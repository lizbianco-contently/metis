Mr. President, President John Kennedy famously said that \n``a rising tide lifts all boats.''\n  The economic policies of the past 8 years may have lifted the \nprivileged few to greater wealth, but they left the rest of our country \nto drown in shallow waters. With this new President, with this new \nbudget, we begin to turn the page. President Obama's 2010 budget honors \nthe middle class. It honors the middle-class values of hard work, \nresponsibility, and opportunity.\n  After years of falling incomes and rising costs across the board for \nhealth care, education, groceries, gas, and retirement, this budget \nfinally begins to bring the American dream back within the grasp of \nmiddle-class families once again. We are cutting taxes for 95 percent \nof working families and ending the irresponsible tax giveaways the Bush \nadministration doled out to the superwealthy. Ninety-five percent of \nAmerican households will get to keep more of each paycheck to save or \nspend on a mortgage payment, a doctor bill, a new car, or maybe a used \ncar. We will expand the child tax credit for all families and increase \ncredits available for larger families, who are more likely to live in \npoverty. We will help families afford the rising cost of college by \nmaking a $2,500 tuition tax credit permanent. We will help to encourage \na new generation of savers by providing automatic enrollment in \nretirement accounts and expanding tax credits to reward the choice to \nsave for retirement. Also, because we understand that every dollar the \nFederal Government invests comes from American taxpayers, we will \nensure that high-level transparency and accountability exist. The \ntaxpayers deserve this, and certainly taxpayer money deserves to be \ntransparent and accounted for.\n  After 8 years of misplaced priorities, corporate greed, and failed \noversight, we are facing a severe economic crisis. And that is an \nunderstatement. Senior\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\ncitizens are delaying their retirement, workers are losing their jobs, \nand families are losing their homes. Although this hour is difficult, \nPresident Obama's budget sets the path toward recovery, and when our \neconomy does recover, we will ensure that this time not just the yachts \nbut all boats are lifted with the coming tide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3324-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Now we hear that those taxpayer \ndollars were going in the front door, supposedly to keep the company \nafloat, and then right back out the back door into the hands of those \ncorporate officials who got us into this mess in the first place.\n  The Treasury Department was supposed to be minding the store. They \nhad the authority to disburse the funds and to provide oversight. It \nwas Treasury's responsibility to watch how these funds were being used. \nObviously, they fell asleep on the job. The Treasury Department was \ncompletely asleep on the job. They need to wake up.

Mr. President, the American people are starting to get \nan idea about the administration's budget. They understand that it \ntaxes too much, it spends too much, and it borrows too much, especially \nin the middle of an economic crisis.\n  On taxes, the budget includes the largest tax hike in history, \ndiverts billions of dollars from charities here at home at a time when \nAmericans are looking to those charities even more than they would be \nin normal times, and it raises taxes on small businesses.\n  Small businesses account for nearly three-fourths of all new private \nsector jobs here in our country. The budget's tax on small businesses \nwould cause many of them to see their taxes go up significantly. This \ntax hits the general contractor down the street, the family restaurant, \nthe startup technology firm, and many other businesses people deal with \nor work at all across our country every single day. These businesses \nare the engines of our economy. They are struggling, and they will \nstruggle even more once these tax hikes go into effect. Small \nbusinesses with more than 20 workers, which account for two-thirds--\ntwo-thirds--of the small business workforce, get hit particularly hard. \nThe President's budget includes a tax increase on more than half of \nthose businesses. These businesses are run by men and women who make \ndecisions based on considerations such as how much they are taxed, and \nif they have less money coming in as a result of higher taxes, they cut \njobs, put off buying new equipment, and they take fewer risks, the \nkinds of risks that have always made our economy so vibrant and so \ninnovative. These risks will be squeezed out as a result of these \nhigher taxes.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are losing their jobs every month. \nMany of these jobs are with small businesses. Higher taxes will only \nforce these businesses to shed even more jobs. I understand the \nadministration's desire to make good on its promises, but taxes on job \ncreators in a recession is not the right approach. With the highest \nunemployment rate in 25 years, most people don't see the sense of \nraising taxes on small businesses, and they are absolutely right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3324-4", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I don't think my State of Oklahoma is any \ndifferent from any other State when you go home and you find out that \npeople are looking at these monstrous expenditures never even dreamed \nof before in the history of this country. They talk about the auto \nbailout, $17 billion; the housing bailout--I think probably the worst \none was the first one, the bank bailout that gave the authority to \nunelected bureaucrats to do what they are doing today. We have the \neconomic bailout, the stimulus package. I am here today to say that as \nbad as all of this is, if you look at the one that is in the budget--\nthe climate bailout--it is far worse because at least these are one-\nshot deals, and that would be a permanent tax every year. Over the next \nfew weeks, we will be talking about it.\n  I spent nearly 10 years on this issue in the capacity of the ranking \nmember and the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nTo tell the truth, for a long time I was a one-man truth squad, and now \nmore and more people realize that the science that was supposed to be \nthere really is not there. But that is not the important thing. As I \nsaid in the debate against the Boxer bill a year ago, let's go ahead \nand concede the science, even though it is not there, so that it \ndoesn't take away from the economic arguments.\n  So, in my view, I think the President did a good thing, including an \nestimate in his budget as to how much this is going to cost. Now, his \nestimate was understated, I understand that, but it allows us to have \nan honest debate about the cost of a program of this magnitude to the \nAmerican people, not to mention the enormous redistribution of wealth \nfor pet projects and programs under the umbrella of clean energy. In \nfact, according to a new report by the Center for Public Integrity, the \nnumber of lobbyists seeking to influence Federal policy on climate \nchange--that is what we are talking about here--has grown more than 300 \npercent in 5 years. This represents more than four lobbyists for every \nMember of Congress, with a slew of new interests from Main Street to \nWall Street, clamoring for new taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n  I don't think anyone questions that in the Senate. Our Halls are \ninundated with people who want in on this deal. The administration's \ndecision to include cap and trade, and the revenues it generates in the \nbudget, forces my colleagues in the Senate to quit hiding from this \nissue. They are going to have to talk about it. They can no longer \nprevent a discussion of what a program of this magnitude is.\n  The public is finally beginning to pay attention. To put it simply, \nthey are realizing cap and trade is a regressive energy tax that hits \nthe Midwest and the South the hardest, and it hits the poor \ndisproportionately. I don't think anyone now is questioning that \nbecause everyone has been talking about it.\n  While a number of lobbyists and the companies are lining up inside \nthe beltway, Washington businesses and the consumers are coming to \nrealize that cap and trade is designed to deliver\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\nmoney and power to the Government, and there is nothing in it for the \ntaxpayers or consumers or even for the climate.\n  Let me further explain at this time that with the recession and \neconomic pain, the administration and the proponents of mandatory \nglobal warming controls now need to be honest with the American people. \nThe purpose of these programs is to ration fossil energy by making it \nmore expensive and less appealing to public consumption. It is so \nregressive in nature. All you have to do is calculate it in any State, \nincluding Colorado and Oklahoma. The poor people spend a larger \npercentage of their money on heating their homes and driving their \nvehicles--using energy.\n  If you need proof, the President's own OMB Director, Peter Orszag, is \non record making the statement:\n\n       The rise in prices for energy and energy-intensive goods \n     and services would impose a larger burden, relative to \n     income, on low-income households than on high-income \n     households.\n\n  That is the OMB Director, who also said:\n\n       Under a cap and trade program, firms would not ultimately \n     bear most of the costs of the allowances, but instead would \n     pass them along to their customers in the form of higher \n     prices for products such as electricity and gasoline. The \n     higher prices caused by the cap would lower real inflation-\n     adjusted wages and real returns on capital, which would be \n     equivalent to raising marginal tax rates on those sources of \n     income.\n\n  No one questions this. Recently, there was an article in the Wall \nStreet Journal--this month. It said:\n\n       Cap and trade, in other words, is a scheme to redistribute \n     income and wealth--but in a very curious way. It takes from \n     the working class and gives to the affluent; takes from \n     Miami, Ohio, and gives to Miami, FL; and takes from an \n     industrial America that is already struggling and gives to \n     rich Silicon Valley and Wall Street ``green tech'' investors \n     who know how to leverage the political class.\n\n  Warren Buffet said:\n\n       That tax is probably going to be pretty regressive. If you \n     put a cost of issuing--putting carbon into the atmosphere--in \n     the utility business, it's going to be borne by customers. \n     And it's a tax hike like anything else.\n\n  Ben Stein had an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal in which he \nsaid:\n\n       Why add another element of uncertainty to energy \n     production, especially if the goal of suppressing carbon-\n     based fuel burning can be accomplished by another means? \n     Energy companies have enough problems as it is--including \n     reduced supplies, political risks, and wildly changing prices \n     of raw materials.\n\n  Jim Cramer of CNBC said this:\n\n       Obama's budget is pushing an aggressive cap and trade \n     program that could raise the price of energy for millions of \n     people.\n\n  Detroit would really suffer. The Detroit News said this:\n\n       President Barack Obama's proposed cap and trade system on \n     greenhouse gas emissions is a giant economic dagger aimed at \n     the nation's heartland--particularly Michigan. It is a \n     multibillion dollar tax hike on everything that Michigan \n     does, including making things, driving cars and burning coal.\n\n  So we have this awareness that wasn't there until this appeared in \nthe President's budget. I have to say this. Back in the very beginning \nof this discussion, I was somewhat of a believer that manmade gas, \nanthropogenic gases, CO2, caused global warming, until we \nfound out what the cost is going to be, and until we looked at the \nscience.\n  In terms of the costs and how it is going to impact the various \nStates such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Michigan, these States \nwill be impacted harder than most others.\n  All of these reports reflect the numbers released in the President's \nproposed budget which estimated that a cap-and-trade program would \ngenerate $646 billion in Federal revenues through 2019. Keep in mind, \nthat is a nice way of saying increase taxes by $646 billion. However, \nwe now know that figure is way low.\n  Nearly 10 years ago--and this was my first discovery--we came this \nclose to ratifying the Kyoto Treaty, which would have mandated all \nthese things they are talking about doing now. That was about 10 years \nago. The Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates did an analysis and \nsaid: What could it cost if we were to sign Kyoto and live by its \nprovisions? They found it would cost 2.4 million U.S. jobs and reduce \nGDP by 3.2 percent or about $300 billion a year in taxes.\n  Well, nearly 10 years later, we have come full circle. According to \nMIT, an analysis of similar legislation as the President's budget \nproposal suggests much higher revenues. We have gone through the Kyoto \nthing and then we had the Lieberman-McCain bill and then the Lieberman-\nWarner bill. Each time we do this, more people come in and do analyses, \nand they come to the same conclusion.\n  Then I looked at one of the more recent ones, the Sanders-Boxer bill, \nand that bill mandates even less aggressive emissions reduction \ntargets, and that is 80 percent. Now they are talking about 83 percent. \nIt would have cost approximately $366 billion a year. So you have a \nconsistent range from $300 billion to $366 billion. That is what \neveryone says it is actually going to cost. It is around $350 billion \nif you round it off.\n  As bad as all this spending is--it is out of control--still, this is \nworse because this is something that is every year. To put it into \nperspective for my colleagues, I point to this chart that shows the \nlargest tax increases in history--we remember these--in the last 50 \nyears. I remember this one, the Clinton-Gore tax increase of 1993. I \nremember talking about this on the Senate floor--the inheritance tax, \nthe marginal tax rates, the income tax, and the capital gains tax. It \nwas a $32 billion tax increase.\n  By contrast, look at what we have--a $300 billion increase or 10 \ntimes greater than the largest tax increase in the last 50 years. You \nare going to hear that some of these revenues will fund tax relief to \nbe returned to the people.\n  For the purposes of this budget proposal, the administration plans to \nspend $15 billion a year to fund clean energy technologies and allocate \n$63 billion to $68 billion per year for the making work pay tax credit \ncampaign promise to give back to people who don't pay taxes. We have \nlearned firsthand that, of course, this stuff wasn't true. We learned \nthat in the consideration of the Warner-Lieberman bill, when they made \nthe statement that they were going to give back a lot of this revenue \nto poor people--it turned out the same thing will be true in the case \nof this budget--that for each $1 a person gets back, they are paying \n$8.40. That is how the math works out.\n  You can try to make people believe they are going to be on the \nreceiving end of this, but when it is over, the cost is $6.7 trillion, \nand the refund--which wasn't guaranteed; it was legislative intent--was \n$802 billion. I think we will have plenty of time to talk about this \nand bring this to the American people.\n  In his budget, the President wants to recycle $525 billion through \nthe making work pay tax credit that goes to many people who don't pay \nincome taxes. The math is not good, as we noted. It doesn't work. My \ncolleagues may argue that at least this money will be going to a good \npurpose, for the cause of fighting global warming, having America lead \nthe way. I think many find it very difficult this would happen. I add \nthat, at times, you have to be logical on these things.\n\n  Referring to this chart, these are the figures actually used in terms \nof how it would have an effect if we passed one of these programs. This \nwas based on the Lieberman-Warner bill. If we had passed it in terms of \nthe emissions of CO2 worldwide, you can see it doesn't have \nan effect. Let's assume that--which is not true but assume--there is \nglobal warming, which is not happening, as we are in a cooling period \nnow; global warming is a result of CO2 coming into the \natmosphere, and that we want to somehow reduce the emissions of \nCO2.\n  The problem we have with this is, if we do it unilaterally, then we \nin the United States are going to be paying these huge taxes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair. While we are paying these huge taxes, \nyou have to keep in mind that China is not doing that, Mexico isn't \ndoing it, and India isn't doing it. They are laughing at us. I wish \nthere was time to finish. We document what China and Mexico are saying. \nThey are going to be the beneficiary. If we were to limit \nCO2 in our country, our jobs would have to go elsewhere. \nThere would not be adequate energy.\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\n  In conclusion, if you look at how fast this is in terms of what \nhappened so far, for those of us--I am not saying anything disparaging \nabout the President; I like the guy--all of these things that are in \nyellow are expenditures that are unprecedented in the history of this \ncountry. Far worse than that would be if we were to pass a cap-and-\ntrade bailout. It would cost some $6.7 trillion, as opposed to the \nlower figures. It is something we cannot afford. It is all pain and no \nclimate gain.\n  Let me briefly go back in history. It is my understanding that the \nother person who was going to use time is delayed, so we have more \ntime. I mentioned a minute ago that when Republicans were in the \nmajority, I was the chairman of the committee called Environment and \nPublic Works. This committee has jurisdiction over most of the energy \nissues we deal with.\n  At that time--way back during the Kyoto consideration, about 10 years \nago--most people didn't believe CO2 or anthropogenic gases \nwere causing global warming. We were in a warming period at that time. \nI have an interesting speech where I take magazines, such as Time, \nwhere back in the middle 1970s they were talking about another ice age \ncoming, and we were all going to die. I wish I had it with me now.\n  About 2 years ago, the same Time magazine had this polar bear \nstanding on the last piece of ice floating around on an icecap, saying \nthat we were all going to die; global warming is coming.\n  A couple things, I believe, are the motivation for this. One is \npublications. Probably their two largest issues were those two. They \nmade people walking by the news stands and seeing that ``we are going \nto die'' think: I better see how much time we have left. It started \nwith the U.N. IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that \ncame out with this idea that somehow greenhouse gases are causing \nglobal warming.\n  When you think about it--and this was in concert with the NAS--they \nhad reports they started giving out, summaries for policyholders. They \nwere not based on science. They talked about how the science is all \nsettled. It was after we realized from the Wharton School how much \nmoney this is going to cost taxpayers. After that, we were in a \nposition where we could start analyzing it, and then the scientists \nstarted coming out of the woodwork. They were no longer intimidated.\n  One of the problems we had was that the scientists who were dependent \nupon various sources of income, either from the Government or from \nvarious organizations, such as the Heinz Foundation and Pew \nFoundation--so long as they said they went along with this scheme that \nCO2 is causing global warming, they were getting grants. \nThis started changing, and they started telling the truth. We now have \naccumulated--later today or tomorrow, I will give a talk showing how \nthe science now has grown, where over 700 scientists who were on the \nother side of this issue are now on the truth side of this issue.\n  So the science needs to be talked about even right now during the \ndebate. It is probably more significant that we talk about the \neconomics and what it is going to cost people.\n  I can remember when Claude Allegre, who is probably the most \nrespected scientist in France, a Socialist, was a person who was very \nstrongly on the Al Gore side of this issue and has recently come over \nand said, in reevaluating, in looking at this issue and in looking at \nwhat has happened to the climate, the science is not there.\n  David Bellamy, a similar scientist in Great Britain, was on the other \nside of this issue. He has now come over.\n  Nir Shaviv from Israel, a top scientist who was always on the other \nside of this issue until about 3 years ago--I don't have the quotes \nhere--came out and said: We are wrong on this issue, the science is not \nthere.\n  By the way, we have a lot of documentation, and I invite my \ncolleagues to go to my Web site, inhofe.senate.gov. We document what \nhas happened in terms of the science.\n  This has been a 10-year journey. I sometimes think of Winston \nChurchill, who said:\n\n       The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, \n     ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is.\n\n  It has taken 10 years for the truth to come out so the American \npeople realize, with all of the scary stuff going on, with Hollywood \nand the elitists pouring money into campaigns--and I am talking about \nmoveon.org, George Soros, Michael Moore, and all the millions of \ndollars that went into campaigns. They have influenced a lot of Members \nof the House and Senate. But the truth is coming out now.\n  As this issue moves forward, I invite all of us to look at all that \nhas happened. It is hard for people to understand this sometimes until \nthey get to my stage in life. I have 20 kids and grandkids. None of \nthis stuff is going to affect me, but it is going to affect future \ngenerations. I look at that and think: How can we allow all this to \ntake place and then pass a tax increase that will do absolutely \nnothing?\n  I repeat, those who are believers who have bought into this thing and \nhave seen the science fiction movie ``An Inconvenient Truth''--even if \nwe do that, what good would it do for us to do it unilaterally in the \nUnited States, take the jobs and put them in countries that have no \nadditional requirements? It would have a net increase of \nCO2. That is being logical even for those who are believers \nthat this is a problem.\n  Yesterday, I pointed out something I thought should be pointed out; \nthat is, the first bailout was the $700 billion bailout. As much as I \nhate to say it, 74 Senators voted for that bailout. What is bad about \nthat is this gave one person, an unelected bureaucrat, the power over \n$700 billion to do with as he wished. It is interesting because that \nwas Hank Paulson, the Secretary of Treasury. Now we find the new \nSecretary of Treasury was in on that deal at the same time. So they put \nthis together. A lot of this stuff was authorized by voting to give \nsomeone $700 billion to do with as he wished. Now we are paying for \nthat, and the costs are very great.\n  I believe, when we look at what is going on right now, there are some \nscary things over and above what I have been talking about. I had \noccasion to make several trips to Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay. That is an \nasset we have had in this country since 1903. In fact, it is one of the \nfew good deals around. We are still paying the same rent now that we \npaid back then. It is $4,000 a year, and we get this great big \nresource. It is a place to put the detainees and to go through the \ntribunals in a courtroom that is over there.\n  One of the scary things I am looking at now is a statement by \nPresident Obama that he wants to do away with the tribunals and he \nwants to close Gitmo or Guantanamo Bay. Here is the problem we have \nwith that. Right now, we have 245 detainees--some call them \nterrorists--who are incarcerated there. Of the 245, 170 of them have no \nplace to go. Their countries will not take them back. They cannot be \nrepatriated anywhere. Of the 170, 110 are really like the Shaikh \nMohammed-type individuals--really bad terrorists. If the President goes \nthrough with his statement that he is going to close Guantanamo Bay, \nthere is no place else to put them, no place in the world.\n  This number is going to increase as we escalate in Afghanistan. It is \ngoing to be going up. Some might say: There are prisons in Afghanistan. \nYes, there are two, but they will only take detainees who are Afghans. \nSo if they are from Djibouti, Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, then they have to \ngo someplace else. The only place we can put them right now is \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  The argument some make is there has been torture going on. That has \nbeen completely refuted. In fact, every publication, every television \nstation, every newspaper that has gone and inspected the premises at \nGuantanamo Bay has come back with a report that it is better than \nanything in our prison system in the United States.\n  One of the suggestions was that we take these people and send them \naround to some 17 areas within the United States. One of those areas \nsuggested is in my State of Oklahoma, which is Fort Sill. I went down \nto Fort Sill the other day to look at the place, trying to picture if \nwe had a bunch of terrorist detainees there.\n  By the way, this will serve throughout the country as 17 magnets to \nbring in terrorist activity. Most people agree that would be the case.\n  If we were to distribute these people around, they would have to be \ncoming into our court system since we could not use tribunals, and the \nrules of evidence are different in a court system.\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nIt could be that some of these people would actually be turned loose.\n  It is very serious. It is something we need to keep. Every \npublication, every newspaper or television station that has gone to \nGuantanamo Bay has come back and said all these things just are not \ntrue, we need to keep Gitmo, and it has changed a lot of minds. I am \nhoping that is one area where we will be able to demonstrate clearly \nthat it is a resource we must have and the world needs very much. We \nwill be working to that cause.\n  Another issue that is not talked about very much in the budget is \nthat almost everything is increased. We look at the size of the budget. \nWe look at the deficits. The deficit for the year we are in right now \ncould approach $2 trillion. It is just unimaginable. People criticized \nGeorge W. Bush during his tenure, but if you take all the deficits for \nthose 8 years, add them up, and divide by eight, it averaged $245 \nbillion a year. Now we are talking about eight times that in 1 year. \nThese amounts are horrible.\n  The other aspect of the budget I don't like is everything is going \nup, an increase in spending, except military. We have a serious problem \nright now that we are facing in the military; that is, during the \ndecade of the nineties, we downgraded our military by about 40 percent. \nI might add that some countries that could be potential adversaries, \nsuch as China, increased tenfold during that time. We reduced. There \nwas this euphoric attitude that the Cold War is over, we don't need a \nmilitary anymore. So in the nineties, they brought down the military in \nterms of our force strength, in terms of our modernization program.\n\n  There were a few heroes back at that time who helped us out. One was \na GEN John Jumper, before he became the Chief of the Air Force. He made \na statement in 1998. He said: Now we are in a position where our best \nstrike fighters, our best strike equipment, the F-15 and F-16, are not \nas good in many ways as what the Russians are making right now in the \nSU series. At that time, it was SU-30s, now SU-35s. We went ahead. That \nhelped us get into the F-22 and the Joint Strike Fighter so we would \nagain regain our superiority.\n  When I talk with people and tell them that when our kids go out in \npotential conflicts, they would be fighting people who have better \nequipment than we do, it is un-American, it is not believable. Right \nnow, the best artillery piece we have is called a Paladin. It is World \nWar II technology. You have to get out and swab the breech after every \nshot. Yet there are five countries, including South Africa, that make a \nbetter one than we have.\n  Because we lifted that awareness, we were able to step into an area \nof what we call Future Combat Systems, FCS, to modernize our ground \nequipment and other equipment they will use. There are 16 elements of \nthe Future Combat Systems. The first is NLOS-C, non-line-of-site \ncannon. This would replace the Paladin, so we will have something that \nis state of the art. But we are not there and will not be there for \nseveral more years.\n  We went through the decade of the nineties downgrading our military, \nand then, of course, when 9/11 came, all of a sudden we were in a war. \nI have to be sympathetic with former President George W. Bush because \nhe inherited a military that had been taken down, and then all of a \nsudden he is confronted with one or two wars or fronts he had to fight. \nSo it has been very difficult.\n  It is interesting to me that many of the liberal Members of the \nSenate during the years we were trying to enhance our military spending \nare the ones who objected to that and then complained about the \noverworking of our Guard and Reserve. They actually are responsible for \nthat. Yes, we are now trying to do something about it. But in this \nbudget, we increase spending everywhere except the military. That is an \narea where we are going to have to be doing something.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I encourage us to look at the overall budget, not just \nthe tax increases but also how it affects other programs, such as our \nmilitary.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3327-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3327-S3328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I left a wonderful meeting with a group \nof organizations--many of our national faith leaders--from around the \ncountry and those who have been deeply involved in the issues around \nthe Federal budget and expenditures and what our priorities should be \nas a country. There was a new optimism in the room about the direction \nof the country because for the first time in a long time--certainly \nsince 2001--we have actually been talking about how does a budget \nreflect what is right for the majority of the American people; how do \nwe address what is happening for children and families; middle-class \nworkers who have lost their jobs and are trying just to put food on the \ntable; people who have been struggling and not doing well even before \nthe recession; the poor who find themselves hit over and over again and \nneed to know there is a ladder out of poverty and into the middle \nclass.\n  It was wonderful to see the commitment in that room and to see the \nfact that people around the country are coming together to focus on how \nwe strengthen our country in very real ways. Not what has happened in \nthe last 8 years--where it has been all about tax policies to help the \nprivileged few, spending to help the privileged few--but how do we have \na country where everybody has a chance to achieve the American dream \nfor themselves and their families.\n  We talked about the fact that the budget we will be taking up next \nweek, the week after, and every year is a moral document. It is about \nwho we are as Americans: What do we believe in? What do we care about? \nI am very proud President Obama has given us a moral document that \nreflects the values and the priorities of the American people; the fact \nthat he has focused on education, health care, getting us off our \ndependence on foreign oil so we can bring down the costs of energy and \ncreate jobs through the new green economy, and that we are turning the \ncorner as we look at a tax policy to focus on the middle class and to \nfocus on families who are working hard every day or trying to find a \njob. So these were all positive things.\n  But I also thought in that meeting this morning--when we were talking \nabout the budget as a moral document--how there has been created in \nthis country a culture of greed. Greed has been rewarded for too long \nat the expense of the majority of Americans--certainly at the expense \nof the people in my great State of Michigan. Nowhere is that more \nepitomized than looking at recent outrages, whether it be Bernie Madoff \nand what happened with all the people who were victimized and who lost \ntheir savings and all the people who have been impacted--wiped out--by \na Ponzi scheme and the greed of one individual or a few individuals or \nturning closer to home and what we have been talking about for the last \ncouple days, which is the outrageous bonuses--$165 million in bonuses--\nto a group of people at AIG who actually created the situation we are \nin today--not only for this country but which has created a ripple \neffect that has caused a global credit crisis. We look at the morality \nof that--the morality of $165 million in bonuses.\n  I am also outraged at the fact that we have put so much money into \nthis company. Taxpayers now own 80 percent of it. Yet we have not seen \nthe oversight, the accountability one would expect, whether it is the \nbonuses or anything else for that matter. Now, we all know President \nObama inherited an incredible mess and is working with all of us to dig \nour way out, but we have to have accountability with AIG and every \nother entity that has stepped up to ask for or received taxpayer \ndollars. Bonuses? They are absolutely an outrage, especially for people \nwho didn't deserve a bonus for their performance. In fact, many left, \nand should leave, because of what has been done. They should be fired, \nif they\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\nhaven't already left--the people who got us where we are today.\n  I am amazed when I look at the fact that we are providing such a \ndifferent standard between those on Wall Street, who got us into this \nmess--AIG and others receiving taxpayer money--and what I see happening \nwith my own auto industry in Michigan, employing directly or indirectly \n3 million people. Where is the equivalent of the auto task force? I can \ntell you that every single line in every single budget, every single \nmanagement plan, every part of the auto companies that has received a \nsmall fraction of what AIG has received has been gone through and is \ncontinuing to receive great scrutiny. I support that. They certainly \nare willing to do that. But where is the scrutiny on AIG? Where is the \nscrutiny on the other companies that have taken huge amounts of money \nfrom taxpayers?\n  I find it incredible when they say they can't renegotiate contracts. \nSomebody should tell that to the United Auto Workers, who are \nrenegotiating contracts right now, who have opened their contracts over \nand over again, with workers taking more and more cuts, paying more and \nmore in health care. Yet we hear from this company and these executives \nwith AIG that they have contractual agreements and they can't reopen \ncontracts? I don't think there is anybody in my State who believes that \nis not possible, given what our families have gone through over and \nover again, with people who thought they had jobs, thought they had \ncontracts but suddenly do not.\n  Why is it the people who got us into this mess--with their \ncomplicated leveraging, the tools they put together that created this \nhouse of cards that has fallen and affected not only everyone in \nAmerica but around the world--can't be asked to step up and reopen \ncontracts? I don't understand that at all.\n  We are going to do everything we can in order to get that money back \nfor the American taxpayers. We have seen bills introduced, and I am \nproud to be cosponsoring one of those bills through the Finance \nCommittee. Our leader, Senator Reid, has asked us to move as quickly as \npossible, and I know the Speaker of the House has as well, as has the \nPresident of the United States, and we are going to do everything we \ncan to be able to recoup those dollars.\n  When we talk about what is moral in this country, whether it is the \nbudget, whether it is bonuses of millions of dollars for people who \nhave hurt so many, caused so much damage, created such a crisis around \nthe world or whether it is looking at what is happening to families \nevery day, this is a moral issue. This is a question of right and \nwrong. It is a question of our priorities. The budget the President has \nproposed focuses us back on what is important for this country, and it \nis critical we get that budget passed. We have middle-class families \nacross the country right now, and really all families, who never \nthought they would have to worry about trying to decide whether to buy \ngroceries or to buy medicine; worrying about what happens tomorrow--\nwill there be food tomorrow. People are going to food banks who never \nthought they would have to go to a food bank. People who used to donate \nto the food bank are now going to the food bank, and others who have \nbeen relying on the food banks for a long time find it is getting \ntougher and tougher and tougher.\n  More than 11 percent--in fact, close to 12 percent--of the people in \nmy State do not have jobs right now. They are unemployed. That is only \nthe official number. That doesn't count those who have been long-term \nunemployed, unable to find work and are no longer counted. It also \ndoesn't count the number of people who are working one, two, and three \npart-time jobs trying to hold it together. That is a moral issue.\n  The reason we tackled this recovery plan and so quickly brought it \nforward--to create jobs that we create in America, jobs in a green \neconomy, focusing on job training and education and health care for \npeople who have not been able to find a job so they will be able to \nkeep health care going for their families--is because we understand \nwhat this is all about in terms of our values and priorities. Millions \nof families are in danger of losing their homes or have already lost \ntheir homes which is why we are focused on doing everything we can to \nhelp families, neighborhoods, and communities address the housing \ncrisis. We know that education is the key to the future for all of us, \nfor our children and our grandchildren. Keeping education a priority \nand investing in the future, in education and access to college, is a \ncritical part of our budget because it is a critical part of the \nAmerican dream.\n\n  Yes, I am outraged about AIG giving away millions in bonuses--\nabsolutely. I am outraged about other injustices going on, about the \nfocus over the last 8 years on those who are doing well and policies \nthat made sure they were doing even better, oftentimes at the expense \nof middle-class Americans, at the expense of the majority of Americans \nin this country. I am outraged that billions of dollars are going to \ncompanies that do not have accountability attached to them. I know the \npeople in Michigan are as well. But I also believe it is critical that \nwe not only get the money back from these bonuses and provide the \naccountability but we redirect back to the priorities of the American \npeople. That is what this budget is all about.\n  We need jobs. We need jobs in this country because, if people have \nmoney in their pockets and they can pay their bills and keep that \nmortgage and invest in their families' education, this country is going \nto turn around.\n  The budget the President has proposed, the budget the people with \nwhom I met this morning are so encouraged about, is, in fact, a moral \ndocument. It changes the way this country has been operating--from a \nculture of greed, where somehow bonuses for AIG made sense to somebody \nsomewhere in AIG, to a situation where we are focused again on what is \nimportant for the majority of the American people, what will allow us \nto be strong as a country: putting people back to work; making sure we \nhave access to health care, which is not only the moral thing to do but \nbrings down costs; education and investing in a new energy economy that \nis not dependent on anybody else but American ingenuity. That is what \nis in this budget, and it is a budget that reflects the priorities and \nthe values of the American people. We need to come together in a \nbipartisan way to pass this as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Ronald Kirk, of Texas, \nto be U.S. Trade Representative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 90 \nminutes of debate on the nomination, with the majority controlling 30 \nminutes and the Republicans controlling 60 minutes.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as you noted, we will consider the \nnomination of Mr. Ron Kirk as the next U.S. Trade Representative.\n  With some reluctance, I will vote to confirm Mr. Kirk's nomination. I \nthink it is pretty obvious Mr. Kirk has been less than forthcoming on a \nnumber of trade issues that affect this country, and some of the \npositions he has articulated are very dangerous for this Nation's \nfuture. I have come to this floor on numerous occasions and argued \nagainst the provisions that have\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nbeen signed into law in omnibus bills recently, one of them ``Buy \nAmerican,'' the other, of course, the latest being the barring of \nMexican trucks into the United States of America.\n  The signal that sends to the world is that the United States is on a \npath of protectionism. That shows at least a majority of Members of \nthis body have ignored the lessons of history. That lesson, obviously, \nwe learned in the Great Depression, when isolationism and protectionism \nturned our economy from a deep recession to the worst depression of \nmodern times. That is what protectionism and isolationism does.\n  So we now have a predictable result of killing the program which \nwould allow, in keeping with the North American Free Trade Agreement, a \nsolemn treaty signed by then-President Clinton, that Mexican trucks \nwould be allowed into the United States.\n  Before I go much further, though, I wished to comment on the issue \nthat is consuming the American people and the Congress today; that is, \nthe AIG bonuses paid to executives. The simple lesson is, if we had not \nbailed out AIG, we would not be worried about the bonuses. I spoke out \nagainst the bailout of AIG at the time when it was first proposed when \nAIG was in trouble.\n  I, along with every other American, share anger and obvious \ndispleasure that these bonuses were given to executives who obviously \ndid not deserve them. But we should not have bailed out AIG. We should \nhave let them fail and reorganize.\n  I would also like to point out that another area of the bailout that \nAmericans should be equally disturbed about is the $20 billion that \nwent to foreign banks. American taxpayers are paying now $20 billion to \nbail out foreign banks. Have we not enough trouble here at home and \nenough areas of the country that need Government assistance than to \nsend $20 billion to foreign banks?\n  There is an obvious need for increased transparency, increased \noversight, and far more careful stewardship of American tax dollars. \nThe numbers we are talking about are, indeed, staggering. I would point \nout, again, we are committing generational theft by these kinds of \nexpenditures of American taxpayers' dollars and mortgaging our children \nand grandchildren's future.\n  The direction of our trade policy has hardly been more important in \nrecent years, given the enormous economic challenges we are facing \ntoday, with unemployment rising, consumer confidence dropping, and our \ngrowth rate stagnating, at best.\n  American exports. American exports have been one of the few bright \nspots in a terrible economic situation. Until last quarter, the export \nsector of our economy grew at a faster rate than other sectors during \nthe past several years. In the face of this fact, and mindful of \nhistory lessons, Congress and the administration should be working to \nbreak down remaining barriers to trade.\n  However, we are doing the opposite. Since the beginning of this year, \nCongress and the administration have taken several steps designed to \nchoke off access to the U.S. market which invites retaliation from our \nforeign trading partners.\n  American business and workers will suffer as the result of these ill-\nconsidered moves. Last month, as I mentioned, Congress adopted and the \nPresident signed into law--again, one of the consequences of these \nomnibus bills that are thousands of pages, that nobody knows what is \nincluded, they are designed to be a ``stimulus'' or ``spending bill,'' \nand we stuff policy provisions in them, which people may not know about \nfor weeks or even months.\n  We find out that these are egregious in the case of ``Buy American'' \nand in the case of the American trucks. Both of them send a signal to \nthe world that America is going down the path of protectionism.\n  The results, as far as Mexico is concerned, are unfortunate, very \nunfortunate, but predictable. The reaction of our friends and allies \nthroughout the world to the ``Buy American'' provisions is predictable. \nThey are angry and they are upset. I cannot say I blame them.\n  Now, the ``Buy American'' provision required funds appropriated in \nthat bill--this is a policy change, remember, adopted in a ``stimulus \npackage,'' that we purchase only American-made steel, iron, and \nmanufactured goods.\n  As we debated this provision, many of our closest partners expressed \ngreat concerns about the implications of this course of action. The \nCanadian Ambassador to the United States wrote:\n\n       If Buy America becomes part of the stimulus legislation, \n     the United States will lose the moral authority to pressure \n     others not to introduce protectionist policies. A rush of \n     protectionist actions could create a downward spiral like the \n     world experienced in the 1930's.\n\n  When then-Candidate Obama said he would ``unilaterally renegotiate'' \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadian response was: \nYes, and if you do that, then we will sell our oil to China. Then, \nlater, Candidate Obama changed his position to saying: Well, that \nwasn't exactly what he meant. Then, President Obama said: Now we are in \nfavor of free trade. But yet President Obama did not veto either one of \nthese bills, which sends a signal to the world that the United States \nhas embarked on a protectionist path. He should have vetoed those \nbills, especially the one on Mexican trucks.\n  A European Commission spokesman noted:\n\n       We are particularly concerned about the signal that these \n     measures could send to the world at a time when all countries \n     are facing difficulty. Where America leads, many others tend \n     to follow.\n\n  Others lent their own voices to those cautioning against a terribly \nill-timed protectionist act.\n  While some Senators may have taken comfort in last-minute language \nadded to require that implementation of the ``Buy American'' provisions \nbe consistent with our international obligations, I worry very much \nabout the effect this and other steps will have on the global trading \nsystem. For decades the United States has led global efforts toward \nfree and open trade and investment. We abandon this leadership at our \nperil.\n  The ``Buy American'' provision was not the only step in the \nprotectionist direction. There have been other protectionist measures, \nand we are already seeing the fallout from such unwise decisions. Mr. \nKirk agreed during his confirmation hearing:\n\n       [I]f the United States raises barriers in our own market, \n     other countries are more likely to raise barriers against our \n     products.\n\n  We have that evidence already. On Monday, the Mexican Government \nannounced it will increase tariffs on 90 American agricultural and \nmanufactured goods in direct retaliation for our recent decision to ban \nMexican trucks from traveling beyond commercial zones. Although the \nMexican Government is yet to specify the 90 different goods, it has \nannounced that its decision would affect $2.4 billion worth of exports \nfrom 40 States. The Mexican Ambassador had an article in the Wall \nStreet Journal this morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, along with \nan editorial from this morning from the Arizona Republic.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 18, 2009]\n\n                     Congress Doesn't Respect Nafta\n\n       Nobody can argue that Mexico hasn't worked tirelessly for \n     more than a decade to avoid a dispute with the United States \n     over Mexican long-haul trucks traveling through this country. \n     But free and fair trade hit another red light this past week.\n       Back in 1995, the U.S. unilaterally blocked the \n     implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement's \n     cross-border trucking provisions, just as they were about to \n     enter into force. In response, and after three years of \n     constant engagement, Mexico had no alternative but to request \n     the establishment of an arbitration panel as allowed under \n     Nafta. A five-member panel, chaired by a Briton and including \n     two U.S. citizens, ruled unanimously in February 2001 that \n     Washington had violated the trucking provisions contained in \n     Nafta, authorizing Mexico to adopt retaliatory measures. Yet \n     once again, Mexico exercised restraint and sought a \n     resolution of this issue through further dialogue.\n       Unfortunately, Mexico's forbearance only seemed to make \n     matters worse. In 2002, Congress introduced 22 additional \n     safety requirements that Mexican trucks would have to meet, a \n     measure that was clearly discriminatory as these requirements \n     were not applied to U.S. and Canadian carriers operating in \n     the U.S. Mexico worked assiduously with the U.S. \n     administration to find a solution to this problem.\n       Finally, in 2007 an agreement was reached that included the \n     implementation of a demonstration program in which up to 100 \n     carriers from each nation would be allowed to participate. \n     This program was designed precisely to address the concerns \n     voiced by\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\n     those opposed to cross-border trucking. The demonstration \n     program, launched in September 2007, was an unmitigated \n     success. During the 18 months that the program was in \n     operation, 26 carriers from Mexico (with 103 trucks) and 10 \n     from the U.S. (with 61 trucks) crossed the border over 45,000 \n     times without any significant incident or accident. Moreover, \n     according to reports of both the Department of \n     Transportation's inspector general and an independent \n     evaluation panel, Mexico's carriers participating in the \n     program have a safety record far better than that of all \n     other carriers operating in the U.S.\n       The demonstration program also underscored the benefits of \n     free and fair cross-border trade, given the lower costs that \n     would result from ending the requirement that short-haul \n     trucks be used to transfer cargo at the border from the long-\n     haul trucks of one country to those of the other. Thus, for \n     example, one participating carrier saved over $600,000 a year \n     by cutting trip times and fuel costs, while another saved an \n     estimated $188,000 in transfer fees in the nine months that \n     it participated in the demonstration program.\n       These savings benefit consumers and enhance North American \n     competitiveness. Moreover, a streamlined system would also \n     cut pollution, since fewer and newer Mexican long-haul trucks \n     would replace smaller and older trucks that now huff and puff \n     their way to the border. Unfortunately, notwithstanding these \n     benefits to businesses and workers, and to the safety of our \n     roads and the health of our environment, a small but vocal \n     group has consistently blocked progress on this issue. It has \n     now finally managed to stop the demonstration program by \n     defunding it through the 2009 omnibus spending bill.\n       In confronting this situation, the government of Mexico--\n     after over a decade of dialogue and engagement in which it \n     has asked for nothing more than U.S. compliance with its \n     international commitments and with the rules of the game that \n     provide for a level playing field--has had no alternative but \n     to respond by raising tariffs on 90 U.S. products that \n     account for approximately $2.4 billion in trade.\n       Today, opponents within Congress continue to allege \n     concerns related to the safety of America's roads--yet they \n     cancelled the very program designed to address such concerns, \n     and which had been producing positive results. After all, the \n     cross-border trucking program that was defunded had been \n     demonstrating not only compliance by Mexico's long-haul \n     trucks with U.S. regulations, but a superb and unmatched \n     record of safety. It is precisely because of our firm belief \n     in the importance of cross-border services that the \n     government of Mexico will continue, as a sign of good-faith \n     and notwithstanding the countermeasures announced early this \n     week, to allow U.S. carriers to provide trucking services \n     into Mexico under the now-defunct demonstration program \n     guidelines and criteria.\n       Mexico is the U.S.'s second-largest buyer of exports. It \n     remains a steadfast supporter of free and fair trade, and \n     will continue to work actively and responsibly during the \n     coming weeks and months with Congress and the administration \n     to find a solution that will allow safe Mexican trucks onto \n     U.S. roads under Nafta rules.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Mar. 18, 2009]\n\n              U.S. in the Wrong by Blocking Mexican Trucks\n\n       America is picking a food fight with Mexico over trade. \n     Congress set it off by canceling a pilot program that allowed \n     Mexican trucks to operate on U.S. highways--a blatant \n     violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n       Mexico responded Monday by announcing that it will jack up \n     tariffs on 90 U.S. agricultural and manufactured products. \n     About $2.4 billion worth of exports from 40 states will be \n     affected.\n       Under NAFTA, we agreed to give Mexican trucks access \n     beginning in 1995, increasing efficiency and lowering costs \n     for consumers.\n       But U.S. trucking interests and unions have been trying to \n     block the move for years with scare stories about safety. \n     Actually, thousands of Mexican trucks, which were \n     grandfathered in, have operated safely here for years. The \n     pilot program set high standards for vehicles and drivers. \n     The real issue isn't safety but competition and profits.\n       President Barack Obama, who was cool to NAFTA during the \n     campaign, must step up to ensure the United States finally \n     follows its treaty obligations. The White House says he is \n     working on a new version of the pilot program that responds \n     to congressional concerns. It needs to happen quickly.\n       Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is sounding a timely warning \n     that this dispute could lead to more protectionist measures.\n       Let the trucks roll.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Mexican Ambassador says, in part of his article:\n\n       The U.S. Congress, which has now killed a modest and highly \n     successful U.S.-Mexico trucking demonstration program, has \n     sadly left my government no choice but to impose \n     countermeasures after years of restraint and goodwill.\n       Then and now, this was never about the safety of American \n     roads or drivers; it was and has been about protectionism, \n     pure and simple.\n\n  He is right. It is also a testimony to the influence of the Teamsters \nUnion. Elections have consequences.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       It is worth noting that this takes place shortly after \n     Mexico announced it would unilaterally reduce its industrial \n     tariffs from an average of 10.4% in 2008 to 4.3% by 2013, and \n     that it has underscored its commitment, along with its other \n     G-20 partners, to push back on protectionist pressures.\n\n  What has been particularly frustrating in this long and uphill battle \nhas been the fact that the Congress continues to move the goalposts.\n  Importantly, he concludes:\n\n       Mexico is the U.S.'s second largest buyer of exports. It \n     remains a steadfast supporter of free and fair trade, and \n     will continue to work actively and responsibly during the \n     coming weeks and months with Congress and the administration \n     to find a solution that will allow safe Mexican trucks onto \n     U.S. roads under Nafta rules.\n\n  Again, NAFTA was signed by President Clinton 14 years ago. Part of \nthat agreement was that Mexican trucks would be allowed into the United \nStates. Study after study has concluded that Mexican trucks operate as \nsafely as U.S. trucks do.\n  Today, on goods America buys coming from Mexico, the truck, after \ncrossing the border, if it is Mexican, has to stop. The goods are \noffloaded onto another truck, moved to another truck that is American-\nowned and loaded onboard that truck. Meanwhile, there are \nCO2 emissions and the cost and expenses of the delay are \npassed on to the American consumer.\n  I repeat, Mexico is the third largest trading partner of the United \nStates, behind Canada and China, and the United States ranks first \namong Mexico's trading partners. United States trade with Mexico \ntotaled $368 billion in 2008. We have close and growing ties between \nour two Governments. Right now there is an existential threat to our \nsouthern neighbor from drug cartels. The violence on the border is at \nunprecedented levels. Acts of cruelty and murder are taking place \nbeyond belief. People are being beheaded. There is the assassination of \npolice chiefs and others. The corruption is very high. Why should we \ncare? One reason we should care is because of violence spilling over \nfrom the Mexican border into ours.\n  The other reason is, there is between, according to estimates, $10 \nand $13 billion worth of revenue in receipts from the sale of drugs in \nthe United States. It is the United States that is creating the market \nthat is creating the drug cartels and violence on the border that has \nensued. The Mexican Government is trying--maybe for the first time in \nas serious a way as they are now--to bring under control these cartels. \nThe corruption reaches to the highest level. The violence is incredibly \nhigh. We need to do what we can to help the Mexican Government bring \nthese cartels under control and try to eradicate them because they do \npose an existential threat. We cannot afford to have a government that \nis full of corruption and controlled by drug cartels on our southern \nborder, not to mention the impact it has on illegal immigration.\n  What did we do? We took steps in violation of our obligations under \nthe North America Free Trade Agreement that will have precisely the \nopposite effect and have prompted retaliation that will only serve to \nharm American workers, consumers, and our Nation's relationship with \nMexico.\n  During these difficult economic times for many American businesses, \nthe ability to sell products on the world market is essential to our \neconomic recovery. The Financial Times wrote in an editorial published \nyesterday:\n\n       The retaliatory duties are a legitimate response to a U.S. \n     violation of a trade deal . . . but this does not bode well \n     for bilateral relations just under two months into the Obama \n     administration.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       We hope cooler heads prevail and prevent any deterioration \n     of the bilateral relationship. Both nations have too much at \n     stake--and trade as well as security issues.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  The Arizona Republic published an editorial that reads:\n\n       With the economy in tatters, it's no time to mince words: \n     The United States is in the wrong. Under NAFTA, we agreed to \n     give Mexican trucks access beginning in 1995, increasing \n     efficiency and lowering costs for consumers.\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       Around the world, countries are considering trade barriers \n     that could have disastrous consequences for the world \n     economy.\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\n     The United States must put the brakes on trade restrictions, \n     not fuel them.\n\n  I am aware there is a sizable block of public opinion that believes \nwe should close our borders to everybody and everything, that somehow \nMexican trucks are unacceptable, that legal immigration is something we \nought to do away with. I understand all those arguments. But I also \nurge those who say that trade with Mexico is not important to \nunderstand the facts: They are our third largest trading partner; we \nhave a trade surplus; it is important to have our relationship good as \nwe help them battle the drug cartels; and, most importantly, \nprotectionism and high tariffs led to the Great Depression.\n  Congress passed NAFTA in 1993 and President Clinton signed it into \nlaw in 1994, which mandated the opening of our southern border to \nMexican trucking operations to allow the free flow of goods and \nservices between the two countries. Last year, language was slipped \ninto a fiscal year 2008 spending bill that sought to strip funding for \na pilot program with Mexico that would allow a limited number of \nMexican trucks to enter the United States. Now the administration says \nit will try to create ``a new trucking project that will meet the \nlegitimate concerns'' of Congress. I don't understand how the \nadministration can create a new trucking project to comply with NAFTA, \nwhen Congress explicitly barred any money from being spent toward such \nactivities. The President should not seek to create a new project to \ncircumvent the terms of the legislative language. Rather, he should \nhave vetoed it in the first place.\n  The administration's eliminating the Mexican cross-border trucking \nprogram will harm millions of American consumers who could benefit from \nlower prices on many goods manufactured in Mexico and then distributed \nin the United States.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, refusing entry \ninto our country of Mexican trucks carrying Mexican-made goods adds \n$400 million to the price of Mexican imports which is, of course, \npassed on to the American consumer. Mr. Kirk has made some statements \nbroadly supportive of international trade, but he has also made \ncomments suggesting protectionism might not be so bad after all. During \nhis confirmation hearing, Mr. Kirk stated:\n\n       Not all Americans are winning from [trade] and our trading \n     partners are not always playing by the rules.\n\n  He suggested the administration may abandon the free-trade agreement \nwe have concluded with South Korea, one projected to increase the \nUnited States GDP by $10 to $12 billion. He said the pact ``simply \nisn't fair.'' He emphasized he does not have ``deal fever'' when it \ncomes to trade agreements. Again, it is up in the air as to what the \nfate of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement would be, sending a clear \nsignal that we would be punishing the Colombian Government for their \nassistance in trying to combat drug cartels.\n  Our trading partners, including Canada and Mexico, don't seem \ninterested in strengthening agreements that have served them and us \nwell for years. Rather, they would like to see the United States \nfulfill its own trade obligations and look for further ways to open \nmarkets to the free flow of commerce. The free flow of commerce has \nbeen a founding principle of U.S. economic policy for many decades and \na key factor in our rise to prosperity and greatness. It is for this \nreason I hope Mr. Kirk and his colleagues in the administration will \nreconsider their stance and help build, not damage, the consensus \nbehind free trade. After all, we have seen a terribly destructive \npattern unfold before.\n  In 1930, as the United States and the world were entering what would \nbe known in history as the Great Depression, two men, Mr. Smoot and Mr. \nHawley, led the effort to enact protectionist legislation in the face \nof economic crisis. Their bill, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, raised \nduties on thousands of imported goods in a futile attempt to keep jobs \nat home. In the face of this legislation, 1,028 economists issued a \nstatement to President Herbert Hoover, wherein they wrote:\n\n       America is now facing the problem of unemployment.\n       The proponents of higher tariffs would claim that an \n     increase in rates will give work to the idle. This is not \n     true. We cannot increase employment by restricting trade.\n\n  Mr. Smoot, Mr. Hawley, and their colleagues paid no attention to this \nwise admonishment, and the Congress went ahead with protectionist \nlegislation. In doing so, they sparked an international trade war as \ncountries around the world retaliated, raising their own duties and \nrestricting trade, and they helped turn a severe recession into the \ngreatest depression in modern history.\n  I do not intend to oppose the President's nominee for U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. I remain very concerned about the direction of our \ntrade policies at a time of economic peril. I urge my colleagues and \nthe administration to heed the lessons of economics and heed the \nlessons of history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nconfirmation of the nomination of Ron Kirk occur at 2 p.m. today, with \nthe remaining provisions of the previous order governing the \nconsideration of this nomination in effect; that upon resuming \nlegislative session, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the \nfollowing amendments in the order listed; further, with respect to H.R. \n146 and the provisions of the order governing vote sequences remaining \nin effect: Coburn amendment No. 680, Coburn amendment No. 679, Coburn \namendment No. 675.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 8 minutes as in morning business and that \nthe time not count against debate time on the Kirk nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Ending Stealth Bonuses\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss taxpayer-\nfunded bonuses. These bonuses are paid every year, often without any \npublic discussion or a recorded vote by those with the authority to \napprove or stop them. The people giving themselves these bonuses have \nmade sure they get them regardless of their performance.\n  I am referring to the annual bonuses given to Members of Congress.\n  There is some good news to report on this issue today. Thanks to the \nleadership of majority leader Harry Reid, we took an important step \nyesterday. Senator Reid moved legislation through the Senate that will \nend these annual stealth bonuses. I have introduced legislation similar \nto Senator Reid's bill for the past six Congresses, and I am delighted, \nbecause of Senator Reid's leadership, this proposal has finally passed \nthe Senate.\n  Congress has the power to raise its own pay. While some corporate \nexecutives apparently have this power as well, it is something most of \nour constituents cannot do. Because this is such a singular power, I \nthink Congress ought to exercise it openly and subject to regular \nprocedures, including debate, amendment, and, of course, a vote on the \nrecord.\n  But current law allows Congress to avoid that public debate and vote. \nAll that is necessary for Congress to get a pay raise is that they do \nnothing, that nothing be done to stop it. The annual bonus takes effect \nunless Congress acts.\n  As I noted in a statement yesterday, that stealth bonus mechanism \nbegan with a change Congress enacted in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. \nIn section 704 of that act, Members of Congress voted to make \nthemselves entitled--entitled--to an annual raise equal to half a \npercentage point less than the employment cost index, which is one \nmeasure of inflation.\n  On occasion, Congress has actually voted to deny itself a bonus, and \nthe traditional vehicle for the pay raise vote is the Treasury \nappropriations bill. But that vehicle is not always made available to \nthose who want a public debate and vote on the matter. As I have noted \nin the past, getting a vote on the annual congressional pay raise is a \nhaphazard affair, at best, and it should not be that way. The burden \nshould not be on those who seek a public debate and a recorded vote on \nthe Member pay raise. On the contrary,\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\nCongress should have to act if it decides to award itself a hike in \npay. This process of congressional bonuses without accountability must \nend.\n  I joined with the junior Senator from Louisiana in offering an \namendment to the Omnibus appropriations bill recently. That amendment \nreceived strong support--support which was all the more remarkable \nbecause many of the amendment's potential supporters felt constrained \nto oppose it in order to keep the underlying legislation free of \namendments. Now, thanks to our majority leader, we have a real chance \nto end this system in fact.\n  This issue is not a new question. It was something our Founders \nconsidered from the beginning of our Nation. In August of 1789, as part \nof the package of 12 amendments advocated by James Madison that \nincluded what has become our Bill of Rights, the House of \nRepresentatives passed an amendment to the Constitution providing that \nCongress could not raise its pay without an intervening election. On \nSeptember 9, 1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September \nof 1789, Congress submitted the amendments to the States.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin State Senate, I was pleased to help add Wisconsin to the \nStates ratifying the amendment. Then its approval by the Michigan \nlegislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed approval by three-\nfourths of the States.\n  So the 27th amendment to the Constitution now states:\n\n       No law, varying the compensation for the services of the \n     senators and representatives, shall take effect, until an \n     election of representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  I honor that limitation. Throughout my 6-year term, I accept only the \nrate of pay Senators receive on the date on which I was sworn in as a \nSenator. I return to the Treasury any cost-of-living adjustments or \nbonuses during my term. I do not take a raise until my bosses, the \npeople of Wisconsin, give me one at the ballot box. That is the spirit \nof the 27th amendment, and, at the very least, the stealth pay raises \npermitted under the current system certainly violate that spirit.\n  This practice must end. I am so delighted to express my thanks to \nMajority Leader Reid. Because of him, we have a real chance of ending \nit.\n  Today I am sending a letter to Speaker Pelosi asking that the other \nbody take up and pass the Reid legislation to end the automatic \ncongressional bonuses. Doing so would assure the American people that \nwe are not only serious about going after the abusive bonuses paid to \nthe executives of firms bailed out with taxpayer dollars, but we are \nalso serious about ending a system that was devised to provide Members \nof Congress with bonuses without any accountability.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might ask, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kirk nomination is before the Senate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to speak on the Kirk nomination.\n  Mr. President, Ralph Waldo Emerson said:\n\n       [T]he most advanced nations are always those who navigate \n     the most.\n\n  Today, the Senate considers the nomination of Mayor Ron Kirk to be \nU.S. Trade Representative. As we consider the nomination, America is \nnavigating a shifting economic landscape. And so are our trading \npartners.\n  As financial systems weaken, protectionist sentiments strengthen. As \nmarkets crumble, import barriers rise. And as jobs disappear, trade \nviolations emerge.\n  Ron Kirk has been asked to navigate U.S. trade policy through these \ndifficult waters. To ensure that America keeps moving forward, he must \nnavigate the right course.\n  Many feel our trade policy has veered off course. They argue the \nGovernment has not safeguarded our workers. They argue the Government \nhas not enforced our trade agreements. They argue the Government has \nnot dismantled barriers to our exports.\n  I believe Mayor Kirk will chart the right course. He understands he \nmust steady the tilting ship of public opinion. He will do so by \nrebuilding America's faith in the benefits of international trade. He \nwill remain constantly on the lookout for America's workers. He will \nshine a spotlight on trade violations. He will vigilantly enforce our \ninternational agreements. He will speed our economic recovery by \nopening markets for American exports.\n  Let us chart the right course on international trade. Let us rebuild \nAmerica's faith in our trade policy. Let us confirm Ron Kirk to be the \nU.S. Trade Representative.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the nomination before the Senate is \ncritically important in this time of economic upheaval.\n  We need a U.S. Trade Representative to assert our rights, defend our \ninterests, and negotiate new market opportunities for our exporters.\n  Trade can and should play an important role in our economic recovery. \nPresident Obama recently acknowledged this in his trade policy agenda.\n  If Mayor Kirk is confirmed today, I look forward to working with him \nto advance a progrowth trade agenda for the benefit of U.S. consumers \nand producers.\n  We have a lot of work to do, some of which is left over from the last \nCongress. By that I am referring to our three pending trade agreements \nwith Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  We also need to find a way to reinvigorate the Doha Development Round \nnegotiations in the World Trade Organization.\n  I appreciate Mayor Kirk's engagement and enthusiasm to assume the \nresponsibilities of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Based on his responses to my questions during the vetting process in \nthe Finance Committee, there appear to be some policy areas in which \nour views converge.\n  There are some other areas in which I continue to have concerns, \nparticularly where his responses provided insufficient detail to \ndetermine whether we can have a convergence of views.\n  But that said, if Mayor Kirk is confirmed, I believe that we will \nable to work together on a positive trade agenda.\n  During the committee vetting process, several issues arose with \nrespect to the nominee's tax returns.\n  I am grateful for Mayor Kirk's cooperation with me, Chairman Baucus, \nand the Finance Committee staff.\n  In the true spirit of transparency and cooperation, he responded to \nall questions about his taxes directly and honestly.\n  He also agreed in communications with the staff to release \ninformation about his tax issues, and that information was put into the \nrecord of the committee proceedings.\n  I believe that all nominees should be held to the same standard when \nit comes to compliance with the tax laws.\n  Mayor Kirk was required to amend his returns and pay additional tax \nas a result of the vetting process.\n  Each of the issues for which he amended his returns was considered by \nhim and his preparer at the time the returns were prepared. However, \nupon further review of some of the calculations, he agreed that some of \nthem needed to be changed. Those issues are now resolved.\n  In closing, Mayor Kirk is a strong nominee for the position of U.S. \nTrade Representative.\n  He brings enthusiasm and energy to the table, as well as first-hand \nexperience and understanding of the benefits of liberalized trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Ron Kirk, \nthe nominee for whom we will vote in the next few minutes for U.S. \nTrade Representative. I wish to speak in strong support of Ron Kirk to \nserve as U.S. Trade Representative. I would have been here sooner, but \nas ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, I was holding a hearing \nwith the chairman, Jay Rockefeller, on Governor Locke to be Secretary \nof Commerce, and that was my responsibility that I certainly had to \nmeet.\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\n  I will say that Governor Locke did a very good job before our \nCommerce Committee. We just, within the last hour, concluded that \nhearing. But I wanted to make sure that I am able to speak about Ron \nKirk because, certainly, I know him. I have known him for many years. \nWe both live in Dallas, and he and I enjoy a great relationship. I was \nin the Senate when Ron Kirk was the mayor of Dallas, and he did a \nwonderful job as mayor of our city. I worked with him as a Senator. I \nknow he can get things done. He is very bright, very affable, really \nfunny. He is the kind of person you want to sit next to in a very dull \nspeech because he can make you laugh no matter how bad the summit or \nthe speech or whatever the business of the day. He is a very rare, \nwonderful person.\n  During his time in office, Mayor Kirk expanded Dallas's reach to the \nworld through a range of trade missions, trying to show that Dallas was \nopen for business, and he traveled on trade missions to assure that \nwould happen. While he was mayor he sponsored a competition every year \nfor small businesses to highlight those competing in foreign markets \nand invited the winner to go on his trade mission trips. I think it is \nimportant as a former small business owner myself that we show how you \ncan export to foreign countries, no matter how small your business is, \nif you just know how to pursue it. Mayor Kirk tried to ensure that \nsmall businesses in Dallas, as well as our big businesses, were able to \nhave a place at the table when he was on trade missions, showing what \ncould be done with trade.\n  Before becoming mayor of Dallas, Ron Kirk was secretary of state of \nTexas. He was an appointee of Gov. Ann Richards. He attended Austin \nCollege, graduating with a degree in political science and sociology in \n1976 and then went to the University of Texas Law School, which is also \nmy alma mater. Upon receiving his J.D. in 1979, he practiced law until \n1981 when he went to work in the office of then Texas Senator Lloyd \nBentsen who was my immediate predecessor in this Senate seat.\n  On a personal note, Ron is married to Matrice Ellis Kirk. She, in her \nown right, is a professional woman, a leader in Dallas, another very \nbright, affable person who has made her own impression in Dallas as \nwell. They have two daughters, Elizabeth Alexandria and Catherine \nVictoria.\n  I know that Mayor Kirk's leadership and experience will make him a \nstrong ambassador for U.S. trade policy. Last week in his testimony \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee, Mayor Kirk pledged that as U.S. \nTrade Representative, ``I will work to increase opportunities for \nAmerican entrepreneurs in the global marketplace.''\n  These economic opportunities are critical to America's prosperity. In \n2007, exports accounted for 40 percent of our economic growth.\n  The next U.S. Trade Representative will face a series of challenges, \nincluding revitalizing the stalled WTO talks and managing the Doha \nRound, which is preoccupied with topics such as export subsidies, \ntariffs, copyright issues, and keeping markets open to U.S. goods. \nEqually important, the next U.S. Trade Representative will face the \nworst economic downturn in decades in America and in the world.\n  As we face economic hardships, trade presents a tremendous \nopportunity to sustain and create jobs, expand economies, and stimulate \ngrowth. We must resist the temptation to close our borders and engage \nin protectionism, which always ends up harming our economy.\n  History is not kind to those who raise trade barriers during a \nrecession. In 1930, President Hoover made the mistake of signing the \nSmoot-Hawley tariff, which dramatically increased the cost of imports \nand turned a serious recession into the Great Depression. We can't \nallow that to happen again. My heavens, if we know anything, it is that \nwe should learn from history. The past is prologue.\n  I believe trade policy can play a leading role in getting the U.S. \neconomy and the global economy back on track.\n  Currently, the United States has free-trade agreements in effect with \n14 countries: Canada, Mexico, Israel, Jordan, Chile, Singapore, \nAustralia, Morocco, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras, Nicaragua, and Bahrain. However, we still have free-trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea that await \ncongressional approval.\n  The next U.S. Trade Representative must work with Congress to \nimplement those trade agreements and ensure that American exports enter \nthe global market on a level playing field. I am pleased that in his \ntestimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Mayor Kirk committed to \nwork with Congress to develop ``benchmarks'' that will allow these \naccords to move forward.\n  The Colombian Free Trade Agreement in particular will be tremendously \nbeneficial to the United States, both economically and diplomatically. \nThis accord would remove tariffs on the $8.6 billion of U.S. \nagricultural exports to Colombia every year.\n  While America's economic growth is a primary objective of free-trade \nagreements, they also serve the broader purpose of bolstering our \nforeign policy.\n  At a time when Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez is trying to undermine \nU.S. security interests in Latin America, we must seek trade \npartnerships with allies such as Colombia.\n  As the Washington Post said in an editorial: ``A vote for the \nColombia deal would show Latin America that a staunch U.S. ally will be \nrewarded for improving its human rights record and resisting the anti-\nAmerican populism of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.''\n  By helping Colombia and other countries thrive under the free market, \nwe will help them become less vulnerable to Chavez's petrodollars.\n  I am hopeful that Mayor Kirk will take the necessary steps to ensure \nthat the Colombian Free Trade Agreement is approved.\n  Let me say that I think probably the first issue the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative will have to focus on and solve is with Mexico. This \nweek Mexico threw up tariffs on 90 products that are imported to Mexico \nfrom the United States. Most of these are agricultural products. It \nwill hurt our agriculture businesses if we have a trade war with \nMexico; if we have tariffs that increase the price of American goods \ninto Mexico. We all know this must be solved.\n  I will say that the person who understands this best is Ron Kirk. Ron \nKirk, obviously, lives in Texas. He knows how important free trade is \nwith Mexico. Mexico is Texas's largest trading partner. We export to \nMexico, and he has been there. So he understands that this is a high \npriority for all of our States exporting into Mexico and that we must \nsolve the trucking issue so that Mexico understands that there will be \nparity across the border and that Mexican trucks, like American trucks, \nwill have the same safety standards and that they will have an ability \nto be inspected. He can solve this if we will confirm him today and let \nhim start on this very important problem.\n  Throughout his career, Mayor Kirk has shown the character and \nleadership skills to bring people together on behalf of a good cause. \nFor that reason, I am very confident he will make a great U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. He will seek exports of American goods all over the \nworld. He will seek free and fair trade. That is very important--we \ndon't want other countries to throw up barriers to our entry into their \ncountry--and he will do the right thing. I know he is a good \nnegotiator. I know he will be a good representative of the United \nStates in this very important position.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his nomination. I am pleased we are \nvoting on him soon so that he can hit the ground running on the Doha \nRound and the many issues that are facing our country in this time of \neconomic stress--when the last thing we should be doing is throwing up \nbarriers to trade and exports from our country into other countries, \nwhere good trade makes good neighbors and partners.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Ron Kirk to \nbe our trade representative, despite my concerns with his position on \ntrade policy. The tax matters that came to light during Mr. Kirk's \nvetting are not disqualifying, and because I am inclined to defer to \nany President on the choice of his closest advisers, I decided to \nsupport this nomination.\n  Having said that, I very much hope the President and his new trade \nrepresentative will carefully review our current trade policies, and \nthe impact\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\nthey have had on the lives of millions of Americans. The trade policies \nhanded over to this administration are as fundamentally flawed and \ndamaging to our economy as the fiscal disaster and financial market \ncrisis they inherited.\n  The trade policies of the last two decades, under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, and supported by both Republican and \nDemocratic controlled Congresses, have undermined environmental \nprotections, food safety and public health protections, subverted our \ndemocratic institutions, and helped ship millions of family-supporting \ndecent paying jobs overseas. They have greatly disadvantaged thousands \nof small businesses in my home State of Wisconsin, exposed consumers to \nhealth risks, and decimated communities. They have accelerated the very \nworst aspects of globalization, and have not done nearly enough to \nadvance its potential benefits.\n  Mr. President, I wish Mr. Kirk all the best in his new position, and \nhope he and the President will take a fresh look at our trade policy. \nAs I noted earlier, the mess they have inherited is as big a problem as \nany presented to the new administration, and it deserves our full \nattention.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mayor Ron \nKirk on his nomination to serve as President Obama's U.S. trade \nrepresentative. I am proud to support the confirmation of my fellow \nTexan.\n  Following World War II, the United States recognized a need to engage \nforeign nations and harmonize global economic trade. President Kennedy \nrecognized the value in placing a single chief U.S. trade negotiator in \ncharge of these responsibilities. Later, President Ford elevated this \nimportant position to Cabinet rank. Since then, Congress has worked \nwith many administrations to strengthen the ability of the U.S. trade \nrepresentative to enforce existing trade agreements and open new \nmarkets for American workers, farmers, and consumers.\n  Mayor Kirk would lead the office of U.S. trade representative during \nthe most challenging global financial crisis in history. The World Bank \npredicts that the global economy will shrink this year for the first \ntime in more than six decades. People in many nations are suffering, \nand calls for new trade barriers grow louder. However, the U.S. trade \nrepresentative must speak clearly and calmly against protectionism. He \nmust show how open markets can renew global prosperity and lift \nmillions in the developing world out of poverty.\n  I believe President Obama chose the right man for this job. As mayor \nof Dallas, Ron Kirk saw how open markets create new opportunities for \nour people. His trade missions to other nations encouraged new export \ngrowth. He engaged and recruited foreign investors thereby attracting \nnew jobs into the city. And he recognized that the North American Free \nTrade Agreement would bring additional export-related jobs to the \nregion. While many roundly criticized that accord, Mayor Kirk put it to \nwork for the residents of Dallas. His leadership in the late 1990s \nhelped reenergize the local economy. By 2007, the Dallas-Fort Worth \narea was exporting more than $22 billion of goods and services to \nforeign markets.\n  Mayor Kirk's confirmation will fill an important void in President \nObama's Cabinet. Mayor Kirk has demonstrated that he will warn against \nprotectionism. This voice is needed in the Cabinet.\n  Congress recently voted to suspend the cross-border transportation \npilot program occurring at the southern border of my State of Texas. \nThis shortsighted cancellation was met immediately with news that the \ngovernment of Mexico will retaliate by levying new tariffs on U.S. made \nproducts.\n  This unfortunate situation was avoidable had my colleagues heeded \nwarnings of the retaliation that this policy change would incur upon \nour economy. These tariffs amount to a $2.4 billion tax increase on \nAmerican made products, and one economist estimates a loss of \napproximately 40,000 jobs.\n  At a time when Congress should be working to expand markets for our \ngoods and create jobs in the United States, Congress is instead \nprovoking the ire of the customers who buy American products and \nservices. Our workers and our consumers deserve a trade ambassador that \nwill ensure economic policy is rooted in the best interest of the \neconomy rather than political payback.\n  The President has three economic remedies available immediately. The \npending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and Korea will create \njobs in the United States. Consumers in these countries have a \nvoracious appetite for American goods and services. My State of Texas \nis the top exporter to both Colombia and Panama and the second leading \nexporter to Korea. These destinations represented a $9.5 billion market \nfor Texas-made goods and services in 2008.\n  The hard work is over; these agreements have been negotiated and \nsigned. I urge the administration to work with Congress and pass these \nbeneficial accords.\n  Mayor Kirk is not the first choice of those who fail to recognize the \nbenefits of free trade, but he's the first choice of the President--and \na good choice for American exporters and consumers. The continuing \nglobal financial crisis demands a strong leader at USTR--and Mayor Kirk \nwill fill this role well.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote today to confirm Ronald Kirk to \nbe U.S. Trade Representative. Although I have had serious concerns \nabout our trade policies in the past, I am hopeful this administration \nwill deal differently with trade.\n  I am reassured by some of the things that Mr. Kirk said at his \nconfirmation hearing. For instance, Mr. Kirk said he will put an \nemphasis on workers and the environment, something that his \npredecessors failed to do. He also has acknowledged that the pending \nU.S.-South Korea trade deal negotiated by the Bush administration ``. . \n. just simply isn't fair.'' This acknowledgement is important because \nthe U.S.-South Korea trade agreement as currently written is harmful to \nthe U.S. auto industry and its workers and should not be pursued in its \npresent form.\n  When it comes to automotive trade between the United States and \nKorea, the numbers speak for themselves. While Americans buy more than \n770,000 Korean vehicles each year, fewer than 6,300 American autos are \nsold in Korea. Despite two bilateral memoranda of understanding in 1995 \nand 1998, Korea continues to use ever-changing standards to restrict \nauto imports. There is nothing in the pending agreement that guarantees \nKorea will open its market to U.S. automobiles even though it commits \nthe U.S. to further opening its already open market to Korean vehicles. \nWe should open our auto market further only after U.S. autos have \ngained measurable access to the Korean market but that is not how the \nagreement is currently written.\n  At his confirmation hearing Mr. Kirk agreed the U.S.-South Korea free \ntrade agreement wasn't fair and said, ``if we don't get that right \nwe'll be prepared to step away from that.'' He also said, ``I do not \ncome to this job with `deal fever.' We will not do trade deals just for \nthe sake of doing deals.''\n  I am pleased to hear these remarks because frankly some of the trade \nagreements the U.S. has entered into have not been in the best \ninterests of the United States. The North American Free Trade \nAgreement, NAFTA, is a good example. NAFTA contained a number of unfair \nprovisions that are discriminatory to Michigan workers and companies. \nFor example, it restricted U.S.-made auto parts from entering Mexico \nfor a decade and American used car exports for 25 years. Furthermore, \nthe U.S. maintained small but stable trade deficits with Canada and \nMexico in the 1980s and early 1990s. After NAFTA took effect in 1994, \nthe U.S. developed large and rapidly growing deficits with Canada and \nMexico. Since jobs are created by exports but displaced by imports, job \nlosses occurred. The Economic Policy Institute found that total U.S. \njob displacement from NAFTA over 12 years was 1 million jobs.\n  Our trade policy should focus on opening markets in nations such as \nChina, Japan, the European Union, and South Korea, where the most \negregious trade barriers block the sale of U.S. goods and services and \nwhere we have the potential to export a larger quantity of goods and \nservices. Mr. Kirk has promised to pry open foreign markets and enforce \nexisting trade rules. I support his confirmation in the hope that he \nwill.\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\n  I have not been satisfied with America's trade policy over the past \n30 years. I believe in free trade, but I believe that with free trade \nwe must have fair trade. The U.S. market is the most open in the world, \nbut our policy has failed to insist that foreign markets be equally \nopen to American products. We sorely need a new and just approach to \ntrade.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I understand that we are on \nthe Kirk nomination; however, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nlands bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Coburn Amendments\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate will have before it a \nseries of amendments to the lands bill made by Senator Coburn. I rise \nto oppose specifically two of these amendments, amendment No. 683 and \namendment No. 675, and I do so on behalf of myself and my friend and \ncolleague from California, Senator Boxer.\n  These amendments would essentially throw out a legal settlement \nagreement concerning the restoration of the San Joaquin River. The \nsettlement agreement ends 18 years of costly litigation. It is the \nproduct of 4 years of negotiation by the Bush administration, the State \nof California, dozens of water agencies, the Friant water users--it \naffects Friant, and Friant is a Division of the Central Valley Project \nand 15,000 farmers draw their water from this Division; it is big, it \nis important, it is critical--and by environmental and fishing groups.\n  This was a suit brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council \nagainst the Federal Government saying that what was happening at Friant \nDam was not sufficient in the release of water to protect the salmon.\n  I wish to have printed in the Record at the end of my remarks a \nletter by the Governor of the State of California, Arnold \nSchwarzenegger, supporting the settlement agreement, and a letter from \nthe U.S. Department of Justice supporting the settlement agreement. I \nalso commend to my colleagues a Congressional Research Service \nMemorandum entitled ``Institutional and Economic Context of the San \nJoaquin River Restoration Settlement,'' spelling out the institutional \nand economic context of this settlement agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  So we have broad and strong support for the settlement agreement. \nNow, the question is, Why do we have it? The reason we have it is \nbecause it is my understanding that the Government has lost the case, \nand the result is that with or without the settlement, a Federal court \nwill require restoration of the San Joaquin River. According to all of \nthe parties, the court could--and we believe would--order a huge \nrelease of water from Friant Dam, negatively impacting the 15,000 farms \nin the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project.\n  In contrast, the settlement agreement allows orderly restoration of \nthe river, with minimized impacts to irrigated agricultural and \nmunicipal water users. It provides negotiated flood control and other \nprotections for private landowners. It represents a sensible and hard-\nfought consensus solution. I know, because these parties came to me and \nasked me if I would sit down with all of the parties and try to put \ntogether this settlement agreement, and we did, in fact, do this. It is \nvirtually supported by all of these elements.\n  Also, the settlement would be far less costly to the taxpayers than \nreturning to court and having the end result of having a Federal judge \nmanage the river. That is what the alternative is. Here is why: The \nsettlement provides almost $400 million in non-Federal funds, so what \nwould have had to have been funded by the Federal taxpayers will be \nlowered. Effectively, the costs are lowered to Federal taxpayers. The \naffected water districts have agreed to help fund the settlement with \napproximately $200 million. The State of California will provide \nanother $200 million. If the Coburn amendment is successful and this is \ndropped from the bill, the Federal Government will have to pay an \nadditional $400 million and face the fact that the judge could well \norder a huge release of water, not staggered to any particular time, in \nno orderly manner, which could have tremendous adverse impacts on the \nfarming community.\n  The settlement also minimizes economic costs to the region by \nproviding water supply certainty for users, but without the settlement \nwater users in Friant could face more severe water losses and \npotentially millions of dollars of lost income and lost jobs. As I say, \nthis is 15,000 separate farming entities, so that is unacceptable.\n  Critics have argued that this provision is wasteful spending and that \nit would cost millions of dollars for every fish restored. But the \nfacts prove them wrong. To get the number the critics use, they assume \nthat only 500 fish will ever be restored; that is, salmon, instead of \nthe 30,000 salmon that will eventually return to the river each year as \na self-sustaining fishery. They ignore all the other benefits of the \nsettlement.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service analysis I have \nreferenced, it is ``misleading'' to disregard the ``full array of \nlikely project costs and benefits,'' including ``the values that \nCalifornians and U.S. citizens place on improvements in environmental \nquality and restored runs of salmon.''\n  The bottom line: The settlement offers the best possible solution to \na longstanding water fight in my State. I do not believe there is \nanything wasteful about it. Remember, this suit has gone on for 18 \nyears. I have talked with every one of the parties. They have all come \ntogether asking for a settlement agreement, including the Federal \nGovernment, the State of California, and actually the environmental \ngroup that sued, the NRDC, because they believe that if left to the \njudge, the action might be very adverse in terms of large amounts of \nwater, rather than being staggered and done in a more sensible way, \nwould be detrimental to the Friant farmers as well as, quite possibly, \nto the fish.\n  The other problematic amendment offered by Senator Coburn is \namendment No. 675 which would remove the Government's eminent domain \nauthority for the public lands omnibus bill, including the San Joaquin \nRiver settlement title of the lands bill.\n  Now, to be candid, none of us like the use of eminent domain. In the \n9 years I was mayor, I refused to use eminent domain in San Francisco \nand, in fact, never did. But Senator Coburn's amendment ignores the \nbasic reality that the use of eminent domain is sometimes necessary to \ncarry out western water projects that are vital for an entire region \nbecause the water comes from one place, the State is vast, and it has \nto be moved to other places, and the public benefit of moving that \nwater is enormous in the seventh largest economy on Earth.\n  These water projects need to have the use of eminent domain as a last \nresort for building water projects and flood channels on a willing \nseller-willing buyer basis. Otherwise, the Government clearly is not \ngoing to be able to build water conduits, water projects, and flood \ncontrol elements where they are most needed. That may be different in \nsmall States, but in huge States such as California, where the water \ncomes primarily either from the very north of the State, the Sierra \nNevada mountain range, or the Colorado River--where we are being weaned \noff of the Colorado River, and have an\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nagreement to dramatically cut our take of water from the Colorado \nRiver--we have to have the conveyances to move the water around the \nState.\n  Private landowners also receive the benefit of upgraded flood \nprotections and bypasses around key diversion points, so that fish are \nnot diverted along with irrigation supplies. This is a very sensitive, \nvery problematic area. It has taken a lot of work to know how to do \nthis. The Federal Government could not build these flood and bypass \nmeasures to benefit third party landowners without the ability to \nacquire land through eminent domain. That is just a fact.\n  There is a great need for water projects in my State. If we don't \nmove, I believe California will end up a desert State. We are faced \nwith high wildfire potential, with warming climates, and reduced water. \nWe are in the third year of a drought.\n  Mr. President, you might be interested in knowing that for the big \nCentral Valley of California, which makes California the No. 1 \nagricultural producer in America, most of that valley's water \nallocation from the Central Valley Project for this year is zero, which \nmeans fallowing, which means cutting out trees and crops. So we are in \na very sensitive situation.\n  I urge the Senate to vote no on these Coburn amendments. I think it \nis very easy to come in and second-guess a situation and not know \nanything about 18 years of litigation and the fact that the Government \nis going to lose the case and having to try to work out a settlement, \nwhich gets the best for all of the parties concerned. I believe we have \ndone it, and it has taken hours and hours of negotiation.\n  This has been approved by this body once. To remove the bill and the \neminent domain authority from the lands bill would be tragic. Again, \nthe Federal Government would have to pick up the costs the State of \nCalifornia is willing to pay under this settlement--$200 million--and \nthe cost these water contractors are willing to provide--$200 million--\nand do the whole job itself, which is going to cost an additional $400 \nmillion.\n  These amendments are in no way, shape, or form, cost effective, and \nthey will hamstring California's effort to solve what is an egregious \nproblem, and that is an increasingly drying State, which is in drought \nalmost on a perpetual basis and is trying to solve its problems.\n  On behalf of Senator Boxer and I, I urge a ``no'' vote on both of \nthese amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time not count against \nthe time allocated for the Kirk nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                      Sacramento, CA, May 5, 2008.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As Congress again considers \n     legislation needed to implement the Settlement Agreement \n     reached to restore the San Joaquin River, I write to \n     reiterate my support of your leadership in this matter and to \n     urge Congress to act now to take advantage of this historic \n     opportunity. Restoring the San Joaquin River will provide \n     vital benefits to the environment, to the people of the San \n     Joaquin Valley, and to all Californians. I remain confident \n     that this settlement can be implemented to provide these \n     important benefits while minimizing impacts to the Friant \n     water users and preserving the regional economy.\n       The state of California has already committed substantial \n     funding to support the settlement effort. In November 2006, \n     California voters approved Proposition 84, the Water Quality, \n     Safety and Supply, Flood Control, Natural Resource Protection \n     Bond, which earmarks $100 million to support San Joaquin \n     River restoration. Other bond funds are available to provide \n     flood management improvements and to support regional water \n     supply reliability projects. Moreover, I have directed my \n     Administration to pursue all available opportunities to \n     contribute to the dual restoration and water management goals \n     of the Settlement Agreement.\n       Thank you again for your leadership to secure the passage \n     of the necessary legislation to advance the restoration of \n     the San Joaquin River. Please know that my Administration \n     remains committed to this important effort and we look \n     forward to continuing our work with the federal government on \n     this significant restoration program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arnold Schwarzenegger,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Nick J. Rahall II,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Department of Justice (DOJ) strongly \n     supports H.R. 4074, the San Joaquin River Restoration \n     Settlement Act (originally introduced by Congressman \n     Radanovich as H.R. 24). This bill provides necessary \n     authorization and funding to carry out the terms of the San \n     Joaquin River Settlement. The purpose of the settlement is to \n     fully restore the San Joaquin River and to mitigate the \n     impact of water losses on water districts in the Friant \n     Division of the Central Valley Project who have long-term \n     contractual rights and obligations with the Bureau of \n     Reclamation. This settlement not only resolves litigation \n     over the operation of the Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam \n     east of Fresno, California, it provides a framework for the \n     restoration of the San Joaquin River and its fishery in a way \n     that protects the sustainability of farming in the Friant \n     Division.\n       On October 23, 2006, the United States District Court for \n     the Eastern District of California approved this settlement, \n     ending eighteen years of litigation, Natural Resources \n     Defense Council, et al. v. Kirk Rodgers, et al. The \n     Administration previously announced its support for \n     legislation implementing this settlement in testimony before \n     your Committee on March 1, 2007, by Jason Peltier, Principal \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary for Water and Science for the U.S. \n     Department of the Interior. The State of California has \n     pledged its support for the Settlement in the amount of $200 \n     million.\n       Enactment of H.R. 4074 is essential to the implementation \n     of this historic, court-approved settlement. Without this \n     legislation, the Secretary of the Interior lacks sufficient \n     authority to implement the actions in the settlement, \n     Implementation of the San Joaquin River Settlement will avoid \n     the high cost and uncertainty that will result from a return \n     to litigation if the settlement is not implemented.\n       Thank you for the consideration of our views. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact this office if we can be of further \n     assistance in this matter. The Office of Management and \n     Budget has advised that there is no objection to the \n     submission of this letter from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Brian A. Benczkowski,\n\n                                       Principal Deputy Assistant,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be charged \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about this \nadministration's proposed budget. I believe the President's proposed \nbudget fails the American people. It fails small businesses, and it \nfails our economic future.\n  To me, this budget spends too much on bailouts and on wasteful \nGovernment programs. It raises the cost of energy, and it costs \nAmerican jobs.\n  The spending in this budget is so massive that independent estimates \nsay they are going to need another quarter million people--250,000 more \nFederal Washington bureaucratic workers--just to spend all the money.\n  Middle-class families and small businesses all across this country \nare taking notice. These are the people who are making the financial \nsacrifices every day to pay for these huge Government expenses. Yet \nWashington continues to spend trillions in taxpayers' dollars on \nbailouts and big Government programs.\n  This budget spends too much, it taxes too much, and it borrows too \nmuch.\n  This budget contains the largest tax increase in the history of our \ncountry. We need to help American industry promote growth and create \njobs. I will tell you that raising taxes makes matters worse, \nespecially in an economic downturn.\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\n  The President's plan takes money from small businesses and families \nin my home State of Wyoming. The President's budget will devastate the \nsmall businesses of America. The budget even limits itemized deductions \nfor people who give money to charities. This effectively raises our \nNation's top tax rate to 42 percent.\n  Our Treasury Secretary Geithner says the proposed changes in the tax \nrates would apply to only 2 or 3 percent of small business owners. But \nthe reality is, those tax increases are going to hit hardest those \nsmall businesses which create the most jobs in our Nation.\n  Small businesses created a majority of new jobs in America over the \nlast 10 years. Small businesses are responsible for 70 percent of the \njob creation in this Nation.\n  These jobs are being created by businesses similar to those that are \nnow threatened by the administration's proposed tax increases. When we \nconsider that the administration talks about a goal of job creation, \nwhy is this administration proposing a budget with costly tax hikes on \nthose very engines that create the jobs in this Nation?\n  They say: We are going to delay the tax increases until 2010. That \ndoesn't make those tax increases hurt any less. Small business owners \nplan ahead. They plan well in advance. They will not hire someone today \nif they know they are going to be forced to lay that person off in less \nthan 2 years.\n  I want to talk a little bit about electric bills.\n  Electric bills and the cost of everything manufactured in America is \ngoing to skyrocket under this proposed budget. Under the Obama budget, \ngasoline prices are likely to go up as much as 145 percent.\n  The President from Duke Energy says the plan could increase energy \nprices for American households by as much as 40 percent.\n  People need to know under this plan, anything that emits carbon is \ngoing to be more expensive. This means the plastics we use, the cars we \ndrive, the homes we heat--they are all going to be more expensive. \nEvery time you flip the light switch, you are going to be paying much \nmore.\n  The very building blocks of our Nation will be dramatically taxed. \nAmerican families will experience a dramatic shift down the economic \nladder.\n  Folks who are struggling to get by in my home State of Wyoming and \nall across America will fall through the cracks in this budget. It is \nwrong. It is time this administration leveled with the American people \nabout the hidden details in this budget plan.\n  The President is proposing we spend scarce resources transferring \nincome rather than promoting growth.\n  According to the President's climate proposal, taxes on carbon are \nprojected to total over $78 billion in 2012 and at least $646 billion \nover the next 10 years. Of that money, he proposes to spend $1 out of \nevery $5--only $1 of every $5--on clean energy technologies. The other \n$4 of every $5 are going to go to bigger Government programs.\n  According to the President's budget document, his climate change \nproposal is more expensive than the $646 billion he has suggested. He \nis hiding the true cost to the economy of his cap-and-trade scheme.\n  The President is also abandoning what I call 24-hour power. Under his \ncap-and-trade scheme, that is power that runs the factories and \nAmerican homes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is the power we need \nwhen renewable energy is not there--when the Sun is not shining or the \nwind is not blowing. We need all the energy. We need the coal. We need \nthe nuclear. We need the natural gas. We need the hydropower. All are \nproven and affordable energy solutions. Those are the kinds of things \nthat will help keep electric bills low.\n  If you eliminate these, you are automatically taxing all Americans \nwith high energy bills--that is what you are doing--and that means \nmaking the cost of running a business more expensive. That means \nheating homes all across America will be much more expensive.\n  They have done some estimates, and they have estimated that the \nPresident's new energy tax will cost every household in America an \nadditional $250--not each year but $250 each month.\n  Frankly, that is a tax increase that most American people cannot \nafford, and, frankly, I don't understand why the President is asking \nthem to pay it.\n  In reality, the President's cap-and-trade scheme is another bailout, \na trillion-dollar climate bailout.\n  This budget spends too much, it taxes too much, and it borrows too \nmuch.\n  This budget costs too much in dollars, and it costs too much in jobs. \nThis budget hurts small businesses, and it hurts American families \nalike.\n  This budget provides for the largest tax increase in history to fund \na trillion-dollar climate bailout. It is unfortunate that we are aiming \nand targeting small businesses because they are the very foundation of \njob creation in this country. It is unfortunate that this is the \nstarting point of the debate of how to get our economy moving again.\n  The American people expect better. The American people demand better. \nThe American people deserve better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside on the nomination for USTR?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 16 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to speak for 10 of the 16 \nminutes. I will reserve the 6 minutes for others.\n  Mr. President, we are dealing with the nomination of Mr. Kirk to be \ntrade ambassador, the head of the trade office in our Government. I \nintend to support his nomination, but I wanted to come to the floor to \ntake the opportunity to say that ambassador after ambassador after \nambassador has left that trade office with large and growing trade \ndeficits that I think weaken and undermine our country. And I want to \nmake certain Mr. Kirk and others know what I think is the urgency to \naddress these significant trade deficits.\n  We are a country that is consuming 3 percent more than we produce. No \ncountry can do that for a very long period of time. We are buying more \nfrom abroad than we are selling abroad--$2 billion every single day. We \nimport $2 billion every day more than we export.\n  We are facing a very severe financial crisis in this country now. At \nleast one of the causes of that crisis, which is never discussed by \nanybody, is an unbelievable trade deficit.\n  Our merchandise trade deficit last year was $800 billion. You can \ntake a look at what has happened in recent years. These red lines \nrepresent the deep hole of trade deficits. That is money we owe to \nother countries because we are buying more from them than we are \nselling to them.\n\n  Now, I am for trade, and plenty of it, but I insist it be fair, and I \nalso believe there are mutual responsibilities of trading partners. The \ntrade deficit, for example--in the $800 billion merchandise trade \ndeficit we have--with China is $256 billion. Think of that: $256 \nbillion in a year. And we have very serious trade problems with China \nwith respect to the issue of counterfeiting and piracy.\n  Part of what we are producing in this country these days is \nintellectual property--computer programming and software, various types \nof music and movies, and all kinds of inventions. Our intellectual \nproperty is being pirated and counterfeited on street corners all \nacross China. And it is not as if China doesn't know how to deal with \nthat. When China held the Olympics, they knew how to deal with their \nlogo. There was an Olympic logo for the Chinese Olympics which belonged \nto the Government of China. All of a sudden, that had value, and they \ndecided to protect that. People started showing up on street corners in \nChina selling mugs and banners with the Chinese Olympic logo, and they \nshut them down just like that. They stopped it just like that because \nthat belonged to the Government of China. Well, what about all the \nintellectual property that is pirated and counterfeited and reverse-\nengineered in China that is sold on their street corners in violation \nof everything, which helps result in this $256 billion trade deficit \nwith China?\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nThat is something our U.S. trade ambassador has to confront.\n  Let me give an example--and this is just one; I could give a dozen--\nof part of our problem. We have a trade deficit with South Korea. \nNinety-eight percent of the cars on the streets of South Korea are made \nin South Korea because that is what they want. They do not want foreign \ncars in South Korea. Our country signed two separate trade deals with \nKorea in the 1990s, which supposedly meant that Korea would open up \ntheir auto market. Those agreements are apparently not worth the paper \nthey were written on. So Korea sent us 770,000 vehicles last year--\n770,000 Korean-made vehicles. Those are Korean jobs--vehicles made in \nKorea, sold in the United States. Yet we are able to sell 6,000 \nAmerican vehicles in Korea. Now, think of that: 770,000 cars coming our \nway, and we get to sell 6,000 there. Why? Because the Korean Government \ndoesn't want American cars on their roads. They want one-way trade, \nwhich I think results in unfairness to our country, lack of jobs in our \ncountry, and a growing trade deficit in our country that undermines our \neconomy.\n  The same is true with respect to China. For example, we negotiated a \nbilateral trade agreement with China. Only much later did we learn the \ningredients of that agreement. China is now creating a significant \nautomobile export industry, and we will begin seeing Chinese cars on \nAmerican streets in the not too distant future. They are gearing up for \na very robust automobile export industry. Here is what our country \nagreed with in a bilateral agreement with China. We agreed that any \nAmerican cars sold in China after a phase-in could have a 25-percent \ntariff imposed by the Chinese. Any Chinese cars sold in America would \nhave a 2\\1/2\\-percent tariff. Think of the absurdity of that. A country \nwith which we have a $200 billion trade deficit--last year, $260 \nbillion--and we said: It is okay for you to impose a tariff that is 10 \ntimes higher on U.S.-made automobiles sold in your country than we will \nimpose on your automobiles sold in our country. That is the kind of \nignorance, in my judgment, and unfair trade provisions that result in \nour having an $800 billion merchandise trade deficit.\n  Now, Warren Buffett has said--and Warren Buffett is a bright guy, and \nI like him, I have known him for a long while--this is unsustainable. \nYou can't run these kinds of trade deficits year after year. It is \nunsustainable. Why? Because when we buy $800 billion more from other \ncountries than we sell to them, it means they end up with our money or \na debt, and that debt will be repaid with a lower standard of living in \nour country.\n  My point is that the financial crisis in this country is caused by a \nlot of things, at least one of which is an unbelievable growing trade \ndeficit that has gone on and festered for a long while, and no \nadministration has done much about it. Oh, the last administration, I \nthink the last time they took action was against Europe, and they \nannounced with big fanfare that they were going to impose tariffs on \nRoquefort cheese, truffles, and goose liver. That will scare the devil \nout of some country--Roquefort cheese, truffles, and goose liver. We \nnot only negotiate bad trade agreements, but then we fail to enforce \nthem. And when we do enforce them, we don't enforce them with any \nvigor.\n  Mr. President, I know there has been discussion in the last couple of \ndays about trade with Mexico. Mexico had a $66 billion surplus--or we a \ndeficit with them--last year. We have had a nearly \\1/2\\ trillion \ndollar trade deficit with Mexico in the last 10 years alone, and Mexico \nis accusing us of unfair trade? I am sorry. We have a \\1/2\\ trillion \ndollar deficit with Mexico in trade relationship in 10 years, and they \nbelieve we are unfair?\n  The recent action by Mexico against the United States is due to the \nfact that a large bipartisan majority of both Chambers of Congress \nobjected to a Mexican long-haul trucking pilot program that the Bush \nAdministration wanted to establish. The inspector general of the \nTransportation Department had said that in Mexico there is no central \nrepository of drivers' records, no central repository of accident \nreports, and no central repository of vehicle inspections. We don't \nhave an equivalent system. Well, there is nothing in a trade agreement \nthat requires us to diminish safety on our roads. When we have \nequivalent systems or when we have conditions in both countries that \nare equivalent, you will hear no complaint from me about any pilot \nprogram of this type, but that is not the case today.\n  Just as an aside, at a hearing I held last year, we were told that \none of the rules for the cross-border trucking program was that the \ndrivers who were coming in with the big trucks were going to be \nrequired to be fluent in English. One way they would determine whether \nthey were fluent in English is they would hold up a highway sign, such \nas a stop sign, to the driver and ask him: What is this sign? And if \nthe driver replied, ``Alto,'' which means ``stop'' in Spanish, they \nwould declare that driver fluent in English. Look, this made no sense \nat all. Let's make sure we protect the safety on America's roads. I \nhave no problem with cross-border trucking as soon as we have \nequivalent standards. That is not now the case.\n  But my larger point with Mexico, as with other countries, is that we \nhave a large and growing trade deficit--$66 billion last year with \nMexico; \\1/2\\ trillion dollars in 10 years. This country can't continue \nthat. We have to have fair trade with other countries and fair trade \nagreements. And when we do, it seems to me we should be aggressive in \ntrying to sell worldwide. We are good at this. We can prevail. We don't \nhave to have an $800 billion deficit that threatens our country's \neconomy. No one talks about it much, but the fact is, this enormous \ndeficit undermines the strength of the American economy. It sucks jobs \nout of our country and moves them overseas in search of cheap labor. We \ncan do better than that.\n  I intend to support Ron Kirk. I think he will be a good choice. \nHowever, I hope this trade ambassador understands that while our \ncountry stands for trade and our country stands for open markets, we \nought to, for a change, also stand for fair trade agreements and we \nought to stand for balance in trade and get rid of an $800 billion-a-\nyear deficit in which we end up owing other countries a substantial \namount of our future. It makes no sense to me.\n  So I am for trade, and plenty of it, but let's try to get it right \nfor a change, to strengthen this country and put this country on the \nright track.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the statement of the Secretary of the \nInterior, Ken Salazar, given yesterday before the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources. I think Members will find significant \nsupport for my amendment on alternative energy in his statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Ken Salazar, Secretary of the Interior, Before the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources on Energy Development on the \n                Public Lands and Outer Continental Shelf\n\n       Thank you, Chairman Bingaman, Senator Murkowski, and \n     Members of the Committee, for giving me the opportunity to \n     come before you today to discuss energy development on public \n     lands and the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) under the \n     Department of the Interior's jurisdiction. This is my first \n     hearing before you since my confirmation as Secretary of the \n     Interior and it is an honor to be here.\n       President Obama has pledged to work with you to develop a \n     new energy strategy for the country. His New Energy for \n     America plan will create a clean energy-based economy that \n     promotes investment and innovation here at home, generating \n     millions of new jobs. It will ensure energy security by \n     reducing our dependence on foreign oil, increasing \n     efficiency, and making responsible use of our domestic \n     resources. Finally, it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n       During his visit to the Department for our 160th \n     anniversary celebration two weeks ago, the President spoke \n     about the Department's major role in helping to create this \n     new, secure, reliable and clean energy future. The vast \n     landholdings and management jurisdiction of the Department's \n     bureaus, encompassing 20 percent of the land mass of the \n     United States and 1.7 billion acres of the Outer Continental \n     Shelf, are key to realizing this vision through the \n     responsible development of these resources.\n       These lands have some of the highest renewable energy \n     potential in the nation. The Bureau of Land Management has \n     identified a total of approximately 20.6 million acres of \n     public land with wind energy potential in the 11 western \n     states and approximately 29.5 million acres with solar energy \n     potential in the six southwestern states. There are also over \n     140 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska \n     with geothermal resource potential.\n       There is also significant wind and wave potential in our \n     offshore waters. The National Renewable Energy Lab has \n     identified more than 1,000 gigawatts of wind potential off \n     the Atlantic coast, and more than 900 gigawatts of wind \n     potential off the Pacific Coast.\n       Renewable energy companies are looking to partner with the \n     government to develop this renewable energy potential. We \n     should responsibly facilitate this development. \n     Unfortunately, today, in BLM southwestern states, there is a \n     backlog of over 200 solar energy applications. In addition, \n     there are some 20 proposed wind development projects on BLM \n     lands in the west. These projects would create engineering \n     and construction jobs.\n       To help focus the Department of the Interior on the \n     importance of renewable energy development, last Wednesday, \n     March 11, I issued my first Secretarial Order. The order \n     makes facilitating the production, development, and delivery \n     of renewable energy top priorities for the Department. Of \n     course, this would be accomplished in ways that also project \n     our natural heritage, wildlife, and land and water resources.\n       The order also establishes an energy and climate change \n     task force within the Department, drawing from the leadership \n     of each of the bureaus. The task force will be responsible \n     for, among other things, quantifying the potential \n     contributions of renewable energy resources on our public \n     lands and the OCS and identifying and prioritizing specific \n     ``zones'' on our public lands where the Department can \n     facilitate a rapid and responsible move to significantly \n     increased production of renewable energy from solar, wind, \n     geothermal, incremental or small hydroelectric power on \n     existing structures, and biomass sources. The task force will \n     prioritize the permitting and appropriate environmental \n     review of transmission rights-of-way applications that are \n     necessary to deliver renewable energy generation to \n     consumers, and will work to resolve obstacles to renewable \n     energy permitting, siting, development, and production \n     without compromising environmental values.\n       Accomplishing these goals may require new policies or \n     practices or the revision of existing policies or practices, \n     including possible revision of the Programmatic Environmental \n     Impact Statements (PEISs) for wind and geothermal energy \n     development and the West-Wide Corridors PEIS that BLM has \n     completed, as well as their Records of Decision. The \n     Department of Interior will work with relevant agencies to \n     explore these options.\n       We will also, as I have said before, finalize the \n     regulations for offshore renewable development authorized by \n     section 388 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which gave the \n     Secretary of the Interior authority to provide access to the \n     OCS for alternative energy and alternate use projects. This \n     rulemaking was proposed but never finalized by the previous \n     Administration.\n       For these renewable energy zones to succeed, we will need \n     to work closely with other agencies, states, Tribes and \n     interested communities to determine what electric \n     transmission infrastructure and transmission corridors are \n     needed and appropriate to deliver these renewable resources \n     to major population centers. We must, in effect, create a \n     national electrical superhighway system to move these \n     resources from the places they are generated to where they \n     are consumed. We will assign a high priority to completing \n     the permitting and appropriate environmental review of \n     transmission rights-of-way applications that are necessary to \n     accomplish this task.\n       Developing these renewable resources requires a balanced \n     and mindful approach that addresses the impacts of \n     development on wildlife, water resources and other interests \n     under the Department's management jurisdiction. I recognize \n     this responsibility, and it is not a charge I take lightly.\n       At the same time, we must recognize that we will likely be \n     dependent on conventional sources--oil, gas, and coal--for a \n     significant portion of our energy for many years to come. \n     Therefore it is important that the Department continue to \n     responsibly develop these energy resources on public lands.\n       In the past 7 weeks, the Department has held seven major \n     oil and gas lease sales onshore, netting more than $33 \n     million for taxpayers. And tomorrow I will be in New Orleans \n     for a lease sale covering approximately 34.6 million offshore \n     acres in the Central Gulf of Mexico. This sale includes 4.2 \n     million acres in the 181 South Area, opened as a result of \n     the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. Continuing to develop \n     these assets, through an orderly process and based on sound \n     science, adds important resources to our domestic energy \n     production.\n       Based on this approach, I announced last week that I would \n     be hosting four regional public meetings next month in order \n     to gather a broad range of viewpoints from all parties \n     interested in energy development on the OCS. In addition, I \n     directed the Minerals Management Service and the U.S. \n     Geological Survey to assemble a report on our offshore oil \n     and gas resources and the potential for renewable energy \n     resources, including wind, wave, and tidal energy. The \n     results of that report will be presented and discussed with \n     the public.\n       The meetings will be held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, New \n     Orleans, Louisiana, Anchorage, Alaska, and San Francisco, \n     California, during the first two weeks in April.\n       These meetings are an integral part of our strategy for \n     developing a new, comprehensive, and environmentally \n     appropriate energy development plan for the OCS. I have also \n     extended the comment period on the previous Administration's \n     proposed 5-year Plan for development by 180 days. We will use \n     the information gathered at these regional meetings to help \n     us develop the new 5-year plan on energy development on the \n     OCS.\n       Similarly, again based on sound science, policy and public \n     input, we will move forward with a second round of research, \n     development, and demonstration leases for oil shale in \n     Colorado and Utah. While we need to move aggressively with \n     these technologies, these leases will help answer the \n     critical questions about oil shale, including about the \n     viability of emerging technologies on a commercial scale, how \n     much water and power would be required, and what impact \n     commercial development would have on land, water, wildlife, \n     communities and on addressing global climate change.\n       We are also proceeding with development onshore, where \n     appropriate, on our public lands. As I noted above, the \n     responsible development of our oil, gas and coal resources \n     help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but this \n     development must be done in a thoughtful and balanced way, \n     and in a way that allows us to protect our signature \n     landscapes, natural resources, wildlife, and cultural \n     resources.\n       We also need to ensure that this development results in a \n     fair return to the public that owns these federal minerals. \n     That's why the President's 2010 Budget includes several \n     proposals to improve this return by closing loopholes, \n     charging appropriate fees, and reforming how royalties are \n     set. Of course, I'll be happy to discuss these in more detail \n     after the Administration's full budget request is released in \n     the coming weeks.\n       Implementation of the President's energy plan will \n     ultimately focus the nation on development of a new green \n     economy and move us toward energy independence, and I and my \n     team are working hard to put that plan into place.\n       Mr. Chairman, I know you and the Committee, along with the \n     Majority Leader and others in Congress, are working hard on \n     these issues. I believe we are being presented today with an \n     historic opportunity to enhance our economy, our environment, \n     and our national security. Too much is at stake for us to \n     miss this opportunity.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I am \n     happy to answer any questions that you may have.\n\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are putting the cart before the horse, \nbecause one of the things the Secretary spoke about yesterday is that \nwe have to figure out how to transfer all this renewable energy from \nFederal lands. What this bill and what a previous amendment that I have \noffered and that is now pending would do is to say this bill is going \nto offset that. We are not going to know where we need to send it or \nhow we need to send it. With this bill, we are going to deny the \noptions to the Secretary of the Interior in terms of transmission lines \nwith geothermal, with solar, and with wind.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the opening statement of the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, Senator Bingaman, because I am very pleased with \nhis statements on oil and gas and renewables, and it again would \nsupport the amendment I have offered that we should not preclude \nrenewables from this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Energy Production on Federal Lands\n\n       I want to welcome my colleagues, our witnesses and \n     especially Secretary Salazar to today's hearing on the \n     important topic of energy development on public lands and the \n     Outer Continental Shelf. Our Nation has abundant energy \n     resources, a good portion of which are found on our onshore \n     public lands and the Outer Continental Shelf. These resources \n     are owned by all of the people of the United States, and \n     their management is entrusted to the Federal Government.\n       That's why we're particularly pleased that our new \n     Secretary of the Interior is here today to tell us about his \n     vision for the development of our energy resources on public \n     lands, both onshore and offshore. Secretary Salazar has \n     important decisions to make--decisions that may prove \n     essential to our Nation's energy security and economic well-\n     being--but also decisions that will impact the landscape and \n     our environment for generations to come.\n       I look forward to hearing more about the Administration's \n     plans in this regard. I hope that Secretary Salazar can share \n     with us his vision for how we can determine the best places \n     for energy development on the OCS, and how we can move \n     forward to get more energy production--both oil and gas and \n     renewables--in a safe and environmentally sound manner from \n     the Outer Continental Shelf.\n       I know that the Secretary is also interested in our onshore \n     oil and gas leasing program. We recognize the contribution of \n     that program to our energy supply. I hope that under his \n     leadership, the BLM can resolve any resource conflicts up \n     front, so that this important program can run smoothly and \n     efficiently. To this end, it is also important that the \n     inspection and enforcement program at the BLM be well-funded.\n       Finally, this Administration is clearly committed to \n     renewable energy. I know Secretary Salazar is. The Department \n     of the Interior and the Forest Service have a key role in the \n     siting of generation and transmission facilities for wind and \n     solar energy. I know that Secretary Salazar has already \n     undertaken initiatives to bring about more renewable energy \n     production on Federal lands.--Jeff Bingaman, Chairman, \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 682 to Amendment No. 684\n\n  (Purpose: To protect scientists and visitors to federal lands from \n          unfair penalties for collecting insignificant rocks)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and amendment No. 682 be brought up and \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 682 to amendment No. 684.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. We do \nhave a problem with thieves stealing significant fossil remains from \npublic lands, but the way the bill is written currently is that we are \ngoing to hit a fly with a sledgehammer. What we are going to do is put \nScout leaders and troops, graduate students, and the regular public in \nline for tremendously harsh penalties if they inadvertently or \ninconsequentially pick up a small rock that might have a fossil.\n  All this amendment does is it tells the Secretary that ``they shall \nallow,'' without penalty, the insignificant capture of these small \nitems--not to resell, not for going on the black market, but actually \nfor educational purposes--by Scout troops, graduate students, college \nclasses, and the like.\n  What we know from the history is that there have been significant \ndifficulties in terms of the lack of law enforcement on public lands. \nThis goes back to one of our other amendments we talked about earlier, \nwhich is not only is there a backlog in the repair and care of our \npublic lands, but we don't have the money to enforce and protect the \nvery assets which we think are paleontological assets, which we know \nare valuable both for history and science. We haven't had the forces \ncapable of even enforcing what is already illegal. It is already \nillegal to steal those items from public land.\n  So what this amendment does is just change the wording from ``may'' \nto ``shall''; that the Secretary ``shall allow casual collecting'' that \nwill not harm any of our public lands and will not put the truly \ninnocent--simply inquiring minds--at risk of the harsh penalties of \nthis segment of the bill. It is as simple as that. All it does is \nlighten up on the inadvertent and the non-inappropriate looking for \nsmall fossils and small rocks that may not even contain fossils. We \nhave already had testimony that the majority of the people who have \nbeen arrested under the illegal statute have not been those who have \nbeen in the black market. It has been Scout leaders and graduate \nstudents and college professors who have actually been out there.\n  So I think it is a commonsense amendment, and I hope my colleagues \nwill consider it and adopt it so that we don't overshoot on what is \nintended to be a solution to a very serious problem.\n  I would also like to spend a moment in rebutting some of the words of \nthe Senator from California. I have not yet offered, but intend to \noffer, one amendment that will in fact strike some earmarks from this \nbill. The San Joaquin River has, no question, been engaged in a \nlawsuit. But if you ago back to 1924 and see what the Federal \nGovernment said about the salmon run over this area, it was already in \ndecline. As a matter of fact, it was in a decline to a level very close \nto what we have seen today.\n  What we have had is a lawsuit that has reached a settlement that now \nwe are to pay $1 billion with the specific goal not of 100,000 salmon, \nnot of 30,000 salmon, but the goal in the settlement is 500 salmon. The \nlikelihood of achieving that, for $1 billion, first of all, is \nunlikely. The ultimate outside costs are going to be tremendous. What \nare the costs? Through this lawsuit, we are going to put at jeopardy, \nput at risk, $20 billion worth of economic activity in one of the most \nfertile areas of California.\n  The Congressman who represents 85 percent of that district and his \nconstituents are adamantly opposed to this settlement because they know \nwhat it is going to do in terms of the water resource for that \nagricultural community. Not everyone supports this settlement, as the \nSenator from California said, certainly not the Congressman \nrepresenting the district.\n  The other claim Senator Feinstein made is it would be less costly \nthan the alternative litigation. If you use the two analyses done in \nthe late 1990s regarding the economic impacts of water supply \nreductions, estimates paint the total costs of this settlement to the \ncommunity at over $10 billion; $10 billion is the economic loss to be \nassociated with this settlement.\n  At a time of economic difficulty, the last thing we need to be doing \nis cutting out another $10 billion of economic productivity.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 677 to Amendment No. 684\n\n  I ask the pending amendment be set aside and amendment No. 677 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 677 to amendment No. 684.\n\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require Federal agencies to determine on an annual basis \nthe quantity of land that is owned by each Federal agency and the cost \n               to taxpayers of the ownership of the land)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S3341]]\n\n     SEC. ___. ANNUAL REPORT RELATING TO LAND OWNED BY FEDERAL \n                   GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) Annual Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), not later than \n     May 15, 2009, and annually thereafter, the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget (referred to in this section \n     as the ``Director'') shall ensure that a report that contains \n     the information described in subsection (b) is posted on a \n     publicly available website.\n       (2) Extension relating to certain segment of report.--With \n     respect to the date on which the first annual report is \n     required to be posted under paragraph (1), if the Director \n     determines that an additional period of time is required to \n     gather the information required under subsection (b)(3)(B), \n     the Director may--\n       (A) as of the date described in paragraph (1), post each \n     segment of information required under paragraphs (1), (2), \n     and (3)(A) of subsection (b); and\n       (B) as of May 15, 2010, post the segment of information \n     required under subsection (b)(3)(B).\n       (b) Required Information.--Except as provided in subsection \n     (c), an annual report described in subsection (a) shall \n     contain, for the period covered by the report--\n       (1) a description of the total quantity of--\n       (A) land located within the jurisdiction of the United \n     States, to be expressed in acres;\n       (B) the land described in subparagraph (A) that is owned by \n     the Federal Government, to be expressed--\n       (i) in acres; and\n       (ii) as a percentage of the quantity described in \n     subparagraph (A); and\n       (C) the land described in subparagraph (B) that is located \n     in each State, to be expressed, with respect to each State--\n       (i) in acres; and\n       (ii) as a percentage of the quantity described in \n     subparagraph (B);\n       (2) a description of the total annual cost to the Federal \n     Government for maintaining all parcels of administrative land \n     and all administrative buildings or structures under the \n     jurisdiction of each Federal agency; and\n       (3) a list and detailed summary of--\n       (A) with respect to each Federal agency--\n       (i) the number of unused or vacant assets;\n       (ii) the replacement value for each unused or vacant asset;\n       (iii) the total operating costs for each unused or vacant \n     asset; and\n       (iv) the length of time that each type of asset described \n     in clause (i) has been unused or vacant, organized in \n     categories comprised of periods of--\n\n       (I) not more than 1 year;\n       (II) not less than 1, but not more than 2, years; and\n       (III) not less than 2 years; and\n\n       (B) the estimated costs to the Federal Government of the \n     maintenance backlog of each Federal agency, to be--\n       (i) organized in categories comprised of buildings and \n     structures; and\n       (ii) expressed as an aggregate cost.\n       (c) Exclusions.--Notwithstanding subsection (b), the \n     Director shall exclude from an annual report required under \n     subsection (a) any information that the Director determines \n     would threaten national security.\n       (d) Use of Existing Annual Reports.--An annual report \n     required under subsection (a) may be comprised of any annual \n     report relating to the management of Federal real property \n     that is published by a Federal agency.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment, too. It is a \ngood housekeeping amendment. What this amendment does is requires the \nFederal Government every year to detail to the people of this country \nthe amount of the property that the Federal Government owns and the \ncost of that land ownership to taxpayers. Do you realize right now we \nhave 21,000 buildings that are owned by the Federal Government sitting \nempty? We have 40 million square feet of excess space that is not being \nused, just by the Department of Energy alone.\n  The Federal Government currently does not disclose these assets. As a \nmatter of fact, they do not even know what they are. What this \namendment would do is ask the Federal Government, through the OMB, to \ncreate an inventory of Federal assets as far as land and buildings are \nconcerned. We do not know what it costs us to maintain it. We don't \nknow if it is economical for us to continue to maintain it as a Federal \nGovernment property or whether we ought to put it up for sale or we \nought to cede it to the States, to an Indian tribe or some other \nGovernment agency where it can be utilized. We just don't have the \nknowledge. Without this kind of knowledge there is no way that Congress \ncan manage Federal properties and Federal lands.\n  What this would specifically require is the Office of Management and \nBudget to issue a report detailing the following: the total amount of \nland in the United States that is owned by the Federal Government; the \npercentage of all U.S. property controlled by the Federal Government, \nthat is controlled--maybe not owned but controlled; the total cost of \noperating and maintaining Federal real property, including land, \nbuildings and structures; a list of all Federal property that is either \nunused or vacant--that is something we should know which we do not \nknow--and the estimated cost of the maintenance backlog on Federal \nland, buildings, and properties by agency.\n  This will give taxpayers greater transparency. It allows the \ntaxpayers to know what kind of poor stewards we are with Federal \nproperty and land. It will also give us a focus to direct the \nmaintenance backlog that we have today, to create a priority for it. We \ncan see it in light of all the maintenance problems by agency.\n  It also will help us when we are considering a bill like this one. \nNobody knows the total impact of this bill--this bill, 170 bills. \nNobody has done a study to say what the total impact is going to be. We \ndon't know what the total impact is going to be on energy transmission. \nWhat we do know is it is going to hinder it greatly. What it does is it \ngives us a management tool.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the total amount of \nFederal land is unknown. In fact, different sources show significantly \ndifferent estimates. This is their direct quote:\n\n       The estimate of $650 million assumes the four Federal land \n     management agencies have reasonably accurate data on lands \n     under their jurisdiction, and the Department of Defense.\n\n  I would note that this amendment specifically excludes any properties \nthat should not be known publicly, that are of national security or \ndefense nature.\n  It is interesting, the Government tracks property we own, but the \ntaxpayers cannot track the property the Government owns. Let me repeat \nthat. Government at all levels tracks the property we own, but the \ntaxpayers are not allowed to track the property the Government owns \nthrough them--ridiculous. The Government should have to disclose \nexactly the same information, when it is not a national security issue, \nthat we have to disclose on our own property.\n  What we do know is that the Federal Government controls more than \none-fourth of the Nation's total land, and that continues to grow. It \nis going to grow by almost 3 million acres in this bill. Between 1997 \nand 2004, the latest years for which reliable information was \navailable, Federal land ownership increased from 563 million to 654.7 \nmillion acres. In 7 years it grew 100 million acres. That is 100 \nmillion acres on which nobody is collecting any property tax. It is 100 \nmillion acres we are not taking care of. It is 100 million acres that \nhave facilities and structures and backlogs on maintenance issues on it \nthat are costing us dearly every year. As the Federal Government takes \nmore land, the costs of maintaining the property increases and the \nmaintenance backlogs continue to grow.\n  It also does something else. In this 100 million acres of growth in \nthe 7 years up to 2004, that is 100 million acres that is not available \nto the American public to utilize in a productive way, in a way that \ncould build capacity, could build wealth, could build jobs. None of \nthat happens. The only jobs that come with Federal Government programs \nor Federal Government property is Federal jobs that are not necessarily \nproductive of new assets, new wealth, and new job creation beyond it.\n  The other thing we know is, as this 100 million acres has been added \nover the previous 7 years, that the maintenance backlog of what we do \nown has fallen further and further behind. We know, according to the \nGAO, the maintenance backlog just at the Forest Service--not the \nnational parks--we know that is somewhere between $12 billion and $19 \nbillion. But the Forest Service has tripled.\n  The other problem I mentioned earlier, of the 21,000 buildings we \nhave now that we are not utilizing, we could reduce the debt by $18 \nbillion just in the maintenance costs to those buildings. Think about \nthat. We have 21,000 buildings sitting. We are not doing anything with \nthem except maintaining them, and we are spending $18 billion that we \ndo not have taking care of buildings whereas we could get $18 billion \nfor those buildings if we would dispose of them. But we have been \nblocked in this body from proposing real property reform.\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\n  The first step, then, is to know what we have, and this is just a \nguess of what we have. I mentioned earlier that the Department of \nEnergy--I said 40--it is 20 million square feet of excess capacity. \nThat is three times the size of the Pentagon. So three times the size \nof the Pentagon, you could put five U.S. Capitols inside the Pentagon \nin terms of square footage.\n  The other benefit from this is transparency will help us every time \nin every way. Knowing what we need to know about Federal property, \nknowing what we need to know about maintenance backlogs, is key to us \nfixing the problem. We cannot manage Federal property unless we know \nwhat we are managing, unless we have the details and the data. My hope \nis this amendment will be accepted and that the American people can \nactually know what they own, much like the Government knows what they \nown.\n  I have one other amendment to offer, but I will defer that to a later \npoint in time, and at this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from New Mexico \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I believe at 2 o'clock we are \nproceeding to vote on a nomination and then also on three of the six \namendments that are being proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma to this \nomnibus lands bill. I just want to speak briefly about the three \namendments that we are expected to vote on in the sequence of votes \nbeginning at 2 o'clock.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 680\n\n  As I understand it, the first of those is an amendment, SA 680, \nprohibiting construction in the national parks. This amendment \nprohibits the National Park Service from beginning any new construction \nuntil the Secretary determines that ``all existing sites, structures, \ntrails, and transportation infrastructure of the National Park Service \nare--fully operational; fully accessible to the public; and propose no \nhealth or safety risk to the general public or employees of the \nNational Park Service.''\n  The amendment excludes from the new construction ban, first, ``the \nreplacement of existing structures in cases in which rehabilitation \ncosts exceed new construction costs''; or, second, the second area that \nis excluded from the construction ban would be ``any new construction \nthat the Secretary determines to be necessary for public safety.''\n  The amendment, as I read it, would eliminate the ability of Congress \nto determine what funds should be appropriated to each park. In all \nlikelihood, the Secretary would never be able to make the certification \ncalled for in the amendment since there would always be some backlog. \nSo this amendment would ensure that we would not proceed with new \nconstruction in our national parks.\n  The amendment also appears to prohibit the expenditure of already \nappropriated funds, if the construction has not yet begun, which would \nnegate funds recently appropriated as part of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act and also funds contained in the Omnibus Appropriations \nAct that was approved by this Congress.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose that amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 679\n\n  The second amendment I wanted to talk about is Coburn amendment No. \n679. That amendment states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in \n     this Act shall restrict the development of renewable energy \n     on public land, including geothermal, solar and wind energy \n     and related transmission infrastructure.\n\n  Madam President, the proponent of the amendment argues we should not \ndesignate the wilderness or national park or other conservation in the \nareas set out in this bill because they will restrict our sources of \nenergy. I disagree with that.\n  For example, the bill, as it stands before us, designates 15 new \nwilderness areas. None of those areas have significant energy \ndevelopment potential. Three of the wilderness areas are within \nnational parks where energy development is already not allowed. So the \nwilderness designation would not change that in any way.\n  The remaining wilderness areas are on land administered by the Bureau \nof Land Management or the Forest Service, and those agencies have \nprovided information to our committee, the Energy Committee, that the \nnew wilderness areas have low or no potential for energy development \nwithin the areas designated.\n  In addition to the wilderness areas, the amendment would undermine \nthe designation of several other areas that are created to protect \nnaturally significant features. For example, the bill designates a new \nnational monument and a new national conservation area in my home State \nof New Mexico, one of which will protect a series of fossilized \nprehistoric trackways and the other which protects a large cave system. \nNeither site is appropriate for energy development. Neither designation \nwould reduce the contribution made by New Mexico as a major energy \nprovider.\n  We are currently working on an energy bill in our Energy and Natural \nResources Committee that will encourage the development of renewable \nenergy. However, the areas designated in this bill will not reduce our \nNation's ability to develop these resources.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 675\n\n  The third amendment I wished to briefly describe or discuss is the \namendment No. 675 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. This amendment \nstates that no land or interest in land shall be acquired under this \nact by eminent domain.\n  First, it is important to understand that there are no provisions in \nthis act that grant the Federal Government eminent domain authority. \nThat authority already exists. It has existed since the founding of the \ncountry.\n  The use of eminent domain authority, however, is limited and \ncontrolled by the fifth amendment and by certain Federal statutes. \nThese provisions require just compensation when eminent domain is \nactually used.\n  Secondly, there are no major land acquisitions in the bill. The \namendment could impact the water projects that are authorized by the \nbill, particularly the Indian water rights settlement and rural water \nprojects that are authorized in titles IX and X of the regulation.\n  Eminent domain, while sparingly used, has at times been a crucial \ntool for the Bureau of Reclamation in its attempts to complete \nimportant water projects. Examples that come to mind are the Central \nArizona Project. My colleagues from Arizona are very familiar with the \nbenefits that has brought to the State of Arizona.\n  The Central Utah Project, again, my colleagues from Utah undoubtedly \nknow the value of that project. In such cases, without this tool, it \nlikely would have been impossible to complete the reservoirs and \ndrinking water pipelines and irrigation canals that are so crucial to \nthe communities that are served by those projects.\n  The amendment that is being offered is problematic for several \nreasons. Let me recount those: First, it would impede the construction \nor increase the cost of several of the water projects provided for in \nthis bill. This could result in the failure to complete projects or to \nimplement one or more of the Indian water rights settlements that are \nbeing resolved.\n  The Navajo settlement, which includes a rural water project critical \nto the Navajo people, is one of particular importance to me. It needs \nto be fully implemented without delay, and elimination of this \nauthority would impede that. The language of the amendment is not \nlimited to Federal agencies. Accordingly, it would be interpreted to \nrestrict eminent domain by State-based entities if Federal money is \ninvolved as part of a condemnation.\n  The Eastern New Mexico Project is an example of a project where the \nlocal water authority will be responsible for securing rights of way \nfor the project. It does not intend to condemn any property rights, but \nit will have that power, if needed, to deliver much needed water to the \ncommunities in rural New Mexico that will be served by the project. The \nCoburn amendment could interfere with the authority of that local \nentity to complete that project.\n  Finally, the Bureau of Reclamation indicates it has at times used so-\ncalled friendly condemnation to acquire State and local lands when the \nrelevant government entities do not have the authority to sell such \nland. This has been a valuable tool to the Bureau of Reclamation and \ncould be prohibited by the Coburn amendment.\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\n  In sum, for well over 100 years, the Bureau of Reclamation, as one \nagency, has balanced public needs with private property rights to help \naddress critical water needs throughout the West. I expect that \nReclamation's approach will not change as a result of anything in this \nbill. The Coburn amendment is unnecessary, would likely complicate the \nwork done by numerous communities to address the water issues that \naffect their future.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose that amendment as well.\n  I yield the floor. I see my colleague from Oklahoma is here and would \nlike to continue with his other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. While I thank the chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, \nfor his words and his comments, I would note that true eminent domain \nwas not truly exercised in this country until the authority was given \nin 1960, not at the start of our founding. As a matter of fact, we \nbelieved in property rights in our founding. It is only since 1960 have \nwe decided the Government knows better than a private landowner.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the present \nongoing debate on eminent domain between the Friars and the National \nPark Service on the Appalachian Trail, just to show you how \ncontroversial the taking of land of private homeowners, landowners is, \nwhen we, in our ultimate wisdom, say we know better than the people who \nown private land in this country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Friars and National Park Service Face Off on Appalachian Trail\n\n\n                   Eminent domain proceedings halted\n\n                        (By Margaret O'Sullivan)\n\n       The Franciscan Friars and Sisters of the Atonement at \n     Graymoor met with officials from the National Park Service: \n     Judy Brumback, Chief of the Acquisitions Division and Pamela \n     Underhill, Park Manager of the Appalachian Trail; US Senator \n     Charles E. Schumer and Congresswoman Sue Kelly on August 7. \n     The topic was the disputed 20-acre parcel the National Park \n     Service wants as ``a buffer area'' for the Appalachian Trail. \n     As reported in this paper on July 19, 2000 the Park Service \n     obtained an easement on 58 acres of Friar land just north of \n     the contested section in 1984 when the Friars sold the \n     development rights of that parcel to the Park Service. The \n     following year the agreement was violated when a pumphouse \n     for a sewage treatment plant was built by the Franciscan \n     Friars on the land.\n       After a private meeting on a hot and humid August 7, \n     between the Friars and the Park Service, moderated by Senator \n     Schumer and Congresswoman Kelly, Senator Schumer said that \n     letters had been going back and forth to the Park Service \n     since May this year and finally the situation had come to a \n     head. He stated that ``good news'' is on the way: The lawsuit \n     is on hold, the parties have come back to the table for talks \n     and they have a basic agreement in that their goals are not \n     really in conflict.\n       A further meeting is scheduled for August 23, 2000 when \n     discussions will take place in order to resolve the dispute. \n     Senator Schumer further stated that it is great to have the \n     Friary here--it is probably the best part of the Appalachian \n     Trail, if one was caught in a storm or in need. The Friars \n     welcome anyone who might need assistance, a shower or a meal \n     while hiking the trail. As Senator Schumer indicated, there \n     are many solutions short of legal action. He said he has ``a \n     nose'' for when disputes will escalate or get resolved and it \n     is positive for the community to bring both sides together. \n     The situation should be resolved amiably; there are no gains \n     by continued fighting.\n       Congresswoman Kelly said that recently the National Park \n     Service had turned down a request from her office to arrange \n     a meeting between the Friars and the Park Service to resolve \n     the matter. Instead the National Park Service initiated \n     eminent domain proceedings through the Justice Department. \n     She hadn't thought another meeting would rake place this soon \n     but stated that ``it appears that the Park service is finally \n     coming to its senses.'' ``Their decision to pursue this case \n     using such heavy-handed tactics is wrong. The Justice \n     Department should play no role in this matter. The Friars \n     contribute to our community every day. Their work has touched \n     the lives of countless individuals and the Hudson Valley \n     community as a whole. I don't want to see their work hindered \n     in any way.'' She said it was a good sign that the Justice \n     Department had withdrawn any legal action and emphasized that \n     the dispute is not about development but about the use of \n     land.\n       Rev. Arthur M. Johnson, Minister General of Graymoor, (Fr. \n     Art) thanked both Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Kelly for \n     ``pressuring'' the two factions to get together face to face. \n     He felt that the Friary and the National Park Service \n     actually had a common goal, and that is people. Hiking the \n     Appalachian Trail gives people a natural experience while the \n     Friary wants to continue their ministry to help those in \n     need. Many hikers, over 400 a year in fact, have experienced \n     the Franciscan hospitality while hiking the Trail, a service \n     recognized by hikers and the Park Service alike. He felt it \n     was a ``win-win'' situation for all.\n       Pamela Underhill, Park Manager of the Appalachian National \n     Scenic Trail, agreeing in principle with Fr. Art, stated that \n     it was rewarding to meet and felt that the lines of \n     communication had vastly improved. She too touched on the \n     common goal theme, which offered both a ``Godly and natural \n     retreat.'' She reiterated the need for a ``buffer zone'' \n     along the trail, which is the heart of the matter. Although \n     Ms. Underhill and Fr. Art had both hiked the Trail, they had \n     never hiked together--August 7th was the first time.\n       They hit the trail along with other Friars, Senator \n     Schumer, Congresswoman Kelly and members of the press. All \n     agreed that it was very beneficial to actually see the site \n     in question, and the position of the pumphouse in proximity \n     to the Appalachian Trail. Putting their ``worst fears'' on \n     the table, Pamela Underhill stated that she is concerned \n     about the Trail and development of any land in close \n     proximity to the Appalachian Trail. Fr. Art's concerns were \n     about the future of their ministry. He did not want to see \n     any plans they may have for the future undermined which could \n     curtail their ability to sustain the needed infrastructure to \n     minister to the thousands of men and women who come to \n     Graymoor each year.\n       Both sides are optimistic about the upcoming meeting on \n     August 23rd.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I would also note the testimony yesterday given by the \nSecretary of the Interior on his idea that we have to figure out where \nthe transmission lines are going to run.\n  This bill goes against exactly his testimony before your committee \nyesterday. Because what he said was, we need to plan ahead where the \ntransmission lines are going to go. We need to know that before we \nblock off anything else. That was the implication of his testimony.\n  For these renewable energy sites to succeed, we need to work closely \nwith other agencies, States, tribes, and interested communities to \ndetermine what electric transmission infrastructure and corridors are \nneeded and appropriate to deliver the renewable resources to major \npopulation centers. Our own Secretary of the Interior, our former \ncolleague, says we have the cart before the horse.\n  What we heard in opposition to the first amendment, No. 680, is a \ncontinued slight to the American people in terms of taking care of the \nproperties we have. Now, the GAO says, and the IG of the Department of \nthe Interior, it is somewhere between $12 and $19 billion in backlog.\n  What we hear is nobody wants to put a priority in taking care of what \nwe have. What we want to do is build more new and let what we have \ncrumble. The last thing we should be doing is building something new \nuntil we take care of what we have. Go to any of our national parks and \ntalk to the people who are in charge of the maintenance and they will \ntell you: Congress never gives us the money to take care of it. And it \nis growing at $1 billion a year in terms of backlog.\n  I understand the chairman's reluctance to accept these amendments. I \nrespect him greatly. But we are going to continue on doing what we have \nbeen doing, which is a shame looking at our national parks.\n  I have not even talked seriously about the backlog at the Forest \nService. So if we want to deny the amendment to not start new \nconstruction unless the Secretary certifies it is something for safety \nor that it would, in fact, help us build something that would cost more \nto fix than to repair, then we are going to keep on allowing this \nbacklog to grow. That is exactly what this bill does. This amendment is \nnot trying to stop or play any games, it is saying, let's catch up with \nthe real need we have in our parks now. Let's catch up with the needs \non the National Mall. Let's catch up with the $200 million backlog at \nthe Statue of Liberty. No, we are not going to do that. We are going to \nauthorize all these new programs. Then we are going to fund the new \nprograms because we look better doing it than taking care of the very \nvaluable assets we have.\n  I disagree with my colleague from New Mexico on the importance and \nthe intention of that amendment. The amendment is to cause us to focus \non priorities which this body has not. One of the reasons we have not \nis because we do not have my other amendment\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\nsaying we need a list of what we have, where we have it, what the \nproblems are, and what the backlogs are.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              2010 Budget\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I had an opportunity to \naddress my colleagues on my concerns with the budget sent to us by \nPresident Obama, a bloated budget crawling with tax increases. Today, I \nwould like to be more specific in that discussion.\n  Almost 3 weeks ago, President Obama sent his first budget up to \nCapitol Hill. The deficit and debt proposed in that budget are eye-\npopping. President Obama is correct when he says he inherited a record \nbudget deficit of $1.2 trillion. Let me repeat that because this \nSenator and the Senator from Idaho are willing to be very transparent \non what the numbers are. You do not argue with them.\n  I can say we agree with what President Obama said, that he inherited \na record budget deficit of $1.2 trillion. This is a chart that shows \nthe pattern of Federal deficits over the past few years. We go out to \nthe year 2019 because the Congressional Budget Office always looks \nahead in their projections. You can see what those deficits are--\nobviously, very high where we are right now because of the recession we \nare in and things of that nature.\n  But from the talk around here, especially the talk from the \nCongressional Democratic leadership, you would think they got majority \npower just this January, 2 months ago. You would think there was no \nrole of the Democratic Party in creating deficits that President Obama \ninherited. Now we even have some in the administration who are joining \nthis chorus. A very smart guy, a guy we all ought to respect for his \nunderstanding of economics, former Treasury Secretary Summers, now \nDirector of the National Economic Council, said Sunday on a news show \nthat a Republican President--and emphasis upon Republican Congress--had \nleft President Obama with this inherited deficit.\n  Well, I am sure Senator McConnell would have liked to have been \nmajority leader, but he would be glad to correct Dr. Summers and let \nhim know he was not majority leader but was minority leader during the \nyears of 2007 and 2008.\n  Likewise, Congressman Boehner, though he would like to be Speaker, \nwas not Speaker. He would be glad to point out he was leader of the \nminority, the Republicans, within the minority in the House and not \nSpeaker during 2007 and 2008.\n  So the correction comes from the fact that Congressional Democrats \nand the last Republican administration agreed on the fiscal policy in \nthe last Congress. The Congress, namely the Democratic leadership, \ntogether with former President George W. Bush and that administration, \nwrote the stimulus bill, wrote the housing bills, and had a great deal \nto do with financial bailouts.\n  The congressional Democratic leadership wrote the budgets and the \nspending bills of 2007 and 2008. So we need to set the facts straight. \nPresident Obama did, as I said twice--I will say again--inherit the \ndeficit and debt. But--and a very important ``but''--the inheritance \nhad bipartisan origins, the Democratic Congress, on the one hand, and a \nRepublican President on the other hand.\n  Now, what is more, the budget the President sent up would make this \nextraordinary level of debt an ordinary level of debt.\n  We have to think about the budget coming up because this is budget \nmonth. These issues are going to be driven home to the people. We have \nan extraordinary level of debt in this budget. It soon may look like an \nordinary level of debt, and it will be. What is now an extraordinary \nburden on our children and grandchildren would become an ordinary \nburden.\n  I have a chart that shows this inherited debt. The inherited debt \nmeaning what was inherited by this administration on the day they were \nsworn into office, January 20 of this year, is here. This black line is \nthe percentage of gross national product. This is real dollars. So you \nsee by 2019 how it grows and how it still is very big debt. But this \ninherited debt is not a pretty picture. But the picture gets uglier \nbecause in the last year of the budget, meaning the budget the \nPresident sent up here, debt held by the public would be two-thirds, 67 \npercent, of our gross national product. In other words, what was \ninherited has the national debt coming down to about 42 percent of \ngross national product, but what is happening from this point on with \nthe budget we have, this black line will come up here at 67 percent. \nThat is the legacy of this budget.\n  That number assumes also the return of a healthy economy, which we \nall hope happens. I suppose most Presidents would assume a healthy \neconomy, but it is not a certainty. That means President Obama's budget \nassumes that a prosperous United States will carry the debt to more \nthan two-thirds of the gross national product as we look out 10 years \nahead, and the Congressional Budget Office does that on an automatic \nbasis. That number, if the economy is healthy, will be 67 percent, \nright here, that black line. If the budget is not as healthy as what \nthey project then, of course, that black line will be higher than 67 \npercent.\n  In terms of proposed tax policy, the President's budget does contain \nsome common ground. If President Obama wants to pursue tax relief, he \nwill find no better ally than we Republicans. If President Obama wants \nto embrace fiscal responsibility and reduce the deficit by cutting \nwasteful spending, Republicans on Capitol Hill will have his back. From \nour perspective, good fiscal policy keeps the tax burden low on \nAmerican families, workers and small businesses and keeps wasteful \nspending in check. For the hard-working American taxpayers, there is \nsome good news in this budget. President Obama's budget proposes to \nmake permanent about 80 percent of the bipartisan tax relief plans set \nto expire in less than 2 years. For 8 long years, Republicans have \ntried to make this bipartisan tax relief permanent. Now the Democratic \nleadership seems to have seen some of that light. They now agree with \nus Republicans that families should be able to count on marriage \npenalty relief, on a double child tax credit. Democratic leaders now \nseem to agree with decisions that were in the bipartisan tax bill of \n2003, agree with us Republicans that low-income seniors who rely on \ncapital gains and dividend income will be able to rely on low rates of \ntaxation as they draw on their savings.\n  Democratic leaders now agree with Republicans that middle-income \nfamilies will be able to count on relief from the alternative minimum \ntax. They were never supposed to be taxed in the first place, but it is \nnot indexed. So they would agree that we protect middle-class taxpayers \nfrom the AMT which was not indexed. President Obama will find many \nRepublican allies in his efforts to make these tax relief policies \npermanent.\n  I wish the budget I am referring to, the budget that came to the Hill \na couple weeks ago, was as taxpayer friendly, but it is not. There is a \nlot of bad news for American taxpayers. If you put gas in a car, heat \nor cool your home, use electricity to cook a meal, turn on the lights, \npower a computer, there is a new energy tax for you in the budget from \nthe President. This tax would exceed a trillion dollars. I better say \n``could'' exceed because the figure in the budget is less than that, \nbut most everybody around here thinks it is going to be over a trillion \ndollars.\n  This budget also raises taxes on those making more than $250,000. \nThat sounds like a lot of money to most Americans. If we were only \ntalking about the idle rich, maybe the news wouldn't be so bad. But we \nare not talking about coupon clippers on Park Avenue. We are not \ntalking about the high-paid, corporate jet-flying, well-paid hedge fund \nmanagers in Chicago, San Francisco or other high-income, liberal \nmeccas. Many of the Americans targeted for this hefty tax hike are \nsuccessful small business owners. Unlike the financial engineers of the \nflush, liberal meccas of New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, a lot of \nthese small businesses add value beyond just shuffling paper. There is \nbipartisan agreement that small business and all these businesses are \nthe main drivers\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\nof our dynamic economy. Small businesses create 74 percent of all new \nprivate sector jobs, according to latest statistics. On Monday, my \nPresident, President Obama, used a similar figure of 70 percent. \nWhether it is 70 or 74 percent, it means the vast majority of small \nbusinesses create most of the new jobs in America. They are the \nemployment machine. Both sides agree we ought to not hurt key job \nproducers that small businesses are.\n  President Obama also mentioned his zero capital gains proposal for \nsmall business startups. It might surprise you, but we Republicans \nagree with President Obama on that issue. We are still trying to figure \nout why Democratic leadership doesn't agree with the President on that \nsmall business-friendly proposal, because we tried to get a better \nproposal in the stimulus bill. If we also agree that small business is \nthe key to creating new jobs, why does the Democratic leadership and \nthe President's budget propose a new tax increase directed at these \nsmall businesses of America that are most likely to create new jobs? \nWait a minute, please. Many on the left side of the political spectrum \nsay only 2 or 3 percent of the small businesses are affected by this \ntax increase. That figure was developed by a think tank, and it is \nbased on a microsimulation model. Treasury studies show the figure to \nbe considerably higher. But to focus solely on the filer percentage is \nto miss the forest for the trees. It is to assume that all small \nbusinesses have the same level of activity, that they employ the same \nworkers, that they buy the same number of machines, that they make the \nsame number of sales. Common sense has to prevail, and common sense \nwill tell you that can't be the case.\n  In fact, it is not the case. The data on small business activity \ntells a different story. I come to that conclusion this way. According \nto a recent Gallup survey, over half the small business owners \nemploying over 20 workers would pay higher taxes under the President's \nbudget. This chart depicts the number of small businesses hit by this \ntax increase. We point to different levels of employment of small \nbusiness being affected by this. We get to a point out here where we \nhave 950,000 businesses, one-sixth of small businesses, with 1 to 499 \nemployees are hit by it. Do we want to destroy that employment machine? \nI don't think so. But this tax proposal will do that.\n  I have another chart that shows that roughly half the firms that \nemploy two-thirds of small business workers, those with 20 or more \nworkers, are hit by the tax rate hikes in the President's budget. I \nwill not go through all of them, but we can see here, 50 percent of the \nemployers with employees of somewhere between 20 and 499 are hit by \nthat big, fat tax increase.\n  According to Treasury Department data, not mine, these small \nbusinesses account for nearly 70 percent of small business income. So \nthere is a big tax hit on small businesses that employ 20 or more \nworkers. It is a marginal tax rate increase of 20 percent. Everybody, \nDemocrat or Republican, ought to think about how these dynamic small \nbusinesses, responsible for two-thirds of small businesses, will react. \nThat 20 percent in new taxes has to come from somewhere.\n  We Republicans will also scrutinize the budget for other major new \ntaxes. We have discussed the new cutbacks on itemized deductions. I am \nreferring to home mortgage interest, charities and State and local \ntaxes. We Republicans will question a broad-based energy tax that \nactually cuts jobs and could, according to the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology, cost consumers and businesses trillions.\n  In these troubled economic times, we ought to err on the side of \nkeeping taxes and spending low and reduce the deficit. Keeping taxes \nand spending low, along with reversing the growth in Federal debt, will \npush the economy back to growth. It is the only way we will provide \nmore opportunities for all Americans.\n  Getting our private sector going, making small business strong is the \nbasis for getting out of this recession and continuing to grow. I hope \nthroughout this process of the budget debate, we will remember a firm \nfact that ought to be common sense, but I am not sure in this town it \nis seen as common sense: Government does not create wealth. Government \nconsumes wealth.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to my friend from Idaho as he gives \nhis version of the budget. He is an outstanding member of our Finance \nCommittee, and I appreciate his work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The senior Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor this morning and \njoin with my colleague, Senator Grassley from Iowa, who is the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee. It is truly a pleasure to serve with \nhim on that committee. He is one of those who, day in and day out, year \nin and year out, fights for fiscal responsibility at the Federal level. \nI appreciate his support and share in the comments he has made already \ntoday.\n  I wish to start my remarks by talking about a meeting I had this \nmorning in my office with a couple of mayors from two Idaho cities and \na number of young students whom they brought with them from their \nrespective cities to come to Washington, DC. These two mayors have \nestablished a mayor's council of students in their cities and work with \nthese students on public issues and help these young people find an \neffective way to be active and involved.\n  As they came to visit with me today, they brought up two issues. The \nfirst issue they brought up was the alarming rate of high school \ndropouts and the need for us to pay attention to our educational \nsystem. They talked with me about a number of interesting ideas we \nshould pursue as we try to regain America's lead in excellence in \neducation. I am going to have more to say about that on the floor and \nin other contexts on another day.\n  But I thought it was very interesting; the second issue they brought \nup with me was directly relevant to the remarks I planned to make on \nthe floor today; that is, they brought me a set of petitions--I am \nholding them in my hand right now--with the signatures of about 400 \nstudents in Idaho, whom I think properly reflect many, many, more than \nthey, who have asked that we pay attention to our national debt and our \ninability--our inability in Congress--to achieve fiscal responsibility.\n  These young people said what I and many others have been saying, only \nthey said it best; that is, that our inability to control our fiscal \nhouse here in Washington, DC, is jeopardizing their future and it is \njeopardizing their children's future and their children's future.\n  Now, we often say that on the floor, but I had the opportunity today \nto meet with these young people who looked me in the eye and asked me \nto do everything I can to help protect them from what they see \nhappening as a result of a runaway Congress and a runaway spending plan \nin this Congress that will specifically fall on their shoulders to \nbear.\n  Well, they talked with me about things such as who owns our national \ndebt. They pointed out, as most Americans are starting to realize, that \nforeign nations own most of our national debt, which raises additional \nthreats to our security.\n  Today, China and Japan are the primary holders of our national debt. \nAs I think many Americans have noted recently, the Chinese are starting \nto wonder whether this investment in U.S. debt instruments is a viable \ninvestment because of the spending policies of our Nation.\n  Well, I am here to talk about the budget that this Senate and this \nCongress are now beginning to consider. In addition to sitting on the \nFinance Committee, I sit on the Budget Committee. In the next few \nweeks, the Budget Committee is going to begin its deliberations on the \nbudget the President has submitted to us.\n  Every year, the President submits to Congress a budget. I do not \nthink in any year I have served in Congress has the Congress actually \nadopted the exact budget the President has proposed. But the \nPresident's budget proposal acts as a guide from which the Congress \nthen crafts its own budget.\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n  I believe this year Congress must be very careful in following the \nproposals or using as a model or a guide the budget which we have been \ngiven.\n  As shown on this chart, the budget that has been proposed to us will \nincrease taxes by approximately $1.4 trillion. This number is hard to \nget at because we do not have the details yet. The reason I say that is \nbecause many--including myself--believe that is a very low number in \nterms of the actual amount of the tax increases. I will explain that in \na moment.\n  It increases discretionary spending by $725 billion. These are 10-\nyear numbers. As my colleague from Iowa said, the budgets project out \nover a 10-year cycle, and it increases mandatory spending by $1.2 \ntrillion.\n  If you look at the spending side of this for a minute--for those who \ndo not pay attention to our discussion of different pieces of the \nbudget here in Washington, mandatory spending generally is spending \nthat previous Congresses and previous Presidents have already debated, \npassed into law, and signed into law and is ongoing. I call it spending \nthat is on autopilot because this spending will happen regardless of \nwhether Congress ever votes or meets again. It is law, and regardless \nof the status of the economy, regardless of the demographics of our \nNation and what is happening in the world in which we are living today, \nthe law requires this spending occur. It is what often we call \nentitlement spending--``entitlement'' because the law has created an \nentitlement, and if a person qualifies in a certain way, they are \nentitled to receive payment under the law.\n  Now, the vast majority of this entitlement spending, as most people \nknow, is Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. There are other \nentitlement laws, mandatory spending laws, in the United States, but \nthe vast majority--the vastly largest percentage--are Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security. Also added into this category of \nmandatory spending is interest on the national debt because that also \nmust be paid.\n  So you can think of the mandatory spending or autopilot spending as \nbasically this column here, as shown on the chart, that represents \nabout two-thirds--roughly, about two-thirds--of all the spending in \neach year's average budget.\n  The discretionary spending is everything else. That is what we \nactually vote on in Congress every year in our appropriations process. \nAs I have said, it is roughly about a third of our budget. That \nspending can also be divided roughly in half. Approximately half of it \nis national defense and security spending; and approximately half of it \nis everything other than defense. So you often hear us talk about \nnondefense discretionary spending. That is what we are talking about: \nthe things Congress actually votes on every year.\n  Together, our discretionary spending and our mandatory spending are \nthe spending side of our budget. As you can see on this chart, we are \nproposing in both categories dramatic increases over the next 10 years. \nThe fiscal restraint is not there. At a time when Americans are \ntightening their belts, this budget grows the size of Government by 9 \npercent--9-percent growth for nondefense programs in just the year 2010 \nalone. If you go back to the 2009 budget we adopted and finalized in \nour appropriations process in this Congress and add the growth there \ninto it as well, you will see a 20-percent growth--a 20-percent \ngrowth--in our nondefense spending in this country since the year 2008.\n  The fiscal restraint is lacking in this budget proposal. In fact, \nthere is only one category of this budget in which there is any actual \nreduction in spending, and that is in the defense side of the ledger. \nThere are actual proposed reductions in defense spending in the \nPresident's budget. But only in that category.\n  If we look at the tax side for a moment, you can see there is $1.4 \ntrillion of new taxes. As I said a minute ago, that number is kind of \nhard to quantify. Why is that hard to quantify?\n  Well, the President has said his tax policies would reduce taxes for \n95 percent of American taxpayers. That statement can only be accurate \nif you only look at one kind of tax; namely, income taxes. I believe it \nis correct that in the income tax category, there will not be an \nincrease for the vast majority of Americans, and, in fact, for \nmost Americans we might actually see a reduction.\n\n  But if you look at all the other proposals for tax increases and tax \nadjustments in the President's budget, you see there is going to be a \nhuge increase in tax payments by Americans in every category of income \nin this country.\n  Those taxes include things such as a brandnew--and this is the part \nthat makes it difficult to give a final number--a brandnew tax on \nenergy. It is part of what some have called the cap-and-trade proposal \nthe President has made on carbon fuels. Others have called it a cap-\nand-tax approach.\n  The point, however, is, under this new energy proposal, somewhere \nbetween $600 billion and $2 trillion of new cost will be put on carbon-\nemitting energy sources, and Americans will pay those increased costs, \nprimarily in their utility bills. The President himself has said this \nproposal would cause electricity rates to skyrocket. We do not know \nexactly to what level, but everyone who uses electricity, everyone who \npumps gas at the gas station, everyone who uses natural gas can expect \nto see--and we do not know the details yet, which is why we cannot give \nthe details on the numbers, but they can expect to see significantly \nincreased costs for them in their household budgets.\n  Now, some would say that is not a tax. That is just a fee or it is \njust an increase in the price of your electricity as a result of some \nnational policies. But however you say it, the fact is, there is a \nprojected revenue to the Federal Treasury to come from people who will \npay more on their electricity bills and pay more on their gasoline and \nother fuel bills that will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 \ntrillion. Many of us think it is going to be closer to $2 trillion.\n  The list goes on.\n  It is proposed the capital gains and dividends tax rates go up. Some \nargue that only hurts wealthy people. In fact, the argument made on \nthis floor so often is: Any tax increase is justified as being a tax \nincrease on only the wealthy. Well, if you look at dividends and \ncapital gains and look at the kinds of people in this country who own \nstock, either in their own individual account or through a pension \nfund, it reaches far deeper than just the wealthy. The people who are \nimpacted day in and day out by having to pay tax on dividends and \ncapital gains are far more people than simply those who are the so-\ncalled wealthy.\n  The list goes on.\n  The bottom line is, the budget will raise taxes by about $1.4 \ntrillion and raise spending--both in discretionary and mandatory \nlevels--a greater amount.\n  Now let me look at this last category shown on the chart. It is \ncalled mandatory savings. The number there is zero. Now, why do we have \nthat column? In order to change--remember the law I told you about \nearlier: The entitlement programs are already the law. If we are going \nto change and gain savings in this category of mandatory spending, we \nhave to literally vote to change the law. It takes 60 votes in the \nSenate to do that because we always face a filibuster when we try to \nfind savings in this category of entitlement spending.\n  But in the budget proposal the Budget Committee will put forward, the \nBudget Committee is allowed to propose that there be savings here. And \nthen, if the Budget Committee can get that proposal adopted in the \nbudget, our respective committees of jurisdiction in the areas where \nthe entitlements lie are required by the budget to find those savings \nand make law-change proposals to Congress so we can achieve some \nsavings.\n  The reason I have this column on the chart is because in the budget \nthat has been proposed, there are no savings proposed. There is not \neven a request that $1 of savings be found in the entire entitlement \nsystem. That is wrong also.\n  Now, let's go to the next chart.\n  This is a chart that shows the deficits we expect to face--not the \nnational debt but the deficits, the yearly deficits we expect to face. \nThat means the amount of money we will spend beyond our projected \nrevenue.\n  The blue line, as shown on the chart, is what we call the BEA \nbaseline. What that means is that is current law. If we do not change \nany law and do not do\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\nanything in Congress and do not put any more increased spending into \nplace, what would our deficits look like? We can see there is a big \nspike here, in about 2009 and 2010, and then it drops off dramatically. \nUnder current law, it tails down rather dramatically over the next 10 \nyears.\n\n  Now, one of the reasons it goes down so dramatically over the next 10 \nyears is that we have a number of tax cuts that were passed in the 2001 \nand 2003 timeframe that are going to expire, which means if we do \nnothing, taxes are going to go up dramatically, and we are going to see \nthe deficit drop dramatically because everybody is going to be paying a \nlot more taxes. If we allow those tax cuts to stay in place--and I \nbelieve we are starting to get some consensus that we do that--then \nthis line for what current law would be with those tax cuts staying in \nplace would be somewhere between the red line and the blue line.\n  The point I wish to make, though, is the red line is the proposed \nbudget we are now dealing with. As my colleagues can see, the spending \nin excess of revenue is dramatically higher than current law under the \nproposed budget.\n  There is another point that needs to be made, and I think this point \nshows it as well as anything. The President has said his goal is to \nreduce the deficit by half in the next 4 to 5 years, but as my \ncolleagues can see by the chart, that will happen anyway under current \nlaw.\n  Now, why will that happen anyway under current law? That will happen \nanyway under current law because this spike we are looking at is the \nresult of the phenomenal spending spree that Congress has been on since \nlast fall. Actually, even going into the spring of last year, you may \nrecall that Congress, to stimulate the economy, passed a $158 billion \nbill, I think it was, for rebate checks, to send rebate checks out to \nAmericans so they could stimulate the economy. Well, we have seen that \nthose checks didn't actually stimulate the economy, but it did add $158 \nbillion to our spending.\n  Then we had the $700 billion TARP bill, $350 billion under President \nBush and $350 billion under President Obama. We had the $800 billion \nstimulus package, much of which we will be spending out in this \ntimeframe. We have had the auto bailout, and actually part of it--most \nof it, so far--has come from the TARP dollars. But we are seeing a \nspending spree by Congress which is driving these deficits up \ndramatically over the next 2 years.\n  But assuming--and this is an important assumption--assuming Congress \ndoes not continue this pattern of bailouts and Congress does not \ncontinue this pattern of $800 billion stimulus spending bills, then we \nshould see this spending rate of Congress drop back down. So assuming \nCongress doesn't continue this rampant spending spree it is on, the \ndeficit will return itself to half without any real effort and, in \nfact, without any real cuts in spending.\n  The last thing this chart shows that is very notable is, in the \noutyears--again, current law starts seeing us get our deficit under \ncontrol, but the proposed budget starts us growing this deficit and \nleaves it at a permanent level around $600 billion. We are dealing with \na proposed budget that leaves America with a proposed ongoing and \ngrowing deficit for the indefinite future of about $600 billion. That \nis not good enough. We need to be following a line on our deficit that \nbrings us toward balance, and we can't do that. We can't achieve that.\n  One last point: We had Secretary Geithner before our Budget Committee \nlast week to talk about this budget. In his comments, Secretary \nGeithner acknowledged that the tax increases that are being proposed--\nthe ones I had on the previous chart--are going to actually harm our \neconomy in our effort to build back right now. He acknowledged the \npoint that this is the wrong time to be increasing taxes and that taxes \nat this time would have a chilling effect on our ability to restimulate \nour economic activity. But he defended these tax increase proposals by \nsaying that they are not projected to take place until the year 2011, \nat which point the economy is supposed to be back in good shape. \nTherefore, we can let the economy get healthy again, and then we can \nhit it with some tax increases and then it will be OK.\n  Well, first of all, I don't believe it is necessarily going to be OK \nto hit the economy as it is starting to stabilize again in 2011, even \nif it is starting to stabilize at that point. But there is no consensus \nthat we will be out of this difficulty by that time. So I asked \nSecretary Geithner: If the economy is not strong by 2011, will you \nstill push for these tax cuts--increases--or are these tax increases \ncontingent on a strong economy? In other words, if we don't have the \nstrength you are projecting we will have, will you still propose the \ntax increases? He ducked the question.\n  I think the reason he ducked the question is because the answer was, \nyes; the taxes are going to go up regardless of what happens with the \neconomy, and we are just hoping and projecting that we are not going to \nhave any problem there because we think the economy is going to be fine \nin 2011.\n  Well, I certainly hope the economy is fine in 2011, and I don't think \nthat will be a good time to hit it with a huge tax burden again anyway, \nbut it is clearly wrong to put into place a path toward tax increases \nwhen we don't know whether the economy is going to remain strong.\n  Let's put up the last chart. The last chart just shows the debt we \nare growing. The chart before was deficits. The debt is the \naccumulation of all of our deficits over time. You will see right in \nhere and around the 2009 timeframe, we were at around $6 trillion--\nactually, it was growing up into the $7 trillion and $8 trillion level, \nand Congress is starting a spending spike that is starting to drive up \nour national debt. It is hard to get a handle on our national debt \nright now, but it is between $10 trillion and $11 trillion. It is \nprojected that our national debt--excuse me, the debt held by the \npublic, and there are different pieces of the debt--but the debt held \nby the public--that is the debt we talk about when we talk about China \nand Japan and other nations buying our bonds and pension plans and so \nforth. The debt held by the public under this proposed budget will \ndouble in 5 years and triple in 10 years. That is remarkable and it is \nscary that we could have a budget that proposes a wall of debt like \nthis and does not put into place any kind of spending restraint \nproposals but adds increased taxes, which will make it harder for our \neconomy to keep up with this spending level, and proposes no effort to \naddress the entitlement growth that is probably the biggest driver of \nspending in the Federal budget.\n  I guess I should clarify that--the biggest driver except when \nCongress gets engaged in stimulus packages and bailouts, at which point \nCongress becomes the biggest driver. But assuming we can stop the \ntendency in Congress to spend as rapidly as we have been doing over the \nlast 6 months, then we must turn our attention to the entitlement \nprograms and begin to find a way to find savings in them.\n  So I will conclude with this: Many have said on this floor that this \nbudget spends too much, taxes too much, and results in too much debt. \nIt couldn't be said more succinctly or better. This budget jeopardizes \nthe economic strength of our Nation. It taxes far too much, it spends \nfar too much, and it leaves us with a legacy of debt that our children \nand our grandchildren will face to their detriment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I have been listening to Senator \nCrapo's remarks, and I think he has made some excellent points. The \nSenator is pointing out the long-term consequences of this incredible \nspending proposal that has been put before us on top of two incredible \nspending proposals that we have passed in the last month in this \nCongress. So I do hope the people of America start looking at the long-\nterm effects of this spending increase at a time when our economy is \nseriously in jeopardy. I hope we can stop it at the budget and start \nshowing the American people that we know everyone is concerned about \ntheir future. Everyone is concerned about their jobs, their retirement. \nWe need to act accordingly in Congress; and that is, to spend taxpayer \ndollars wisely and not continue to borrow as we have been just in the \nlast 2 months. It is going to be a spiral that I don't know how we \novercome. So we have to start overcoming it right now, and that is with \nthe budget proposal that has been put before us.\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Coburn Amendments\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nthree amendments filed by Senator Coburn that we are going to be voting \non shortly to the omnibus lands package.\n  With this country in the dire economic straits we are in, with the \nhousing market crumbling, and with all of the major issues we have on \nour plate, I am not sure I understand why we are here dealing with a \nlands package today but, more importantly, why we are dealing with this \nlands package.\n  This omnibus lands package is truly antistimulus because it will \nerect new barriers to energy exploration and squander billions of \ntaxpayer dollars on low-priority, parochial programs and frivolous \nearmarks.\n  The bill is another direct challenge from Congress to President \nObama's pledge to clean up the earmark process. Last week, the \nPresident pledged to eliminate earmarks that didn't serve a legitimate \npurpose. He also said that each earmark must be scrutinized at public \nhearings. None of the individual earmarks in this bill were subject to \npublic hearings, nor would many Americans describe earmarks such as a \n$3.5 million birthday bash for St. Augustine, FL, a legitimate public \npurpose.\n  The omnibus lands bill should be subject to a full and open amendment \nprocess. For months, the leader on the other side has argued that the \nbill is ``noncontroversial'' and should pass by a voice vote, with no \namendments and no recorded rollcall votes. Yet, last week, 144 Members \nof the House of Representatives voted against the bill because it does \nneed major revision. More than 100 organizations, ranging from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce to the National Wildlife Refuge Association, have \nexpressed their opposition to this package.\n  The bill blocks the development of both renewable and oil and gas \nenergy resources--one of the critical issues we are still facing in \nthis country even with the price of a barrel of oil down and the price \nof a cubic foot of natural gas down. But they are not going to stay \ndown. One bill in the package locks up at least 8.8 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas and more than 300 million barrels of oil in a single \nfield, which is equal to nearly twice as much natural gas as all \nAmericans use in a year. All of that will be off limits at a time when \nwe are seeking to take advantage of our natural resources in this \ncountry. The bill includes 92 National Wild and Scenic Rivers \ndesignations, covering over 1,100 miles that will prohibit any pipeline \nor transmission crossing. In 19 cases, the bill permanently withdraws \nFederal lands from future mineral and geothermal leasing.\n  Since the Senate last considered the lands bill, Secretary Salazar \nhas withdrawn major energy leases in both Utah and Wyoming that were \nthe subject of a coordinated lawsuit brought by extreme anti-energy \ngroups.\n  The three amendments we are going to be voting on do three basic \nthings to try to improve this package. First, amendment No. 679 strikes \nprovisions that restrict the development of renewable energy on public \nlands, including but not limited to geothermal, wind, solar, biomass, \nand related transmission infrastructure. Amendment No. 680 bars new \nconstruction until all current sites are certified by the Secretary as \nfully operational, ensuring full access by the public and posing no \nhealth or safety threat. The National Park Service is currently facing \na $10 billion maintenance backlog. Yet we are going to be adding to \ntheir inventory. The third amendment prohibits the use of eminent \ndomain for any provision authorized in the bill.\n  These are basic, commonsense amendments that ought to be supported by \neverybody here. If we are going to have this lands package debated and \nvoted on--and, again, I am not clear as to exactly why we are dealing \nwith this in the middle of our other crises--certainly we ought to make \ncommonsense amendments applicable to basic provisions in this huge \npackage that is going to be the most major acquisition of lands by the \nFederal Government, which is already the largest landowner in our \ncountry over the last two decades.\n  With that, I urge adoption of the Coburn amendments on which we are \ngetting ready to vote.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

Mr. President, the amendment we are going to be voting on \nnext is amendment No. 680. If my colleagues have not read the GAO \nreport on the Department of Interior released this month, they should \nas they consider this.\n  The national parks have--according to the national parks--a $9 \nbillion backlog. According to the GAO, it is\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\nsomewhere between $13 billion and $19 billion. This amendment is not \nintended to do anything except cause us to order a priority that we \nwill take care of what we have now before we spend new money on new \nparks and new areas under the Department of the Interior. It is simple. \nIt is straightforward. There is nothing underhanded about it.\n  The fact is, we cannot continue adding things when we are not taking \ncare of the Statute of Liberty, the National Mall, and many of our \nnational parks that are falling down and are a threat to health and \nsafety of the visitors and the employees who work there.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will take the first minute, and my \ncolleague from Alaska will take the second minute.\n  This amendment would prohibit the National Park Service from \nbeginning any new construction in national parks until the Secretary of \nthe Interior can certify that the backlog of maintenance in all \nstructures, trails, sites and transportation infrastructure has all \nbeen accomplished. I would argue he or she will never be able to \ncertify that; therefore, we could not have new construction in our \nnational parks. This would apply to funds we have already appropriated, \nincluding those in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that we \nvoted on a couple of weeks ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and at the appropriate \ntime I will move to table the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. In addition to what the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee has stated, we may be in a situation where you have a newly \nacquired national park or national historic facility and this amendment \nwould prevent the Director of the Park Service from even putting in new \nfacilities until the maintenance backlog is completed in older existing \npark units. It could also force the agency to expend funds on \nfacilities they no longer need, such as trails or buildings that the \nagency would like to remove.\n  I think this is a well-intended amendment, but I believe it misses \nthe mark by placing restrictions that could hamstring the National Park \nService's effort to provide high-quality recreational opportunities, \nand I urge opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this does not limit the ability of the \nNational Park Service to consider something they do not want to repair. \nIn fact, there is an exact exemption in this amendment for that.\n  We are going to do the same thing. We are not going to take care of \nwhat we have and we are going to spend money on new things and we are \ngoing to put the employees and the people of this country at risk. \nLet's take care of what we have.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to table that motion.\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 679\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on amendment No. 679 offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is another amendment, the whole \npurpose of which is to think forward not think short term. What we are \ngoing to do in this collage of 170 bills is restrict, significantly \nrestrict, the availability of geothermal, solar, wind, and biomass \nenergy.\n  We are doing that because we are going to limit the places where we \ncan get that. Ninety percent of the geothermal capability in this \ncountry lies on Federal lands. What we are doing in this bill is not \nthinking about what we are going to do on transmission lines, not \nthinking how we are going to bring solar, wind, and geothermal, as well \nas biomass, to the population centers of this country.\n  Yesterday, the Secretary of the Interior outlined, in his testimony \nbefore the committee, the importance of getting transmission lines and \ngrids right in anticipation of having this access for renewable energy \nthat is clean and without a significant carbon footprint.\n  All this amendment does is say we are not going to allow it to \nprohibit our utilization of geothermal, our utilization of solar, and \nour utilization of wind by what we are doing in the bill.\n  So everything else stays the same, but we are not going to handicap \nourselves and handcuff ourselves by eliminating the ability to gather \nthese energy sources off these lands.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment as well. This \nwould open the wilderness areas, the parks, and the wild and scenic \nrivers that are designated in the bill to potential development of new \nenergy projects, renewable energy projects, as well as the associated \nfacilities that go with those such as transmission lines, generating \nstations, access roads.\n  There are 2 million acres of new wilderness area here. We do not want \nwind farms in those wilderness areas. There are over 1,000 miles of \nwild and scenic rivers. We do not want hydroelectric powerplants on \nthose wild and scenic rivers. I think this would be a major mistake for \nus to make an exception and say that renewable energy sources should go \nin regardless of the designation in the bill.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I make a point that is worth mentioning \nthat Senators may have forgotten. The 1964 Wilderness Act includes a \nprovision that allows the President may declare an emergency and allow \n``water resources, reservoirs, water construction work, power plants, \ntransmission lines and other facilities needed in the public interest, \nincluding road construction and maintenance essential to develop and \nuse thereof.''\n  So, therefore, other than a handful of declared wilderness areas in \nColorado and Nevada, this protection is included in the law \nestablishing every wilderness, including those in this bill. Therefore, \nI do not think there is a reason we need the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what we are doing in this country is we \nare shutting off oil and gas energy that we\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nare going to need for the next 20 years. Now we are going to handicap \nthe renewable, clean energy that is in the bill.\n  I disagree that the President has the ability only under an extreme \nnational emergency. Well, we have an emergency right now and nobody is \ndoing that. What we ought to do is make sure we do not limit further \nenergy potential for this country. We are going to see petroleum prices \nrise. We are going to see energy costs double in the future.\n  This will eliminate some of that.\n  I yield back the time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                  Senator Lugar Casts Vote No. 12,000\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader and I would like to \nmake a few brief comments before this last vote in the tranche of votes \nwe are having at the moment.\n  It is customary in the Senate to acknowledge one's colleagues on the \noccasion of a major legislative milestone, and so today we honor the \nsenior Senator from Indiana on the occasion of his 12,000th vote. In \nour Nation's history, only 12 individuals have cast more votes in this \nbody than Senator Lugar, and this is well worth noting.\n  But it is a special pleasure to recognize someone who has always been \nso reluctant to speak about himself. Few Americans have more to brag \nabout than Senator Richard Lugar. Yet I know of no one who is less \nlikely to do so. So it is an honor for me to take a moment to brag \nabout my colleague, my neighbor, and my friend.\n  As a measure of Senator Lugar's reputation for bipartisanship, \nhistorians will note that when our current President launched his \nPresidential campaign at the Illinois statehouse 2 years ago, he \nmentioned just one politician by name: Richard Lugar. No one in the \nSenate commands more bipartisan respect.\n  As a measure of Senator Lugar's reputation as a foreign policy \nexpert, ask any television news producer for the first Senator they \nwould think to look to to discuss an important international story. \nThey would, of course, tell you: Richard Lugar.\n  As a measure of Senator Lugar's effectiveness as a lawmaker, just \ntake a look at the results from his last election. During a year in \nwhich Democrats made significant gains in both the House and the \nSenate, Senator Lugar won 87 percent of the vote--a victory so \nconvincing that the State chairman of the Democratic Party in Indiana \nmade the following statement: ``Let's be honest,'' he said, ``Richard \nLugar is beloved not only by Republicans, but by Independents and \nDemocrats.''\n  Never has anyone provided his or her political opponent with a better \nscript for a campaign ad than that--particularly since the comment had \nthe added virtue of being absolutely true.\n  As a measure of my own personal esteem for Senator Lugar, I would \nnote that I have 12 framed photographs in my office in the Capitol \nmarking various points in my own career, dating back to my days as a \ncollege Republican. One of those photographs is a picture of a young \nSenator Lugar helping me in my first Senate campaign. Whenever I see \nit, I am reminded of what a public servant should be.\n  Senator Lugar's life has been one of high achievement: high school \nvaledictorian, a straight-A college student, Eagle Scout, Rhodes \nScholar, big-city mayor at the age of 35, U.S. Senator. He has been a \ncounselor to Presidents and one of the most widely respected voices on \nforeign relations within the Senate for decades. Before he finishes out \nhis current term, he will have served almost twice as long as any \nIndiana Senator before him--a milestone he has approached with \ncharacteristic humility.\n  In a long Senate career, perhaps none of Senator Lugar's achievements \nhas been more far reaching as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperation Threat \nReduction Program, which has led to the dismantling of thousands of \nnuclear warheads and contributed immeasurably to the promotion of \npeace. For this achievement in particular, he has been considered for a \nNobel Peace Prize.\n  But ask Senator Lugar and he will probably tell you his greatest \nachievement was his marriage to Charlene. Senator Lugar was recently \nasked about the demands of his work. Here is what he had to say:\n\n       I've been especially fortunate that my wife, Charlene, has \n     shared my enthusiasm. It would not have been remotely \n     possible if that had not been the case.\n\n  Senator Lugar and Char have been married for more than 50 years. They \nare proud of their four sons and their 13 grandchildren, and they can \nbe proud of the teamwork that has produced a brilliant career, carried \nout in the best traditions of the Senate and of our country.\n  Senator Lugar, you are a treasure to the Senate and a model for \nanyone who wishes to pursue a career in public service.\n  It is an honor and a privilege for me to recognize my esteemed \ncolleague on this latest of so many accomplishments in a truly \ndistinguished Senate career.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Hear, hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hesitate to jump in front of my friend \nfrom Indiana, but I feel I want to say, as I should, a few things about \nSenator Lugar.\n  He is not only the most senior Republican currently serving in the \nSenate, he also will have served twice as long as any other Senator in \nthe history of the State of Indiana, as mentioned by my colleague, \nSenator McConnell.\n  Born in Indianapolis, he spent much of his boyhood focusing on \nthings--as he is able to do--such as on becoming an Eagle Scout, and he \ndid become an Eagle Scout.\n  He graduated first in his class--not just at Shortridge High School \nbut also at Denison University. This is where he met Charlene, his \nwife.\n  Richard Lugar is clearly one of the most intellectually sound Members \nof the Senate. After college, he earned a Rhodes Scholarship to study \nat Oxford University, where he received honors in various programs. He \nreceived honors degrees in politics, philosophy, and economics and was \na member of Phi Beta Kappa. He has also earned honorary degrees from 41 \nuniversities and colleges--41.\n  When Richard Lugar returned from Oxford, he and Charlene were \nmarried.\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\nBut just a few months later, Richard began his 3 years of volunteer \nservice in the U.S. Navy, where he was ultimately assigned as \nintelligence briefer for ADM Arleigh Burke, the Chief of Naval \nOperations.\n  Back home in Indiana, after the Navy, Richard went into business with \nhis brother, running a food machinery manufacturing company, before \nwinning a seat on the school board, and then serving two terms as mayor \nof Indianapolis.\n  In the Senate, Richard Lugar has been a national leader on the \nenvironment, foreign policy, and let's not forget agriculture.\n  He worked closely with then-Senator Obama on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee on the complex challenge of loose nukes.\n  He currently serves as ranking Republican and former chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee and as a member and former chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  Charlene and Richard have four sons: Mark, Robert, John, and David, \nand 14 grandchildren.\n  So, Senator Lugar, congratulations in casting your 12,000th vote as a \nU.S. Senator. This milestone is the latest in a career filled with \nremarkable accomplishments.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Hear, hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank my very dear friends, Mitch \nMcConnell and Harry Reid, for overly generous comments, which give me \ngreat encouragement and inspiration.\n  I appreciate so much the Senate taking time for a moment in my life I \nwill always cherish. I thank you for recognizing the importance of my \nsweetheart, Charlene, and our children and our grandchildren. They are \nthe precious inspiration for me, as it is for each one of us who serves \nin this way and who enjoys and loves the Senate as I do.\n  I thank all of you so very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this will be the last vote in the series of \nvotes of amendments offered by Senator Coburn. There are three other \namendments Senator Coburn has laid down, two of which we will have to \nvote on. On one I think there is agreement on this side it should be \naccepted, and Senator Coburn has acknowledged we would not need a vote \non that. We are going to have those two votes. We are working on the \nappropriate time.\n  Senator Coburn has one more amendment on which he needs to speak. He \nhas already spoken on the others I have mentioned.\n  I tell all Senators, we will likely do these votes when we first come \nin in the morning rather than this afternoon. There are a number of \nhearings and other things going on this afternoon. I think that would \nbe to everyone's advantage.\n  We are also working on a number of nominations we are trying to \ncomplete. We hope we can get those done tomorrow. I do not see any \nreason to do the votes tonight. We will do them in the morning, at a \nvery early time in the morning.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 675\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 675, offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the minority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would ask for my colleagues' attention for \njust a moment.\n  This is a very good amendment. The staff has informed me all the land \nacquisition under this bill has been accomplished through the \ncooperation of all parties--willing sellers, willing buyers--and there \nis no need for condemnation of any property, no need for eminent \ndomain.\n  Believing that to be true, my colleague has simply said, therefore, \nthere will be no eminent domain used to purchase land under this bill; \nin other words, no acquisitions contrary to the wishes of the \nlandowner.\n  Believing the staff is correct, and, therefore, that it is not \nnecessary, it seems to me it establishes a good principle to say that \nwhere there is no need for it, we should not authorize eminent domain \nto acquire land against a landowner's wishes.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, it is important to understand \nthere are no provisions in the bill granting the Federal Government \neminent domain authority. That authority already exists. It has existed \nfor many years. The Supreme Court first recognized it in 1876 and \nacknowledged that the Government had that authority.\n  What I believe is important is that there are water projects in this \nbill which are very important--the San Joaquin project in California, \nvarious water projects throughout the West--and it is important the \nBureau of Reclamation have authority, if it needs to use it, to proceed \nwith eminent domain proceedings.\n  My colleague from Arizona, I am sure, takes great pride in the \nCentral Arizona project. It is very doubtful that project could have \nbeen accomplished had not the Federal Government had eminent domain \nauthority. That is true of these water projects in this legislation as \nwell.\n  So we should not be writing provisions in here that take that tool \naway from our Federal land managers and particularly the Bureau of \nReclamation, and that is exactly what the effect of this amendment \nwould be.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there is eminent domain, and then there is \nthe threat of eminent domain. The threat of eminent domain is as \npowerful as eminent domain in itself because we cause people who have \npure and sincere and guaranteed rights to their property to give up \ntheir property.\n  The fact is, this bill relates to all sorts of statutes that utilize \neminent domain. If, in fact, we do not intend to utilize eminent \ndomain, why won't we say it? We will not say it because we want to use \nthe power of having that to intimidate property owners in this country \nand landowners.\n  This is about protecting one of the most important principles of our \ncountry: the right to have and hold property. This is an issue under \nwhich we either accept the rights of individuals to hold property or we \nsay the Government knows better. Even though we are saying we are not \ngoing to use it, we are going to use it to intimidate landowners.\n  I would appreciate your vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, has an opportunity to be \nrecognized and speak, that Senator Corker be recognized at that point \nand that I then follow him with another unanimous consent recognition, \nand after that moment, Senator McCaskill be recognized to speak for 5 \nminutes, Senator Mikulski for 5 minutes, and Senator Burris for 5 \nminutes.\n  I wish to amend that UC request to include 10 minutes following \nSenator Burris for Senator Sessions and 10 minutes for Senator \nGrassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                    Depositor Protection Act of 2009\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know how important it is to our \nbanking system, and especially our community banks, that the Senate \npass S. 541, the Depositor Protection Act of 2009.\n  This is a bipartisan bill, led by Senators Dodd and Crapo, that we \nincrease the borrowing authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, thereby freeing up capital for banks to lend to small \nbusinesses and people who need it.\n  The Depositor Protection Act is cosponsored by Senators across the \npolitical spectrum, including Senators Schumer, Brown, Akaka, Bond, \nGregg, and Corker, who is here on the floor with us. The fact that it \nhas such diverse support underscores how important it is to our \nfinancial system. This is a bill we should pass without delay. Doing so \nwould help our financial institutions, and thus our economy, during \nthis economic downturn.\n  The bipartisan Dodd-Crapo bill should not be held hostage by efforts \nto attach much more controversial legislation on top of it. \nSpecifically, I understand some of our Democratic colleagues want the \nDodd-Crapo bill to pull to passage a controversial measure called cram-\ndown, which would allow bankruptcy judges to basically rewrite mortgage \ncontracts.\n  Politically and economically, cram-down is the opposite of the Dodd-\nCrapo bill because it has bipartisan opposition; it has bipartisan \nopposition because it would worsen our economic situation. For example, \nlast year, 11 Senate Democrats, along with every single Republican in \nthe Senate, voted against cram-down because its passage would worsen \nhousing markets by raising interest rates for everyone in order to \nbenefit a very few. This, in turn, would make it more difficult for \neveryone, especially those of modest means, to own a home. This is the \nwrong prescription at the wrong time for an ailing housing market. \nThese concerns, of course, have not gone away. This year, some Senate \nDemocrats have publicly reiterated their opposition to cram-down. There \nare no such concerns with the bipartisan Dodd-Crapo Depositor \nProtection Act of 2009. We could pass it right now, Mr. President, on a \nbipartisan basis and help our financial situation.\n  I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle will let us pass \nthis important bill. They should not hold it up so they can chase \nsomething that is fraught with problems and, according to a Senate \nDemocrat, isn't going anywhere anytime soon.\n  I thank in particular one of the most knowledgeable Members of the \nSenate, who is thoroughly conversant with these issues and has \nrecommended this approach, and that is my friend and colleague from \nTennessee, Senator Corker, whom I see is on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 541\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. 541, a Dodd-Crapo bill, which would increase the \nborrowing authority of the FDIC, the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, the bill be read the third time and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to object to this unanimous \nconsent request. The reason is that the provision that has been \nreferred to by Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, relative to \nthe Bankruptcy Code is one that is in negotiation at this very moment.\n  When this measure was called before the Senate last year, there were \nsome who ominously predicted we could be losing some 2 million homes to \nforeclosure in America. The most recent estimate of Goldman Sachs is \nthat 13 million homes will be lost to mortgage foreclosure in the next \n5 years.\n  The efforts underway to revise the bankruptcy law to provide for \nauthority in that court in specialized circumstances is one to prevent \nand preclude these foreclosures from occurring. That is actively under \nconsideration. It is included in the House bill that I will \nsubsequently ask to be approved by unanimous consent, and it is one \nsupported by the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, as \nwell as many others.\n  I would hate to see us lose an opportunity to deal with this looming \nforeclosure crisis by agreeing to this unanimous consent request. I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 541 and H.R. 1106\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 541, the \nDepositor Protection Act, and that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that an amendment at the desk, which contains the \nprovisions of the House-passed bill, H.R. 1106, be agreed to; the bill, \nas amended, be read the third time and passed; and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. I object to this, Mr. President. As was stated, we have a \nbipartisan solution that many banks across the country are clamoring \nfor--the banking system is clamoring for. This bill I tried to call up \nwould pass overwhelmingly in this body.\n  The Senator from Illinois--and I appreciate his persistence--has \ncontinued to pursue this cram-down bill, which meets with tremendous \nopposition in this body.\n  I just hate that what we are doing is in essence extorting community \nbanks and extorting credit unions all across this country to provisions \nthat everyone knows are very problematic.\n  I object, and I hope the Senator from Illinois will allow us, at some \npoint soon, to take up this issue that is very important to credit \nunions, to community banks, to institutions across this country. As a \nresult, it is very important to the men and women all across this \ncountry who are concerned about their jobs, concerned about credit. \nThis is something we can do together to change the atmosphere of the \nbanking community and change our country in the process. But it appears \nwe are not going to have that opportunity today. I hope the Senator \nfrom Illinois will give us that opportunity in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Greed\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, as we look around at the problems we \nare\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nfacing in this country now when it comes to our economy, all of us are \ntrying to figure out what caused this mess, what is the root cause of \nthis incredible meltdown in the financial sector of our economy, in our \nhousing sector. It comes back to one simple concept: greed. It is just \nabout a bunch of really greedy people, brought to you by the current \nexecutive pay structure we have on Wall Street and in some parts of \ncorporate America. It is the largest part of the problem.\n  These potential payouts under this corporate structure of pay we have \nright now are so large that executives at financial institutions, \nincluding institutions such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that were \nsupposed to have a public purpose, had incentives to create rules that \nwould reward them no matter what happens. Why did all these exotic \nderivatives and swaps start happening? Pay. Pay. And greed. \nPerformance, not so much. It didn't matter whether you failed, you got \npaid anyway. That is the culture that caused the problem. Failure and \nyou walk with huge money.\n  These AIG bonuses are just one symptom of this very serious illness \nthat is gripping our economy and harming our competitiveness. The \nMerrill Lynch bonuses, which I stood on the floor and railed about a \nfew short weeks ago, were exhibit B. Those guys failed, and they made \nsure they got the money and walked with it before Bank of America took \nover. They moved up their bonuses. Retention? Not so much. It doesn't \nhave much to do with that. These AIG bonuses--52 of the people had \nalready walked out the door when they got the money. We weren't paying \nthem to stay; they had already left.\n  Our competitive disadvantage in this regard is real. Two of the most \nproductive competitors to our country, Germany and Japan--their trade \nsurplus per capita is the highest. Do you know what their average \ncorporate pay is? It is 10 or 11 times the average worker's. What is it \nin the United States of America? It is 400 times the average worker's.\n  We need to get back to our American values of hard work equals \nsuccess, equals financial reward--not failure and you get paid anyway. \nIt is most insulting on the American taxpayer's dime when it comes to \nMerrill Lynch and AIG.\n  There is a great column in the New York Times today by David \nLeonhardt. I recommend it to my colleagues. In that column, he makes \nthe following statement, and I paraphrase: Stop the deference to this \nculture. Stop the deference to Wall Street. Treasury, can you hear me? \nStop the deference to the culture of Wall Street. Be bold, stand up to \nthem.\n  That deference has now created a cold anger of populism that is going \nto make it very politically difficult for us to do anything else to \nfree up our credit markets that are so essential for our economy to \nsurvive.\n  America's economy has a hangover from the drunken greed of high pay \nand bonuses for failure. Sober up. Sober up, folks, because the \nAmerican people are paying too high a price.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              AIG Bonuses\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, AIG is in the news. If you want to know \nwhat I think AIG stands for, it is ``Ain't I Greedy.'' If there were \never a company that stands for ``ain't I greedy,'' it is certainly AIG.\n  In the midst of one of the greatest economic turmoils to hit our \ncountry, we have a corporation that received $170 billion in taxpayer \nmoney to keep them afloat, and now they want to pay themselves $165 \nmillion in bonuses. Ain't I greedy?\n  You better believe they are greedy. The very people who helped bring \nthe financial services and structure of the world economy to the brink \nof disaster now want to give themselves bonuses. That is like saying to \nthe crew on the Titanic, after they hit the iceberg: We are going to \ngive you a bonus for navigation.\n  What is this? I want people to know that I am mad as hell and, like \nthe taxpayers, I don't want to take it anymore. We need to do something \nabout this.\n  Right now, we see that over at that corporation, and others that are \ndoing these self-enrichment bonuses, they are the very people who \nbrought us near financial bankruptcy, and they are now demonstrating \nmoral bankruptcy. They nearly bankrupted their companies, but they come \nwith bankrupt values and a bankrupt approach to trying to help America \nout of this situation. If we want bankruptcy modification, let's throw \nthose bums out. Let's make them wear a scarlet B. I am ready to put \nthem in a stockade in Rockefeller Center so all the people who are \nlosing their homes, losing their jobs, losing their health care can \ncome and take a look at them.\n\n  You think I am frustrated? I am nowhere near frustrated compared to \nwhat my constituents are facing. They are very worried about their \nfuture. Senior citizens who saved all their lives and fought in great \nwars to protect America now have no one to protect their life savings \nas Wall Street sinks. People who played by the rules and are raising \ntheir families and trying to run a small business cannot have access to \ncredit because these guys were busy being celebrity CEOs, celebrity \nchefs with celebrity wives, and now they want a celebrity bonus. You \nbetter believe they are celebrities. Everybody knows who they are.\n  Also, what so infuriates the people of Maryland and, I believe, this \ncountry and we in Congress is there is no remorse about what they did. \nIn a 12-step program, when you have been an addict--and they certainly \nwere addicted to greed and they certainly were compulsive about \nfailure--usually you say: I am sorry, I did wrong. I promise never to \ndo it anymore, and I want to make amends by making it right.\n  Not these guys. They want more money to do the same. What is it they \nsay to us? My way or the highway. We need to pay bonuses to get people \nto stay. Why would we want them to stay? They got us into this mess. \nThey show no remorse, and I don't see a lot of competency in getting us \nout of it.\n  We need to use the power of our ownership. We own 80 percent of AIG. \nYou know what I think an 80-percent owner ought to do? Goodbye to the \npeople who either do not know how to work to get us out of this mess or \nare unwilling to help us get out of this mess unless they get a bonus.\n  Second, I think for those who took these bonuses, we are saying: \nDon't take the money or, if you have, give it back.\n  I signed a letter with other colleagues to Mr. Liddy, the CEO, \nsaying: Don't give them the bonuses, and if they got any, to give it \nback. But if they will not do it, I am saying loudly and clearly that I \nwill support the initiative to tax them at 90 percent of the money they \ngot.\n  My belief is: You can take it, but we are not going to let you keep \nit. You can take it, but we are not going to let you keep it. We are \ngoing to tax you at 90 percent. If we are 80 percent owners, then we \nare going to exercise our influence.\n  I believe we need to show not only the taxpayers that we are serious \nabout being stewards of their money, but we have to show corporate \nAmerica they have to get serious about working with the Obama \nadministration and us to get this economy back on track. Then we need \nto change not only the culture but help change the direction of our \neconomy.\n  I wish to see change in this country. That is what the voters voted \nfor. Let's start right now, today, by ending this culture of \ncorruption, greed, and self-enrichment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              AIG Bonuses\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I rise to express my outrage that at a \ntime of economic crisis in our Nation and around the world, at a time \nwhen so many Americans are losing jobs, defaulting on homes, and \nfalling behind in their own payments, they are paying into a system \ndoling out multimillion-dollar bonuses to employees at AIG.\n  Many of the same employees receiving these lavish payouts are the \nsame\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\nones who brought their company to the edge of collapse and the economy \ninto the depths of recession.\n  We cannot let their actions be rewarded--excessively rewarded--with \nthe multimillion-dollar bonuses paid by the taxpayers.\n  Time and again, we have gone back to our constituents and asked them \nto sacrifice to make ends meet. Now we demand the corporate executives \ndo the same.\n  As American families struggle to balance their own checkbooks at \nkitchen tables all across America, the employees of AIG walk out of \ntheir offices with $165 million in bonuses so far and are on track to \ntake home an estimated $450 million by the end of this year--free money \nthat they did not earn and certainly do not deserve.\n  It is now time for those executives who, through their reckless greed \nand irresponsible actions, have jeopardized our economic security to \nshare the burden in rebuilding this economy. If this company and others \nlike it fail to recognize the outrage and the frivolous nature of these \ntaxpayer-funded bonuses, Congress will intervene and act on their \nbehalf.\n  Yesterday, I joined my Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to \nthe CEO of AIG, Edward Liddy. We asked that Mr. Liddy take a reasonable \nlook at these excessive bonuses and requested that he act to \nrenegotiate them.\n  We also warned that if he chooses not to act immediately, we will \ntake action to recoup the American taxpayers' money through punitive \nlegislation.\n  Chairman Baucus has signaled he is poised to move forward with \nlegislation that he and Senators Grassley, Wyden, and Snowe are \ndrafting to allow the Government to recoup this money for taxpayers by \nsubjecting the bonuses to severe tax penalties.\n  At the same time we are correcting the payouts of the past, we have \nbeen working with the current administration to put in place new \nstandards of accountability for the future.\n  As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act we passed last \nmonth, we asked the Treasury Department to establish new guidelines \nregarding executive pay and luxuries. Just last week, we reiterated the \nurgency in a second letter to the Treasury Department asking that they \nswiftly complete this project and announce these new standards.\n  In addition to these steps, let us resolve to work in partnership \nwith the Obama administration and the Senate Banking Committee to take \nup a strong Wall Street accountability bill as soon as possible.\n  Our responsibilities lie with the citizens we represent. If we are \nsuccessful in taming the greed of Wall Street, we will have gone a long \nway to safeguarding the economic interests of those we represent and \nthose for whom we work--the people of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think our colleagues know that the \nissue of health care reform is hopefully on a fast track in the sense \nof getting something done this year. This is a very big project to get \nunderway. Senator Baucus and I have laid out an ambitious schedule for \nenacting a bipartisan health reform bill, and I think there are a lot \nof facets of it that we have to expect people who are not on the \ncommittees--Senator Kennedy's committee on the one hand and Senator \nBaucus's committee on the other hand--will have to take into \nconsideration. I am asking, through a series of speeches I will give \nthis spring, for people who perhaps don't think about the issue of \nhealth care reform because they do not serve on the committees to think \nof various things.\n  Today, I wish to address an issue we often read about in newspaper \naccounts--and the most recent one comes from a Wall Street Journal \narticle I had a chance to read--that comes up as a reminder when people \nthink about health care reform that we ought to take into \nconsideration. I often refer to Canada, I suppose because a lot of \nAmericans are familiar with the health care system in Canada, and we \nhave a lot of our constituents who ask us why we don't put in place \nwhat they have in Canada. We refer to that system as single payer. We \noften run into people who say: Well, don't do what they are doing in \nCanada. I think a lot of our colleagues here would support single \npayer. So obviously, when these things are discussed in America at the \ngrass roots level, I think we ought to be constantly reminded of this \nhere as we debate health care reform, and a lot of our colleagues need \nto be thinking about this a long time before legislation comes to the \nfloor.\n  We have a lot of work ahead of us if we want to see meaningful \nlegislation that will accomplish our three main goals of health care \nreform: lower cost, expanded coverage, and better quality.\n  Let me say that again: Lower cost, expanded coverage, and better \nquality.\n  As we roll up our sleeves, it is helpful to look to our neighbor to \nthe north, Canada, for some lessons about what works and what does not \nwork. Some of the proposals that are being discussed--the public plan \noption, rationing of care, and a Federal health board--will make our \ncurrent market-based health care system that we have in the United \nStates more similar to the Canadian health care system. Some like that. \nSome do not like it. My purpose is to be raising questions that our \ncolleagues ought to be considering.\n  The Canadian health care system might seem like a good idea to some \nof my colleagues, but this should make anyone who values access to care \nand the doctor-patient relationship very nervous. Canadian patients \noften wait months or even years for necessary care. It has become so \nbad that some patients are suing the Government in Canada to gain \naccess to care. One Ontario man suffering from headaches and seizures \nwas told he would have to wait 4\\1/2\\ months for an MRI. Instead of \nstanding in line, he did what a lot of Canadians do. He traveled across \nthe border to Buffalo for an MRI. It was there he discovered he had a \nmalignant brain tumor. When he returned to Canada, he was told again it \nwould be months before he could have surgery, so once again he traveled \nto Buffalo, for surgery. Another Canadian man waited in pain for a year \nbefore he could see a doctor about his arthritic hip. Once he finally \nsaw the right specialist he was told that he would need a state-of-the-\nart procedure to resurface his hip, but sadly the Canadian Government \ntold the 57-year-old gentleman he was ``too old'' to get the procedure. \nHe was also prohibited from paying for the surgery with his own money. \nSimilar to so many other Canadian patients, he is taking his case to \ncourt.\n  These court cases gained traction in 2005, when the Canadian supreme \ncourt ruled that patients suffer physically and psychologically while \nwaiting for treatment in Canada's Government-run system. The court also \nconcluded that the Government's controls over basic health care \nservices impose a risk of irreparable harm and even death.\n  As some people propose that the Government take a more active role in \nour Nation's health care system, I hope we can agree that access to a \nwaiting list is not access to health care. We all agree we need to fix \nour health care system but, as we try to fix it, let's not make it \nworse. Let's learn from our neighbors to the north. Let's not force \npatients in America into a one-size-fits-all Government-run system.\n\n\n                   Comparative Effectiveness Research\n\n  I would like to speak on another matter, about an important provision \ntucked away in the $1 trillion spending bill that passed last month. \nDuring the debate, Members spent a lot of time talking about big-ticket \nhealth care provisions--Medicaid, COBRA, Health IT. But one issue that \ndid not receive enough attention was a term that a lot of our \ncolleagues are not familiar with, but every colleague needs to become \nfamiliar with--this phrase ``comparative effectiveness research.'' I \nstill haven't figured out how spending money on comparative \neffectiveness research is actually stimulative, but this is one of \nthose things that probably should not have been in the stimulus bill--\nbut it was there and is now law.\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\n  I am even willing to guess that a lot of Members do not even know \nwhat comparative effectiveness research actually is, but in the so-\ncalled stimulus bill, we increased our investment in this research from \nabout $30 million to $1 billion. That is over a 3,000-percent increase \nfor something a lot of Members don't know about and can't even define--\nand I am not sure I want anybody to ask me right now to define it in \nthe purest sense. This makes me a little nervous.\n  Mr. President, $1 billion is a lot of money, but maybe it is money \nthat even people in comparative research might not even know what they \nare spending the money for.\n  Some policy experts have expressed concerns that this drastic \nincrease in funding will help establish the United States version of \nEngland's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, also \nreferred to as--I don't know whether the English pronounce it ``nice'' \nor ``niece,'' I am going to say NICE.\n  So you are not misled, many patient groups consider NICE to be \nanything but nice. NICE was created by the British Government in 1999 \nto decide what treatments, prescription drugs, and medical devices the \nBritish Government is going to pay for. In other words, you are having \nbureaucrats and/or politicians interfere in decisions that in America \nwe normally leave to the doctor and the patient. Put another way, NICE \nwas created for the Government to ration care and ultimately save \nmoney.\n  If the Congress of the United States was passing something to ration \ncare, I will bet a good number of people in this country would get up \nin arms. For example, a news story printed in August entitled \n``UK's''--meaning United Kingdom's--``NICE says `No' to four new cancer \ndrugs.'' It detailed how the NICE panel concluded that the four drugs \nwould extend people's lives, but somehow you cannot use them because \nthey are not cost-effective.\n  So, under England's single-payer Government system, patients were \nprohibited from getting those drugs, regardless of what the patient or \ntheir doctor might have thought. It was not until there was public \noutrage about that decision that made newspaper headlines around the \nworld that NICE then reversed its decision about at least one of those \ndrugs. The three other drugs are still considered too costly to give to \npatients.\n  Another article in the New York Times on December 8, 2008, was \nentitled ``British Balance Benefit vs. Cost of Latest Drugs.'' This \narticle told the story of Bruce Hardy, a British citizen who was \ndiagnosed with kidney cancer. Mr. Hardy was unable to get a particular \ndrug that would have extended his life because NICE determined the drug \nwas not ``cost-effective.'' That is because NICE has decided the \nBritish Government can only afford to pay about $22,000 for every 6 \nmonths of life.\n  Get this. The Government of England is putting a value on life of \nabout $22,000 for every 6 months of life. This may be acceptable in a \ngovernment-run single-payer health care system, but here in the United \nStates only two people should be involved in deciding what treatment, \ndrug or device to use, and those two people would be, on the one hand, \nthe doctor; on the other hand, the patient.\n  We do not need the Federal Government standing between patients and \ntheir doctors. We do not need bureaucrats in Washington denying \npatients with terminal cancer access to the newest and most promising \nexperimental drugs. We do not need the drug companies to have undue \ninfluence over our system either.\n  I think my work overseeing, as congressional responsibility dictates, \nthe Food and Drug Administration, gives me some authority to speak in \nthis area, that drug companies should not have undue influence. I have \nbeen a leading advocate for increasing oversight of drugs and device \nmanufacturers. In fact, I have introduced legislation to make \nmanufacturers report payments to patients so we can make sure we do not \nhave conflicts of interest getting in the way of high-quality care. I \nhave also supported drug importation and legislation to prohibit brand-\nname manufacturers from gaming the system to prevent lower cost generic \ndrugs from getting to the market. So I am not down here today to defend \nthe drug companies or device industry. They can do that on their own, \nand I think they do it very well. But I think it is legitimate to be \nconcerned about patients. I don't want some faceless, unelected \nGovernment panel keeping patients in Iowa or anywhere from getting the \nlifesaving treatment they need.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter I received from 60 patient groups, from the breast cancer \nadvocates to muscular dystrophy, to name two, expressing concerns about \nusing comparative effectiveness to ration care.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 26, 2009.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye, Chairman,\n     Hon. Thad Cochran, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Appropriations, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin, Chairman,\n     Hon. Arlen Specter, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Labor, Health \n         and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye, Ranking Member Cochran, Chairman \n     Harkin and Ranking Member Specter: We are writing to urge you \n     to ensure that any comparative effectiveness research (CER) \n     included in the economic stimulus package establish a \n     legislative framework that is strong and patient-centered. \n     The goal of CER should be to arm individual patients and \n     their doctors with the best available information to help \n     assess the relative clinical outcomes of various treatment \n     strategies and alternatives, recognizing that this will vary \n     with circumstances. When used appropriately, comparative \n     clinical effectiveness information can serve as a valuable \n     tool that can contribute to improving health care delivery \n     and outcomes by informing clinical decision making. By \n     focusing on quality of patient care, such research also can \n     help us achieve better health care value. However, we are \n     very concerned that the House legislation and accompanying \n     report language could have unintended and negative effects \n     for patients, providers and medical innovators, leading to \n     restrictions on patients' access to treatments and \n     physicians' and other providers' ability to deliver care that \n     best meets the needs of the individual patient. Rather, we \n     believe any provisions related to comparative effectiveness \n     should:\n       Focus CER on comparative clinical benefit, rather than \n     cost-effectiveness. Any legislation should state that funding \n     will be used only to support clinical comparative \n     effectiveness research, and define clinical comparative \n     effectiveness as research evaluating and comparing the \n     clinical effectiveness of two or more medical treatments, \n     services, items and care processes and management. \n     Additionally, CER should not encourage a generalized, ``one-\n     size fits all'' approach. Rather, it is necessary to design \n     studies and communicate results in ways that reflect \n     variation in individual patient needs, that help patients and \n     doctors make informed choices, and account for differences \n     among patients including co-morbidities, sex, race and \n     ethnicity. Recognizing these differences is important to \n     allowing patients optimal treatment today and to encouraging \n     the development of innovative targeted therapies which will \n     advance personalized medicine.\n       Be conducted through an open and transparent process that \n     allows for patients, providers and other stakeholders to \n     participate equally in governance and input, starting from \n     the research planning stage. There are many challenges in \n     successfully conducting and communicating high-quality, \n     patient-centered CER. Therefore, comparative effectiveness \n     programs should include transparent decision-making \n     procedures and broad stakeholder representation to enhance \n     the credibility and usefulness of such studies.\n       Ensure that research supports providers in delivering the \n     best possible care to their patients. To maintain a focus on \n     patient and provider needs, the research entity should not \n     engage in making policy recommendations or coverage \n     decisions. Patients may respond differently to the same \n     intervention and the needs of the individual must be taken \n     into consideration. Imposing rigid, federally-proscribed \n     practice guidelines, which fail to recognize such variations, \n     among patients can lead to poor patient outcomes and \n     increased health care costs.\n       Comparative effectiveness information that reflects \n     interactions among all of the various components of the \n     health care system has the greatest potential to empower \n     clinicians and patients to make more appropriate decisions. \n     In addition to comparing scientific treatment interventions, \n     research should also focus on how innovations in care \n     delivery models, such as disease management programs, may \n     produce better health outcomes.\n       We look forward to working with you to create a system that \n     improves information about clinical outcomes, ensures that \n     patients continue to have access to life-saving\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\n     treatments and the tools necessary to advance a better \n     quality of life for all Americans.

I agree we need to lower the overall cost of our health \ncare system. We need to improve quality. It is true we spend more \nmoney, about twice as much more than other developed nations in the \nworld, and still rank poorly in many health care indicators. But having \nthe Government ration care is not the answer. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office concluded that comparative effectiveness \nresearch would only save 1/10th of 1 percent of the total health care \nspending.\n  Let me remind you when I started out I was saying I want my \ncolleagues to become familiar with comparative effectiveness research \nbecause this is something we are going to be dealing with in the \nlegislation later on this year, and we just put $1 billion into this \nproject as opposed to $30 million previously.\n  If Congress is going to spend this $1 billion on this research, let's \nnot bill it as some magic bullet to control health care spending \nbecause the Congressional Budget Office--and I hope you know they are \nGod around here, they are God around here because if they say something \ncosts something, it costs something. If you want to overrule them, it \ntakes 60 votes to overrule. So what they say counts. If we are going to \nspend that $1 billion, we have to make sure it is improving quality and \ninforming patients and providers. If Congress is going to spend $1 \nbillion on this, let's not establish the United States version of the \nUnited Kingdom's government-run National Institutes of Health and \nClinical Excellence that I have been referring to by the acronym NICE. \nLet's not set up a system for Washington dictating to your doctor what \ntreatment to prescribe. If we are going to do this, we have to do it \nright. Comparative effectiveness research should be about comparing \nclinical treatments and then letting your doctor decide the best way to \ntreat it.\n  I am not up here saying there should not be any comparative \neffectiveness research. I am here to say it should not be a subterfuge \nfor some bureaucrat or politician deciding who is going to live and who \nis going to die. It is information for doctors and patients. It should \nbe done in the most open and transparent process possible.\n  Finally, the research should be used to get information to doctors \nand patients about the best treatment.\n  It should not be used for Washington to make policy or to decide what \ntreatments the government will or will not cover. I hope we can agree \nthe Federal Government should not be in the business of determining the \nvalue of a person's life, as I indicated to you this outfit in the \nUnited Kingdom decides that your life is worth $22,000 per 6 months.\n  Clinical comparative effectiveness can be a valuable tool in creating \na more efficient health care system, but let's make sure we use this \ntool wisely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              AIG Bonuses\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I first would like to say a thing or two \nabout the bonuses that have been paid to the AIG employees, those \npersons who are in the specific division whose actions led to the \ndemise of what was once considered a great insurance company.\n  No doubt about it, that was a very serious error, and now as a result \nof agreements made, apparently sometime ago, they are going to receive \nbonuses. Everybody has been upset about it. So have I.\n  I said Monday on this floor the only thing I felt like giving them \nfor free would be a free lunch and a free bed somewhere in a \npenitentiary. I know the Presiding Officer is a former prosecutor and \nhas sent some people to the penitentiary. I hope they are not guilty of \ncriminal activities, but that is how I feel about it.\n  But the reason we are in this is because of an unwise act. That act \nwas--beginning with Secretary Paulson, President Bush's Secretary of \nthe Treasury, continued now under Secretary Geithner, President Obama's \nSecretary of the Treasury--taking over AIG.\n  We own 80 percent of AIG's stock. Secretary Paulson picked Mr. Liddy, \nwho had a good record in the past and was off somewhere with his \ngrandchildren, and asked him to come back and try to take over this \ncompany and start pumping billions of dollars into it. It now has \ntotaled $170 billion.\n  It is unbelievable how much that is, $170 billion. I would repeat, \nthat is, compared to the Alabama budget, including schools and \nteachers' pay, $7 billion a year. We gave one private company, \ncompeting with a lot of other private insurance companies in America \ntoday that did not get themselves in trouble--we are bailing them out. \nSo we should not have done that.\n  Now, when Mr. Paulson came before this body and asked for this power \nto get $700 billion to spend as he wished, I objected. As just a \nSenator, I was flabbergasted that he would ask for such unlimited \npower. Not one time did he hint that he was going to buy stock in an \ninsurance company. It was to buy the toxic assets from banks. Do you \nremember that?\n  So Secretary Paulson, within a few days, a week I believe, had gotten \nhis authority. But it did not say: Mr. Secretary, you get to buy toxic \nassets in banks--which I did not think was very good anyway and voted \nagainst it--it gave him power to do virtually anything. That is another \nreason I voted against the legislation.\n  By the way, under oath in a House committee, Secretary Paulson said \nhe had no intention of buying stock. Somebody asked him: What about \nbuying stock in these banks?\n  He said, no, he did not want to buy stock; that we were just going to \nbuy these toxic assets.\n  A week later he was buying stock in an insurance company and stock in \nbanks. And to this day, we have not yet bought any of these toxic \nassets, these bad mortgages that are really the problem that have \ndestabilized our financial situation and have not dealt with yet. That \nis why there is still instability out there.\n  OK. So here we are now; we own this corporation. So I asked the \nquestion about the bonuses at AIG. Apparently, they got a contract. By \nthe way, when we passed legislation here, it was with a Democratic \nmajority. Somewhere in conference they put in language in the \nlegislation that basically said bonuses would be honored if they were \nentered into before a certain date. These bonus contracts were entered \ninto before that date.\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\n  So now we have all of these protestations and all this angst and all \nthis outrage about bonuses, and we have to do something about it. I am \noutraged, too, really but have a little perspective. The amount of the \nbonuses are one-thousandth, less than one-thousandth of the amount of \nmoney we put in this corporation that is at great risk today. And that \nis a galling issue for all of us, to have this division, the bad \ndivision in the whole fine insurance company, taking this company down, \nand they get the bonuses. It is outrageous. It really is. But the truth \nis, it appears there is some contractual right for them to have it.\n  So I would ask, what about the folks in these companies who are paid \ntoo much? Maybe we ought to have debate on the Senate floor about how \nmuch every employee of AIG should be paid or how their bathrooms should \nbe configured or whether they should even have a private bathroom or \nhow many businesses they ought to have or what kind of cars they should \ndrive, whether they should have jet airplanes, whether they ought to be \non Manhattan or some cheaper place in Brooklyn.\n  I mean, what we are going to enter into is these have become \npolitical decisions because politicians own the company. This is a \nwarning for us. We have to be careful about buying stock in \ncorporations. I am telling you, it is not a good policy. I do not \nbelieve it was justified in this circumstance. I think history is \ndemonstrating that.\n  I am worried about it. We need to get out of AIG. How are we going to \ndo it? I think the way you do it, and the way it should have been done \nfrom the beginning, is the company should have gone into chapter 11 \nunder the Bankruptcy Code. You would have had a Federal bankruptcy \njudge bring all of them in, raise their hands under oath, testify to \nthe financial condition, how this all happened, what parts of the \ncompany are good, valuable, prosperous, what parts are sick and in \ndanger.\n  Then we could have figured out as a government how we could help with \nthe sick and toxic parts, get rid of the others and let all of that go, \nand we would not have been running this company.\n  So now we are going to tax them. I am not sure how this has been \nwritten, but we are somehow going to identify the several hundred \npeople who got bonuses, and we are going to tax them. We might as well \nput their names in the Record. I do not know; it is probably \nunconstitutional. It really is. It is a real constitutional question, \ncertainly a policy question, that the Congress is going to abrogate a \ncontract whether we like it or not. But a bankruptcy judge can. A \nbankruptcy judge has constitutional power to abrogate a contract. I am \ncertain a bankruptcy judge would have invalidated the contract for \nbonuses for the people in this division. They do not have the money.\n  The only reason they are afloat today is because we bailed them out. \nThey would not have jobs if we had not bailed them out. This whole \nthing would have been done differently. So I am worried about what we \nare doing.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. President, I am also worried about the budget. The President has \nsubmitted a budget. It has come over to us now. It is in a bound book, \nslick cover. It sets out his agenda for the future. It is an important \ndocument, and it sets out his priorities and his direction he wants the \ncountry to go.\n\n  I am a member of the Budget Committee, and we will be marking that up \nand offering amendments to it next week. But the American people need \nto know that the financial condition of our country will be altered to \na historic degree if this budget is passed. I am not just saying that. \nI am saying, read the budget. That is what it says.\n  I will share some thoughts about it. I think there is a growing \nbipartisan consensus, and certainly at least a concern on both sides of \nthe aisle, that the budget deficits and spending levels are \nunsustainable; that is, continuing these levels of spending will \ndestabilize this country, weaken the value of our dollar, perhaps kick \noff inflation, and in many other ways erode confidence in the United \nStates as a government of integrity and financial wisdom and management \nthat can be relied on.\n  So while American families are out there right now saving a good bit \nmore than they have in years past, watching their pennies, while \nAmerican cities and towns who have been in my office this week and are \ntelling me they are seeing a 6 or 7 or so percent reduction in sales \ntax revenues and revenues for their towns, they are managing well, and \nthey are getting by. They are postponing some things they would like to \nhave done this year until they get a little more money in, and they are \nnot going out of business. They heard there was some free money in the \nstimulus package. They wanted as much of it as they can get. Fair \nenough. But, you know, they are getting by.\n  Our Government is increasing spending to a degree to which we have \nnever seen before. This budget calls for $3.6 billion in spending, \nwhich is, in effect, a 20-percent growth in nondefense programs. I am \ntalking about the discretionary programs under our control that we deal \nwith from 2008 levels to 2010 levels, 20 percent.\n  At that rate, of course, that is 10 percent a year, and with a 7-\npercent growth rate per year your money will double in 10 years. This \nis the track we are on. It is a huge baseline budget increase to pay \nfor this expansion of Government.\n  The budget imposes or presumes $1.4 trillion in new taxes. That \nincludes a national energy tax similar to the one the MIT experts \npredict would cost working families $3,100 per year. That is almost \n$300 a month for the average family for this tax. So despite these \ntaxes, the budget will require even more borrowing. We will go even \nfurther in debt despite the tax increase.\n  We would double the debt held by the public in 5 years. I mean, the \ntotal American debt we have today would double in 5 years and triple in \n10 years. Our budget is a 10-year budget. It projects what this \nadministration believes should happen over the next 10 years. That is \nwhat they project will happen.\n  Under this plan, starting in 2012, the United States will pay $1 \nbillion a day in interest to our creditors, the largest of which are \nChina and Japan outside of our country. That is $1 billion a day in \ninterest on this surging debt we have.\n  So, in summary, I believe it is fair and honest to say this budget \nspends too much, it taxes too much, and it borrows too much. The \nadministration has promised the budget would be free of accounting \ntricks and gimmicks, but they have not met that standard either. On the \none hand, we have been told repeatedly by the administration that we \nface the gravest economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n  On the other hand, his budget assumes that unemployment will not rise \nbeyond today's level and economic growth will not substantially fall. I \ncannot accept and I do not buy the rhetoric of imminent economic \ndisaster. I have not believed that is likely. I still don't believe it \nis likely. I know we are in a difficult time, but few, if any, \neconomists would agree with the budget's prediction and assumption that \nunemployment will stay at today's rate of 8.1 percent or that the gross \ndomestic product this year will only decrease by 1.2 percent. The \nadministration's rosy economic picture permits them to assume, \ntherefore, greater revenue. If you assume you have a higher growth \nrate, a lower unemployment rate, more people are making money, more \npeople are working and getting paid, less people are on unemployment \ncompensation, you assume you have billions more dollars to spend on \nwhatever you would like to spend it on.\n  An independent blue chip group that predicts unemployment and \npredicts GDP is predicting GDP will decline more than twice 1.2 \npercent, and they are also predicting the unemployment rate will hit \n8.9. I believe our Congressional Budget Office is predicting \nunemployment will cap out at 9.1 percent. I have seen some figures of \n9.4 percent. I am hopeful we will come in under 10 percent. I believe \nwe will.\n  To build on good feelings here, I will note that under President \nReagan, when Mr. Volcker was Secretary of the Treasury, they realized \nthey had to confront and break the back of surging inflation. \nUnemployment hit 10.9 in the early 1980s. It kicked off, though, a \nsound economy, and for 20 years we have had steady growth after \ncollapsing the unacceptable inflation rate.\n  The best estimates I am seeing do not predict economic disaster, but \nthey\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\ncertainly don't predict the kind of minimum economic slowdown these \nnumbers are assuming. When those numbers prove to be off the mark, the \nresult will be deficits higher than the administration is predicting in \ntheir own budget. That is what I am saying. If you look at the budget \nover the next 10 years, that is what really worries me.\n  In 2004, President Bush, after 9/11 and after the recession that \noccurred there, his deficit hit $412 billion. That was the biggest \ndeficit we had since World War II. He was roundly criticized for that. \nI wasn't very happy with it either. I liked President Bush, but I \nthought that was too big a deficit. It dropped until 2007, when it hit \n$161 billion.\n  Last year, President Bush sent out the $300 checks and the $150 \nbillion in deficit spending on top of our other deficit to try to \nstimulate the economy. It didn't work. He sent out that money. \nEverybody got the little check. Whatever they did with it, it didn't do \nmuch good. The debt jumped to $455 billion. So last year, September 30, \nthe deficit was $455 billion, the largest we have ever had, perhaps \nincluding World War II. This year, there is uniform agreement.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is scoring that at September 30, our \ndeficit--the amount of money we spent, less the amount of money we have \ntaken in in taxes--will be $1.8 trillion, one thousand eight hundred \nbillion, four times the highest deficit we ever had last year. That is \na serious matter, not a little bitty matter. The budget the President \nsent us projects that next year--and he does this over 10 years--it \nwill be $1.1 trillion. It begins to drop down to that and hits $533 \nbillion in the fourth year. That is the year he said he cuts the budget \ndeficit in half.\n  The reason the deficit was particularly high this year is the money \nwe spent for the financial bailout of Wall Street that they bought AIG \nwith and other bank stock. The Congressional Budget Office said we are \ngoing to lose about $250 billion in that deal. We will get some of it \nback. They scored in this year's budget $250 billion for that. We have \nbought Freddie and Fannie, taken over and guaranteed all those loans at \nthose two huge financing institutions, which were quasi-private, \nbasically private, we have taken those over now, and CBO has scored \nabout another $250 billion. They are putting all of that in this year. \nAnd then we passed, a few weeks ago, $800 billion--pure stimulus \nspending to send out over the country. You heard it was for roads and \nbridges. Only 3 or 4 percent went for roads and bridges. The rest of it \nwent for all kinds of nice ideas, not very stimulative in the minds of \nexperts. So you add that over the next 2 years of spending, split that \nout. That is how we get such a high year this year.\n  One reason we are at a trillion dollars next year is because they are \nscoring some of that $800 billion in next year's deficit. At any rate, \nit drops down, OK? So the fourth year, we are hitting $533 billion. \nThat is still the highest deficit in the history of our Republic. Then \nit starts going up. And the budget President Obama gives us projects \nthat in the 10th year, the deficit will be over $700 billion.\n  That is why we need the American people to be engaged. Members of \nCongress are going to have to study the numbers. They are going to have \nto study the immensity of the requirements of this budget. We are going \nto have to reject it. We cannot pass such an automatic guaranteed surge \nin debt. It would triple our total national public debt in 10 years.\n  This is the beginning. The budget will begin to be marked up next \nweek in committee. It is going to take more than just the committee \nmembers to decide what we do. I believe the American people and the \nMembers of this Congress are going to have to get our heads together \nand figure out some ways to do like our cities and counties. Instead of \nhaving baseline spending increase at 7, 8, 10 percent a year, we might \ngo for a year or two where we don't increase at all. Just a little bit \nof that would have a dramatic impact on the deficit. It is the \nincreases that are killing us. They are projecting increased revenues \nin the years to come, but they are projecting substantially greater \nincreases in spending.\n  That is not who we are as a people. We are a people of limited \ngovernment. We are people of low taxes. We are people of individual \nresponsibility. That is a fundamental American ethic, individual \nresponsibility. The Europeans are more into this Socialist mentality, \nbut we were faced with the spectacle over the weekend of our own \nSecretary of the Treasury going to Europe meeting with Europeans and \nupbraiding them because they aren't borrowing enough or spending \nenough, in his mind, going far enough into debt to stimulate the \neconomy as much as he would like to see it done. They are being more \nconservative and responsible than we are. It is a matter of real \nconcern.\n  These are important issues. I hope the debate will continue and all \nof us will look at the long-term interests of this great Nation and \ntake the steps today that will protect our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Markets Commission\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, we were all reminded yesterday, when news \nof the AIG bonus payouts hit, of the frustration all of us have and all \nthe American people have with the financial difficulties the Nation has \nhad but also what appear to be at best irresponsible acts taking place \nby many of the financial institutions that, in fact, received Federal \nTARP money.\n  I rise to repeat a call that Senator Conrad and I made 6 weeks ago on \nthe floor of the Senate. We created a piece of legislation known as the \nFinancial Markets Commission, a commission patterned after the 9/11 \nCommission, a commission of seven appointed members--two by the \nPresident, one by the Speaker of the House, one by majority leader of \nthe Senate and one by the minority leader, one by the minority leader \nof the House, and then one by the chairman of the Federal Reserve--\nseven members given 360 days a year, empowered with a $3 million budget \nand subpoena power to investigate every aspect of the financial \ncollapse in the United States, whether it is insurance, investment \nbankers, mortgage bankers, individual managers such as Mr. Madoff in \nNew York or anybody else, and to come back to the American people and \nto the President a year from now and tell us, to the best of their \nability, in a forensic way, what happened. If, in the course of their \ninvestigation, they find inappropriate activities, there is the \nrequirement that they refer those to the Attorney General of the United \nStates of America.\n  It is important that we do this for four reasons. I will go about \nthem briefly.\n  No. 1, it should be an independent panel that is fully funded and has \nsubpoena power so there is no impediment to gathering facts, finding \nout the information necessary, and making that report.\n\n  No. 2, it should be created by the Congress, but the membership \nshould be appointees who are experienced and knowledgeable in finance, \nbanking, investment banking, and in law, not politicians but \nprofessionals who know, just as we had on the 9/11 Commission 2 years \nago.\n  No. 3, there is no question that mistakes were made, but there is no \nquestion that some people took advantage of the system. The public \nexpects, I expect, and we should demand that where we find wrongdoing, \nit is eliminated, pointed out, the individuals who did wrong are held \naccountable, and we restore some level of confidence in the oversight \nof our financial system.\n  No. 4, I think it is time that all of us recognize there is plenty of \nfault to go around. You could blame a hedge fund. You can blame a \nMadoff. You could blame an AIG. We have to look in the mirror as well. \nThe second vote I ever cast in the Congress was the vote that repealed \nGlass-Steagall, put in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill. I thought it was \ngood legislation. So did 99 percent of the House and Senate. In \nretrospect, by allowing the vertical integration of the financial \nsystem from insurance and mortgage banking to investment banking and \nregular banking, we blurred some of the lines that for so many years \nhad protected the integrity of the financial system in America. As a \nresult of that, situations happened, like AIG and Citibank, where \nvertical integration beyond the original mission of the financial \nservices of the\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\ncompany attracted more money but it also attracted more greed. And it \nhad no transparency.\n  I think it is critical, at a time and place where we recognize we \nhave had some significant problems, where the American people know it \nis going to take us time to recover, for us to have a forensic audit of \nthe financial systems of the United States, the regulatory authorities, \nthe legislative bodies, and any individuals who were part of it so that \nwe can learn from the mistakes that have been made, we can put in the \ntransparency that is necessary to prevent it happening in the future, \nand we can restore the confidence of the American people in the \nAmerican financial system.\n  I urge colleagues to look at the Financial Markets Commission, join \nSenator Conrad and myself as cosponsors. Let's begin finding the \nanswers that all of us seek and that the American public demands.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  AIG\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am sure my office is not the only one \nthat has been flooded with calls, e-mails, and letters expressing \nanger--righteous anger--as to what happened at AIG. In fact, the person \nin charge of my mail told me our e-mails on this issue is running \nhigher than anything that has happened in recent history.\n  Well, I am not just angry and disgusted at AIG, I am, frankly, kind \nof dumbfounded by how this has all happened. How in the world could AIG \ndecide to pay retention bonuses worth millions of dollars to the very \nindividuals whose reckless practices caused this meltdown on the global \nfinancial system? This truly sets a new gold standard for arrogance and \nbeing clueless.\n  Now, to add insult to injury, the CEO of AIG, Edward Liddy, told the \nHouse Financial Services Committee this morning that these bonuses were \n``distasteful'' but ``necessary'' because of contractual obligations. \nMr. Liddy said he asked the bonus recipients to return half of the \nmoney. But he rebuffed the demand of 44 Senators, including me, that he \nrenegotiate those contacts and recoup all of the bonus payments.\n  Now, for the AIG unit specifically responsible for much of the \nfinancial difficulties we are in to receive $170 billion in taxpayers' \nmoney, and then to give these extraordinary bonuses to people who \nshould have been fired a long time ago, is shameful and inexcusable--\ninexcusable--since the Federal Reserve and the Treasury knew about \nthese bonus payments before they went out but did not act aggressively \nto stop them.\n  There is a broader context to the public's anger at AIG's misconduct. \nBear in mind we are in the longest, deepest, most destructive economic \ndownturn since the Great Depression. We are now losing jobs at a rate \nof about 650,000 a month. Millions of Americans are losing their jobs, \ntheir retirement savings, their pensions, their health insurance, and, \nyes, their homes.\n  But Americans look at Wall Street and Washington, and they see \nbusiness as usual. They see alumni of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup \narranging tens of billions in bailouts for their former Wall Street \ncolleagues. They see corporate executives flying to Washington in \nexpensive corporate jets to ask for taxpayer bailout money.\n  At a time when their incomes are stagnant, they see a rapidly rising \nconcentration of wealth in the hands of a few, with the average CEO now \nmaking 430 times as much as the average worker. They see these hedge \nfund hotshots making tens of millions of dollars manipulating markets, \nwhile they get paid the minimum wage for doing some of the most \ndifficult, draining work imaginable.\n  They see corporate executives getting gold-plated pensions worth tens \nof millions of dollars, while, in some cases, the very same corporation \nis slashing pensions for their rank-and-file employees.\n  Hard-working, ordinary Americans see these harsh realities and--with \ngood reason--they get the idea there is one set of rules for the little \npeople and a very different set of rules for the privileged and the \nwell-connected and the wealthy. Call it the Leona Helmsley rule.\n  For instance, look at the double standard for key people at AIG. The \nFederal Government required union workers at GM and Chrysler--some \nmaking as little as $14 an hour--to renegotiate their contracts and \naccept lower compensation as a condition for their employers getting \ntaxpayer bailout money. But the compensation contracts at AIG are held \nup as somehow sacrosanct and untouchable. Well, this is complete \nnonsense. Why shouldn't multimillionaire employees at AIG be treated \nthe same as line workers at GM or Chrysler? Why shouldn't they have \nbeen required in the first instance to renegotiate their compensation \ncontracts, as well, before we gave AIG all that money? To me, it is a \nmatter of basic fairness and equity.\n  So the anger of the American people at AIG must be seen in this \nbroader context. Hard-working Americans are sick and tired of playing \nby the rules and falling further and further behind, while the \nprivileged and the well connected break the rules and get richer and \nricher.\n  That is why the misconduct at AIG--these lavish bonus payouts to \npeople who deserve to be fired--must not be tolerated. It is time for a \nmeasure of fairness and common sense.\n  Mr. President, 73 AIG employees were paid bonuses of $1 million or \nmore, and 7 in excess of $4 million. Now we find that a number of these \npeople who got these bonuses already left the company. We were told \nbefore the reason for the bonuses was to retain people. Well, we see a \nlot of these people have already left. So now the reason is because of \na contractual--a contractual--obligation.\n  Well, even if an AIG executive had a contractual claim to a multi \nmillion bonus, one would think that contract has been abrogated. It has \nbeen a few years since I have been in law school, but I do remember a \nfew things from contracts. Contracts can be abrogated.\n  For example, Mr. President, if you and I have a contract, and one \nparty does not perform, the contract is abrogated. Contracts also can \nbe abrogated by bankruptcy. We know that. If we have a contract, and \none party goes bankrupt, the contract can be abrogated.\n  Well, let's look at it from those two standpoints.\n  Nonperformance: Well, it is funny. We have been told about these \ncontracts, but has anyone ever seen one? I am talking about the \ncontracts AIG had with the people who were getting the bonuses. They \nsay they had a contractual obligation. I would like to see one of those \ncontracts. What did it say?\n  Well, to listen to Mr. Liddy, evidently all the contract said is, if \nyou are alive at a certain date you get a bonus. Now, I say to the \nPresiding Officer, you know as well as I do, bonus contracts are not \nmade that way. Bonus agreements are made on the basis of performance. \nSurely, AIG did not make a contract with one of their employees that \nsaid: No matter what you do, no matter how much money you lose for this \ncompany, no matter the circumstances, we are going to give you a bonus. \nNo one believes that.\n  So, herewith, I call upon Mr. Liddy to show us the contracts. Let us \nsee them. Let us see the contract that AIG had with all those people \nwho got bonuses. I would like to see what it says. I would like to see \nif it just says: If you are alive on a certain date, you get the bonus \nno matter what you do.\n  I do not think it said that. I think those contracts said: If you do \ncertain things, you get a bonus; or if you are here, we will give you a \nbonus to retain you; or you have to do certain performances. I would \nlike to see those contracts.\n  Then I hear people in our own Government, in this administration, \ntalking about the sanctity of contracts. Well, maybe they ought to go \nto law school--a couple of them--and find out that contracts can be \nabrogated. They can also be abrogated if they are unconscionable.\n  Public policy: This goes way back into British common law. But, \nagain, that is a sort of maybe yes, maybe no.\n\n[[Page S3360]]\n\nBut courts have held contracts to be abrogated if it is in the public \ngood or if it is unconscionable, for example, that these contracts were \nmade. I would say in this case it would be unconscionable for someone \nwho has been in charge of bringing this company down and lost more \nmoney than any corporate enterprise in history to receive a bonus \npayment, especially since it comes from the taxpayers.\n  Now, it might not be unconscionable if it came from stockholders, \nshareholders, other equity partners. But when it comes from the \ntaxpayer, I would suggest it is unconscionable in this circumstance. So \nI do not know who these people are, talking about the sanctity of these \ncontracts, but, obviously, on any one of those three items, surely \nthose contracts cannot be held to be valid.\n  Now, the only reason these contracts are worth anything at all is \nbecause we stepped in and gave them all this money. If we allowed AIG \nto go bankrupt, these executives would probably not have gotten one \ncent of bonus. They would not have gotten one cent. So it really is \nunconscionable they would then take taxpayer money and give these \nbonuses out.\n  But, again, I repeat, we need to see these contracts so we can make a \njudgment as to whether Mr. Liddy is telling the truth. I have gone \nbeyond accepting his word. I want to see the contracts.\n  Now, again, since AIG seems to have the responsiveness of a mule, it \nis time to hit them in the head with a 2 by 4. Congress has to step in. \nAnd I know the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Schumer, has worked on a bill that I support that would reach \nout and get this money back to our taxpayers. I want to compliment my \ngood friend from New York, the Presiding Officer, right now for doing \nthat because basically that is the way we have to get the money back.\n\n  Ideally, I would tax at close to all income above $400,000 not only \nat AIG but at all other companies that have taken TARP money, bonus or \notherwise. State, local and foreign income taxes plus payroll taxes and \nthe federal tax should add up to 100 percent on whatever is over \n$400,000.\n  Now, I know Mr. Liddy asked for them to give back half of the money. \nTo me, that is not acceptable. If somebody got $4 million, and they are \ngoing to give $2 million back, I am sorry, that is not acceptable. Go \ntell that to the line workers at GM and Chrysler who was asked to gave \nup some of their $14 per hour or gave up some of their pension rights \nand things like that to get the bailout money.\n  Well, at any rate, I think there are 44 Senators on a letter, if I am \nnot mistaken, now, I say to my friend from New York that says take \nthose bonuses back or we stand ready to recoup those bonus payments, \nperhaps with an income tax of 91 percent.\n  I also say there was an amendment that was added to the stimulus \nbill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, that limited \nexecutive pay at bailed out companies to $400,000 annually and voided \nany contracts providing compensation above that level. The Senator from \nMissouri was the lead sponsor on that. I was a cosponsor on that \namendment. It was accepted on the stimulus bill here in the Senate, and \nthen it went to conference. Then it got dropped. Why did it get \ndropped? When did it get dropped? Who advocated dropping that in \nconference? I would like to know the answer to that question.\n  Now, again, you might say $400,000 annually? Well, that was put in \nthere because that is the salary of the President of the United States. \nWe said nobody working for are TARP receiving company should make over \nthat. You could get $400,000, but nobody over that. But that was put in \nthe stimulus bill, and then it got dropped mysteriously in conference. \nI ask, why?\n  Well, again, I say to the Presiding Officer, I think your work on \nthis issue and I hope we act on the concepts we are urging soon; I do \nnot know when, but the sooner the better--that the tax be as close to \n100 percent as we can get. But, obviously, we have to minus the State \nand other income and payroll taxes that might be owed on that sum. That \nhas to be taken out. I understand that. And, ideally, if some lower \npaid person, a secretary or someone like that, got--you do not want to \nbother them either. But you want to get at these people who were \nmeddling and moving these credit default swaps and other financial \ninstruments around and ratcheting them up and giving phony valuations \nto them. These are the people who should not be getting any of the \nbonus money whatsoever.\n\n  I would also like to see the Treasury become a much more aggressive \nwatchdog and defender of the taxpayers' interests. When Wall Street \nlawyers say that outrageous compensation contracts must be honored--\neven under dramatically changed circumstances and even when we know the \ncontracts can be abrogated by certain circumstances such as \nnonperformance and things such as that--we need Treasury lawyers who \nwill say no, who will push back hard, be creative and tough-minded, \ndoing everything possible to protect the taxpayers' interests.\n  Likewise, when the lawyers say AIG--which we must say now is the \nFederal Government because we own 80 percent of it. So when you are \ntalking about AIG, you are talking about the Federal Government and \ntaxpayers. So when Wall Street lawyers and the Treasury lawyers say \ntaxpayers must pay 100 percent of payouts to counterparties on \nderivatives contracts, we need a Treasury that will do all that they \ncan to say no and who will see to it that those counterparts, including \nDeutsche Bank and other big banks in Europe, have to take a haircut \ntoo. They have to share some of the pain. Again, after all, if we had \nlet AIG go bankrupt, Deutsche Bank would have gotten nothing or very \nlittle. Yet to permit them to be made completely whole by the taxpayers \nof this country is not right.\n  We need to make it clear to AIG--and, again, we are focused on AIG, \nbut we have to say this to all recipients of taxpayer bailout money \nthat business as usual will not be tolerated. Incompetence, \nrecklessness will not be rewarded. It is an insult and an affront to \nthe American people that will not be allowed to stand. Not just at AIG \nbut everyone else who is getting this so-called TARP money. It is time \nto be fair, and it is time to let the taxpayers of this country know we \nare going to stick up for them. We are not going to let this business \nas usual continue.\n  Again, I thank the Presiding Officer, for the time but also for his \nleadership on this issue, in making sure we go after these people and \nget this money back. I just hope we do it soon. The sooner we do it, \nthe better off we are all going to be.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Follow Autoworkers' Example\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, much has already been made of the recent \naction by AIG to distribute $165 million in bonuses for some of the \nvery employees who contributed to the company's near collapse, the loss \nto our Treasury of tens of billions of dollars, and the severe damage \nto our economy. I joined with 43 colleagues yesterday in signing a \nletter, which our Presiding Officer was instrumental in writing, to the \nchief executive officer of AIG to express our outrage that this kind of \nmoney could go out the door, when the only reason the company survives \ntoday is the $170 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars that has been pumped \ninto AIG over the past 6 months.\n  I recognize that my disgust with this situation is far from unique. I \nwish to briefly discuss the appalling double standard revealed by the \ntreatment of hundreds of thousands of honest autoworkers who are \nvictims of the current financial crisis, compared to the treatment of a \nfew hundred overpaid financial executives whose poor judgment and greed \nhelped cause AIG's and our Nation's financial crisis.\n  Right now, in large part because of the mortgage fraud, sleazy \nlending practices, outrageous financial engineering, and inadequate \nregulatory oversight that caused the financial crisis, we are in a deep \nrecession. The recession means people aren't buying\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\ncars, and many who want to buy a car cannot get a loan because credit \nis so tight. No one foresaw those circumstances back in 2007, when the \nUAW last negotiated a labor contract for this country's autoworkers. \nThat 4-year contract was supposed to last through 2011. When the bottom \nfell out of the economy, the future of the big three auto companies was \ncalled into question. The auto industry came to the Federal Government \nfor help, and we offered assistance in the form of bridge loans, with \nthe understanding that all the stakeholders would have to sacrifice to \nmake this a fair deal for taxpayers.\n  The autoworkers' response was not: We signed a 4-year contract and we \nare not changing a word.\n  They could have taken that position, but they didn't. Instead, the \nworkers renegotiated their contract. They agreed to significant \nreductions in their pay and benefits. They are doing what they can to \nhelp their company survive and help get our Nation out of this economic \nditch.\n  Contrast those autoworkers with the AIG executives. When the economy \nbegan tanking, AIG's stock nosedived, its assets plummeted in value, \nand the company lost its AAA credit rating. Due to hundreds of billions \nof dollars in commitments that AIG had issued, called credit default \nswaps, but which they failed to support with reserves, AIG's executives \ncame hat in hand to the Government. The Government responded with \nbillions of dollars in aid, not to protect AIG but to safeguard the \nU.S. economy from the threat posed by an AIG collapse.\n  AIG's executives, including the financial products division that \nhelped bring AIG down, were saved from bankruptcy. To recovery from \nAIG's financial fiasco and repay the Government loans, it should have \nbeen clear that everybody at AIG would have to make sacrifices to \nsustain the company and rebuild the U.S. economy. Unlike the \nautoworkers, however, AIG's executives didn't step to the plate. The \n400 or so AIG employees at the Financial Products division signed \nemployment contracts in the spring of 2008 that promised millions of \ndollars in bonuses and retention payments. When AIG attempted to \nrenegotiate those employment contracts, the Financial Products \nexecutives refused. They demanded their millions, and AIG complied at \nthe same time the company is borrowing tens of billions of dollars from \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  This week, according to the information of the New York attorney \ngeneral, Andrew Cuomo, 73 AIG executives received so-called retention \nbonuses of $1 million or more. That is 73 millionaires out of the AIG \nfiasco that is taking billions of taxpayer dollars to fix. Eleven of \nthose millionaires took the money and ran--they don't even work at AIG \nanymore.\n  Wall Street has been out of control for years now, with high-risk \nfinancial concoctions and with excessive compensation that is too often \nunrelated to performance or shareholder value. But the contrast between \nassembly line workers in the auto industry giving up their bonuses and \nbenefits to keep the big three in business, while executives who drove \nAIG over a cliff thumb their noses at the very taxpayers bailing them \nout, is simply too much to go unnoticed.\n  The greed and chutzpah shown by these executives is reprehensible--\nunacceptable to me, unacceptable to my constituents and unacceptable to \nthis body and to every American who believes, as I do, that our Nation \nperseveres through hard times by working toward our common interests \nand making shared sacrifice. American taxpayers are pouring billions \ninto AIG, even as millions of Americans have lost their jobs. Many more \nhave made sacrifices similar to the autoworkers to help their employers \nand their families survive.\n  AIG employees need to be clear: Without the U.S. Government, there \nwould be no AIG, and they would have no job and no salary, let alone a \nbonus--let alone a $1 million bonus. In these exceedingly difficult \ntimes, AIG executives should follow the example set by the American \nautoworkers and renegotiate their employment contracts and accept \ncompensation that doesn't shock and offend the American taxpayers who \nare keeping their company and this economy afloat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, H.R. 146 is the pending business; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 683\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 683.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 683.\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit funding for congressional earmarks for wasteful \n                      and parochial pork projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS \n                   FOR WASTEFUL AND PAROCHIAL PORK PROJECTS.\n\n       Sections 7203, 7404, 13006, 10001 through 10011, and \n     12003(a)(3) shall have no effect and none of the funds \n     authorized by this Act may be spent on a special resource \n     study of Estate Grange and other sites and resources \n     associated with Alexander Hamilton's life on St. Croix in the \n     United States Virgin Islands, a celebration of the 450th \n     anniversary of St. Augustine, Florida, and its Commemoration \n     Commission, the National Tropical Botanical Garden and the \n     operation and maintenance of gardens in Hawaii and Florida, \n     and a water project in California to restore salmon \n     populations in the San Joaquin River or the creation of a new \n     ocean exploration program to conduct scientific voyages to \n     locate, define and document shipwrecks and submerged sites.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is the last of the amendments I will \noffer on this bill. These are specifically five particular directed \nauthorizations and spending that really do not fit--maybe with the \nexception of one--that do not pass the smell test and do not pass the \ncommonsense test. I have no delusions about how the Congress will \nhandle this. We have demonstrated our inability to choke off our own \nparochial interests. These are five areas that, I believe, if the \nAmerican people really knew what they were about, would reject out of \nhand.\n  This bill is going to cost the American taxpayers $11 billion. If we \nadopt this amendment, we will reduce that by 10 percent.\n  In this bill is $3.5 million for a birthday celebration for the \noldest city in America, St. Augustine in Florida. That is going to \noccur 6 years from now. Think about that. We are in one of the most \ndifficult financial times we have experienced. Families are being hit \nseverely with unemployment, declining values of their savings, \ndeclining values of their No. 1 asset, their home, and we are going to \nauthorize $3.5 million to study how to best have a birthday party in a \ntown in America. It may be a great thing to celebrate this early city \nin our country, but it is not a great thing to steal $3.5 million from \nthe next two generations to pay for it. Noting, and I have said this on \nthe floor, that we will have a $2.2 trillion deficit this year, any \nexample of less than the tightest fiscal ship ought to be made fun of, \nit ought to be brought forward, it ought to be made public so people \ncan see it.\n  There is not a whole lot of difference between this and somebody \ninserting something in a bill to say the people who got the $176 \nmillion worth of bonuses will be able to keep them. That is what \nhappened in the conference. That is why the AIG problem is there, \nbecause some Member of Congress made it happen that way. We should be \njust as outraged when we see these kinds of projects earmarked in an \nauthorization bill that do not pass the smell test either.\n  There is $5 million for botanical gardens in Hawaii and Florida. We \ndon't have to spend that money. That is an option. This is directed \nauthorization to make sure when it comes to appropriations we know \nwhere it is going to go. It is going to go to somebody's benefit--some \nCongressman's benefit or some Senator's benefit.\n  So in this bill is a birthday celebration, $5 million for botanical \ngardens in\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\nHawaii and Florida, a controversial issue, to say the least, in terms \nof spending over $1 billion on a settlement claim on a river. Prior to \na dam being placed there, they already had a marked decline of the \nsalmon run in it. That is what the historical records show. But we have \na lawsuit and a Federal judge who says we are going to do this. By the \nway, we are going to put at risk $11 billion worth of commerce in some \nof the most productive areas of California. The metric on spending the \n$1 billion that has been agreed to is when you have 500 salmon. That \ncomes out to over $2 million a salmon. I have not figured that up by \nounce, but it is pretty expensive salmon. It is not to say we should \nnot do good things and right things to maintain fisheries and to \nmaintain natural salmon runs. The fact is, this happened a long time \nago, and it was diminished before there was ever an imprint in terms of \ndamming in the waterway.\n  There is also $250,000 to study Alexander Tyler's boyhood home in St. \nCroix, Virgin Islands, with the idea of making it a national landmark. \nFirst, it is not a priority--it cannot be a priority for us. It cannot \nbe a priority that we would spend money right now at this time when we \nare facing these significant difficulties financially, when, in fact, \nwe are going to borrow $7,000 per person across the whole Nation more \nthan we spend this year--$7,000. That works out to almost $30,000 a \nfamily that we are going to borrow against our kids and our grandkids. \nAnd then we have the gall to say it is OK to spend money on this.\n  The final aspect is a study and an authorization to allow an \nunspecified amount for a new national ocean exploration program and \nundersea research program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration that is tasked to conduct scientific voyages to locate, \ndefine, and document historic shipwrecks. There is $320 million \nauthorized to be spent over the next 7 years on that. It may be \nsomething we want to do when we have our ship aright and our ship is \nnot sinking, but to authorize and spend that money now on a new program \nto look for sunken ships does not pass the commonsense test this body \nought to be about.\n  We already have the following that documents shipwrecks, old ones as \nwell as new ones: the U.S. Coast Guard, the Library of Congress, 12 \nprivate museums, 8 libraries, 8 historical societies. And those are \njust a few. There are other Government sources, including the National \nArchives and Records Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Office \nof Distribution Services, the Defense Mapping Agency, the Smithsonian \nInstitution, the Naval Historical Center, and the Federal Building, \nGreat Lakes Courthouse papers. There are 12 separate museums and 8 \nother libraries and historical societies. There are 22 publications out \nthis year on shipwrecks. Oh, there are nine U.S. Government shipwreck \npublications, and there are eight other additional sets of records in \ncustody of the National Archives.\n  The other thing that this bill does is it throws five earmarks right \nat President Obama and says: We don't care what you said, we are going \nto do it anyway. It goes against his pledge. It goes against our \npledge. It goes against the idea of change you can believe in. It \ndiminishes hope when we have items such as this in this bill. It is \ndiscouraging to the people who are out there struggling that we would \nput such things in this bill. I understand they are authorizations and \nthey may not happen. I agree that you ought to authorize earmarks \nbefore we do them. But I can tell you, I don't think these pass any \nresemblance to anything that has common sense.\n  I will talk about this again in the morning. Tomorrow, I also plan, \nbefore the final vote on this bill, to list specifically over 30 \nwilderness areas that the wilderness study said should not be \ntransferred into wilderness as we do in this bill. Hear me clearly: 30 \nnew wilderness areas which the study said should not be included in the \nwilderness area that we have included in wilderness in this new bill. \nWhy spend the money on a study if you are not going to pay attention to \nit? Why did we waste all that money?\n  I will go through a limited but thorough critique of the bill again \ntomorrow.\n  I know the ranking member would like to speak and to praise a species \nof stamina and courage that I would only hope we would reflect in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Lance Mackey\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, my colleague from Oklahoma has given \nme a fine lead-in this evening to rise and tell an amazing story of an \nAlaskan dog musher named Lance Mackey and the story of his dog teams \nthat carried him to yet another recordbreaking victory today in the \ntoughest race on Earth, and that is the Iditarod.\n  The story of Lance Mackey is not only amazing because of his skill \nand his determination in the sport of dog mushing, but Lance Mackey has \nalso overcome some very incredible personal challenges. He had a \nvictory over cancer that preceded his victories in the sport of dog \nmushing.\n  Lance is a lifelong Alaskan. He married his high school sweetheart. \nHe has four children.\n  He was diagnosed with throat cancer after finishing in 36th place in \nthe 2001 Iditarod sled dog race. After that race--the man doesn't give \nup--he had extensive surgery and radiation treatment.\n  He attempted to complete the Iditarod the following year, in 2002, \nafter this surgery, but he had to scratch. He had to drop out of that \nrace, taking time off from dog mushing to recover from his cancer and \nthe surgery. He is now considered cancer free. He went on to win the \nYukon Quest, one of the two major sled dog races in Alaska. He did this \nin 2005 and 2006. Then Lance Mackey went on to do what no one had done \nbefore and what most people consider absolutely impossible. In 2007 and \n2008, he won both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod, two incredibly \ngrueling races, with only a week and a half in between each race to \nrest before he moved to the next event. For the first time in the \nhistory of the races, Lance had won both races, and he did so 2 years \nin a row. And today, Lance Mackey won the Iditarod yet again.\n  For those of you who may be unfamiliar with either the Iditarod or \nthe Yukon Quest, these races are the world's two longest sled dog \nraces. Both races span over 1,000 miles of really tough mountains, \nrugged mountains, frozen tundra, dense forests. These are true tests of \ndedication and determination. Not only does the rugged terrain pose \nimmense obstacles, but they have the weather that factors in. It is \nstarting to turn a little bit like spring around here, but back home it \nis still winter, and these mushers face temperatures which frequently \ndrop to 30 or 40 degrees below zero. And then they have the wind that \nkicks up, winds gusting up to about 100 miles per hour. So you can \nimagine what the wind chill factor is as you are racing those dogs in \nthe weather and the elements.\n  The annual Yukon Quest sled dog race is a 1,000-mile international \ntrek. It goes from Fairbanks, AK, over to Whitehorse in Canada. Lance \nMackey and his team of canine athletes have won this race 4 years in a \nrow.\n  The race Lance won for the third consecutive year today is the 1,100-\nmile Iditarod sled dog race. This race starts in Willow, AK, and ends \nup in Nome, AK. The race commemorates the 1925 diphtheria serum relay. \nThey ran dog teams in a relay to pass along a vaccine for \ndiphtheria. They needed to get it from Anchorage, where it had come in \nby ship, to Nome. At that point in time, we didn't have the ability for \nair transport to get into Nome. So how do you move it and how do you \nmove it quickly? Well, we resorted to a series of dog teams to move \nthat serum north and to save the lives of those who were infected.\n\n  Today, the Iditarod is no longer run as a relay, but it is a race of \nindividual dog sled teams. This 1,100-mile race takes the mushers into \nsome incredibly beautiful areas. The journey they travel through--the \nAlaskan wilderness--is exceptionally beautiful. But as I mentioned, you \nnot only have tough terrain but you have brutal weather. This year has \nbeen particularly tough, with the snow and the wind. It has caused \ndelays, it has caused real setbacks with the mushers and the teams as \nthey have been trying to go through high snowpack. There have been some \naccidents, there have been some sleds that have been lost, and it has \nbeen very difficult. We had some near hurricane-\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\nforce winds that forced dog musher Lou Packer and his dogs to be \nairlifted to safety, and he and his team had to quit the race. He \ndescribed what I would call life-threatening weather conditions by \nsaying:\n\n       We were climbing over this mountain and we got hit by this \n     wind that hit us like a hammer. The temperature dropped--\n     started plummeting--and I lost the trail. And the wind \n     started to build and build, and then the wind got bad, so I \n     climbed in my sled and it was pretty much a survival \n     situation at this point. I threw all the gear out of my sled \n     and climbed in and zipped it up; it was probably 30, 35 \n     below, I have no idea.\n\n  These are the types of individuals who train all year long with their \ndogs to prepare for this incredible race. So it is not just the musher \nwhose success we celebrate but it is these incredible four-legged \nathletes that are absolutely astounding.\n  Some of the other mushers out on the trail are pretty extraordinary \nfolks, such as John Baker, out of Nome, Sebastian Schnuelle and Aaron \nBurmeister. They were describing other conditions along the trail. \nSchnuelle described it as brutal, but he said:\n\n       At times the wind was blowing so hard out of Shaktoolik \n     that his dog team moved sideways.\n\n  Well, when you have about 15 or 16 dogs pulling a loaded sled and a \nmusher and you have winds that are blowing you sideways, you know you \nare in some weather. He commented further:\n\n       First we had snow and wind. Now we have wind and wind.\n\n  Well, earlier this afternoon, thousands gathered at the famous burled \nwood arch on Front Street in Nome, AK, to cheer on Lance Mackey as his \ndogs carried him to victory over his extremely talented and resilient \ncompetitors from all over the world. This is an international race, \nmost absolutely. Lance and his team of canines completed the race a \nlittle less than 3 hours short of 10 days.\n  Imagine yourself standing on the back of sled runners going over \nmountain ranges, going through ice and snow, in temperatures of 30 \nbelow and the wind howling at you. And that is fun, ladies and \ngentlemen. This is man and dog against Mother Nature, and the best \nteams sure are winning.\n  Alaskan newspapers tell a story of Lance's fired-up dog team after \ntaking his only 24-hour break during the race. He broke in a town \ncalled Takotna. After the layover was completed--you have to rest for \n24 hours, mandatory, because sometimes your teams don't want to rest; \nthey want to keep moving. Well, after this layover was completed, \nLance's 16 dogs were barking and pulling at their tug lines like they \nwere leaving the race's starting line. Lance said he had this amazing \nrun, and he was going to put the bale of straw out for the dogs to \nrest. He had every intention of stopping, but then he sees that his \ndogs are yelping and barking to get going, so he takes off. He said:\n\n       They're telling me what to do. So I dumped the straw, and \n     it's been heaven ever since.\n\n  What you have here, with this individual musher, Lance Mackey, who \ncares so deeply for the health and the condition of these four-legged \nathletes, is a guy who has shown a great mastery of working with and \ntraining these canine athletes for the sport of dog mushing. The \nAnchorage Daily News last year, when he won, stated:\n\n       A musher doesn't win four straight 1,000 mile Yukon Quests \n     and two straight Iditarods by making dogs run. He wins by \n     making dogs want to run.\n\n  Lance describes working with his dogs this way: He says:\n\n       The biggest challenge working with a large team of dogs is \n     the individual personalities. Like a classroom full of kids, \n     all with issues, wants, questions, some barking wildly to get \n     my attention, and then there are some who just do what needs \n     to be done and require only a nod or a smile. Every dog is \n     different. Every need is different. That is what I love. The \n     reward is seeing them all come together as a team working for \n     a common goal. It's just cool.\n\n  I had the opportunity last week--when I was up in the State for the \nceremonial start of the Iditarod--to go around and talk with the \nmushers and see all their teams. I had a chance to see Larry, his lead \ndog. My favorite is Lippy. I just kind of like the name, but Lippy has \ngreat little eyebrows. My favorite picture is with Lippy, but these \ndogs all have personalities unto themselves. And when they do come \ntogether as a team to do these incredible athletic feats, we must \nacknowledge and respect them.\n  Lance Mackey continues to impress all of us with his remarkable \nachievements and record-setting performances. He is an inspiration to \nothers who struggle with cancer. He named his dog kennel up north the \nLance Mackey's Comeback Kennel. I think that is most appropriate.\n  So it is my honor today to stand before the Senate to congratulate \nLance Mackey and his team of amazing dogs. Lance is a world-class dog \nmusher and a true Alaskan hero, and I wish him and his team continued \nsuccess and good health in the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for several months now we have been \ndiscussing earmarks or congressionally directed spending. This body has \nheard many false charges about earmarks. We have heard that earmarks \namount to wasteful spending. We have heard that taxpayers should not \nsupport these projects. We have even heard that earmarks don't actually \nbenefit our States.\n  Fortunately, my constituents understand that the rhetoric on earmarks \ndoesn't match the facts.\n  Nevadans know that these projects are brought to me by their mayors, \ncouncil members, and city managers. Nevadans know that, as their \nSenator, I understand their needs better than a faceless bureaucrat in \nWashington. And most importantly, Nevadans know how valuable earmarks \nare in a small State like ours to expand medical services, build \ninfrastructure, and provide other services.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \neditorial from Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist John L. Smith. Mr. \nSmith accurately points out the hypocrisy surrounding the earmarking \ndebate and provides examples of many beneficial earmarks for Nevada.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From Las Vegas Review-Journal, Mar. 18, 2009]\n\n  John L. Smith: Let's Do Right-Wing Thing and Send That Pork Back to \n                               Washington\n\n       Here's your chance, Nevada.\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\n       This is your golden opportunity to unfurl old ``Battle \n     Born'' and wave it proudly in the Libertarian breezes.\n       Come on, all you die-hard conservatives and daffy Obama \n     critics who these days find yourselves chattering endlessly \n     about the evils of pork barrel politics, ``earmarks'' and \n     government waste in general. Take time out from calling into \n     your favorite radio talk show and register your complaint.\n       This is the time to demand that your local and state \n     officials return the $100 million secured by Senate Majority \n     Leader and Silver State Pork Farmer Supreme Harry Reid in the \n     recent $410 billion federal spending bill. (Meanwhile, \n     Nevada's ``hard-core conservative'' John Ensign voted against \n     the bill after putting his fingerprints on $54 million in \n     earmarks. And he didn't even blush.)\n       Many conservatives have assailed the latest federal \n     shopping spree for being riddled with ``earmarks'' at a time \n     Congress had supposedly sworn off pork. You can't turn on a \n     television or open a newspaper without running into the \n     criticism.\n       So here's your chance, Nevada. Demand that your community's \n     portion of the money be returned.\n       If wicked old Clark County wants to keep its share of the \n     loot, that doesn't preclude the state's rural counties from \n     taking a righteous stand and marking the metaphorical \n     envelopes containing those federal handout checks ``Return to \n     Sender.'' Even if it isn't effective, just think how much \n     publicity your town will generate by tossing that federal \n     handout back into Uncle Sam's face.\n       Of course, criticizing government waste is easy. Rejecting \n     it when it's your turn at the trough is more difficult. A \n     quick perusal of the particulars of Nevada's $100 million \n     proves this out.\n       There's $807,500 for the Nevada Fair Housing Foreclosure \n     Effort, and another $507,000 for the Access to Healthcare \n     Network for uninsured Nevadans.\n       Remember the hepatitis C scandal? There's $523,000 \n     earmarked for the Southern Nevada Health District to fight \n     that battle.\n       There's nearly $1 million to assist the University of \n     Nevada Health Sciences System nursing program and $856,000 \n     each for the Clark County and Washoe County school districts \n     for dropout prevention.\n       There's more than $800,000 for University of Nevada, Reno \n     agriculture-related programs, and another $269,000 to help \n     Carson City battle erosion that followed the 2004 Waterfall \n     Fire.\n       Come on, Carson. Just say no.\n       While Clark and Washoe counties receive by far the greatest \n     percentage of federal funding for public safety improvements \n     for everything from training facilities to DNA labs, the city \n     of Fernley in Lyon County is due to get $300,000 for law \n     enforcement equipment.\n       While I've never thought much about the need for invasive \n     weed control, there's $235,000 for those who do at the Nevada \n     Department of Agriculture. Presumably, they'll be controlling \n     invasive weeds somewhere in the middle of Great Basin cattle \n     country.\n       There's $4.78 million for the Truckee Meadows Flood Control \n     Project, another $2.5 million for Truckee Canal \n     Reconstruction. There's more than $3 million for water \n     treatment at Lake Tahoe and $18 million for ``rural Nevada \n     water infrastructure and water quality projects.''\n       There's money to study wildlife habitat in central Nevada \n     lakes and to restore the Lahontan cutthroat trout population.\n       Inside town limits, there's $608,000 to help Wells recover \n     from its earthquake, $150,000 to restore St. Augustine's \n     Church in Austin, $475,000 for the Virginia & Truckee \n     Railroad, $190,000 for the Amargosa Valley Community Center, \n     $300,000 for wastewater treatment in Goldfield, $1.5 million \n     for an interpretive center in Elko, $285,000 for Truckee \n     Meadows Community College low-income student recruitment, and \n     $24,000 to help poor schoolchildren in Lincoln County.\n       One of my serious favorites is $381,000 for the Nevada \n     Cancer Institute to fund the Hope Coach ``mammovan,'' which \n     will provide cancer screening for women in the state's many \n     rural outposts.\n       This is a great project, but then I like pork spending.\n       Don't misunderstand: There's plenty to criticize about \n     earmarks and federal spending. Nevada's list of big \n     government projects made me scratch my head several times.\n       And there are compelling philosophical arguments to be made \n     against wide-open government checkbooks and big deficits. \n     Frankly, I'll be happy to have that discussion--as soon as \n     lowly, care-worn Nevada finishes getting its share. Until \n     then, I'll refrain from joining the Libertarian chorus.\n       That's the thing about pork.\n       It's easy to turn it down until the pig is roasted and the \n     platter is passed to you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3364-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3364-S3365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in a recent column for the Washington Post, \n``Obama's `Science' Fiction,'' Charles Krauthammer exposes President \nObama's efforts to destabilize the delicate balance between moral \nconcerns over destroying embryonic stem cells and advancing medical \nresearch that can be universally accepted.\n  President Obama's recent decision to authorize expanded and seemingly \nunlimited Federal funding for stem cell research eviscerates the \ndelicate balance forged by President Bush by forcing taxpayers to \nsupport embryonic creation and destruction. Mr. Krauthammer observed \nthat some may ``favor moving that moral line to additionally permit the \nuse of spare fertility clinic embryos,'' but ``President Obama replaced \nit with no line at all. He pointedly left open the creation of cloned \nand noncloned sperm-and-egg derived--human embryos solely for the \npurpose of dismemberment and use for parts.'' What is most concerning \nto me, and what Mr. Krauthammer succinctly exposes, is that President \nObama's new embryonic stem cell policy is devoid of any ethical \nstandards or guidelines. President Obama's decision makes the federal \ngovernment the final arbiter in a moral argument that defies many \nAmericans' core beliefs about the creation of life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his column be printed in the Record and \nI urge my colleagues to consider his thoughtful views.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 13, 2009]\n\n                       Obama's `Science' Fiction\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Last week, the White House invited me to a signing ceremony \n     overturning the Bush (43) executive order on stem cell \n     research. I assume this was because I have long argued in \n     these columns and during my five years on the President's \n     Council on Bioethics that, contrary to the Bush policy, \n     federal funding should be extended to research on embryonic \n     stem cell lines derived from discarded embryos in fertility \n     clinics.\n       I declined to attend. Once you show your face at these \n     things you become a tacit endorser of whatever they spring. \n     My caution was vindicated.\n       President Bush had restricted federal funding for embryonic \n     stem cell research to cells derived from embryos that had \n     already been destroyed (as of his speech of Aug. 9, 2001). \n     While I favor moving that moral line to additionally permit \n     the use of spare fertility clinic embryos, President Obama \n     replaced it with no line at all. He pointedly left open the \n     creation of cloned--and noncloned sperm-and-egg-derived--\n     human embryos solely for the purpose of dismemberment and use \n     for parts.\n       I am not religious. I do not believe that personhood is \n     conferred upon conception. But I also do not believe that a \n     human embryo is the moral equivalent of a hangnail and \n     deserves no more respect than an appendix. Moreover, given \n     the protean power of embryonic manipulation, the temptation \n     it presents to science and the well-recorded human propensity \n     for evil even in the pursuit of good, lines must be drawn. I \n     suggested the bright line prohibiting the deliberate creation \n     of human embryos solely for the instrumental purpose of \n     research--a clear violation of the categorical imperative not \n     to make a human life (even if only a potential human life) a \n     means rather than an end.\n       On this, Obama has nothing to say. He leaves it entirely to \n     the scientists. This is more than moral abdication. It is \n     acquiescence to the mystique of ``science'' and its inherent \n     moral benevolence. How anyone as sophisticated as Obama can \n     believe this within living memory of Mengele and Tuskegee and \n     the fake (and coercive) South Korean stem cell research is \n     hard to fathom.\n       That part of the ceremony, watched from the safe distance \n     of my office, made me uneasy. The other part--the \n     ostentatious issuance of a memorandum on ``restoring \n     scientific integrity to government decision-making''--would \n     have made me walk out.\n       Restoring? The implication, of course, is that while Obama \n     is guided solely by science, Bush was driven by dogma, \n     ideology and politics.\n       What an outrage. Bush's nationally televised stem cell \n     speech was the most morally serious address on medical ethics \n     ever given by an American president. It was so scrupulous in \n     presenting the best case for both his view and the contrary \n     view that until the last few minutes, the listener had no \n     idea where Bush would come out.\n       Obama's address was morally unserious in the extreme. It \n     was populated, as his didactic discourses always are, with a \n     forest of straw men. Such as his admonition that we must \n     resist the ``false choice between sound science and moral \n     values.'' Yet, exactly 2 minutes and 12 seconds later he went \n     on to declare that he would never open the door to the ``use \n     of cloning for human reproduction.''\n       Does he not think that a cloned human would be of \n     extraordinary scientific interest? And yet he banned it.\n       Is he so obtuse as not to see that he had just made a \n     choice of ethics over science? Yet, unlike Bush, who \n     painstakingly explained the balance of ethical and scientific \n     goods he was trying to achieve, Obama did not even pretend to \n     make the case why some practices are morally permissible and \n     others not.\n       This is not just intellectual laziness. It is the moral \n     arrogance of a man who continuously dismisses his critics as \n     ideological\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\n     while he is guided exclusively by pragmatism (in economics, \n     social policy, foreign policy) and science in medical ethics.\n       Science has everything to say about what is possible. \n     Science has nothing to say about what is permissible. Obama's \n     pretense that he will ``restore science to its rightful \n     place'' and make science, not ideology, dispositive in moral \n     debates is yet more rhetorical sleight of hand--this time to \n     abdicate decision-making and color his own ideological \n     preferences as authentically ``scientific.''\n       Dr. James Thomson, the pioneer of embryonic stem cells, \n     said ``if human embryonic stem cell research does not make \n     you at least a little bit uncomfortable, you have not thought \n     about it enough.'' Obama clearly has not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3365-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KENYA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, two human rights defenders, Oscar Kamau \nKingara and John Paul Oulu, were murdered in the streets of Nairobi, \nKenya 2 weeks ago. I was deeply saddened to learn of these murders and \njoin the call of U.S. Ambassador Ranneberger for an immediate, \ncomprehensive and transparent investigation of this crime. At the same \ntime, we cannot view these murders simply in isolation; these murders \nare part of a continuing pattern of extrajudicial killings with \nimpunity in Kenya. The slain activists were outspoken on the \nparticipation of Kenya's police in such killings and the continuing \nproblem of corruption throughout Kenya's security sector. If these and \nother underlying rule of law problems are not addressed, there is a \nvery real potential for political instability and armed conflict to \nreturn to Kenya.\n  In December 2007, Kenya made international news headlines as violence \nerupted after its general elections. Over 1,000 people were killed, and \nthe international community, under the leadership of Kofi Annan, \nrallied to broker a power-sharing agreement and stabilize the \ngovernment. In the immediate term, this initiative stopped the violence \nfrom worsening and has since been hailed as an example of successful \nconflict resolution. But as too often happens, once the agreement was \nsigned and the immediate threats receded, diplomatic engagement was \nscaled down. Now over a year later, while the power-sharing agreement \nremains intact, the fundamental problems that led to the violence in \nDecember 2007 remain unchanged. In some cases, they have even become \nworse.\n  Last October, the independent Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election \nViolence, known as the Waki Commission, issued its final report. The \nCommission called for the Kenyan government to establish a special \ntribunal to seek accountability for persons bearing the greatest \nresponsibility for the violence after the elections. It also \nrecommended immediate and comprehensive reform of Kenya's police \nservice. Philip Alston, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial \nkillings, echoed that recommendation in his report, which was released \nlast month. Alston found the police had been widely involved in the \npost-election violence and continue to carry out carefully planned \nextrajudicial killings. The Special Rapporteur also identified \nsystematic shortcomings and the need for reform in the judiciary and \nOffice of the Attorney General.\n  Despite these official reports, there has been very little action \ntoward implementing these recommendations. The Kenyan government has \nnot taken steps to establish the special tribunal. The police \ncommissioner and attorney general, both heavily implicated in these \nproblems, remain in their respective posts. Meanwhile, reported \nscandals involving maize and oil imports suggest that public corruption \nin Kenya remains pervasive and may be getting worse. This is generating \nincreased public resentment that can easily be exploited by armed \nmilitias and turn violent. I am especially worried about these \nheightened hostilities given the tensions expected to surround Kenya's \ncensus, which is scheduled for later this year and the potential for \nthem to flow over into next year's constitutional referendum, and \nultimately the 2012 general elections.\n  There is a lot of talk these days about conflict prevention. I see no \ngreater opportunity for conflict prevention in Africa right now than in \nKenya. The international community needs to coordinate its efforts to \nensure the Kenyan government addresses these fundamental problems of \ngovernance and rule of law. The United States has a key role to play in \nthis regard, especially given our longstanding and historic partnership \nwith Kenya. To that end, I was pleased that FBI Director Robert Mueller \nvisited Kenya 2 weeks ago and delivered a very clear message: ``Public \ncorruption should be a priority for all investigation and prosecution \nagencies in the country.'' We need to consistently reiterate that \nmessage and we need to back it up with concrete actions that both \nsupport reform and sanction individuals found guilty of kleptocracy.\n  In the months ahead, Kenya must get more attention from our senior \ngovernment officials. I hope the Obama administration's nominee for \nAssistant Secretary of State for African Affairs will be ready to give \nit that attention and develop an effective strategy for preventing \nconflict there. Allowing the status quo to persist will be far more \ncostly in the long run. Kenya is an extremely important country for the \nstability of the Horn of Africa and East Africa; it is a country of \ngreat talent and entrepreneurship, rich history and diversity. With all \nthose strengths, a promising and peaceful future is possible for Kenya \nand we must help its people to attain it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3365-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3365-S3367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Gas prices have not only affected our family for our \n     vehicle but also in heating fuel. We live 15 miles from town \n     and from our jobs, costing us an increase of $400-500 a \n     month. Our heating bills went from $89 to $389 a month. That \n     has had great impact our family. I am sure that it has on \n     many families. Our hope is that our legislators will find us \n     the resources that available to lower the costs. The cost of \n     living is above our wages for many people. Be it the wind and \n     solar power something needs to done. Thank you for your time.\n     Cindy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for the opportunity to comment. I am an architect \n     and travel to construction sites. It is obvious. The cost \n     goes up so I compromise with my clients; the price goes up a \n     little to them and my already slim margin goes down. \n     Everything is affected: transportation costs more so building \n     materials cost more so we get less buildings and \n     infrastructure for our money. My family gets to do less \n     together.\n       The nonsense is everywhere. In Boise our Mayor wants to \n     reinstitute a street car system. Why not create better bus \n     schedules so people will ride and save billions? The \n     ``environmentalists'' do not want us to recover our own \n     resources because they are looking at the processes of oil, \n     timber and mining of 50 and 100 years ago, not giving credit \n     to the enormous progress those industries have made in their \n     processes.\n       We have become a nation that consumes exponentially more \n     than it produces. If we do not repair that imbalance, it will \n     consume us destructively! Get the supply side in balance. Use \n     our own resources. Bring much manufacturing home. (The unions \n     have already priced themselves out of the market. They may \n     have to give a little.) Extract our own resources in the \n     environmentally safe and sound ways that are now known. Then \n     do not export our resources.\n       Lastly, as I have been saying for 20 years, explore and \n     support development of all logical alternative energy \n     sources.\n       Thanks for the opportunity to do my own pontificating!!\n     David, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Because all of the food in our area is trucked in the price \n     of groceries is naturally going to go up. I worry about the \n     young people that do not have large incomes and have\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\n     families to feed. Please be our voice of reason in this tough \n     time our wages stay the same and everything else rises. \n     Please do not let the rich run this country! Thank you for \n     listening.\n     Sheila, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Build nuclear energy plants.\n       Open ANWR, Wyoming, Utah and etc. The Great Salt Lake is \n     covering a bed of oil, a little sludgy, but oil just the \n     same, found by the only ``off shore'' rig set up there in the \n     late 70s or early 80s.\n       Fight for our right to open up our off shore oil \n     possibilities.\n       Tax incentives for solar energy for hot water, heating \n     homes.\n     Nancy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you, Mr. Crapo, for this opportunity. In addition to \n     my suggested impacts/solutions submitted yesterday, in \n     addition to the obvious need to drastically streamline the \n     NRC licensing process for nuclear reactors, perhaps the \n     single largest improvement to dropping the costs of virtually \n     all commodities, including crude oil, take all necessary \n     measures to regain the value of the U.S. dollar. Its record \n     weakness is impacting all market sectors virtually all \n     commodities purchased abroad.\n     Paul.\n                                  ____\n\n       I think you should be pushing with all of your might to \n     ramp up drilling for oil anywhere within our country and \n     offshore. For too long, we have tried the policy of powder \n     puff energy programs, ethanol, and environmentalist-led no \n     drilling mandates. We are now trying to adjust our lives to \n     survive the ``raging successes'' this policy has delivered to \n     the American people. My family, my friends, and I are all \n     getting really mad about this whole situation. It is \n     blatantly obvious that our current policies are total \n     failures. If this cannot be seen by our elected \n     representatives, then maybe we need some new people capable \n     of rational thought.\n       New technology, new power sources and innovative ways to \n     address our energy needs are embraced and supported by the \n     majority of Americans. However, the same majority fully \n     understands that it will take years, even decades, to \n     transition into these systems. While we are enduring this \n     transition, why punish ourselves with ever-escalating energy \n     costs by squandering our own natural resources.\n       Last September, I made a wonderful trip to Eastern Europe \n     (former Iron Curtain countries). While enjoying a coffee at \n     an outside cafe in ``Old Warsaw'', an old Polish gentleman \n     walked up and politely asked if he could sit down and talk to \n     me. He knew we were speaking English but was unsure if we \n     were Americans, Canadians, Australians, etc. When I said we \n     were Americans and he was most welcome to sit down, he was \n     delighted. Without hesitation, he started in on me by saying \n     ``do not you Americans realize that oil is a global \n     commodity''? We all pay the world price per barrel. He \n     continued by saying that we were sitting on a ton of oil \n     resources that we ``smugly'' refuse to develop and thereby \n     raise the price of oil for everybody. Maybe, he said, you \n     guys can afford it but we cannot. ``We Poles simply cannot \n     understand why it is not obvious to you what the production \n     of 2 or 3 million barrels of oil per day by you Americans \n     from your own resources would do to prices and your own \n     reputation around the world''. What could I say? He was \n     right. Before leaving, the old man looked me straight in the \n     eye and said ``remember, no country is so rich that it can \n     afford to squander it is natural resources''.\n       Drilling is a winner in many ways. By increasing supply we \n     will temper, even lower prices for crude. We will decrease \n     our dependence on hostile foreign suppliers whose production \n     can be disrupted at any time by a few radical people. New, \n     well-paying jobs for Americans will be developed. National \n     security will be advanced by not depending on anyone for our \n     energy needs. Last, but not least, we will always need \n     petroleum. I do not care what energy source drives our cars \n     in the future, they will roll on tires made from petroleum, \n     their bearings and moving parts will be lubricated and cooled \n     by petroleum based products. Our homes will be built with \n     plumbing pipes made from petroleum. The plastics used in cars \n     and untold millions of domestic uses are all petroleum based.\n       It is finally time we let the radical environmentalists \n     know that we gave them their chance to lead us to the energy \n     promised land and they have failed totally. The \n     environmentalists have always been a noisy bunch while the \n     rational thinkers have sat in the background. This is \n     starting to change; the regular people are getting worked up \n     and involved. Some meaningful new direction is now being \n     demanded. The one thing we have not tried is drill and \n     increase supply along with some new refining capability. We, \n     at last, are getting tired of paying unbelievable prices and \n     sending all the money offshore. We are getting tired of \n     watching a bunch of pompous politicians hold stupid hearings \n     and try to lay the whole problem at the feet of ``Big Oil''. \n     Contrary to popular opinion, we are a little smarter than \n     that. I do not think the politicians realize what absolute \n     fools they are making of themselves. Are we supposed to take \n     our business to ``Little Oil''?\n       Bottom line, this issue is so big and important, something \n     is going to happen, and you can count on it. Pie in the sky \n     dreams will not make it, business as usual will not make it, \n     and only straight forward policies that address our real \n     energy needs in the shortest possible time will make it. It \n     is popular among the liberal opposition to say that we cannot \n     drill our way out of this problem. Our answer should be that \n     we have tried all of your ideas and things have only gotten \n     worse. It is people like you liberals who say we cannot drill \n     and succeed, why should the average American believe your \n     analysis when you have done nothing but fail in a huge way.\n     Denny.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have no answer to the problem other than I know doing \n     nothing is not the answer. If 80% of Americans are in favor \n     of offshore drilling, then why are we not doing it? I would \n     like to see the government say to auto manufacturer who are \n     building cars in America with only 100% American-made auto \n     parts, build a car that can run with whatever fuel that does \n     not need gas and we will do something to help you. I am 80 \n     years old and not smart enough to know what that is or how to \n     do it but if the incentive was there it would get done and \n     make jobs for Americans.\n     Harold.\n                                  ____\n\n       I send this letter and information speaking for myself as \n     an individual and not the INL. I am a senior engineer at the \n     Idaho National Laboratory with 19 years of experience working \n     here doing heat transfer modeling. I received a Masters \n     Degree in Mechanical Engineering from BYU in 1989. I just \n     recently submitted a patent to the U.S. patent office through \n     the INL concerning a method to create all of our liquid \n     transportation fuels with a new process we are researching. \n     The process uses high temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) \n     to produce hydrogen, with electricity supplied by non-fossil \n     power plants. Biomass is used as the carbon source and heat \n     source for this cycle. When combining the biomass \n     gasification products with the hydrogen produced from HTSE, \n     liquid hydrocarbon fuels can be created with such processes \n     as the Fischer-Tropsch process. With this process, we could \n     make 13 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbon transportation \n     fuel each day that would go along with 7 million barrels \n     produced from U.S. oil supplies for the total of 20 million \n     barrels per day that we currently use. This means that we \n     would not need to import any oil from anyone. The success of \n     this process includes a huge amount of fossil-free \n     electricity. This can only be done with several hundred large \n     nuclear electricity power plants. These plants do not need to \n     be the NGNP or GEN-IV plants, but would be beneficial if they \n     are. The biomass gasification would supply the heat source \n     for the HTSE. We do not need an NGNP to supply the heat \n     source for the HTSE. This process converts more than 90% of \n     the carbon in the biomass to liquid fuels, while cellulosic \n     ethanol converts only 30%.\n       I am absolutely convinced after many years of thinking \n     about this that this will solve our nation's energy problems. \n     In order to accomplish this feat, the following needs to \n     occur:\n       (1) Increase the DOE funding for researching this promising \n     cycle by:\n       (a) Analyze, Develop, and Build a small scale version of \n     this production facility using Eastern Idaho biomass and \n     create liquid hydrocarbon transportation fuels.\n       (b) Drastically increase the funding for High Temperature \n     Steam Electrolysis performance, reliability, mass production, \n     and cost.\n       (c) Send funding to solve the nuclear fuel cycle for \n     recycling nuclear waste.\n       (2) With this huge increase in electrical power production \n     capacity, drastically increase the fleet of U.S. vehicles \n     using the plug-in hybrid methodology. These plug-in hybrids \n     solve our social need to be able to use electricity for short \n     trips to work each day, or liquid hydrocarbon fuels in a long \n     trip across the country. These are absolutely the way to go \n     as they are very fuel efficient and let us keep our wonderful \n     life-style that we enjoy here in America.\n       (3) Absolutely under no circumstance invoke the ``carbon \n     tax''. This will only send money from the rich nations to the \n     poor nations. If I ever hear anyone use the phrase ``carbon \n     tax'' again, it shows how uneducated they are on this topic. \n     The only source of carbon to the earth's atmosphere is the \n     combustion of fossil fuels. This is a one way street for the \n     carbon from underground to the earth's atmosphere where it \n     will stay for many hundreds if not thousands of years. This \n     phrase needs to be renamed ``fossil tax''. You can only tax \n     people that take the carbon out of the ground and sell it to \n     be combusted and put in the atmosphere. All of the other \n     carbon in the world like ethanol production needs to be left \n     alone, because it only recycles carbon from the atmosphere \n     back to the atmosphere again.\n       Thank you for your attention to this email. I would dearly \n     love to go over all of this with you in person. Please let me \n     know how we can meet together.\n     Grant.\n                                  ____\n\n       I thank you for the opportunity to share with you my views \n     on climate change. My husband and I recently made the \n     decision for me to stay home with our 9-month-old daughter. \n     Even though this has impacted our monthly income, we \n     nevertheless feel the increased fuel prices are a good thing \n     for our nation. It is about time we start paying the real \n     price of oil. When I hear stories of friends selling their \n     trucks for smaller cars, I grin ear-to-ear. For me, the high \n     prices have caused me to limit my trips to town\n\n[[Page S3367]]\n\n     and purchase more goods online (especially from sites where \n     the shipping is free). For my husband, he will begin \n     commuting to work by bike two days/week. The concept of \n     drilling for more domestic oil is a Band-aid approach to our \n     need for more oil. We would not see the results for years and \n     they would only be short-lived. Instead, states should be \n     focused on building city infrastructure and public \n     transportation systems to accommodate the new reality of high \n     fuel prices. As a nation, we should provide incentives for \n     alternative energy research. As a resident of Boise, I am \n     more than willing to utilize the bus system. However, Valley \n     Ride severely lacks what the Treasure Valley would need to \n     make it an appealing option. I came from a city where I \n     utilized two forms of public transportation a day (bus and \n     light rail). It was a inconvenient in some ways but mostly \n     wonderful considering I saved on gas money, read my book and \n     felt great about doing `my part' to help the environment. \n     Besides helping residents, a new and innovative public \n     transportation system appeals to those visiting our beautiful \n     valley as well. Our infrastructure and public transportation \n     system in the Treasure Valley lacks the innovation, \n     efficiency and foresight to become a real option for those \n     feeling the crunch of high gas prices. It is too bad that as \n     a nation, state, and county we are so reactive to issues like \n     this rather than leaders! Why not address the local changes \n     that we can make right here and now that will only continue \n     to benefit and serve us going forward?\n     Allison, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell how the \n     rising cost of gasoline is affecting my family. Just \n     yesterday, I had to cancel reservations I had made back in \n     March for a family vacation to the Oregon Coast in September. \n     This ``yurt'' vacation was going to be the highlight of our \n     year. In fact, we had been planning it since early in March. \n     Already living on a tight budget, this simple vacation would \n     have been an extravagance for us. But I was only able to \n     budget up to $4 a gallon for gas. Now that the price of gas \n     has reached the $4 mark and is expected to be much higher by \n     September, we had no choice but to cancel. We will be taking \n     a ``staycation'' instead.\n       My husband and I share one automobile and are already \n     conservative with our driving. Most days, he drives from our \n     house to the nearest bus stop (about 3 miles) to take a \n     crowded bus to work in downtown Boise. On the one to two days \n     a week that I need the car to drive to work, I have to get \n     him to and from the bus. We have been doing this for over a \n     year now. Our budget already required this of us when gas \n     prices were under $3 a gallon. We seem to have no other way \n     to cut back. My husband has been trying to get a job near \n     where we live which would enable him to ride his bicycle to \n     work but, so far, he hasn't been able to. For us, driving \n     less to save dollars at the pump means giving up some time we \n     would usually spend visiting with family and friends, most of \n     whom live 30 miles from us.\n       Perhaps the biggest way this has affected my family is that \n     we have continued to be unable to afford health insurance. \n     Though my husband has had a couple of good raises over the \n     past year and a half (and is insured through his employer), \n     those raises were eaten up in rising fuel and grocery prices. \n     So, I have been unable to budget in the nearly $400 month it \n     would cost to put myself and our two boys on health \n     insurance.\n       Again, thank you for this opportunity!\n     Susan, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not know if this will really help you, but anything is \n     worth a try, especially for the whole of the United States.\n       My story begins about a year ago, when I discovered I was \n     pregnant. My husband is blind! He receives SSI. Because of \n     this, if I work fulltime and gross $1,400 in a month, the \n     United States government takes away his SSI. OK, no problem. \n     If I claim our daughter and my husband, then not enough taxes \n     will be taken out, and I will owe at the end of the year and \n     struggle to pay what I will owe. If I do not claim our \n     daughter and my husband, then to survive every month will be \n     a challenge because my net income (take home) will be roughly \n     half and then that leaves little to pay the bills (as if we \n     have enough now). So I work parttime, and we still cannot pay \n     all our bills.\n       Our electricity bill was over $200 in one month, during \n     this last winter. With our daughter being a newborn, we just \n     did not want to risk the temperature lower than 65 degrees, \n     which is where we kept our thermostat, just to try to keep \n     the electric bill down. We did receive energy assistance; \n     that helped. However we are still behind in our electric \n     bill, and, to be perfectly honest with you, if I was to work \n     fulltime, I could not afford the fuel in the car. My car is a \n     1989 GEO Tracker which gets up to 25-28 miles per gallon. So \n     where does that leave my husband, our daughter and me? Broke \n     and completely reliant on the government to survive, \n     especially with the cost of food going up. Our $900 stimulus \n     check is not going to the economy; it is going to pay credit \n     card debt, just as my income tax return did.\n       Well, hopefully this will help you in your fight on Capitol \n     Hill.\n     Chrissy, Sagle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3367-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RECOGNIZING DUKE EYE CENTER\n\n Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I recognize the Duke Eye Center \nin North Carolina for its determined efforts to promote awareness, \ntreatment, and prevention of glaucoma. Glaucoma, an optic nerve \ndisease, is the leading cause of incurable blindness in the United \nStates. Worldwide, 70 million people suffer from the disease, 2.2 \nmillion of those in the United States. Because the disease does not \nusually show signs until the point that irreversible vision loss \noccurs, the development of early detection and prevention strategies is \nimperative.\n  We recently observed World Glaucoma Day, on March 12, 2009. In light \nof this important observance, I express my thanks for the researchers \nand staff at the Duke Eye Center, who are devoted to the task of \nuncovering the cause of glaucoma. Historically, most research and \ntreatment has focused on reducing elevated pressure within the eye. \nHowever, not everyone with glaucoma has elevated pressure, and not \neveryone with elevated pressure develops glaucoma. Researchers at the \nDuke Eye Center are working diligently to uncover other possible causes \nof the disease. Researchers and clinicians have excellent working \nrelationships, collaborating on genomics, oxidative stress, and even \nlinks to Alzheimer's disease. They are performing cutting edge \nresearch, while at the same time delivering cutting edge patient care.\n  In 2008, Ophthalmology Times ranked the Duke Eye Center fourth best \namong U.S. ophthalmology programs. I applaud their hard work and \nachievements in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of \nglaucoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3367-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3367-S3368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING BANCROFT CONTRACTING CORPORATION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a Maine \nsmall enterprise that epitomizes the values and commitment necessary to \nexcel not only as a business, but also as a leader in the community. \nBancroft Contracting Corporation, located in the western Maine town of \nSouth Paris, is one of the leading general contractors in Maine, and \ndoes superb work in industrial and commercial markets throughout New \nEngland. I am extremely proud to report that the Small Business \nAdministration has named Bancroft's president, Mark A. Bancroft, the \n2009 Maine Small Business Person of the Year.\n  Bancroft Contracting is a second-generation, family-owned company \nthat provides a wide range of construction and industrial maintenance \nservices to an array of diverse markets. Founded in 1977 by Al \nBancroft, the firm's customers include pulp and paper manufacturers, \npower-generating companies, State transportation departments, and \ncement and plastics manufacturers. Additionally, Bancroft Contracting \nsupplies thousands of cubic yards of reinforced concrete every season \nfor a variety of projects that include dams, bridges, and large \ncommercial foundations. The company employs more than 130 construction \nprofessionals in the winter months and upwards of 200 in the summer. \nBancroft's employees represent a wide spectrum of construction \nprofessions, from structural welders and pipe fitters, to riggers and \nironworkers, and they all possess an extraordinary level of expertise \nin their specialized areas.\n  Bancroft Contracting prides itself on relationship-based customer \nservice, and the company responds diligently to all customer requests \nin a prompt and efficient manner. In a similar vein, Bancroft takes \ncare to contribute significantly to the well-being of the western Maine \ncommunity. Organizations and institutions that have benefited from \nBancroft's generous contributions and services over the years include \nthe University of Maine, the area school department, the Boy Scouts, \nvarious local sports teams, Kiwanis, and the Rotary Club.\n  As Bancroft's president for the past 7 years, Mark Bancroft has had a \nsignificant impact on the company's direction. He is a graduate of the \nconstruction management technology program in the School of Engineering \nTechnology at the University of Maine. Notable, he started his tenure \nat Bancroft Contracting at the age of 14 and continued working for the \ncompany throughout high school and college. Mr. Bancroft learned the \nbusiness at an early age and received critical training\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\nfrom many of the company's skilled craftsmen.\n  Mr. Bancroft's desire to roll up his sleeves and his ability to \nunderstand the business from the ground up has earned him the respect \nof both his employees and customers alike. Before becoming president in \n2002, he worked in a variety of capacities throughout the years, \nserving as a project manager, human resources manager, operations \nmanager, and vice president of operations. It is this intricate \nknowledge of the business, along with his distinguished leadership, \nthat has resulted in Bancroft's tremendous 19 percent growth over the \nlast 3 years, defying the downward trend of too many firms during these \ndifficult economic times.\n  Additionally, Mr. Bancroft serves on several boards of trustees and \ndirectors, including, the Paris Utility District, University of Maine \nConstruction Management Technology Industrial Advisory Council, \nAssociated General Contractors of America Education Foundation Trust, \nand Self Insured Workers Compensation Group Trust. And just last week, \nMr. Bancroft was elected chair of the Associated General Contractors of \nMaine.\n  On a personal note, in the winter of 2008, Mr. Bancroft donated the \nuse of a crane and several employees to the town of Bethel to help the \ncommunity construct Olympia SnowWoman. This architectural feat is now \nin the ``Guinness Book of World Records'' as the largest snowwoman at \n122 feet and 1 inch tall--and what a record to hold! I am proud that \nMr. Bancroft played such an integral part in a project that brought a \ngreat sense of community pride to Bethel and to Maine.\n  It is my distinct honor to congratulate Mark Bancroft, an immensely \ndeserving individual, as the SBA's 2009 Small Business Person of the \nYear in Maine, and I extend my best wishes to everyone at Bancroft \nContracting for their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3368-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3368-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/18/senate-section/article/S3368-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:37 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 628.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants \nto support early college high schools and other dual enrollment \nprograms; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am doing my part to end the growing \ncrisis of high school dropouts. I am introducing the Fast Track to \nCollege Act, a bill to increase high school graduation rates and \nimprove access to college through the expansion of dual enrollment \nprograms and Early College High Schools. Such programs allow young \npeople to earn up to two years of college credit, including an \nAssociate's degree, while also earning their high school diploma.\n  As our country struggles with an economic recession, I believe we \nmust continue to invest in our public schools. While we must carefully \nconsider how taxpayer dollars are spent during these trying times, \neducation is one of the wisest investments we can make, and it is an \ninvestment that must be made now, before our children fall farther \nbehind.\n  Education provides an outstanding return on investment for taxpayers, \nand it builds the foundation for future economic growth. Young people \nwho drop out of high school are at increased risk for unemployment and \nincarceration, and they are more likely to depend on public assistance \nfor healthcare, housing, and other basic needs. Conversely, adults with \na bachelor's degree will earn two-thirds more than a high school \ngraduate over the course of their working lives, and they are much less \nlikely to experience unemployment or rely on social programs.\n  Our Nation's future depends on how we respond to the growing crisis \nin our schools, especially the rising number of high school dropouts. \nThis generation of Americans is the first in history to be less likely \nto graduate from high school than their parents, and the U.S. is the \nonly industrialized Nation where that is the case. This is not a \nsustainable trend if we hope to remain powerful and prosperous. Recent \nreports have illustrated the enormous challenge: the national \ngraduation rate is only 70 percent, and is significantly lower in many \nlarge urban school districts. For example, my home state of Wisconsin \nhas a relatively high graduation rate of 86 percent, but that rate \ndrops to only 46 percent in the urban schools in Milwaukee. Such an \nachievement gap cannot continue.\n  As we work to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act, we must find \nsolutions to the growing dropout crisis and provide opportunities for \nyoung people to pursue higher education. More funding is not the only \nanswer for the problems in our schools--we must also reform our whole \napproach to education. We must ensure that young people are being \nequipped with the skills they need to compete in a 21st century \neconomy. In particular, we can no longer view a high school diploma as \na satisfactory goal for students. In today's world, students need at \nleast two years of college or technical education in order to secure a \nwell-paying job and provide for themselves and their families.\n  That is why I ask my colleagues to support this bill, which provides \ncompetitive grant funding for Early College High Schools and other dual \nenrollment programs that allow low-income students to earn college \ncredit and a high school diploma at the same time. These programs put \nstudents on the fast track to college and increase the odds that they \nwill not only graduate, but go on to continue their education and \nsecure higher-paying jobs. The Gates Foundation has been funding \nevaluations of such programs for several years now, and they have shown \nincredible promise as a tool for increasing attendance, graduation, and \ncollege enrollment rates, particularly among low-income high school \nstudents. Students are motivated by a challenging curriculum and the \ntangible rewards of achievement, including free college credit and \nexposure to career opportunities. This free college credit is \ncritically important, especially in this economy, as family savings \ndwindle and tuition costs continue\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\nto rise. Dual enrollment programs can provide just enough costs savings \nto make college affordable, especially for low and middle-income \nfamilies who might think it is out of their reach.\n  Specifically, this bill authorizes $140,000,000 for competitive 6-\nyear grants to schools, with priority given to schools that serve low-\nincome students. The funding will help defray the costs of implementing \nnew programs, strengthening existing programs, and providing students \nand teachers with the resources they need to succeed in early college \nhigh schools and other dual enrollment programs. The bill also includes \n$10 million for states to provide support for these programs, as well \nas an evaluation component so we can measure the program's \neffectiveness.\n  I am proud to sponsor this legislation because I believe this \ninvestment in our schools will help solve the dropout crisis and secure \nAmerica's future by ensuring that all young people can compete in \ntoday's global economy. Further, I believe that all children, \nregardless of income or other factors, deserve equal opportunities to \nfulfill their potential, and it is both morally and fiscally \nresponsible for this Congress to invest in high-quality educational \nprograms that help them reach that potential.\n  While our country faces unprecedented challenges at this moment in \nhistory, I believe we also face incredible opportunities to shape our \nfuture. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Congress to \nreinvest in a world-class education system that will move our country \nforward into the 21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 627\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide incentives to physicians to practice in \nrural and medically underserved communities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Conrad State 30 \nImprovement Act to extend and expand this program's success in bringing \ndoctors to communities that would otherwise not have access to health \ncare services. In the last Congress, a very similar version of this \nbill had extremely widespread support in the medical community and a \ndiverse group of cosponsors in the Senate.\n  The Conrad State 30 program, which I helped create in 1994, has \nbrought thousands of physicians to underserved communities in all 50 \nStates, across our great country. Under the program, foreign doctors \nalready in the country for medical training are granted a waiver from a \nvisa requirement to return to their home country for 2 years. In \nexchange for this waiver, the doctors must commit to providing health \ncare to underserved populations in the United States for 3 years.\n  By 2020, some projections show that the United States may have \n200,000 fewer doctors than it needs; that is a staggering statistic, \nand one that cannot be taken lightly. If this shortfall is allowed to \nmaterialize, rural areas, like my State of North Dakota, will \nundoubtedly be among the hardest hit.\n  Given the looming deficit of doctors and an increasingly competitive \nglobal marketplace, it is vital that we maintain the incentives for \nqualified foreign physicians to serve patients in this country. The \nimmigration benefits historically provided by the Conrad 30 program, \nand enhanced in this bill, provide crucial incentives to foreign \ndoctors. When they do come to our country, it is vital that we make \nsure that they end up in the places that need them most.\n  This bill makes the Conrad 30 program permanent, something that I \nbelieve is long overdue. It also invites a new group of foreign doctors \nto take part in the program, a change that could dramatically expand \nthe pool of doctors practicing in rural and underserved areas. Further, \nthe bill creates a mechanism by which the current cap of 30 doctors per \nState can significantly expand, while protecting the interests of those \nStates that have had difficulty recruiting doctors under the program. \nFinally, the bill creates an important new incentive for doctors to \nparticipate in the program by granting them a green card cap exemption \nwhen they have completed their service.\n  I strongly believe the Conrad State 30 Improvement Act can be of \ngreat benefit to every state in the country and help combat the growing \nshortage of health care providers in the U.S.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 629. A bill to facilitate the part-time reemployment of \nannuitants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill with my \ncolleagues Senators Voinovich and Kohl that will strengthen the Federal \nGovernment's ability to serve the public at a time when Federal \nagencies face a wave of retirement of highly experienced employees.\n  When we think about the coming demographic shock of millions of Baby \nBoomers reaching retirement age, we usually focus on the cash-flow \nimplications for the Social Security and Medicare programs. But their \naging will also have a profound effect on the Federal workforce.\n  On average, retirements from the Federal workforce have exceeded \n50,000 a year for a decade. The numbers will certainly rise in the near \nfuture. The Office of Personnel Management calculates that 60 percent \nof the current Federal workforce, whose civilian component approaches \nthree million people, will be eligible to retire during the coming 10 \nyears.\n  Federal agencies, which already must hire more than a quarter-million \nnew employees each year, will need to work hard to replace those \nretirees, as the private sector and state and local governments will be \nfacing the same problem and competing for qualified replacements.\n  The Baby Boom retirement wave will have another impact. It will cause \na sudden acceleration in the loss of accumulated skills and mentoring \ncapabilities that experienced workers possess.\n  Research has repeatedly shown that, in general, older workers equal \nor outperform younger workers in organizational knowledge, ability to \nwork independently, commitment, productivity, flexibility, and \nmentoring ability. Making good use of their talents is, therefore, not \ncharity. It is common sense and sound management.\n  Federal agencies recognize the value of older workers, as witnessed \nby the fact that nearly 4,500 retirees have been allowed to return to \nfull-time work on a waiver basis.\n  Agencies could make use of even more Federal annuitants for short-\nterm projects or part-time work, but for a disincentive in current law.\n  Current law mandates that annuitants who return to work for the \nFederal Government must have their salary reduced by the amount of \ntheir annuity during the period of reemployment. The bill I introduce \ntoday with Senators Voinovich and Kohl would provide a limited but \nvital measure of relief to agencies who could benefit from the skills \nand knowledge of Federal retirees. It provides an opportunity for \nFederal agencies to reemploy retirees without requiring them to take \npay cuts based on their annuity payment.\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\n  This simple but powerful reform will provide some much needed hiring \nflexibilities for agencies, especially given the expertise the Federal \nGovernment will need to effectively implement the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a \nhearing earlier this month where we discussed how oversight entities \nwill meet their responsibilities to ensure that stimulus funds are \nspent effectively. Acting Comptroller General Gene Dodaro indicated \nthat the reemployment of annuitants is an essential authority that the \nGovernment Accountability Office uses when circumstances arise that \nrequire rapid staffing increases. Using statutory authority possessed \nby GAO, the agency is able to attract and hire back their annuitants \nwithout offsetting their pay by the amount of their pension.\n  Most executive branch agencies do not enjoy similar flexibility as \nGAO. Instead, current law requires these agencies to offset an \nannuitant's salary, unless the agency can first obtain a waiver from \nOPM. This waiver will be granted if the agency demonstrates to OPM that \nonly a particular annuitant is qualified to fill a particular need and \nthe annuitant will only return if his or her salary is not offset. The \nwaiver process is administratively cumbersome, and often prevents \nagencies from even considering a returning annuitant for an important \nposition.\n  Whether at GAO or in our Government's Inspectors General offices, \nexperienced, qualified former employees--with institutional knowledge--\ncould play an important role in oversight of stimulus spending. This \npoint was recently made by both Acting Comptroller General Dodaro and \nthe Chair of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and \nEfficiency, CIGIE, Phyllis Fong, in testimony before the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Inspectors General will have to quickly hire experienced auditors and \ninvestigators to ensure critical oversight of stimulus spending. This \nlegislation will allow IG offices to bring back valuable and \nexperienced employees to the Federal Government to ensure aggressive \noversight, enhanced transparency, and accountability for taxpayer \ndollars.\n\n  Ensuring an experienced acquisition workforce is available to oversee \nstimulus spending is just as critical. The government spent $532 \nbillion on contracts last year--a 140 percent increase from 2001 to \n2008. At the same time, the Federal Government entered the 21st century \nwith 22 percent fewer federal civilian acquisition personnel than it \nhad at the start of the 1990s. As early as 2012, 50 percent of this \nworkforce will be eligible to retire. This means that as our contract \nspending continues to increase dramatically, our contracting workforce \ncontinues to shrink. This legislation will allow agencies to bring in \nexperienced acquisition personnel at a time when they are desperately \nneeded--whether to ensure that stimulus funds are spent wisely or to \nhelp administer over $500 billion in government contract spending\n  Several organizations have endorsed the reforms in our bill, \nincluding the National Active and Retired Federal Employees \nAssociation, the Partnership for Public Service, and the Government \nManagers Coalition.\n  I would also note two important points about the bill.\n  First, it will not materially affect the necessary flow of younger \nworkers into Federal agencies. The bill contemplates reemployment for \npart-time or project work of not more than 520 hours in the first six \nmonths following the start of annuity payments, not more than 1,040 \nhours in any 12-month period, and not more than 3,120 hours total for \nthe annuitant's lifetime. In terms of eight-hour days, those figures \nare equivalent to 65, 130, and 390 days, respectively.\n  These limits will give agencies flexibility in assigning retirees to \nlimited-time or limited-scope projects, including mentoring and \ncollaboration, without evading or undermining the waiver requirement \nfor substantial or full-time employment of annuitants.\n  I would also note that this bill gives no cause for concern about \nfinancial impact. Reemployed annuitants would be performing work that \nthe agencies needed to do in any case, but would not require any \nadditional contributions to pension or savings plans. Meanwhile, their \nretiree health and life insurance benefits would be unaffected by their \npart-time work. Even without making any allowance for the positive \neffects of their organizational knowledge, commitment, productivity, \nand mentoring potential, their reemployment is likely to produce net \nsavings.\n  This measure offers benefits for Federal agencies, for Federal \nretirees who would welcome the opportunity to perform part-time work, \nand for taxpayers, especially during these tough economic times. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n        Sessions):\n  S. 630. A bill to make technical amendments to laws containing time \nperiods affecting judicial proceedings; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, today, we introduce the Statutory Time-\nPeriods Technical Amendments Act of 2009. I thank Senator Specter, the \nRanking Republican on the Judiciary Committee and Senators Whitehouse \nand Sessions, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Administrative \nOversight and Courts Subcommittee for cosponsoring.\n  This legislation incorporates recommendations from the Judicial \nConference of the United States to alter deadlines in certain statutes \naffecting court proceedings to account for recent amendments to the \nFederal time-computation rules. This bipartisan bill would provide \njudges and practitioners with commonsense deadlines that are less \nconfusing and less complex than current deadlines, and also ensure that \nexisting time periods are not shortened.\n  After much study and significant public comment, the Judicial \nConference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and \nthe Advisory Committees on Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil, and Criminal \nRules arrived at proposed new rules intended to provide predictability \nand uniformity to the current process of calculating court deadlines. \nThe proposed rules respond, in part, to findings from the Judicial \nConference that the current time-computation process is confusing and \ncan lead to missed deadlines and litigants' loss of important rights. \nUnder the current time-calculation rules, weekends and holidays are not \ncounted when calculating court deadlines of less than 30 days, but are \ncounted for calculating court deadlines longer than 30 days. The \nproposed new rules simplify this process by counting holidays and \nweekends regardless of a court deadline's time period. According to the \nJudicial Conference, these proposed changes would respond to \npractitioners' complaints and criticism from judges.\n  This legislation would amend a number of Federal civil and criminal \nstatutes affecting court proceedings and harmonize them with the \nproposed rules. First, this remedial bill would alter certain statutory \ncourt deadlines to counterbalance any shortening of the time period \nresulting from the ``days are days'' approach. For example, the bill \nchanges 5 days to 7 days, and 10 days to 14 days, to prevent time \nperiods from becoming shorter when a practitioner counts all days, \nincluding weekends. This change would, in effect, maintain the same \ntime periods in the statutes. In addition, if a time period ends on a \nholiday or a weekend the time period would be extended to the next \nbusiness day. The bill would also change some statutory deadlines that \nwould otherwise be inconsistent with the amended rules deadlines and \nlead to confusion.\n  This bipartisan legislation is time-sensitive. Both the Department of \nJustice and Judicial Conference urge swift consideration of this \nproposal, to allow it to take effect on December 1, 2009, the same date \nas the amendments to the rules.\n  According to a letter the Department of Justice sent to the Judicial \nConference last year: ``Failure to adopt statutory changes that move in \nconcert with the proposed rule changes will result in exactly the \nopposite effect of what is intended--changes to the rules alone will \nintroduce greater confusion rather than desirable simplification.'' \nAlthough the Obama administration has not formally weighed\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\nin on this legislation, I anticipate that the Justice Department will \nagain support this proposal. In addition, this bill mirrors the \nproposal from the Judicial Conference which enjoyed broad support from \nnumerous legal and bar organizations, including of the American College \nof Trial Lawyers, the Council of Appellate Lawyers, and the American \nBar Association's Section of Litigation and Criminal Justice Section.\n  I hope we will consider this measure expeditiously and improve the \neffectiveness of our judicial system. Passing this bill will create a \nconsistent and standard method for lawyers and judges to calculate \ncourt deadlines.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 630\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for nationwide expansion of the pilot \nprogram for national and State background checks on direct patient \naccess employees of long-term care facilities or providers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Patient Safety \nand Abuse Prevention Act along with my colleague, Senator Collins. This \nbill is the culmination of years of work and careful study, and would \ngo a long way to ensuring the safety of vulnerable older Americans. We \nhave hard evidence that this policy will work and will protect lives. \nIt is vital that we consider getting this legislation moving soon, and \nI look forward to working with the Finance Committee, the elder justice \ncommunity, and Congressman Joe Sestak in the House to make that happen.\n  Thousands of individuals with a history of substantiated abuse or a \ncriminal record are hired every year to work closely with exposed and \ndefenseless seniors within our nation's nursing homes and other long-\nterm care facilities. Because the current system of state-based \nbackground checks is haphazard, inconsistent, and full of gaping holes, \npredators can evade detection throughout the hiring process, securing \njobs that allow them to assault, abuse, and steal from defenseless \nelders.\n  We can and must take action to stop this type of abuse by building on \nthe resounding success of a seven-state background check pilot program, \nenacted as part of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, which enabled \nseven states to make major improvements in their existing screening \nprocedures of individuals applying for jobs in long-term care settings. \nThe results of this 3-year pilot program were a resounding success: \nmore than 7,200 individuals with a history of abuse or violence were \nkept out of the workforce in Alaska, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, \nNew Mexico, and Wisconsin.\n  The states who participated in the pilot have all chosen to continue \ntheir programs, and are taking additional steps to build on the success \nof the technological infrastructure they created. The Patient Safety \nand Abuse Prevention Act will expand these outstanding results \nnationwide by making it possible for all states to make these \ncommonsense improvements. The cost of enabling states to efficiently \nconnect registries and databases, expand the range of workers who are \nscreened, and add a national criminal history check is very modest. If \nstates take these steps, we can reduce the terrible toll of elder \nabuse. If we do not, experts tell us abuse rates will continue to rise.\n  Our straightforward approach is strongly endorsed by State Attorneys \nGeneral across the country, the Elder Justice Coalition, which speaks \nfor over 500 member organizations, AARP, the American Health Care \nAssociation, NCCNHR, the American Association of Homes and Services for \nthe Aging, and advocates in hundreds of communities who work every day \nto protect the well-being of elders and individuals with disabilities.\n  Last Congress, the Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act was passed \nunanimously out of the Finance Committee. We are so close to getting \nthis policy passed. I ask my colleagues to join Senators Collins, \nKerry, Whitehouse, Bingaman, Levin, Casey, Lincoln, Klobuchar, \nStabenow, Bayh, and Cochran in supporting our efforts to reduce and \nprevent abuse of our elders and loved ones.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that support material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the PARADE Intelligence Report, Mar. 1, 2009]\n\n                   Protecting the Elderly From Abuse\n\n                       (By Lyric Wallwork Winik)\n\n       In 2006, a 90-year-old New York grandmother was raped by a \n     caregiver with a criminal record. The man worked in the \n     nursing home where she lived. Similar incidents over the \n     years have led many to wonder how criminals end up working \n     with vulnerable populations in the first place.\n       While most states require background checks for nursing-\n     home employees, there is no national database that allows \n     employers to check for crimes committed in other states.\n       Sen. Herb Kohl (D., Wis.) has introduced legislation that \n     would require the creation of a national cross-referencing \n     system. According to the Senate Special Committee on\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\n     Aging, which Kohl leads, the Congressional Budget Office has \n     estimated the cost at $100 million over three years. A trial \n     program in seven states found that 7000 applicants for \n     eldercare positions had violent criminal records or a \n     substantiated history of abuse. Says Kohl, ``This policy is \n     more than just a good idea in theory--we've implemented it in \n     seven states and seen the results. Comprehensive background \n     checks are routine for those who work with young children, \n     and we should be protecting vulnerable seniors and disabled \n     Americans in the same way.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Roberts, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 632. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require \nthat the payment of the manufacturers' excise tax on recreational \nequipment be paid quarterly; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my friend \nSenator Crapo to introduce an important piece of legislation that would \nhelp to strengthen the financial health of America's firearm and \nammunition manufacturers, who in turn support wildlife conservation in \nAmerica.\n  The firearm and ammunition industry pays a Federal excise tax of 11 \npercent on long guns and ammunition and 10 percent on handguns. The Tax \nand Trade Bureau in the Treasury Department collects this tax. The \nBureau sends the proceeds to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, where \nthey are deposited into the Wildlife Restoration Trust Fund, also known \nthe Pittman-Robertson Trust Fund.\n  The tax is a major source of conservation funding in America. Since \n1991, the firearm and ammunition industry has contributed about $3 \nbillion to the Pittman-Robertson Fund and since the inception of the \ntax, has contributed over $5.5 billion. In 2008, over $321 million was \ncollected.\n  Of all the industries that pay excise taxes on the sale of their \nproducts to support wildlife conservation efforts, firearms and \nammunition manufacturers are the only ones that have to pay excise \ntaxes every 2 weeks. Other industries, such as archery and fishing, pay \ntheir tax every 3 months.\n  This frequent payment obligation imposes a costly and inequitable \nburden on the firearms and ammunition industry. Manufacturers spend \nthousands of additional man-hours just to administer the paperwork \nassociated with making the bi-weekly excise payments.\n  According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, changing the \ndeposit schedule from a bi-weekly to quarterly payment would save the \nindustry an estimated $21.6 million dollars a year. That is money that \nthe industry could use for investment in researching and developing new \nproducts, purchasing new manufacturing plants and equipment, and \ncommunicating with the hunting and shooting sports community.\n  Let me take a moment to explain what this legislation does not do. It \ndoes not reduce the firearm and ammunition industry's excise tax rates. \nIt simply adds fairness to the tax code.\n  It is important for my Colleagues to understand the history and \nnature of the firearm and ammunition excise tax. During the Great \nDepression, hunters and conservationists recognized that overharvesting \nof wildlife would destroy America's treasured wildlife and natural \nhabitats. Sportsmen, state wildlife agencies, and the firearm and \nammunition industries lobbied Congress to extend the existing 10 \npercent excise tax and impose a new 11 percent excise tax to create a \nnew fund. The fund was called the Pittman-Robertson Trust Fund after \nSenator Key Pittman of Nevada and Representative A. Willis Robertson of \nVirginia. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the legislation into \nlaw in 1937.\n\n  The industry, hunters, and conservationists came together to create \nthis structure. They recognized the importance of conservation. And \nthey encouraged Congress to impose a tax on their guns and ammo. It is \nrare thing when taxpayers ask to be taxed. But preserving our country's \nwildlife habitat was and continues to be that important.\n  Today, more than $700 million each year is generated and used \nexclusively to establish, restore, and protect wildlife habitats.\n  Now let me explain the effect that the bill we are introducing today \nwould have on the Pittman-Robertson Trust Fund. As the Joint Committee \non Taxation explained in its revenue estimate, the net budget effect to \nthe fund is $4 million. This is purely a result of the shift in the \ntiming of collections, from bi-weekly to quarterly, over a 10-year \nbudget window. Consumers of firearms and ammunition would still pay the \nexact same amount of tax.\n  The firearm and ammunition industry recognizes the ten-year $4 \nmillion loss to the trust fund. The industry developed a comprehensive \n5-year proposal to ease this effect. Under the proposal, the industry \nwould contribute $150,000 a year for the next 5 years, a total of \n$750,000, to the fund.\n  These actions again show the partnership between hunters, \nconservation groups, and the firearm and ammunition industry to protect \nconservation programs and initiatives. That's why this legislation is \nsupported by the following groups: Archery Trade Association; \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies; Boon and Young; \nCongressional Sportsmen's Foundation; Delta Waterfowl; Ducks Unlimited; \nNational Rifle Association; National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc.; \nNational Wild Turkey Federation; North American Wetlands Conservation \nCouncil; Pheasants Forever; Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation; Safari Club \nInternational; Wildlife Management Institute; U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService; and U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance.\n  I urge my Colleagues to support this legislation. I am very glad that \nSenators Lincoln, Snowe, Roberts, Ensign and Enzi have also signed onto \nthis legislation as original cosponsors. I hope that we can come \ntogether, just as the industry, hunters, and conservation groups have, \nto pass this legislation. It is a matter of tax fairness. Let us do our \npart to correct this inequity in the tax code. Let us do our part to \nsupport an American industry that in turn supports wildlife habitat \nrestoration and conservation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Firearms Fairness and \n     Affordability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TIME FOR PAYMENT OF MANUFACTURERS' EXCISE TAX ON \n                   RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 6302 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to mode or time of \n     collection) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Time for Payment of Manufacturers' Excise Tax on \n     Recreational Equipment.--The taxes imposed by subchapter D of \n     chapter 32 of this title (relating to taxes on recreational \n     equipment) shall be due and payable on the date for filing \n     the return for such taxes.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to articles sold by the manufacturer, producer, \n     or importer after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TESTER (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 633. A bill to establish a program for tribal colleges and \nuniversities within the Department of Health and Human Services and to \namend the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to authorize the \nprovision of grants and cooperative agreements to tribal colleges and \nuniversities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, my colleagues and I rise today to \nintroduce the Tribal Health Promotion and Tribal Colleges and \nUniversities Advancement Act of 2009.\n  Indian Education is perhaps the most important issue facing Indian \nCountry today because education represents hope. Higher education leads \nto better job opportunities. Better jobs lead to higher income. Higher \nincome leads to greater access to health care, adequate housing and \noverall, a higher quality of life. Higher quality of life leads to \nstrong communities. Happy, healthy and strong communities are more \nresistant to the destructive forces of poverty such as chemical abuse, \nviolence and neglect. This bill will improve Indian Country by \naddressing three of the most pressing issues facing it today: \nhealthcare, job creation and education.\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\n  No one disagrees that 85 percent unemployment in Indian Country is \nunacceptable. No one disagrees that it is unacceptable that the \nmajority of America's at-risk youth live in Indian Country. However, \nmerely reciting these statistics over and over will not make the \nsituation any better. We need to work together to make Indian Country a \nbetter place to live, work and raise a family.\n  We introduced this vital legislation to help advance the remarkable \nwork of tribal colleges and universities. Through grants awarded under \nthis bill, tribal colleges and universities will have additional \nresources necessary to strengthen Indian communities by providing \nhealthy living and disease prevention education, outreach and workforce \ndevelopment programs, research, and capacity building. Not only will it \nimprove education, but it will also improve the delivery of culturally \nappropriate health care services. In addition to good education and \nincreased access to health care, this bill will also help create good \njobs for tribal members living on American Indian reservations.\n  Tribal Colleges and Universities are accredited by independent, \nregional accreditation agencies, and like all institutions of higher \neducation, must undergo stringent performance reviews to retain their \naccreditation status. In addition to offering postsecondary education \nopportunities, tribal colleges serve reservation communities by \nproviding critical services including: libraries, community centers, \ncultural, historical and language programs; tribal archives, career \ncenters, economic development and business centers; health and wellness \ncenters, public meeting places, child and elder care centers. Despite \ntheir many obligations, functions, and notable achievements, tribal \ncolleges remain the most poorly funded institutions of higher education \nin this country.\n  The continued success and future of the Nation's tribal colleges and \nuniversities depends on their ability to provide higher education and \ncommunity outreach programs. For them to succeed however, they must \nhave the financial resources to do so.\n  As a Montanan and member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I am \nproud to introduce this legislation. I look forward to swift \nconsideration and eventual passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 635.
