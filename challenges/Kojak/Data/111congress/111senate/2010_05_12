Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Elena Kagan\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have only had a few days to consider \nthe President's latest nominee to the Supreme Court, but a few things \nare already becoming clear about the administration's approach to this \nvacancy.\n  As Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan is a member of the President's \nadministration. The President, on Monday, also said: We are friends. \nThe Vice President's chief of staff, who helped oversee her nomination, \nis evidently hard at work convincing members of the President's party \nthat they will have nothing to worry about in terms of Ms. Kagan's \npossible appointment.\n  But in our constitutional order, Justices are not on anybody's team. \nThey have a very different role to play. As a Supreme Court Justice, \nMs. Kagan's job description would change dramatically. Far from being a \nmember of the President's team, she would suddenly be serving as a \ncheck on it. This is why the Founders were insistent that Justices be \nindependent arbiters, not advocates.\n  As one of the Founders once put it:\n\n       Under a limited Constitution, the complete independence of \n     the courts of justice is peculiarly essential.\n\n  And further:\n\n       There is no liberty, if the power of judging be not \n     separated from the legislative and executive powers.\n\n  So it is my hope that the Obama administration does not think the \nideal Supreme Court nominee is someone who would rubberstamp its \npolicies. But this nomination does raise the question, and it is a \nquestion that needs to be answered. Americans want to know that Ms. \nKagan will be independent; that she will not prejudge cases based on \nher personal opinions; that she will treat everyone equally, as the \njudicial oath requires. That is the defining characteristic of any good \njudge, much less a judge on the Nation's highest Court.\n  The simple fact is, her lack of a record--especially her lack of a \njudicial record, and the fact that she does not have much of a record \nas a practicing lawyer either--gives us no way of answering that \nquestion at this particular point with any degree of comfort.\n  She has never had to develop the judicial habit of saying no to an \nadministration, and we cannot simply assume she would. Later this \nmorning, I will have an opportunity to meet with Ms. Kagan and to \nmention some of the concerns I have raised to her personally. We will \nwelcome her to the Capitol and congratulate her once again on her \nnomination. This is not an easy process for any nominee, but it is an \nimportant one.\n\n\n                            Miranda Warnings\n\n  Mr. President, President Hamid Karzai will visit the Capitol today to \ndiscuss the current situation in Afghanistan. His visit reminds us that \nthe surge of forces into Afghanistan is not yet complete and that the \ncounterinsurgency strategy developed by General McChrystal is still in \nits early stages.\n  President Karzai's visit also reminds us of the importance of \ncompleting our work on the war supplemental. We must complete this bill \nto fund our forces in the field, to help General McChrystal in his \nefforts to ensure that the Taliban does not return to power, and to \nensure that Afghanistan does not again become a sanctuary for \nterrorists.\n  Let's remember that the 9/11 attacks were planned in Afghanistan, and \nthat it was because of this attack and al-Qaida's many other attempts \nto kill innocent Americans that President Obama implemented a strategy \nfor reversing the momentum of the Taliban in Afghanistan last December.\n  This is why it is so worrisome and, frankly, baffling to hear the \nAttorney General say the administration's views on issuing Miranda \nwarnings to terrorists are now under reconsideration because of a ``new \nthreat,'' and because we are ``now dealing with international \nterrorism.''\n  Perhaps it is the reported involvement of TTP in the Times Square \nattack that the Attorney General believes is ``new.'' But most people \nhave been aware of the terrorist threat of international terrorists to \nthe homeland since September 11, 2001.\n  The fact is, the clear purpose of many of the antiterror policies \nthis administration in its first days tried to undo through Executive \norder was to deal with this threat that the Attorney General is now \ncalling ``new.'' These threats did not begin with the Times Square \nbomber any more than they ended on 9/11. They have been with us for a \nlong time now, and they are as urgent today as they were 9 years ago.\n\n\n                   Congressional Budget Office Report\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I would also like to note some news that might \nhave slipped past some people yesterday in the midst of everything else \nthat is going on. I am referring to the Congressional Budget Office \nreport that the health care bill is now expected to cost $115 billion \nmore than the administration said it would, wiping out every penny of \nsavings they claimed the bill would produce.\n  This is truly astounding. Here was one of the Democrats' primary \narguments in favor of their health care bill: that it would lower the \ndeficit. Yet now we are learning that it will not. But you will not \nhear a word about it from the people who made that argument day in and \nday out for more than a year.\n  The fact is, the list of failed promises is growing every day. They \ncalled us alarmists for saying businesses would dump employees from \ntheir insurance plan. Yet now it is being reported that some of the \nNation's biggest employers are seriously considering cutting employee \nhealth care and paying the lower cost penalties instead, just as we \npredicted. There goes the President's vow that ``if you like the plan \nyou have, you can keep it.''\n\n  Another thing we heard was that the health care bill would slow the \ngrowth of health care costs for families, businesses, and government. \nYet an analysis last month by the Obama administration's own Actuary \nfound that this bill will actually increase costs and that the national \nspending on health care alone could go up by $1/3 trillion--$1/3 \ntrillion.\n  The President and the Democrats in Congress said time and again that \ntheir health care bill would strengthen Medicare. Yet the \nadministration's own experts now say it would drive nearly one in six \nhospitals into debt and threaten access to care for seniors on \nMedicare.\n  They said the bill wouldn't raise taxes on the middle class. Yet now \nCongress's own bipartisan scorekeeper on the legislation says middle-\nclass taxpayers will pay billions more in taxes as a result of this \nbill. Millions more will get hit with a fine for choosing not to buy \ngovernment-approved insurance.\n  They said health insurance premiums would fall, but we have learned \nfrom the administration just this week that even some of the smaller \nreforms in this bill will actually drive up premiums.\n  So when Speaker Pelosi said we would have to pass this health care \nbill to find out what is in it, she knew what she was talking about, \nand what they are finding out is that Republicans were right all along. \nFor every promise that crumbles, another one of our warnings is \nvindicated. Day after day, Republicans said the health care bill would \nraise taxes, raise premiums, and cut Medicare for seniors. We said it \nwould increase costs because it didn't take an actuary to figure out \nthat you don't save money on health care by spending more on it. Yet, \neven in the face of the clearest proof that we were right on every \nsingle count, the people who forced this bill through Congress against \nthe will of the people continue to call us alarmists and to question \nour motives. But all of these headlines are already confirming what the \nAmerican people already believe and what Republicans said all along: \nMore government isn't the solution to out-of-control health care \nspending any more than spending money we don't have on\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\nprojects we don't need is the secret to robust job growth.\n  The American people are tired of the reckless spending and the failed \npromises, and they are tired of elected representatives who won't own \nup to their mistakes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Times Square Bombing Attempt\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, America was alarmed to learn that Times \nSquare was closed for business because of the potential of a bomb \nthreat. A vehicle was discovered with smoke coming out of it. Some \nalert people on the sidewalks and vendors called it to the attention of \npolice, and they determined the contents of that vehicle at least \nincluded the crude elements that could have resulted in a bomb killing \nmany innocent people. All they had to go on was the vehicle itself and \na fleeting glimpse of the person who might have been responsible \nleaving, changing his shirt as he left that vehicle. It was a \nfrightening situation where many innocent people who were visiting our \nlargest city in America could have been killed just as on 9/11. What \nhappened? Fifty-three hours later, our government arrested the prime \nsuspect, the man who has conceded he was responsible for that vehicle \nin Times Square--53 hours.\n  I listened to some of the criticisms from those who come to the floor \nand say we should do this better, we should be more vigilant, we should \nchange our approach. I would concede that we need to learn from every \nsingle incident how to make America safer, how to avoid those vehicles \neven being in Times Square in the first instance. But let's be honest--\nto arrest the person responsible for it within 53 hours is an \nindication of some pretty good work by law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials.\n  Then comes the argument about Miranda rights. Should we be treating \nterrorists as enemy combatants or as criminal defendants? Should they \nbe sent to military commissions for trial or to our courts? Well, the \nfact is, the person involved in the Times Square bombing incident was \nan American citizen. He cannot be tried in a military commission under \nexisting law. There is a recourse for him, and that is in the courts of \nAmerica.\n  If he is to be tried in the courts, the ordinary process of due \nprocess suggests he will receive a Miranda warning. In this \ncircumstance, after a number of hours of interrogation, the suspect was \ngiven his Miranda warnings. We hear them often on television. It didn't \ndeter him from continuing to offer information literally for days to \nour law enforcement and security officials.\n  Many have come to the floor and suggested it is a bad policy for us \nto consider giving Miranda warnings to those suspected of terrorism. \nWhat they failed to note--and I have never heard one of them concede--\nis this policy is a policy created by George W. Bush and his \nadministration after 9/11. They decided it would be the basic standard \nwhen it comes to interrogating suspected terrorists, particularly those \nwho are American citizens, that a Miranda warning would be given.\n  This past weekend, Attorney General Holder said he believes we should \nconsider some other elements in terms of when the Miranda warnings \nwould be given and when a person would be presented before a court. I \nthink that is a reasonable challenge for us to look to. But remember \nthat the last time the Congress tried to change basic Miranda warnings, \na very conservative Supreme Court across the street said no. They said, \nin fact, that this is part of due process in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  So let's approach this carefully. Let's try to take the politics out \nof it for a moment. Let's concede that the former Republican President \nmade Miranda warnings part of his ordinary process in dealing with \nterrorists.\n  Let's also acknowledge that a lot of hard-working men and women, in \nthe 53 hours after the discovery of that vehicle, did everything in \ntheir power to find the person responsible and were successful. Let's \ngive them some credit. These are men and women who work night and day, \nvirtually unheralded, who, in this instance, did an extraordinary job \nand should be acknowledged in a positive way and not in a negative way.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  There has also been conversation on the floor this morning about the \nhealth care reform bill. Make no mistake, not a single Republican \nSenator voted for it. In fact, they virtually boycotted the efforts to \nbuild this legislation, to write this legislation. Given ample \nopportunities to produce their own amendments or a substitute bill, \nthey did not. When they offered a few amendments, they turned out to be \namendments primarily designed to protect health insurance companies for \na program known as Medicare Advantage. So at the end of the day, only \nthe Democrats voted for health care reform.\n  Immediately, we heard from the other side of the aisle and from many \nof their supporters around the United States: Repeal it. Get rid of it.\n  Well, the American people see it differently. If Republican Senators \nare going to come to the floor and talk about polls, they should \nacknowledge that the polls clearly show the American people believe \nhealth care reform should be given a chance.\n  I think the Senator from Kentucky was suggesting to us this morning \nthat we need to pull the plug on health care right now and stop. So \ndoes that mean he wants to eliminate the small business tax credit \nincluded in health care reform to help businesses with fewer than 25 \nemployees pay for health insurance premiums? Does that mean the Senator \nfrom Kentucky wants to eliminate the $250 to be given to those under \nMedicare who use the Medicare Part D prescription drug program to fill \nthe so-called gap in coverage called the doughnut hole? Does he want to \neliminate that? Does the Senator from Kentucky want to eliminate our \nefforts to move forward so that children up to the age of 26 will be \ncovered by family plans while they are finishing college and looking \nfor a job? Does he want to eliminate and repeal that? Is that what he \nis looking for? I hope not.\n\n  The suggestion that we can't revisit this bill--and we will revisit \nit in the future--is just plain wrong. I have said on the floor before \nthat there are few perfect laws that have been written and not many by \nU.S. Senators. In this circumstance, we did our very best, working with \nthe experts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. I will be glad to concede the floor to one of \nmy Republican colleagues if they come during this 5-minute period.\n  When we wrote the health care reform bill, we relied on the best \nexperts we could find. We were dealing with one-sixth of the American \neconomy, which is the sum total of the cost of health care in our \nNation, and we did our very best to move forward. It would have been an \neasier task had we had the cooperation and joint efforts of the \nRepublican side of the aisle, but they decided to step away and say no.\n\n\n                              Secret Holds\n\n  The last point I wish to make is that we have reached a historic \nmilestone in the Senate with the Executive Calendar. At this point, we \nhave over 100 nominations to the Obama administration for positions, \nlarge and small, that have been held up by the other side of the aisle. \nI wish to salute Senator Claire McCaskill, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, \nand a number of my colleagues who have come to the floor and challenged \nthe fact that this calendar is glutted with over 100 nominees who can't \nbe brought to the floor for a vote.\n  Now let's examine a historical parallel. At the same time in \nPresident George W. Bush's administration, there were 20 nominees being \nheld. Now over 100 are being held. Overwhelmingly, these nominees have \npassed out of committee to the Senate floor with unanimous bipartisan \nvotes or overwhelming bipartisan votes. They are not controversial. \nThese men and women deserve an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote.\n  What is happening here is that these nominations are being held as \nbargaining chips for projects and for--I am not sure what. But it is \nunfair to these men and women who have said they will offer some time \nin their lives to public service and will go through the\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\nrigors of being examined and questioned and then stand up and try to \nhelp make this a better Nation by serving in a government post. There \nis nothing wrong with that. Whether it is Republican or Democrat--and \nmany of these are Republicans--they should have that opportunity.\n  I would suggest to the Republican side of the aisle, let's not use \nthese good men and women of both political parties as bargaining chips \nfor something else. Let's eliminate the so-called secret holds where \nSenators can, in fact, hold up these nominees without ever disclosing \npublicly that they are responsible. If they have a legitimate grievance \nagainst the nominee, make that grievance known publicly, argue it on \nthe floor. But to hold up innocent people, to leave them stranded on \nthe Executive Calendar for weeks and months is unfair to them and \ncertainly unfair to this administration.\n  I see the Senator from Tennessee in the Chamber, and I yield the \nfloor to my colleague from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3955\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Illinois.\n  I wish to speak for just a moment on the Corker amendment that will \nbe coming up very shortly, and I thank the Presiding Officer for the \ntime.\n  First of all, I thank Senator Gregg, Senator LeMieux, Senator Coburn, \nand Senator Brown for being cosponsors. I thank Senator Shelby for all \nhe has done to help support and make this amendment possible as well as \nSenator Isakson, who brings a wealth of experience to this body as it \nrelates to real estate lending. I thank all of them for their support \nof this amendment.\n  It is a basic, commonsense amendment. I think everybody in this body \nknows that we as a country are going down a pretty slippery slope and \nthat we as politicians act as enablers. We don't tell people what they \nneed to hear. Instead, we try to give them what they want without any \ndegree of discipline.\n  What this amendment does is restore within the housing market a focus \non the core issue that took us into this crisis--something many people \nin this body do not want to discuss--and that is the fact that there \nwere a lot of loans written to people who had no ability whatsoever to \npay them back.\n  So this amendment does some very simple things. No. 1, it requires a \nvery modest 5-percent downpayment for new home mortgages. If someone \nborrows more than 80 percent loan to value, it requires a credit \nenhancement--something that has been part of the American psyche for a \nlong time. Believe it or not, it asks that there be fully documented \nincome, including credit history and employment history. Gosh, what a \nbig issue that would be, just to know someone had the ability to pay \nback the loan. Then it requires a method for determining the borrower's \nability to repay, including consideration of their debt-to-income \nratio, which is very important. So this would be done by banking \nregulators. It does not apply to VA or rural housing administration \nmortgages. It does give an exemption for organizations such as Habitat \nand Enterprise and others that allow homeowners to use sweat equity to \nactually build up some equity in a home.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. While I respect Senators on the \nother side of the aisle, Senators Merkley and Klobuchar, who have \nworked on a side-by-side, I want to say to people in this body that \nwhile that is a good-intentioned amendment, what it does is build on \nthe construct of the Dodd bill where, in essence, we are giving to this \nnew consumer protection agency the ability to do loan underwriting. I \nthink that is a dangerous path for our country to go down.\n  I thank my colleagues for letting me give an overview of this \namendment, and I urge everybody in this body to support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor in support of the \nMerkley-Klobuchar amendment to prohibit kickbacks to lenders who steer \nhomeowners into bad mortgages.\n  The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations recently \ncompleted an 18-month investigation and a series of four hearings \nlooking into some of the causes and consequences of the financial \ncrisis. In our first hearing, the subcommittee examined the high-risk \nlending practices of Washington Mutual Bank, ``WaMu,'' which led to the \nlargest U.S. bank failure of all time. WaMu was brought to the \nprecipice of collapse, in large part, by irresponsible and abusive home \nlending practices such as steering homeowners into high-risk and high-\ncost loans, and failing to even verify borrower income when making \nthose loans. The Merkley-Klobuchar amendment prohibits those practices, \nand would go a long way towards preventing the irresponsible behavior \nthat led to the financial crisis.\n  In the years prior to its failure, WaMu routinely issued stated \nincome and negatively amortizing loans, which undermined the safety and \nsoundness of the bank and injected hundreds of billions of dollars of \nhigh-risk loans into the U.S. financial system. Stated income mortgage \nloans, sometimes called ``liar loans'' or ``no-doc'' loans, allow \nborrowers to write their income on a loan application, without offering \nproof such as a pay stub or W-2 form, and without lender verification. \nStated income loans made up 90 percent of WaMu's home equity loans, 73 \npercent of its option arms, and 50 percent of its subprime loans. \nDuring our hearings on regulatory oversight of WaMu's high-risk \nlending, both regulators--the Office of Thrift Supervision and Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation--supported an end to stated income loans, \nand inspectors general from those same agencies also advocated that \nCongress consider doing so.\n  It's no surprise that WaMu loan originators were steering borrowers \ninto high-risk, high-cost loans, because they were being paid more to \ndo it. Wall Street had an appetite for high-risk loans, and so WaMu \nbuilt a conveyor belt to churn them out. In order to generate the \nvolume of high-risk loans needed to keep the conveyor belt running, \nWaMu had to convince people to take out high-risk loans, like Option \nARMs, in lieu of low-risk fixed rate loans. WaMu paid loan originators \nand mortgage brokers much more for issuing these high-risk loans, and \nso the originators and brokers would do the convincing, and make the \nsales.\n  It is time to stop those dangerous lending practices, which had such \ndisastrous consequences for the U.S. financial system, our economy, and \nAmerican families.\n  The Merkley-Klobuchar amendment contains one clause that does concern \nme. The amendment explicitly allows loan personnel to be paid bonuses \nfor loan volume. The recent financial crisis shows how dangerous loan \nvolume incentives are--they encourage loan officers and mortgage \nbrokers to issue as many loans as possible as quickly as possible, with \nthe inevitable consequence being shoddy lending in which loan personnel \ncut corners and churn out loans to boost their compensation. Our \nhearing demonstrated how the bonuses paid by WaMu for loan volume and \nspeed resulted in poor quality and even fraudulent loans. It is my hope \nthat the regulators recognize the problem and interpret that provision \nto permit banks to assign bonuses for only a reasonable number of \nloans, and that those same bonuses also be made contingent on good \nquality lending. Regulators should interpret the provision in the \ncontext of the overall amendment whose clear aim is to prohibit shoddy \nlending practices and shut down the type of conveyor belt lending that \ndumped so many toxic loans into the marketplace.\n  The Merkley-Klobuchar amendment takes the steps needed to bar stated \nincome loans. It doesn't go as far with respect to negatively \namortizing loans, although it takes an important initial step. That \nstep is requiring lenders to qualify borrowers for these loans by \nevaluating their ability to pay the highest interest rate that would be \ncharged at any time during the first 5 years of the loan. While that is \na good first step, I have introduced an amendment with Senator Kaufman \nthat would go further and would effectively ban negatively amortizing \nloans because of their detrimental impact on the safety and soundness \nof individual financial institutions and the financial system as a \nwhole.\n  WaMu's experience with neg am loans shows why these loans were so\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\ndangerous to its operations. In 2006, more than 95 percent of WaMu's \nOption ARM borrowers made minimum payments, and, by the end of 2007, 84 \npercent of the total value of the Option ARMS in WaMu's portfolio were \nnegatively amortizing. WaMu projected that negative amortization \nincreased monthly mortgage payments for borrowers by 60 percent. \nRegulators found instances at its subprime originator, Long Beach \nMortgage, of payment shock as high as 240 percent, where a loan payment \njumped from $1,700 to $5,705 per month, with no data showing the \nborrower could afford the extra $4,000. Not surprisingly, the payment \nshock from much higher loan payments led to loan defaults by a large \nnumber of borrowers. According to the Treasury and FDIC Inspectors \nGeneral, WaMu failed largely because of its high-risk loans. The \nsubcommittee investigation found that these high-risk loans also \ncontributed to the 2008 financial crisis, by loading up the financial \nsystem with toxic mortgages.\n  I am cosponsoring the Merkley-Klobuchar amendment because it would \ntake the steps necessary to end stated income loans and lending \npractices that cause loan officers to steer borrowers to high-cost, \nhigh-risk loans.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3759\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their work on \nthis amendment. But, as I have stated, I believe it will fuel, and not \nlimit, the type of charter shopping in search of the most lax regulator \nthat we have seen in this past crisis.\n  The Hutchinson amendment would preserve the status quo by allowing \nthe Federal Reserve to continue regulating about 845 State banks that \nare members of the Federal Reserve System out of a total of \napproximately 6,000 State banks.\n  This is a tremendous shame. Over the last 2 years, I sat through 80 \nhearings, listening to witnesses discuss the failings of the Fed--the \nfailure of the agency to write rules protecting consumers, the failure \nof the agency to regulate derivatives, and its failure to properly \nsupervise holding companies.\n  In response to these hearings, I initially introduced a bill that \nwould have both streamlined our bank regulatory system and stopped \nbanks from being able to engage in regulatory arbitrage. It would have \nconsolidated the bank supervisory functions of four regulatory \nagencies--the OCC, the OTS, the FDIC, and the Fed--and would have \ncreated a single new agency to supervise banks. In other words, it \nwould have taken the Fed out of the business of bank supervision \nentirely.\n  I ended up modifying this proposal in response to concerns raised by \nmy colleagues, but the bill that we passed out of committee still \nconsolidates bank regulatory functions in a clear and logical way. It \neliminates the OTS, and gives supervision of all federally chartered \ndepositories to the OCC, and all State-chartered depositories, \nincluding both State member and nonmember banks, to the FDIC.\n  And small holding companies and their banks are supervised by a \nsingle regulator. We looked into how these companies are structured and \ndetermined that in most cases these holding companies are just shells \nand their primary assets are just simply banks. In these circumstances, \nit just makes no sense to have a separate holding company regulator. \nSo, under the bill, small national banks and their holding companies \nare regulated by the OCC. And small State-chartered banks and their \nholding companies are regulated by the FDIC.\n  Meanwhile, the bill requires the Fed to focus on several key areas--\nits monetary policy role, and its role as lender of last resort. It \nalso expands the Fed's reach into areas that compliment these central \nbank functions.\n  The bill gives the Fed supervision of bank holding companies with $50 \nbillion in assets and over, and the supervision of other nonbank \nfinancial companies if the failure of these companies would pose a risk \nto the U.S. financial stability.\n  The Fed is given the responsibility to establish heightened \nprudential standards for these companies, including tougher capital and \nliquidity requires.\n  And, the bill gives the Fed additional authority to regulate the \npayments system.\n  But apparently this isn't enough.\n  One of the main arguments the Fed makes for retaining this authority \nis that it needs a window into the workings of small banks in order to \nformulate monetary policy.\n  I say to my colleagues--this is a red herring. Take a look at the \nFed's Beige Book. The Fed is able to collect information about a \nvariety of sectors in the economy--about manufacturing, real estate, \nthe energy sector, and the agricultural sector without direct \nregulation in these areas.\n  And by law, the Fed can already gather any information it wants from \nany depository institution--whether it regulates that institution or \nnot. Let me read from the relevant parts of the law:\n\n       The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall \n     be authorized and empowered . . . to require any depository \n     institution specified in this paragraph to make, at such \n     intervals as the Board may prescribe, such reports of its \n     liabilities and assets as the Board may determine to be \n     necessary or desirable to enable the Board to discharge its \n     responsibility to monitor and control monetary and credit \n     aggregates. [12 USC 248(a).]\n\n  The Fed also is arguing that it needs to be the regulator of all \nholding companies so that it can respond effectively in the event of a \nregional crisis.\n  I ask my colleagues--do we need a regulator that can respond \neffectively in the event of a regional crisis or that can effectively \nprevent the next crisis from occurring?\n  I would like to point out the possible downside of allowing the Fed \nto continue supervising State member banks.\n  Let me play this out. The agency that regulates this country's \nlargest national banks is the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, which is a bureau of the Treasury Department. The OCC is \nfunded through assessments on the banks that it regulates.\n  By contrast, the FDIC and the Fed use revenues from their other \noperations to pay for their supervisory activities and don't charge \ntheir banks for examinations. State banks are examined by State \nauthorities every other year, but the States do not charge as much as \nthe OCC. So, it is much cheaper to be a State bank.\n  I fear that the very largest national banks will have tremendous \nincentives to become State member banks so that they will have a single \nFederal regulator--the Federal Reserve. This will concentrate enormous \npower in the Federal Reserve System--an agency that the financial \ncrisis has shown is already stretched too thin with its many and varied \nresponsibilities.\n  This could also result in increased regulatory arbitrage. Since the \nOCC depends on assessments from the banks it regulates to fund its \noperations, the agency may go to great lengths to keep its banks from \nconverting to State charters. We have seen what happens when depository \ninstitutions exploit these weaknesses in our bank regulatory system and \nwhen agencies compromise their supervisory integrity to maintain \ncompanies within their domain.\n  If this happens, we could have another race to the bottom--just like \nthe competition and regulatory arbitrage that lead to the financial \ncrisis.\n  Some will argue that my fears are unfounded, but I remain concerned \nabout the unintended consequences that will flow from the Fed's \ncontinued regulation of State member banks.\n  And therefore I oppose the Hutchison amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today, we have two amendments that \naddress integrity in retail mortgage origination. I am certainly \nencouraging you to place your vote squarely for the Merkley-Klobuchar \namendment.\n  This amendment is critical to end no-document liar loans--a big \nfactor in the meltdown that occurred last year.\n  Second, it establishes underwriting integrity so that underwriters \nwill look at loan to value, credit history, and current obligations--\nagain, integrity of mortgages--which enables loans to be securitized \nand creates liquidity\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\nso families can get loans at a lower interest rate.\n  Third, the Merkley-Klobuchar amendment ends steering payments. This \nis essential. The originators have been in an awkward position where \nthey have been paid bonuses for making deals that weren't in their \nclients' interests.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there is \n2 minutes of debate prior to a vote on amendment No. 3955, offered by \nthe Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I think everybody in this body knows the \ncore of this last financial crisis was because there were a lot of \nloans written in this country that people couldn't pay back. The Dodd \nbill does a lot, but it doesn't deal with that basic core issue of loan \nunderwriting. This is an opportunity for people on both sides of the \naisle to support a commonsense amendment that requires a 5-percent \ndownpayment, with fully documented income, including an employment \nhistory and a credit history, which I think all of us would like to \nsee, and a method for determining the borrower's ability to repay and \nthat being part of loan underwriting put in place by bank regulators.\n  This commonsense amendment should be supported by both sides of the \naisle. It gives the ability for Habitat, for Enterprise, for those \norganizations that use sweat equity to be excluded. This is something \nwe all know needs to be common practice. Let's put it in the law and \nensure that another financial crisis doesn't come on the backs of \nhomeowners who borrow money, by the way, irresponsibly, and we enable \nthem to do it. Let's vote for something that ensures that common sense \nis in place in loan underwriting.\n  This is a good amendment, and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Tennessee. He has been a \npositive, constructive Member of this effort before us, but I oppose \nhis amendment for two reasons.\n  First of all, it creates a very bright line of mandating 5 percent. \nEvery nonprofit, all FHA mortgages would be subject to that rule, which \nwould exclude an awful lot. The Merkley-Klobuchar amendment we just \nadopted establishes underwriting standards.\n  Further, what the Corker amendment does is it strips out the skin in \nthe game. One of the things we learned is that brokers and mortgage \ndealers had no skin in the game. They were selling off these items and \nthey didn't care what was in it because they were being paid.\n  Under an amendment we will adopt after the Corker amendment is \nconsidered--the Isakson-Landrieu amendment--we will set a standard \nallowing for the option of that skin in the game, which I think \nstrengthens the bill even further, and I appreciate Senator Isakson and \nSenator Landrieu offering that idea to this bill that will come right \nafter this.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues, respectfully, to reject the \nCorker amendment.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. CORKER.

Mr. President, what I wish to do at this juncture, if we \ncould, is we have an amendment being offered by our colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, and our colleague from Georgia, Senator \nIsakson.\n  I believe if they take 10 minutes or so, we could do it on a voice \nvote. I support and, in fact, I am a cosponsor of their amendment. I \nthink it strengthens our bill tremendously. I want to thank my \ncolleague from Georgia very much, who has forgotten more about real \nestate than most of us will ever know, having spent a good separate \npart of his life involved in the business.\n  We have worked together on a lot of issues over the last couple of \nyears related to real estate.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3956 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his \nacknowledgment and his work with us on this amendment. It has broad \nbipartisan support. I offer it on behalf of myself and the good Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Isakson, whose expertise in housing matters is well \nknown; also on behalf of Senator Warner, Senator Hagan, Senator \nMenendez, Senator Tester, Senators Lincoln, Levin, Burr, and Hutchison.\n  We have broad and deep bipartisan support for this amendment, and the \nreason we do is because it is a good amendment and, more specifically, \nit addresses the risk retention provisions currently in the bill by \nhelping to eliminate the excessive risk taking we saw in the home \nmortgage market between 2004 and 2007, without raising interest rates \nfor those home buyers who have maintained good credit, document their \nincome and assets, and finance their home the old-fashioned way. Back \nto the basics, with savings.\n  I call up amendment No 3956 at this time, and offer it for the \nSenate's consideration. I wish to also give 1 minute on our side to the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and then turn it over to my \ncolleague from Georgia.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the \nSmall Business Committee, and my colleague and friend, Senator \nLandrieu, and Senator Isakson for this amendment. I am proud to be part \nof it.\n  I think those of us on the committee when we were drafting the \nlegislation wanted to make sure that the mortgage security \nsecuritization process, the originators of mortgages, had skin in the \ngame. I think as we went through this process, and working particularly \nwith the expertise of the Senator from Georgia, we realized that while \nskin in the game is important, it is more the underlying quality of the \nmortgage.\n  If we have mortgages that have that 20 percent down, with a high FICO \nscore, the same level of skin in the game is not required. I think this \namendment stays true to the intent of the Banking Committee bill.\n  I am glad the chairman of the Banking Committee is supportive of it. \nI think this is an amendment that refines and improves the legislation. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of it, and grateful for the expertise of \nthe Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the kind remarks of \nthe Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Louisiana, and the \nSenator from Virginia. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Grassley of \nIowa be also added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The committee did a great job to ensure subprime loans \nwould never be made again by requiring risk retention of 5 percent. The \nonly problem is they have called it on all loans, which meant there \nwould be no mortgage loans. You would not have subprime, you would not \nhave good loans because you cannot make it work with a 5-percent risk \nretention. As I have cautioned all of my colleagues, in the 1980s when \nthe savings and loan industry failed, they had 100 percent risk \nretention. Risk retention is not the cure-all to good lending; \nunderwriting is.\n  The Senator from Louisiana and the other sponsors of this amendment \nare ensuring that people who have incomes that are verified, they will \nensure that they have ratios that meet the tolerance levels for a \nqualified loan, meaning you are not borrowing more than you can pay \nback; they will ensure there is equity of 20 percent in every loan \nmade, either through the downpayment being 20 percent or through \nwhatever downpayment is made, having mortgage guarantee insurance on \nthe amount above 80, and up to the downpayment, which is the way things \nused to work.\n  In other words, the underlying lender is never at risk for more than \n80, more than 80 is made by the borrower, it is mortgage guarantee \ninsurance, which means if there is a default, that insurance is paid \nimmediately, which ensures you that you are making a better quality \nloan.\n  What Senator Landrieu has basically said is, we are not going where \nwe make zero down, interest-only, all-day, stated-income, reversed \namortization loans anymore. But we are going to make the good-old-days \nloan, where there is a downpayment, where there is skin in the game, \nwhere there is an income-to-debt ratio, and where the borrower is \nqualified to borrow the money they are borrowing.\n  The only risk retention that will be required is when someone is \nmaking a bad loan, which means people will stop making bad loans, which \nmeans this bill, with this amendment, will have truly addressed the \nheart and soul of what led to the failure of the housing market and \nultimately the subprime securities in New York.\n  I appreciate the chairman's acceptance of the amendment. I commend \nSenator Landrieu as the original author of the amendment. I appreciate \nthe time she offered me on the floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to ask for immediate consideration of the \namendment, if it could be voice voted at this time and, if not, \nscheduled for the earliest possible vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3918 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily \nlay aside the Landrieu-Isakson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Dodd, for \nbeing responsive and receptive to a number of amendments we have \noffered with respect to small businesses and for making sure there are \nnot unintended consequences as a result of this legislation that \nrequire more regulation on their part.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nLandrieu, for cosponsoring this amendment and for her efforts as a \nstrong champion on behalf of small businesses. I thank the chairman for \nworking with me to forge a compromise on this particular amendment that \ngives small businesses certainty that they will be exempted from the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau to the degree that they are not \ninvolved in financial products that will be regulated under this \nlegislation.\n  This amendment will modify a provision in the underlying legislation \nthat could unintentionally ensnare small businesses within the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau if they are judged by the bureau as having \nengaged ``significantly'' in consumer financial products or services \nsuch as selling goods or services on credit or through an installment \nprogram.\n  The term ``significantly'' is unclear. Certainly, it could \npotentially lead to Main Street enterprises such as jewelers, \northodontists, or furniture store owners being roped into a bureau \nintended to regulate providers of financial services. The chairman has \nbeen clear that through his interpretation, small business owners are \nspecifically excluded, that they were never intended to be placed \nwithin the bureau itself. Yet the bill's use of the term \n``significantly'' is vague.\n  Perhaps an article entitled ``To Protect Consumers, Who Will Be \nRegulated?'' published by the New York Times on April 30 captured this \nissue the best when it noted:\n\n       A review of the consumer protection provisions, which \n     account for 335 pages of the 1,565-page bill, shows that the \n     intent of this legislation is not to cover Main Street \n     businesses. But the ambiguity of some terms--like the word \n     ``significantly''--leaves the regulations open to broad \n     interpretation.\n\n  Accordingly, while I strongly believe Congress should pursue the \nproviders of abusive and predatory financial products that harm \nAmericans, we must be careful not to inadvertently target Main Street \nsmall businesses. Given the state of the economy and the difficulties \nplaced on small businesses struggling to keep their doors open, \nentrepreneurs already have enough to be concerned about. We should not \nbe injecting more uncertainty in the very enterprises we are counting \non to reverse the 7.8 million job losses we have experienced thus far \nin this recession and create opportunities for the 15.3 million \nAmericans who remain unemployed. Additional uncertainty will make small \nfirms far less likely to take risks and make new investments.\n  I believe we add clarity to this provision by virtue of this \namendment. We prevent the overregulation of small businesses that may \nresult in regulators interpreting this statute too broadly.\n  My amendment creates a quick, easy, bright-line test for small \nbusinesses. Firms that fall under the Small Business Administration's \nNorth American Industry Classification System--the classification \nsystem small businesses use to file their taxes and qualify for SBA \nprograms and services--would be exempt so long as the small business \nextends credit for the sale of nonfinancial goods and does not \nsecuritize its debt. For example, this means a doctor's office would be \nexempt if it has less than $10 million in revenue, a jeweler would be \nexempt if it has revenues below $7 million, and a grocery or \nconvenience store would be exempt if it has revenues under $27 million. \nAs a result of this modification, business owners would know with \ncertainty that if they were defined as small businesses by SBA \nstandards, they would be exempt from regulations by the bureau. In \naddition, if a business is in its first year of existence, it would be \nconsidered a small business if it is reasonably expected to fall under \nthe SBA's size standard.\n  This simple measuring stick provides objective criteria for small \nfirms and has also been endorsed by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the largest organization and voice for small \nbusiness. It is also endorsed by the American Dental Association and \nthe American Association of Orthodontists. Finally, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce has indicated that although it continues to have concerns with \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it views this amendment as an \nimportant step forward.\n  In the past year, the economic recession and the radical overhaul of \nthe Nation's health care system have sown the seeds of doubt and \nuncertainty in America's small businesses. In Maine, I have been told \ntime and again by constituents and small business owners that they are \nconcerned about the future and worried about the growth of government. \nAdding another regulator with ambiguous powers is not the answer small \nbusinesses and Mainers are looking for to enable them to make plans \nabout their futures, potentially adding jobs and making future \ninvestments.\n  This is why I have also filed--and intend to call up during this \ndebate--another amendment that I filed with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Pryor. That amendment would ensure that when the \nnewly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau promulgates rules \nand regulations, it fully considers the economic impact that those \nrules and regulations would impose on our Nation's 30 million small \nfirms and their ability to access credit. I look forward to working \nwith Senators Dodd and Shelby to have that amendment considered.\n  In conclusion, this bipartisan amendment now before the Senate was \ncrafted in consultation with small business stakeholders and is a \ncommonsense solution to this problem. Given that ``stability'' is in \nthe title of this legislation, I urge Members on both sides of the \npolitical aisle to aid small business owners and gain a measure of \nstability in these uncertain times and support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Burris as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague, Senator Snowe, who chaired the \nSmall Business Committee for many years, for her dogged determination \nto make sure the language in the underlying bill, which is most \ncertainly necessary to curb gross abuses in the financial market, does \nnot unintentionally do harm to small businesses that are the engines of \ngrowth to pull us out of this recession. Our amendment helps in a \nsignificant way to do that by drawing fine lines and clarifying \ndefinitions.\n  I thank the Federation of Small Businesses, the American Dental \nAssociation, and the American Association of Orthodontists, as well as \ndozens of other organizations that have supported this clarifying \nlanguage.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for giving us an opportunity to \noffer this important amendment, and I urge my colleagues to accept it. \nI urge them to look at the cosponsorship opportunity as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank both of my colleagues, not only for \ntheir work on this particular amendment but for the way they have \napproached the bill. They have been tremendously constructive in \noffering very solid ideas.\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\n  This is one amendment that does a great deal of service to the \nlegislation. As the Senator from Maine pointed out, it was certainly \nalways our intent not to include retailers and merchants under the \nauspices of the consumer financial product safety commission. The \nlanguage they have now offered and on which they worked so hard makes \nthat abundantly clear. The word ``significantly'' clearly is an opaque \nword. No matter how much I tried to make clear what my intentions were \nwith that language, this amendment strengthens it tremendously. As I \nhave said, this was never intended to affect Main Street merchants.\n  I am delighted that the National Federation of Independent Business, \nalong with the American Dental Association and the American Association \nof Orthodontists, is now in support, because they were two groups about \nwhich it was unclear whether they would be included. As a result of \nwhat we have been able to craft, with the leadership of Senators Snowe \nand Landrieu, we now have their support. I thank them.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nchairman for working so constructively to develop this amendment, to \nbuild a consensus, and to give a strong measure of assurance to the \nsmall business community about the intent of this legislation so it \ndoesn't create unintended consequences. I appreciate all he has done to \nmake sure this amendment could be considered and hopefully adopted.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana in supporting this small business legislation. \nThere is a growing chorus in Washington of national leaders and \nadvocacy groups, concerned citizens who have all come together to call \nfor financial reform. Across America, folks are demanding a return to \naccountability, commonsense regulations, and fair business practices.\n  Each of us has been touched by this economic recession. Every Member \nof this body has heard from countless businesses and families back home \nwho have had to tighten their belts and brace for the worst. We have \nall seen the raw numbers. We have heard the statistics over and over. \nToo often, we forget what is behind the numbers--real folks \nexperiencing real pain. This economic crisis is far from abstract. It \nhas touched millions of American lives. It has made people wonder when \nor even if our economic future will be secure again. It has shaken us \nto the core.\n  Things are finally starting to look a bit better. Thanks to bold \nsteps taken at the national level, America is back on the road to \nrecovery. Key economic indicators are turning around. But we are not \nout of the woods yet. The national unemployment rate stands at almost \n10 percent. Our economy is growing but more slowly than we had hoped. \nSome people, especially the elderly and racial and ethnic minorities, \nremain especially vulnerable. Their pain is real. That is why, as the \nSenate considers financial reform legislation, we need to make sure \nthey are protected. We need to make sure recovery continues along the \nright path and, at the same time, to stand up for these folks and \nprevent this from happening again.\n  That is why we need to create a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \na strong advocate standing squarely on the side of the ordinary \nAmerican, defending them from abuse at the hands of large corporations. \nThis new bureau must be at the center of the financial reform package. \nIt must be empowered to set and enforce strict consumer protection \nrules.\n  We should start with the mortgage industry. For years, banks have \nbeen allowed to relax their standards. They have made bad loans to \npeople who were never able to make the payments. As a result, \nforeclosures skyrocketed.\n  Almost no community in America was immune to the subprime lending \ncrisis, but minority populations were hit the hardest. At the height of \nthe subprime boom, 54 percent of the loans made to African Americans \nwere high-priced loans. The recession has caused these borrowers to \ncome under severe stress, and as a result the Black home ownership rate \nhas decreased.\n  We need to stop this kind of predatory lending and restore basic \nprinciples of fair play to the mortgage industry. That is why our \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau would take a hard look at the way \nthe mortgage brokers operate. It would ensure borrowers have access to \nloans they can afford. It would shut down scam operations, end abusive \npractices, and keep all brokers honest.\n  But it doesn't stop there. I believe we should extend many of these \nsame protections to the student loan industry.\n  Today's young people represent the best America has to offer. They \nare our future, and we need to invest in their education, so we can \nmake sure they have the tools that will help them succeed in the global \nmarketplace. That is why our Consumer Protection Bureau would have the \nauthority to set basic rules of the road, to make sure students are \nempowered to make smart choices.\n  The bureau would provide assistance to borrowers and institutions \nalike, increasing the flow of information and breathing transparency \nback into this complicated system. This would provide significant \nbenefits to young people across America. But it would have the \nstrongest impact on minority households, 49 percent of which currently \nhave installment loans, including student loans.\n  Finally, we must task our new bureau with increasing financial \nliteracy among consumers. Today, far too many Americans get caught up \nin the fine print, trapped by the deceptive practices of major \nfinancial institutions. So if we pass financial reform that includes a \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, these folks will have access to \nclear information in plain English. If they are still confused, they \nwill be able to call a consumer hotline. This will connect them \ndirectly with experts at an office of financial literacy, so they can \nget their questions answered and make sure they are getting a fair \ndeal.\n  This will empower consumers to make smart choices and will prevent \nbig financial institutions from taking advantage of ordinary Americans. \nIt would ensure that we stay on the road to recovery and extend a \nhelping hand to regular folks who need it--especially the disadvantaged \ncommunities that have felt the worst effects of this crisis.\n  Most importantly, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will help \nprevent this kind of crisis from ever happening again. We must never \nforget that cold statistics and Wall Street balance sheets do not tell \nthe complete story of this financial meltdown. It is important to think \nof the real human beings--individuals and families--who are behind \nthese numbers: the ordinary folks who continue to suffer.\n  I believe it is time to stand up for these folks. That is why I am \nglad a Consumer Financial Protection Agency is at the center of our \nWall Street reform bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come back \nto the floor and speak on financial regulation. First of all, I wish to \ncongratulate the Presiding Officer from Colorado for being very \nsuccessful yesterday on passing an amendment that I think is going to \nbe good for our country.\n  I rise to speak about an amendment I had earlier today. It was a \ncommonsense amendment that I think gets at the heart of this financial \ncrisis. It didn't pass, but the amendment was to put in place \nunderwriting standards to keep the kind of crisis we just saw happen in \nour country over the last couple of years from happening again.\n  I think we all realize the base of this crisis, which the Dodd bill \ndoes not address, was the fact that we had large numbers of loans \nwritten around this country that people couldn't pay back. The \nunderwriting standards were poor. Credit was extended to people who \ncouldn't pay the mortgages back. Those mortgages were passed throughout \nthe world, and then we had $600\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\ntrillion worth of notional value derivatives that were based on, again, \nthese underlying bad mortgages. Then we had a systemic crisis not only \nin this country but around the world.\n  So what I attempted to do with my amendment was to put some \nappropriate underwriting standards in place where everybody who \npurchased a home would need to have a 5-percent downpayment. If they \nborrowed more than 80 percent loan to value, there would have to be \nsome credit enhancement, up to 100 percent, to ensure it, in fact, was \na safe loan. They had to fully document their income. What a \nbreakthrough. They would have to include their credit history and \nemployment history. Then we would have to determine the borrower's \nability to repay, including consideration of their debt-to-income \nratio.\n  This was just a basic underwriting guidelines amendment. Again, I \nthink we know at the base of this problem we just went through was the \nfact that we had a lot of bad loans written.\n  I had a number of Democratic colleagues come up to me after the \nvote--or actually during the vote--and they said: I support what you \nwant to do, but the provision striking the 5-percent retention dealing \nwith securitization, which we did have in this amendment, was what kept \nme from voting for this underwriting amendment.\n  I put that in there because I think most people looked at the Dodd \nproposal and the 5-percent retention on securitization and realized \nthat it created a problem, not a solution. So I actually did that to \ndraw people to our amendment. But since I had a number of Democrats, my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, come up and say they would have \nsupported it without striking the risk retention, I have now refiled \nthat amendment.\n  I am now saying, OK, let's have some standard underwriting procedures \nin this country. Now that I have refiled that amendment, if it was the \nissue of risk retention on the securitization piece that kept you from \ncoming onto this amendment, I have refiled it, and now I am seeking on \nthe other side of the aisle some cosponsors.\n  We had some great cosponsors last time--Senators Gregg, LeMieux, \nCoburn, and Brown. Senator Shelby also supported this amendment. We had \nJohnny Isakson, from Atlanta, who probably knows more about real estate \nlending than anybody here, on behalf of this amendment.\n  For my friends on the other side who said: I would have done this, \nbut that risk retention piece you had in there regarding securitization \nkept me from it, now I have a clean amendment that does nothing in that \nregard. It leaves that in place. Again, it puts into place these \nunderwriting standards. I had a number of Democrats who said: I agree \nthat we ought to at least have 5 percent down. I think maybe we ought \nto have more.\n  Well, because I want everyone in this body to have the opportunity to \nvote for a good, sound amendment, one that takes us away from the way \nwe have been going in this country, which is we want to make sure \neverybody is entitled--it is no longer the American dream that someone \nowns a home; it is an American entitlement. Nobody saves. I should not \nhave said that. We have moved away from requiring that people save and \nshow discipline in order to own homes. We have made it now, according \nto an amendment that passed today, which the Presiding Officer put into \nplace, and I respect what he tried to do, but in essence we said in \nthat amendment that what you can do to have proper underwriting is you \ncan borrow and pay, over time, the downpayment. We are not going to \nrequire a downpayment. We will let you put that into the cost of the \nloan--borrow it and pay it back over time.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak today. \nAgain, I have so many friends on the other side of the aisle who said: \nCorker, I would have supported your amendment, but it had that one \nphrase in it about risk retention. I have taken that out and, \nhopefully, we will have the opportunity to vote on this again.\n  I see my friends on the other side of the aisle smiling. I am looking \nfor cosponsors on the other side of the aisle for a simple, commonsense \namendment, which says that everybody in America who buys a home will at \nleast put 5 percent down. We will be able to see their income. Let's \ndocument their income and see that they can pay the loan back. This \nwill be a brandnew day in America.\n  My sense is that, as the realtors come to the hill today--my \nfriends--and as the home builders come to the hill today--and they are \nmy friends--obviously, they don't want any underwriting requirements \nbecause they want to make sure loans go to everybody in America. I am \nthankful my friends on the other side of the aisle have come to me \ntoday and said: Corker, ``only if.'' Now I am offering the ``only if.'' \nI look for cosponsors to help me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Health Care Legislation\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today--and the \nRepublican leader has already addressed this body--to discuss the \nissues of health care, about new revelations, new information that has \ncome forth in terms of the specifics of the costs of the health care \nbill that has been signed into law--the costs that far exceed what was \never anticipated.\n  I come here as somebody who has practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 \nyears as an orthopedic surgeon, taking care of families in Wyoming, as \nmedical director of the Wyoming Health Fairs, a program that provided \nlow-cost health screening in Wyoming. This gave people an opportunity \nto take more responsibility for their own health and keep down costs of \ntheir medical care.\n  I come to the floor with a second opinion, as a physician--a \npracticing physician, taking care of patients; it is a second opinion \nabout the health care law.\n  Today, I come to the floor because the goal of the health care bill \nwas truly to improve quality and access and get the cost of care down. \nThose are the things I think all of the Senate wanted to have achieved.\n  But having seen this bill that has been passed and signed into law, I \nbelieve the bill is going to be bad for patients, bad for our \nproviders, the nurses and doctors who take care of them, and bad for \nthe payers--the American people, who will foot the bill for this health \ncare bill.\n  I believe this bill will fundamentally, as it has been passed into \nlaw, result in higher costs for patients and in less access to care for \npeople all across America. It is going to result in unsustainable \nspending, at a time when we are running record deficits.\n  I think about the things the President said when he was not just \nrunning for office but as President. He said: The plan I am announcing \ntonight--it was a joint session--will slow the growth of health care \ncosts for our families, for our businesses, and for our government.\n  But in fact, the Chief Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid has said \nthat the President was wrong. He said the cost of care will actually go \nup by $311 billion through 2019. And now we heard the revelation \nyesterday from the Congressional Budget Office that when you look at \nsome of the things that hadn't been scored, as they say, costed out, it \nwill add another $115 billion on top of that. The President said if you \nlike your health care plan, you will be able to keep it, ``period.'' He \nsaid the word ``period.'' He said nobody will take it away, ``period.'' \nNo matter what, ``period.''\n  The CBO and the Chief Actuary said that 14 million Americans will \nlose their employer-sponsored health coverage under the new law.\n  Today, I come to the floor to also mention that recently the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebilius, had an \nepiphany about the doctor shortage in America. Last week, she said a \nnationwide primary care physician shortage had to be addressed before \nover 30 million Americans get access to subsidized health insurance \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\n  This is her quote:\n\n       How are we going to be ready when we already have a \n     shortage in too many parts of the country?\n\n  This shortage should not have been a surprise to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. The American Association of Medical Colleges \ntells us that at the current graduation and training rates, we are \nfacing a shortage of 150,000 doctors in the next 15 years. Over the \npast year, medical experts warned Congress--this body--and the \nadministration that any health reform bill should tackle the issue of \nphysician shortages. Instead of helping doctors, the new law actually \ndiscourages the next generation from becoming doctors. This new bill \ncuts payments for doctors and cuts patients on Medicare, and it doesn't \ninclude enough money to train new doctors.\n  I believe it was intentional. Maybe the Secretary, maybe the Obama \nadministration, and maybe the Democrats in Congress should have paid \nattention to the experts before jamming this health care law down the \nthroats of the American people. Maybe they should have heeded the calls \nI heard from medical professionals all across Wyoming and the country \nto slow down, let's get it right. But, no, they didn't. And now the \nAmerican people are stuck with a law that costs too much, doesn't solve \nAmerica's doctor shortage--doesn't even address it--and doesn't deliver \ngood care for patients.\n  This should not have been a surprise to the Secretary, because the \nWall Street Journal, over a month ago, said that the medical schools \ncan't keep up. As the ranks of the insured expand, the Nation faces a \nshortage of 150,000 doctors. Right here, it says a shortage of primary \ncare and other physicians could mean more limited access to health care \nand longer wait times--more limited access and more wait times.\n  What about the training of doctors? The Secretary just realized this, \nbut it has been in print for months. Doctors' groups and medical \nschools had hoped the new health care law passed in March would \nincrease the number of funded residency slots--you know, where they \ntrain family doctors--but such a provision didn't make it into the \nfinal bill. With over a trillion dollar bill, are we going to train \ndoctors? No, they left it out.\n  Then what about hospitals? Here it is in the Wall Street Journal--the \nheadline ``Hospitals Under the Knife. New York City System Aims to Cut \n2,600 More Jobs as State Funding Drops.''\n  Not enough doctors? All you have to do is go to the New York Times, \nand this headline: ``More Doctors Giving Up Private Clinics.''\n  That is the end of it. So why would so many doctors behave this way? \nLet's look at Congress Daily this past week, May 4: ``Latest CBO \nFigures Show Higher `Doc Fix' Price Tag.''\n  That is to pay doctors for the doctor bill. Of course, it was left \nout of the health care bill. How can we have a national health care law \nthat fails to address training doctors and paying for them? It is \nastonishing. It says that scheduled cuts take effect June 1, an option \noutlined Friday by CBO to freeze Medicare payment rates which, under \nthe new figures, would cost $275.8 billion through 2020. That is an \namazing amount, because physician payment rates for Medicare are \nexpected to be cut 21 percent on June 1.\n  That is what we are looking at now. That is why, today, I come to the \nfloor to give, as a doctor, a second opinion, because it is time to \nrepeal this legislation and replace it with legislation that delivers \nmore personal responsibility and more opportunities for individual \npatients. We need a patient-centered health care bill, one that \nprovides individual incentives, such as premium breaks for people who \nbehave in a way that encourages healthy behavior and gets down the risk \nfactors that increase the cost of care; that allows people to take \ntheir health insurance with them when they switch jobs; that gives \npeople who buy their own health insurance the same tax relief available \nto people who get their insurance through work; that allows Americans \nto buy health insurance across State lines; that deals with lawsuit \nabuse and that allows small businesses to join together to offer health \ninsurance to their employees. These are the things that will work to \nget down the cost of care and deliver higher quality of care to the \nAmerican people.\n\n  They are not in the health care bill that passed the Senate, that \npassed the House, and was signed into law. That is why today, once \nagain, in light of this brandnew information on the increased costs and \nthe final realization that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nnow says: Gee, we don't have enough doctors to cover the situation, it \nis time to repeal this bill and replace it with what we know will work \nfor the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3736\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment I submitted, \namendment No. 3736. This amendment I know has caused some concerns in \ndifferent places, both in the political process and in the financial \nsector. I believe it is a very fair, carefully drawn amendment. It is a \nfulfillment of a promise I made when I voted in favor of the TARP \nfunding on October 1, 2008, when I stated I would do everything I could \nto make sure, first of all, that we look at appropriate executive \ncompensation issues; second, that we would work to reregulate the \nfinancial sector, which we are doing in this bill, thankfully; and \nthird, we would invest the American taxpayers in the upside of the \neconomy when it started to come back because it was the American \ntaxpayers' funding of rebuilding our economy that made this happen, not \nthe funding of the banking system.\n  This amendment simply says that if you received $5 billion or more \nfrom TARP and if you are a couple of other companies, such as Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, that received significant Federal funding in this \nbailout, any compensation you received in 2009 that is above your basic \ncompensation and above an initial $400,000 bonus should be shared with \nthe taxpayers who made this possible.\n  This is not a clawback. It is not retroactive. It is moneys earned in \n2009 which were paid out in 2010. It is not ongoing. It is a one-shot \nproposition. It affects only 13 companies. From the executives of those \n13 companies, it is estimated the American taxpayers would be \nremunerated to the extent of $3.5 billion to $10 billion. I believe \nthis is very fair. But at the same time I understand, based on \ndiscussions with leadership, that there may be a constitutional point \nof order that would preclude consideration of this amendment on this \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to inquire of Chairman Dodd, through \nthe Chair, whether that is his understanding as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nVirginia. He is absolutely right. That is exactly the case. Under the \nConstitution of the United States, all revenue-rising measures must \noriginate in the other body, the House of Representatives.\n  Despite the merits of his amendment, with which I agree, we have what \nwe call a blue slip. When an amendment originates over here and it \nimpacts the Internal Revenue Code, it is subject to an objection, what \nwe call a blue slip. It does not go to the merits of the amendment. It \ngoes to the constitutionality of such a proposal where revenue is \naffected. Those matters must begin in the House.\n  I say to my colleague from Virginia, there will be opportunities, I \nam sure, with revenue measures coming from the House for our \nconsideration to raise this amendment again. I, for one, am attracted \nto the amendment and what he is proposing and hope at another point--\nand I presume that opportunity will arise in the next couple months \nbecause I gather revenue measures will be coming over--that we will \nhave another chance to address this issue.\n  I appreciate his consideration of this matter and look forward to \nworking with him on this question the next opportunity we have to do \nso. It is my understanding the amendment would suffer from that \nconstitutional question at this point.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his clarification. \nThe last thing I wish to do in a bill this complex is to tie up the \nSenate in procedural votes, rather than votes of substance. Even if \nthis point of order were raised, it is my understanding then\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\nthere would be a mandatory vote which would tie us up. I am not going \nto call up this amendment. I very much appreciate what the chairman \nsaid about the possibility that we be allowed to vote on other \nappropriate legislation being considered in the Senate.\n  As I previously stated, I believe this is a matter of very eminent \nfairness, and it would be for the body to vote on it. I would like to \nhave that vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, while we are waiting, there are two pending \namendments which we can voice vote, but I gather there may be a second-\ndegree amendment offered to one of these amendments. It will be the \nfirst time a second-degree amendment has been offered to one of these \namendments.\n  We are trying to go through the process and give everybody a chance \nto air their ideas. There have been no tabling motions, no filibusters, \nat least none declared on the bill at this point. Nonetheless, Senators \nhave the right to offer second-degree amendments, if they wish. We have \navoided it up to now, having considered quite a few proposals on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I count about 15, 16, at least on my list of amendments, on the \nDemocratic side Members who would like to be given the opportunity to \nraise. I cannot speak to the number on the other side, but it is not a \nlarge number. Our Republican colleagues, at least based on the list I \nhave seen--it is about six or seven or eight. I may be off a little bit \non that count, but it is not a large number.\n  Here we are again, it is almost 12:30 p.m. and sitting here, \npotentially going to a quorum call. I am hearing again my colleagues \nsay we have to stay on this bill and don't get off it. I am prepared to \nstay and work, but we cannot work when Members will not come over and \nat least allow us to vote up or down on rollcall votes on these \namendments.\n  On Saturday, I submitted to my good friend from Alabama, Senator \nShelby, and his staff a list of technical amendments, as well as \nbipartisan amendments and others that I thought were noncontroversial \nthat we could make part of a managers' amendment. We can only do a \nmanagers' amendment when we get consent. Obviously, any objections to \nany of the suggestions I sent over on Saturday would exclude them from \na managers' amendment.\n  It is now Wednesday, and I have not heard back whether we can \nsubtract or add to those amendments. It would help tremendously to \nclean out a lot of issues on which I believe there is consensus.\n  I made it privately and I make a plea publicly. At some point, the \nleader is going to say enough is enough on the bill. We are trying to \ngo back and forth in an orderly fashion so Members will have a chance, \non either side of this so-called political divide, which I wish did not \nexist--even in this Chamber--for people to offer amendments. In a dead \ntime such as this, the clock is ticking. We have no votes this Friday. \nWe will not be in on Saturday or Sunday. We would like to move on to \nother issues.\n  We have taken a lot of time on this bill. I am a strong advocate of \ndoing that to prove this body can function, we can consider each \nothers' ideas, modify them, vote for them, vote against them but to do \nwhat we tell every high school class or elementary school class we talk \nto as Senators about how the Senate functions. I think we are proving \nwe can do that on this bill, despite the significance of it--the first \ntime in almost 100 years reforming the financial structure of our \nNation.\n  My hope is we will continue and finish it without having to get \ninvolved in procedural motions that would deprive people of being heard \non their ideas, whether you like it or not, but at least have the \nopportunity for it to come up.\n  I am trying to orchestrate the votes that relate to the matters with \nwhich we are dealing. It does not work perfectly. It is what every \nmanager tries to do. I know some Members are frustrated because they \nhave not been able to be heard yet on their ideas. I wish to give them \nan opportunity to do so.\n  When we get delays such as this, when the time could be filled on \nconsidering these matters, it sets us back from the goal of having a \nbill completed in this Congress where all Members have had a chance to \nbe heard, that we were able to tackle a significant issue and come to a \nconclusion about it.\n  There are those who think we cannot do that any longer. I believe we \ncan, and we have been proving it in the last couple weeks. After 2 \nweeks of a good, spirited, civil, in some cases partisan but civil \ndebate, let us complete the work as we have begun it.\n  My plea to my colleagues, particularly on the minority side right \nnow, is please respond to these requests so we can have some idea of \nwhat can be accepted, what can be modified and not accepted so we can \nmove forward with the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I add my compliments and gratitude to \nChairman Dodd for his unbelievable patience and hard work and the hard \nwork of his staff in trying to come up with a good consensus, finding \ncommon ground where we can move forward and address the economic crisis \nthat has hit this country and deal with the consequences we have seen \nand certainly the ideas we know exist, to be able to solve the problems \nand move forward, put our economy back on track, put people back to \nwork, making sure we are rebuilding our country in a way that is going \nto be sustainable, with a good financial regulatory reform initiative \nthat is going to be meaningful.\n  I applaud his efforts and patience in what he is doing, working with \neveryone. I certainly add my efforts in trying to work together with \nothers to make sure we can move this bill expeditiously as possible, \nobviously with the consideration he has given to everyone's concerns \nand desires to make it a better bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield for a minute, I \nthank the Senator from Arkansas. She is chairperson of the Agriculture \nCommittee, which is a huge undertaking. Every State is affected by \ndecisions made in that committee. Even small States in New England, \ncontrary to what many people may think, have agricultural interests, \nmaybe not to the extent of Oregon and Arkansas but we have them.\n  I am very grateful to her and members of her committee for the work \nthey engaged in. We are truly fortunate to have the Senator from \nArkansas in the position she is in--making decisions, providing \nvaluable contributions, not just to this effort; we have worked \ntogether on a lot of issues over the years. She is a great advocate of \nher State, but I also say she is a great advocate of our country. That \nis the quality we hope people bring. We have an obligation to keep an \neye out for what happens in our States but also to keep an eye out for \nwhat happens to our country. Striking that balance is a challenge we \nface at one time or another. No one does it better than the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, striking a balance.\n  I have heard that word about Arkansans over and over during her \ntenure. She is as tenacious a fighter as any State has had in my 30 \nyears here. She is also mindful that Arkansas, similar to Connecticut, \nis part of a country, and we all have to be mindful of each other's \ninterests. Striking that balance has been invaluable in this debate.\n  I did not want the moment to pass without thanking her immensely and \nher staff and others for the contributions they have made.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I \nam grateful to him for his comments and again grateful for his patience \nand perseverance in getting something done that is meaningful to all \nAmericans. Arkansans are clamoring for it, and I know others across the \nNation are.\n  The will say about the work of the Agriculture Committee, for all \nAmericans who enjoy nutrition, that comes from the hard-working farm \nfamilies across this country who produce the safest, the most abundant, \nand affordable food and fiber. We all have a little bit at stake in \nthat Agriculture Committee.\n  We appreciate so much working with the Senator from Connecticut. \nChairman Dodd has done a tremendous job.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n                    Lance Corporal Richard R. Penny\n\n  Mr. President, this week, my home State of Arkansas marks a somber\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\nmilestone. Since September 11, 2001, 100 service men and women with \nties to Arkansas have given their life to help defend our freedoms in \nthis great country. I rise to honor their ultimate sacrifice on behalf \nof our Nation.\n  It is also with great sadness that I pay tribute to the family of \nLCpl Richard R. Penny, 21 years of age, of Fayetteville, AR. Lance \nCorporal Penny was killed May 6 while supporting combat operations in \nHelmand Province in Afghanistan, making him our State's 100th service \nman or woman to have given his life to help defend our freedom.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I am grateful for Lance Corporal Penny's \nservice and for the service and sacrifice of all our military \nservicemembers and their families. More than 11,000 Arkansans on Active \nDuty and more than 10,000 Arkansas Reservists have served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan since September 11, 2001. These men and women have shown \ntremendous courage and perseverance through the most difficult of \ntimes.\n  My father and both my grandfathers served as infantrymen. They served \nour Nation in uniform and taught me from an early age about the \nsacrifices our troops and their families make to keep our Nation \nfree. As neighbors, as Arkansans and as Americans, it is incumbent upon \nus to do everything we can to honor their service and to provide for \nthem and their families not only when they are in harm's way but also \nwhen they return home.\n\n  While it is important to honor those who have served our country in \nuniform with words, we must also honor them with our actions. I have \nconsistently supported initiatives that expand the benefits our \nservicemembers and veterans have earned and deserve. During these tough \neconomic times, it is even more important that we don't shortchange \nthese heroes and their families.\n  That is why I have authored several bills on behalf of Arkansas's \nmilitary servicemembers, veterans, and their families. In doing so, I \nhave focused on a number of priorities, including requiring more \naccessible health care for guardsmen and reservists so they can \nmaintain the medical readiness required to fulfill their mission and \nalso ensuring that future GI benefits for members of the National Guard \nand Reserve keep pace with the national average cost of tuition, and \nallowing beneficiaries of the post-9/11 GI bill to use their GI \nbenefits more flexibly to develop skills that are critical to our \nworkforce and our economy and their reentrance into the workplace, and \nalso addressing inequities in survivor benefits for military families.\n  With more than 600,000 courageous men and women who have returned \nfrom combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and with thousands more on the \nway, mental health care is an issue that also deserves more attention. \nI have visited injured servicemembers at Walter Reed and in Arkansas \nand witnessed firsthand that more and more of our troops are affected \nby service-connected mental health issues, such as traumatic brain \ninjury and post-traumatic stress disorder. To address this issue, I \nhave introduced legislation to ensure that our troops receive proper \nmental health assessments before and after they enter a conflict zone.\n  The issue of mental health does not just affect our troops. With more \nNational Guard and Reserve from our rural communities serving abroad, \nfamilies have expressed concerns to me about the impact increased \nmilitary deployments have on other children, and particularly their \nchildren, and whether schools have sufficient resources to meet these \nchallenges. To meet these concerns, I have also introduced legislation \nto increase the number of school counselors, school social workers, and \nschool psychiatrists and psychologists in high-needs school districts, \nmany of which are located in our rural areas all across this great \nNation.\n  All of our veterans, from the ``greatest generation'' to Vietnam war \nveterans to the new generation of servicemembers in the Middle East and \nacross the globe, all of our veterans have sacrificed greatly on behalf \nof our country. Although the challenges and needs of veterans have \nchanged over time, one thing remains constant: It is the responsibility \nof our Nation to provide the tools necessary to care for our country's \nreturning servicemembers and honor the commitment our Nation made when \nwe sent them into harm's way in the first place.\n  Our grateful Nation will not forget them when their military service \nis complete. It is the least we can do for those to whom we owe so \nmuch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nArkansas, for her statement today about the sacrifice of folks not only \nfrom Arkansas but across the country--Virginia, Delaware, and from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Madam President, I wasn't planning on speaking, and I will only do so \nbriefly because my friend, the Senator from Delaware, is going to speak \nmuch more extensively on this issue. But I think many of us who have \nhad the opportunity to preside have heard--and in particular on Monday \nafternoons--the Senator from Delaware come down on a regular basis, for \nmonths, to speak on what, until last Thursday, was a pretty esoteric \nissue--an issue that, for somebody who spent 20 years around the \nfinance sector before I got into politics full time, I thought I might \nhave some knowledge of.\n  But as the Senator started talking about high-frequency trading, \ncollocation, sponsored access, and flash trading, I realized this was a \nwhole realm of new terms that actually even makes derivatives look \nsimple.\n  The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the \nmassive amounts of investments that have been made by certain firms to \ntry to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the \ntrading process might come back to haunt us all. Last Thursday \nafternoon we saw potentially--and we still don't know, and the \nregulators were up testifying on the Hill yesterday on the House side--\nwhat could have been the first warning shot across the bow of what \ncould be the next systemic risk crisis when the stock markets in the \nUnited States lost over $1 trillion of value in a dramatic downsweep of \nabout 16 to 20 minutes.\n  The market recovered, but almost a week later we still don't know the \nreal cause, and I don't think we can blame the regulators. I have had \nconferences with the head of the SEC, and she acknowledges the \ndifficulty in keeping up with the technology and having the oversight \nfor all of this proliferation of new exchanges--electronic exchanges--\nmany that didn't even exist a few years back.\n  Most investors probably think they trade on the New York Stock \nExchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ. They don't \nrealize the majority of trades are now on electronic exchanges they \nhave probably never even heard of. The Senator from Delaware has \nconsistently raised this issue, and whether we simply need additional \nspeed limits, system brakes, or whether we need to make sure there is \nnot an unfair advantage that is being created, these are all issues we \nneed to come back to.\n  I want to personally say I am proud of the fact the Senator from \nDelaware and I contacted the chairman of the Banking Committee and we \nhave spoken out. But he has been the leader on this issue, and I have \nbeen proud to follow his lead. I know he is going to speak more about \nthis issue today, and I am sure in the coming weeks. I don't have all \nthe knowledge, I don't know the right answer yet, but I know in my gut \nthat the Senator from Delaware is onto something here; that we all need \nto make sure we take a better examination of it.\n  The last thing the market needs right now, particularly for that \nsmall-time investor, is some sense that somebody on Wall Street is \ngetting even one further advantage through the use of technology or \nthat there is not appropriate system brakes in the event of a mistake \nmade.\n  So as I yield the floor, I commend my friend, the Senator from \nDelaware, and look forward to working with him and the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, who has said the committee will be taking up this \nissue. It is something I think we all need to take heed of to make sure \nin this very important legislation that Chairman Dodd is working on we \nnot only make sure we fix the last crisis but we potentially get ahead \nof the next crisis.\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, the Senator from Virginia, as usual, is \nmodest. He has explained a lot to me about the intricacies of this \narea, which is of great concern, and his knowledge on this is great. It \nis, I am finding, incredibly rewarding working with him on this issue. \nSo I want to speak about that a little today and follow up on the \nremarks the Senator from Virginia made.\n  As Senator Warner said, last Thursday, for one of the few times since \n24 stockbrokers first gathered under a Buttonwood tree in 1792, we had \na stock market that for 20 minutes stopped performing its essential \nfunction--discovering the price of securities based on a balance \nbetween buyers and sellers. Our equities markets collapsed in a matter \nof minutes--liquidity dropped off, a deluge of sell orders overwhelmed \nthe buyers, and the rug was pulled out from underneath millions of \ninvestors, plummeting the Dow Jones Industrial Average toward its \nbiggest intraday loss in history--nearly 1,000 points.\n  Then, just as quickly, and inexplicably, the market reversed course, \nsnapping back like a yo-yo, and recovered much of its lost ground, \nthank goodness. In the immediate aftermath, the world's focus turned to \nblack-box computer trading, which relies upon electronic trading \nalgorithms to execute thousands of orders in tiny fractions of a \nsecond. These high-frequency trading computer programs determine, with \nminimal, almost no human intervention, the timing, price, and quantity \nof orders.\n\n  It is too soon to know the myriad of factors that played into the \nweek's meltdown, although it appears to be quite likely that we \nwitnessed a real-time example of high-tech trading run wild or, in some \ncases, unplugged.\n  The cooperation between the SEC and the CFTC is critical to \nunraveling what happened in the futures and equities markets, and we \nshould wait for their investigation and for all the facts to be \ndiscovered. It is also too soon to coalesce about Band-Aid solutions; \nthat is, without also committing to dive deeper into structural \nproblems and inherent conflicts of interest that are part of all our \ncapital markets. The SEC still has not discovered or explained what \ntriggered or accelerated the incident, but already the leaders of the \nexchanges have admitted that no one had previously thought to implement \nsystem-wide circuit breakers or adequately protect against the \npossibility of erroneous trades.\n  Yesterday, after the meeting with the leaders of six exchanges, the \nSEC released a statement saying:\n\n       As a first step, the parties agreed on a structural \n     framework, to be refined over the next day, for strengthening \n     circuit breakers and handling erroneous trades.\n\n  Madam President, that is fine--and I mean that is fine--but it is \nindeed, as the SEC said, only a first step. While it is true we should \nwait for information to come in before we reach any conclusions, there \nare many questions that must be carefully reviewed and answered. The \nfirst and most obvious is whether we have gone from too few market \ncenters--it wasn't all that long ago we just had two, the New York \nStock Exchange and NASDAQ--to too many, each with different standards \nand procedures for protecting investors and preserving market \nintegrity.\n  We now have over 50 market centers, which has brought added \ncompetition. Competition is good. Today, algorithmic trading interests \nare wired against markets--equity, fixed income, futures, and options. \nThe market is the network, and yet our regulators work in silos. \nResponsibilities are divided between the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the CFTC. Within equity markets, we have several self-\nregulatory organizations setting rules--more silos: New York Stock \nExchange, NASDAQ, FINRA, National Stock Exchange, and more. All too \noften, those rules have been watered down and eliminated in the absence \nof the SEC establishing these and other regulatory controls across \nequity markets.\n  We created a national market system, but we forgot to create a \nnational regulatory and surveillance system to go along with it. We \nneed--we absolutely have to have--a consolidated audit trail across all \nmarket centers, as Senator Schumer and others have raised. As FINRA \nChairman Rick Ketchum admitted last October, regulators are looking at \n``an incomplete picture of the market and knowing full well that this \nfractured approach does not work.''\n  That is quoting the chairman of FINRA, Rick Ketchum.\n  The second obvious question is, Why is it taking the SEC so long to \nreconstruct the unusual market activity of last Thursday? There is an \nanswer to that--because there is no transparency. The Commission does \nnot yet collect by rule the data it needs to officially reconstruct \nunusual market activity. Even though Congress gave the SEC ``large \ntrader'' reporting authority in the Market Reform Act of 1990--that is \n1990, after the SEC had difficulty in reconstructing market incidents \nin 1987 and 1989--the SEC has never used it.\n  The SEC proposed a large trader rule in 1991, received comments, \nreproposed in 1994, and then unfortunately never adopted it--this, even \nthough the Commission acknowledges:\n\n       The current Electronic Blue Sheet system does not \n     efficiently collect large volumes of data in a timely manner \n     that allows the Commission to perform contemporaneous \n     analysis of the market events. Further, the data generated by \n     the EBS system does not include important information on the \n     time of the trade or the identity of the customer.\n\n  This is what the Commission acknowledges, that the data generated by \nthe EBS system does not include important information--the time of the \ntrade and the identity of the customer. How are you supposed to find \nout how something happened if you don't have data on the time of the \ntrade or the identity of the customer?\n  Flash forward to 2009. To SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro's credit, and to \nher real credit, she began a process of studying market structure and \nhigh-frequency trading last October.\n  I have to say, however, the pace of the Commission's progress has \nbeen slow. Indeed, as many of my colleagues know, I have come to the \nfloor repeatedly to call for a greater sense of urgency at the \nCommission.\n  For example, last year on September 23, I spoke on the Senate floor \nand asked about high frequency trading strategies:\n\n       Do these high-tech practices and their ballooning daily \n     volumes pose a systemic risk?\n       What do we really know about the cumulative effect of all \n     these changes on the stability of our capital markets?\n       In order to maximize speed of execution, many sponsored \n     access participants may neglect important pre-trade credit \n     and compliance checks that ensure faulty algorithms cannot \n     send out erroneous trades.\n\n  On November 20, 2009, I wrote a letter to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro \nasserting:\n\n       [T]ransparency, disclosure and risk compliance requirements \n     on the trading activities of high frequency traders are \n     needed urgently. And while I was encouraged to hear that the \n     Commission may move sooner with its existing authority to \n     require ``tagging'' and reporting by ``large traders'' now \n     using high-frequency algorithms, I am concerned that the \n     Commission does not intend to issue a concept release on high \n     frequency trading until early next year, and that rule \n     proposals should not be expected before the summer of 2010-\n     2011. Given that the Commission under current procedures is \n     now blind to high frequency operations, the need for \n     immediate action should not wait until the Commission has \n     completed its comprehensive review.\n\n  In her response on December 3, Chairman Schapiro assured me the \nCommission was planning to issue a proposed ``large trader'' tagging \nrule the following month. That was back in December.\n  But it was not until months later, on April 14, that the Commission \nfinally did so. While I understand these were incredible problems that \nfaced the SEC because there was no real regulatory oversight for many \nyears, and because of the many hurdles regulatory agencies face which \nslow them down--in particular the need to avoid unintended \nconsequences--this process was clearly way beyond deliberative.\n  Given the deficiencies in the current data collection system that the \nSEC itself acknowledges and which Congress gave the SEC the authority \nto address in 1990, this delay is inexcusable.\n  The SEC must move aggressively to finalize the large trader rule and \ninsist on fast-track implementation by the industry.\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\n  There are many other questions a deeper review should study.\n  Particularly the problem of high frequency programs which sell stock \nshort without first locating the underlying shares or borrowing them in \nhope that their price will drop and they can buy those shares back--so-\ncalled naked short selling--before the required delivery date--at a \nlower price for a profit. Last Thursday, it appears that the computers \nwent into overdrive spewing out sell orders, and in the critical 10 \nminute time period, I will bet my bottom dollar that many of those sell \norders were short sales that did not first locate the stock.\n  Now as I have said repeatedly, there is nothing wrong with short \nselling, I have done it myself. But I have always had to borrow the \nstock first.\n  Last July, along with Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and six other Senators, \nwe wrote the SEC demanding that short sales not be permitted unless the \nseller first obtains a ``hard locate'' of specified shares. But that \nproposal went nowhere, even though the SEC held a Roundtable last \nSeptember to discuss the problems associated with naked short selling.\n  The larger point is these high frequency trading firms have assumed \nthe role that specialists used to take. Some of them get the same \nbenefits of specialists. They get to ignore short-selling locate rules. \nThey get to step in front of other orders on the book legally. All \nbecause they provide liquidity, for which they are also paid.\n\n  Why should they have those advantages? Did some of them abandon their \nrole of liquidity provider when the market needed them most, and \ninstead use their advantages to disadvantage everyone else on the way \ndown? Those questions must be answered.\n  Last September 14 I went to the Senate floor and spoke about the \ndangers of unregulated high-frequency trading, asking:\n\n       If we experience another shock to the financial system, \n     will this new, and dominant, type of pseudo market maker act \n     in the interest of the markets when we really need them?\n       Will they step up and maintain a two-sided market, or will \n     they simply shut off the machines and walk away?\n       Even worse, will they seek even further profit and \n     exacerbate the downside?\n\n  After Thursday's plunge, I am afraid my questions have been answered.\n  Instead of providing ``fair and orderly markets'' as some market \nmakers are obligated to do, some of these unregulated players may have \nadded to the chaos, while others simply unplugged their computers and \nsuspended operations, reducing liquidity when the market needed it the \nvery most.\n  Here is another related question: Was there manipulation involved on \nThursday? More to the point, does the SEC even have the ability to \ndetect illegal manipulation by high frequency algorithms?\n  We know the SEC doesn't have the data it needs. The large trader rule \nhopefully will fix that at some future date. Hopefully sooner before \nlater.\n  There is also the question of whether the SEC has the internal \nanalytical capability to use that data to police trading activities? I \nknow this is something they want to do and we in Congress should help \nthem get it as soon as possible.\n  I have been suggesting that once the SEC collects the data, it should \nmask the proprietary nature of the data and either No. 1 release it to \nthe marketplace, or No. 2 to academics and private analytic firms under \n``hold confidential'' agreements. I believe the SEC needs help in \nconducting analyses about whether high frequency trading practices are \nharmful to the interests of long-term investors.\n  Another question I have raised in the past is whether the SEC needs \nto impose industry-wide pre-trade operational risk controls, in order \nto prevent the incidents and magnitude of trading errors and the havoc \nthey can cause.\n  After last Thursday, that one is starting to look easy.\n  Markets have always had operational risks, but it is clear that the \nproliferation of competing complex computer models has the potential to \nmagnify and exacerbate these risks in ways that can fundamentally \ndamage market integrity and confidence.\n  With computerized, high-frequency trading now responsible for an \nestimated 70 percent of daily trading volume, markets have come to rely \nupon these black-box systems for ample and consistent order flow.\n  Yet humans are simply unable to evaluate in real-time whether their \ntrading models are working as intended.\n  Yet another question is whether our markets are still performing one \nof their best and most important functions: the constant and reliable \nchanneling of capital through the public sale of company stock known as \ninitial public offerings. According to a series of reports released \nlast year by the accounting firm Grant Thornton, the answer is no, the \nIPO market in the United States ``has practically disappeared.''\n  The IPO market is where small and medium-size businesses go to get \nthe capital they need to grow, to pass through the valley of death, to \nget on with what they have to do.\n  Without a doubt, there have been many causes of the sad state of \nAmerica's IPO market. But one source of the problem might be the \ndominance of high frequency trading strategies designed to trade in the \nmost active, highly liquid names, but with little support for small-cap \nstocks.\n  Our markets should work to best serve Americans--by reflecting \nchanges in supply and demand and investors' assessments of stock \nfundamentals--not by encouraging a battle between algorithms looking to \nshave microseconds from their transactions in a few highly liquid \nnames. As Dallas Mavericks' owner and long-time and very successful and \nknowledgeable investor Mark Cuban has recently asked: ``What business \nis Wall Street in? . . . [I]t is important for this country to push \nWall Street back to the business of creating capital for businesses.''\n  There are other questions, as well, many involving conflicts of \ninterest and the failures of some of the exchanges and market centers \nto fulfill their gatekeeper function as self-regulatory organizations.\n  Moving forward, I applaud Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, for calling for hearings to be chaired by Senator Jack Reed \nwho is very knowledgeable in this area on the market's recent plunge \nand recovery. It could not be in better hands.\n  And I am also pleased that a number of market participants and \nregulators have recognized the need for regulations that will protect \nthe markets from future periods of extreme and inexplicable volatility \nlike last Thursday's.\n  I am concerned, however, that the SEC must not solely look for quick \nfixes and surface solutions. The events of May 6 call for a meaningful \nreview of these structural issues, leading to reforms that truly \nprotect investors and, really important, restore the credibility of our \nmarkets so they serve well their highest and best function.\n  That is why Congress, consistent with its oversight responsibilities, \nmust direct regulators to study and report, in a timely manner, on what \nneeds to be done to prevent another meltdown of this magnitude or one \neven worse. It is entirely appropriate for Congress to elaborate on the \nneeded elements of a meaningful review, many of which I have outlined \ntoday.\n  Senator Mark Warner and I want to add language to the current Wall \nStreet Reform Act that would do just that. Once that report to Congress \nis finished, only then can Congress either draft needed legislation or \nencourage new rules.\n  We all know that the challenge for regulators is to see beyond the \nhorizon and to act preventively before financial crises hit. That is \nthe key to everything we do around here. We have to look ahead.\n  This is always difficult, but especially so when markets are opaque \nand Wall Street interests resist even reasonable suggestions about \nneeded reforms.\n  During the past 9 months, in response to my calls for transparency \nand an SEC review of high frequency trading, many voices on Wall Street \npraised the virtues of electronic trading--and almost none were \ninterested in looking critically or even honestly for weaknesses or \npotential systemic risks. ``There is nothing wrong here.'' ``You \nshouldn't even look at this.'' That is all I was looking for and so \nmany on\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\nWall Street said, ``No, nothing wrong here. We should not spend time on \nthat.''\n  My staff has read through nearly a hundred comment letters submitted \nover a period of months from brokerage firms, consultants, exchanges, \nhigh frequency firms, and alternative trading systems. The vast, vast \nmajority of those letters stated the markets have performed \nexceptionally, and just needed to be left alone. They all stated how \nthings were fine and saw nothing amiss. Systemic risk? Not here.\n  Our exchanges--which by statute are required to ``prevent fraudulent \nand manipulative acts and practices'' and be the first line of \nregulatory review of trading practices--are now competing vigorously to \nattract high volume traders to maintain their profits. Yet in response \nto the SEC's concept release raising questions about market structure \nissues, sources of systemic risk and possible manipulation by high \nfrequency traders, the CEO of BATS Exchange sent out a ``call to \naction'' for all high frequency trading firms, suggesting that they all \nfile comment letters on common themes. ``The best defense is a good \noffense,'' he wrote.\n  His letter also said:\n\n       BATS doesn't believe the equities markets are broken. To \n     the contrary, we would argue that the US equity markets were \n     a shining model of reliability and healthy function during \n     what some are calling one of the most challenging and \n     difficult times in recent market history.\n\n  He went on to write:\n\n       Those outside the industry, who have differing opinions, \n     are likely to have a difficult time bringing forward \n     compelling arguments based on the lack of hard evidence.\n\n  I ask: Is this the attitude we want from those charged with \nprotecting investors? Yes, when the markets are opaque and no one \noutside the industry has any data, when the exchange leadership itself \nstays on the offense, it is indeed difficult to offer hard evidence \nsupporting a contrary view.\n  Then we read from a comment letter to the SEC written by the \nSecurities Traders Association in the week before the meltdown. The \nweek before the meltdown.\n\n       The equity markets are functioning properly, and there are \n     no signs of significant deficiencies or an inability to \n     perform their important functions.\n\n  Saying it does not make it so. Now the credibility of both markets is \nurgently in need of repair. But for that to happen, democracy must work \nin a way that permits timely reform of our most powerful financial \ninstitutions, and Wall Street must and should recognize its own long-\nterm interests. The credibility of our markets is vitally at stake.\n  As I have said many times on this floor, what is important are two \nthings that make this country great: democracy and our capital markets. \nIf we let something happen to the credibility of our capital markets, \nwe will have done a great disservice to our country now and to our \ngrandchildren.\n  I will close my remarks today with the same words I used to conclude \nmy floor speech last September 23, as they still ring true to me.\n\n       We cannot simply react to problems after they have \n     occurred. We need the information and resources to identify \n     problems before they arise and stop them in their tracks . . \n     . [We] cannot allow liquidity to trump transparency and \n     fairness, and we cannot permit the need for speed to blind us \n     to the potentially devastating risks inherent in effectively \n     unregulated transactions.\n\n  I thought I was right when I gave it on September 23. After what \nhappened last Thursday, I feel it is even more appropriate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I appreciate the leadership of my \ncolleague from Delaware who understands this Wall Street reform perhaps \nbetter than anybody in the Senate, and has particularly led the charge \non working on too big to fail meaning too big. That the size of banks \nin this country--when the six largest banks' assets 15 years ago were \nonly 17 percent of GDP, and today the assets of the six largest banks \ntotal 63 percent of gross domestic product, we know that too big to \nfail really is too big. I appreciate the work Senator Kaufman has done \non that.\n  We know what a financial meltdown looks like. It means pensions \nshattered, it means homes lost, it means college plans delayed or even \nabandoned, it means good-paying jobs lost, it means middle-class \nsecurity undermined. Two years after the financial collapse in March \n2010, there were 655,000 unemployed Ohioans. Ohio's unemployment rate \ntoday is 11 percent. Three of the largest banks slashed their SBA \nlending by 86 percent from 2008 to 2009. In Ohio, small business SBA-\nbacked loans went from 4,200 of them in 2007 to 2,100 of them in 2009. \nWall Street's casino gambling with the housing markets has caused \nnearly 90,000 foreclosures in Ohio just in the year 2009. The average \nmedian sales price of existing single-family homes across eight of \nOhio's metropolitan markets plunged by an average of 16 percent from \n2007 to 2009.\n  So why are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle trying to \nmaintain the regulatory environment that allowed Wall Street to \nsquander middle-class wealth and security? It makes me incredulous to \nthink there are people in this institution, and a number of them, who \nwant to continue the way it is always done, who think Wall Street does \nnot need further regulation.\n  They were the same people who in the Bush years pushed for \nderegulation, and then President Bush assisted his Republican friends \nby putting more pro-bank, pro-Wall Street bank regulators in place to \nregulate after already weakening the regulations.\n  Neither Republicans nor Democrats should be starting this debate, \nshould be starting the legislative process, by thinking, well, what is \nbest for Wall Street, and then by working backward to see which \nconsumer protections Wall Street can live with. That is not how you \nstart this debate.\n  You do not say: Well, we have got to decide, can Wall Street live \nwith these protections? Are these protections okay? Does Wall Street \napprove of these protections before we do them? That is not the way we \nshould be legislating. We should be starting with what will protect \nmiddle-class families from another devastating economic blow, and we \nshould then move forward to put those protections in place. It should \nbe as simple as that.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I are fighting for the strongest \npossible measures to hold Wall Street accountable. I hope my Republican \ncolleagues resist the temptation, a temptation they usually succumb to, \nto water down reform and carve out loopholes for the special interests. \nThat has been the problem all along, the power of the bank lobby here, \nthe power of Wall Street in the House of Representatives and the \nSenate, the bias so many have that, well, Wall Street did not really do \nthat badly, we should water down this reform, we should carve out \nloopholes so Wall Street can continue doing business the way they did.\n  It is time, instead, to act on behalf of the people we serve, not \nWall Street firms. Too many of my colleagues across the aisle, simply \nput, are putting Wall Street before Main Street.\n  The first step toward the financial recovery is protecting American \nfamilies who rely on credit cards to meet their financial obligations \nor mortgages, to finance their dream of home ownership. Let's not \nforget that the kindling for this fire that became the global financial \ncrisis was a pile of exploding mortgages. If we allow lenders of all \ntypes to continue preying upon hard-working Americans, then we are \nsetting ourselves up for another disaster. This time it was securitized \nmortgages. Next time it can be student loans or it could be credit card \ndebt, or it could be commercial real estate or it could be the junk \nbond market. Who can say for sure? That is why the independent consumer \nprotection bureau in this legislation is essential.\n  It will create, for the first time, an entity dedicated to protecting \nthe interests of middle-class Americans against the greed and the \nrecklessness of Wall Street. We need a watchdog to make sure Wall \nStreet gamblers and their lobbyists do not trample the American dream \nas a means of feeding their own greed.\n  Beyond establishing this agency, an agency tasked with protecting the \ninterests of middle-class families, we have an opportunity to do much \nmore to protect American families. We should adopt an amendment offered \nby Senator Whitehouse, cosponsored by my colleague sitting nearby on \nthe floor, Senator Casey, and a number of us, a bipartisan amendment, \nthat\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\nwould empower States to protect their citizens from unfair credit card \ninterest rates.\n  Thirty-two years ago the Supreme Court decision, the Marquette \ndecision, perhaps the most important Supreme Court decision Americans \ndo not know about, overruled the consumer protections, so-called usury \nrates, interest rates, among the 50 States.\n  In other words, if the legislatures of the State of Pennsylvania, the \nState of North Carolina, the Presiding Officer's State, or my State of \nOhio, enacted an 18-percent usury rate or a 16-percent usury rate, that \nis the top rate at which lenders can charge customers. Those rates were \noverturned by the Supreme Court decision because the Supreme Court \ndecided it does not matter where the customer is, whether the customer \nis in Charlotte or Harrisburg or Cleveland or Columbus, it mattered \nwhere the bank was.\n  Basically what that meant was, bank after bank after bank located \ntheir operations in a State with very high usury rates or no usury \nrates at all. Therefore, a customer in Akron or a customer in Toledo or \nMansfield or Springfield or Xenia, having a credit card with a bank in \nSouth Dakota paid much higher interest rates, even though Ohio set its \ninterest rates much lower.\n  Usury rates--I quoted today in a presentation earlier--were \nestablished by the Bible. In Exodus 12, I believe, the Bible says \nclearly that usury rates--the usurious interest rates aimed at the \npoor, and aimed really at everybody, simply should not stand.\n  Yet, by this Supreme Court decision in 1978, the Court ruled we would \nbasically outsource our interest rate, our consumer protections, to the \nlowest common denominator State. So if South Dakota has no usury rates \nor no limit or a very high limit on their interest rates, it means a \ncredit card holder in Lima, OH or Troy, OH or Springboro, OH is paying \nthose high interest rates, even though the Ohio legislature has acted \nagainst their doing that.\n\n  So the Whitehouse-Casey-Sanders-Brown amendment, a bipartisan \namendment, is particularly important simply to give the power back to \nthe States to make a determination of interest rates. For too long, as \nthis Supreme Court decision indicates, and the lack of response from \nCongress indicates, Washington has been looking out for the megabanks.\n  Some of my colleagues are still saying these banks' interests are \nmore important than protecting the American public. This bill would not \neven allow the consumer protection bureau to set rules regarding credit \ncard interest rates. Meanwhile these rates are inexplicably going \nthrough the roof, at the same time the banks are again enjoying record \nlow borrowing costs. It makes no sense. We report to the American \npublic, not to high-risk business models.\n  The next element of financial collapse came when Wall Street bundled \ntoxic mortgages into untested products such as mortgage-backed \nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic CDOs and \ncredit default swaps. Many of these new products, products that almost \nnobody understands, were unregulated derivatives sold in over-the-\ncounter markets with no oversight or transparency.\n  As a member of both the Banking and the Agriculture Committees, I \nwant to commend the Chairs of each of those committees for the work in \ncreating a derivatives title, a regulation of derivatives, that will \nprovide much needed oversight to the $210 trillion--$210 trillion--that \nis the 210 thousand billion dollar U.S. derivatives market.\n  At the same time we balance the need in regulation of derivatives, we \nbalance the needs of manufacturers in Dayton, Youngstown, and Toledo, \nwho used these products appropriately, and that was not where the \nproblem was, to limit their business risk.\n  This bill provides for financial stability by requiring banks to put \ncapital behind their trades. It uses transparency and accountability to \nprevent Wall Street banks from taking advantage of their business \ncustomers. It reduces speculation that fuels bubbles in markets such as \nnatural gas and mortgages.\n  I want to single out Chairman Lincoln's proposal to separate \nderivatives operations from commercial banks. It is the right thing to \ndo, because the megabanks' speculation is detracting from their primary \njob, lending. Over the last six quarters, megabanks have decreased \ntheir consumer and small business lending. At the three biggest banks, \nlending under the SBA's 7(a) program, the primary SBA program to help \nstartup and existing small businesses, lending under that program \ndeclined 86 percent from 2 years ago to last year, and it does not \nappear to be getting a lot better this year.\n  Over the same period, banks' securities holdings increased by 23 \npercent. What does that mean? That means rather than investing in a \nlocal manufacturing company, Elyria Foundry, or Alcoa in Cleveland, or \nsmaller companies, a fastener company in Bedford, or companies, \nmanufacturing companies, instead of investing in those, their security \nholdings increased. That is where their capital went.\n  That was not productive for our country. It may have been profitable \nfor the banks, but it does not work to get our economy back in gear. \nTaxpayer-funded assistance from the FDIC and the Fed should not be \ngoing to support a bank's gambling, it should be supporting sound \neconomic growth.\n  In an ideal world, we would treat derivative products like all other \ninvestment products and trade them on exchanges.\n  This is a strong bill, particularly now that we have adopted Senator \nCantwell's antimanipulation amendment. We are finally going to impose \nsome order and allow sunlight into what has been and is currently a \ncompletely dark and opaque market.\n  The final ingredient to the financial crisis came when massive, \ninterconnected Wall Street banks and investment houses--such as AIG and \nCitigroup and others--gorged themselves on risky derivatives backed by \npredatory mortgages. When these bets went bad, the U.S. Government \ndecided these banks were too big to fail, and the U.S. taxpayer was \nforced to settle their hundreds of billions of dollars in obligations. \nThese too big to fail banks are getting even bigger. Right now the five \nbiggest banks control 97 percent of all U.S. derivatives. For the first \ntime, we are going to have a process to liquidate these large financial \ninstitutions if they fail. Such a system was lacking at the time the \ngiant investment banks, such as Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns, and \nMerrill Lynch, were in financial peril, due to overleveraging and \ninvestment in toxic investments.\n  I believe the bill should be strengthened to make absolutely certain \nthere are no more meltdowns and no more bailouts. I would like to add \nstronger safeguards against behemoth banks that control so much of the \nNations's wealth they could singlehandedly send our economy spiraling \ndownward. Too big to fail means too big. While this is mostly about the \nrisk these banks took and might take in the future, it is also about \nsize. When 15 years ago the assets of the six largest banks combined \nwere 17 percent of the GDP and today the six banks' total assets make \nup 63 percent of GDP, too big to fail is also simply too big. It is \ncrucial we adopt an amendment offered by Senators Merkley and Levin to \nban proprietary trading. Too many Wall Street banks got rich at the \nexpense of clients they were supposed to be serving and American \nfamilies whose homes have been taken from them.\n  It is equally important that we consider and adopt the amendment \noffered by Senators Cantwell and McCain to reimpose the Glass-Steagall \nwall between commercial and investment banking. We should pass the \nDorgan amendment, giving the systemic risk council the authority to \nspin off parts of large, cross-border financial institutions. After 2 \nyears, after millions of jobs lost, after millions of homes foreclosed \nupon, we are attempting to put in place rules that might prevent the \nnext crisis. We should not dilute this critical piece of legislation \nwith amendments that coddle Wall Street. Too many of my Republican \ncolleagues are still trying to do that, introducing amendments that \nchoose Wall Street over Main Street.\n  It is important this legislation move forward. It is important that \nall of us fight to choose Main Street over Wall Street so this works \nfor Findlay, Warren, Bolero, and Tipp City, OH, communities that have \nbeen hit hard by the\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\ngreed and recklessness of Wall Street banks.\n  That is clear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 3878.\n  We are in the midst of the worst recession, the worst economic \nclimate since the 1930s. That is irrefutable. We have had record job \nloss, more than 15 million Americans out of work. In Pennsylvania, some \n582,000 people are out of work, with the unemployment rate hitting 9 \npercent. I know a lot of other States have had double-digit \nunemployment for a long time, but 9 percent is still more than 580,000 \npeople out of work.\n  There are a number of ways to measure the horrific consequences of \nthis recession--all those individuals out of work, all those families \ndestroyed and communities destroyed, by one estimate $8 trillion of \nwealth lost by Americans. We can attribute $100,000 per family in \nnegative impact due to what happened on Wall Street.\n  In the midst of that, a number of people in the Senate have worked \nvery hard to try to put in place new strategies to create jobs, to help \nus continue to recover. The impact of the recovery bill is still being \nfelt. We are recovering. Economic growth has picked up. Job growth has \nimproved substantially, but we still have a long way to go.\n  Despite that, we still have people in Washington who don't seem to \nget it. They seem to want to continue to protect Wall Street. Time \nafter time, when an amendment is proposed to the Restoring American \nFinancial Stability Act, there are still some who want to protect Wall \nStreet. The choice is very clear. There is no middle ground. The \nAmerican people know it. We can either protect Wall Street and let them \ndo what they have been doing for years, destroying lives because of \nhigh-risk practices, allowing these scheme artists--and that is a \ncharitable way of describing people who commit fraud or at least engage \nin practices that make a very small sliver of the American people on \nWall Street very wealthy, creating a handful of billionaires at the \nexpense of tens of millions of Americans who lost their job, their home \nor, in some cases, both and are in the process of trying to dig out of \nthat and rebuild their lives. You are on one side or the other in this \ndebate. You are either for Wall Street or you are for reforms that \nwill, at long last, begin to hold Wall Street accountable.\n  It is essential to the economy that we pass this legislation. If we \ndon't, we will be right back where we were, with no commonsense rules \nin place, Wall Street doing virtually what they want to do to make \nmoney, no matter what the consequences downstream with regard to those \nwho lose their jobs, their homes and, by definition, their hopes and \ndreams. We have to put in place new strategies not only to create jobs \nbut to reduce the deficit. We cannot do that unless we take affirmative \nsteps to hold Wall Street accountable and give some measure of \nprotection to families who have, for too long, been at the other end of \nthe bargain. They lose their house. They lose their job. Wall Street \nwins. They lose $100,000, on average, per family. Wall Street wins very \nbig.\n  One of the things that should be in place is at least the examination \nof something that was discussed at the G-20 conference in September of \nlast year in Pittsburgh, where the leaders of the 20 largest economies \ncame together and talked about our financial crisis which, of course, \nis an international crisis. It is not something limited to the United \nStates. Recently, the European Parliament took the first step by \npassing a resolution supporting a study on a financial transaction tax, \na fee. The resolution specifically calls for an in-depth study that \nwould provide technical recommendations on how such a fee should be \nstructured across the Euro zone. The study proposed in my amendment \nmirrors the European study and positions the United States to have an \ninformed debate about the issue. This study is simple but can have a \ntremendous impact on the economy because of what we will learn.\n  The study would examine the implementation of a transaction fee on \nall security-based transactions, including swaps and security-based \nswaps, except those that are somehow hedging or mitigating risk. Also \nincluded in these transactions would be stock and debt instruments.\n  Here is what the study would assess. Again, this is not the \nimposition of a transaction fee. This is a study of the imposition of a \ntransaction fee or the implementation thereof. The study would assess, \nfirst, past uses of such fees, what has happened in the recent past and \nour experience with this, other countries that have tried this, other \nexperts who have weighed in, obviously, on the advantages and \ndisadvantages of this kind of fee, and the potential to raise revenue.\n  We hear a lot of talk in this Chamber about reducing the deficit. It \nis going to be pretty difficult to do that in the current environment \nunless we have new revenue. One of the ways to have new revenue in \nplace is to have a transaction fee. Again, this amendment would simply \nrequire the study of a transaction fee.\n  Next, the study would assess the impact on financial markets, which \nis something we have to consider and weigh and analyze, and the impact \non risky investment behavior. We might know the answer to that, \ngenerally, because with a transaction fee in place, it is probably less \nlikely that a financial institution would engage in the kind of risky, \nreckless, irresponsible and, in some cases, illegal behavior they have \nengaged in which has cost the average American family $100,000 per \nfamily because of what they did on Wall Street over a number of years.\n  The study called for in the amendment would be open to public \ncomment, would be conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in coordination with the \nDepartment of the Treasury. It is important to have those three \nagencies involved in the review. It is not just going to be farmed out \nto some think tank, where it can be criticized because it lands on one \nside of the political divide or another. It is going to be conducted, \nif we get this in place, by the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, two agencies with substantial \nexperience and expertise about this kind of a fee, a transaction fee, \nworking in coordination with the Treasury Department. It is important \nto have those agencies involved instead of having a study done by a \ngroup that has, in many cases, limited expertise.\n  Given the dramatic cost of the recession on our economy, the horrific \nand destabilizing job loss we have had, not to mention the world \neconomic downturn, we need to be proactive and thoughtful and \nanalytical in assessing a transaction fee and the positive impact it \ncan have on reducing the deficit and creating jobs.\n  For those who will weigh in against the amendment, I ask: Where is \nthe other revenue they are going to need to reduce the deficit or at \nleast to allocate part of the revenue we generate to reducing the \ndeficit? What are they going to do about job creation? If they are not \ndoing some work on both of those, they are not too concerned about \nwhere the economy is going. If we are going to fully recover and grow \nand sustain growth overtime, we need job creation, and we need to \nreduce the deficit.\n  Predictably, I received a letter recently from the Chamber of \nCommerce that has come out against the study of a transaction fee. In \nmy judgment, it is entirely predictable that the Chamber of Commerce of \nthe United States is opposed. I will leave it to them to make their \ncase. I hope the amendment has bipartisan and broad support, which I \nbelieve eventually it will. Unfortunately for the Chamber of Commerce, \nthey are doing what they always do. They are trying to protect Wall \nStreet in a debate on the study of a transaction fee but in the larger \ndebate as well.\n  It is very simple. There are two places to be--protecting Wall Street \nor standing for reform. The Chamber of Commerce has just weighed in on \nthe side of Wall Street. They will have to answer to all the small \nbusinesses in Pennsylvania, for example, and across the country and \neven larger businesses but especially small businesses that have been \ndevastated by what has been happening on Wall Street. The idea that the \nChamber of Commerce is coming out against the study--the study;\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\nthe analysis--of a transaction fee is disturbing. It tells you a lot \nabout where they stand in this debate.\n\n  I know where the American people are. They want reform, and they want \nit now, and they do not want it watered down. They do not want the bill \ngutted with amendments. They want to have information they should have \na right to expect on the effect of a transaction fee--good, bad, or \nindifferent. They should have that information. What the American \npeople do not want is the Chamber of Commerce or any other organization \nstanding between Wall Street and what has been happening there and \nreform.\n  I urge the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce to go back, take \nanother look at this, take another look at what is the harm of having a \nstudy conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission in conjunction with the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury. I do not care what year it is. I do not \ncare what administration it is, those three parts of our government \nshould have the right and should be instructed by the Congress to study \nsomething that has potential--significant potential--to lower the \ndeficit, or help us lower the deficit, and to create jobs.\n  But to have the usual knee-jerk political reaction the Chamber of \nCommerce and others will have is not in the best interests of the \nAmerican people and is not helping in any way the debate we are having \non the floor of the Senate.\n  So for the chamber folks--or for their allies--it is simple, folks. \nYou have two choices. You can stand here and protect, with all your \nmight, the practices on Wall Street--the fraud, the manipulation, the \nscheme artistry that put us into this ditch we are in right now--or you \ncan be for reform. You have a choice to make. It is very simple. There \nis no middle ground.\n  I hope the Members of the Senate would take a closer look at this \nthan apparently the chamber has and stand up for the American people \nand show at long last we are not going to allow Wall Street to destroy \nmore lives, we are not going to allow Wall Street to allow an adverse \nimpact of $100,000 per family to transpire again, that we are going to \nat long last provide real reform for the American people and hold Wall \nStreet accountable for the abusive practices they engage in, for the \ndishonesty and fraud and sometimes criminal conduct they engage in.\n  It is about time the groups that are opposing reform--of course, the \nchamber has been opposing lots of reform lately; we will not go into \nall of it, but I would hope the Chamber of Commerce would make it very \nclear where they stand in this debate. Because when they come out \nagainst proposals such as this, they stand to protect Wall Street at \nthe expense of the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have an amendment which has been filed \nand is at the desk, and a modification of that amendment, which I wish \nto explain for a moment.\n  It is an amendment related to interchange fees. Interchange fees are \nthe fees charged to commercial establishments which accept credit \ncards. So if I owned a restaurant and accepted Visa or MasterCard, when \nmy customer, who has a bill, presents the credit card to pay for it, \nthen I have to pay a percentage of that bill to the credit card \ncompany. That is called the interchange fee.\n  That is separate and apart from the customer's relationship with the \ncredit card company. This is the relationship of the merchant, the \nretail establishment, the small business, with the credit card company. \nUnfortunately, over the years, small businesses across America have had \nlittle or no bargaining power with the major credit card companies. \nThey impose interchange fees on these businesses, and if you speak to \nsome of the small businesses in Illinois or across the Nation, you will \nfind that many of them feel they are being treated unfairly.\n  Let me give you an example. About half of the transactions that take \nplace now using plastic are with credit cards, and there is a fee \ncharged--usually 1 or 2 percent of the actual amount that is charged to \nthe credit card. It is understandable because the credit card company \nis creating this means of payment. It is also running the risk of \ndefault and collection, where someone does not pay off their credit \ncard. So the fee is understandable because there is risk associated \nwith it.\n  But now gaining in popularity is this so-called debit card, where a \nperson directly draws money from their checking account to pay that \nsame restaurant. Had that person chosen to pay by check--a written \ncheck--it would have been banked by the restaurant in their own bank, \nand drawn from the bank of the customer, with no fee associated with \nit. If the customer uses a debit card--which accomplishes the same \nthing without the actual check paper involved--the credit card/debit \ncard companies, Visa, MasterCard, and others--charge similar fees to \nwhat they charge for credit card. Yet there is virtually no risk \ninvolved in a debit card.\n  So many of these retail establishments and small businesses across \nAmerica have come and said: We are not opposed to paying a reasonable, \nproportional amount for the use of a debit card, for example, at our \nbusiness, but we cannot even get to first base with Visa and \nMasterCard. They say: We are going to charge you what we are going to \ncharge you--take it or leave it.\n  As a consequence, I have submitted this amendment. This amendment is \non behalf of small businesses across the United States which have \nrallied behind this because of their concerns about interchange fees on \ntheir cost of doing business. It says we will use the same mechanism we \nused in credit card reform--a bill that was brought to the floor by \nSenator Dodd of the Senate Banking Committee, which called on the \nFederal Reserve to establish the appropriate fees and charges to \nbusiness establishments for the use of credit cards--and that these \nfees and charges be reasonable and proportional when it comes to debit \ncards. I do not think that is unreasonable. Senator Dodd offered that \nas part of the original credit card reform when it came to customers \nusing credit cards. I do not think it is unreasonable to apply it to \nthe business establishments.\n  You would think there would be general support of this across the \nboard, except from the credit card companies and the biggest banks. But \nit turns out there is opposition to this from the so-called independent \ncommunity banks and credit unions.\n  We created an exemption in my amendment saying if you are a so-called \nindependent community bank that has assets of less than $1 billion, you \nwill not be affected by this--believing we took the lion's share, the \nvast majority of community banks, and exempted them with the $1 billion \nexemption. Regardless, the independent community banks again teamed up \nwith the American Bankers Association and said: We are going to oppose \nit anyway, even if the majority of our members are not covered by it. \nAnd credit unions, which go lockstep with the so-called independent \ncommunity banks when it comes to a lot of banking issues, said the same \nthing. So in an effort to reach a compromise here that will help \nMembers come to the support of this amendment, I am going to modify my \namendment to extend and enlarge the exemption to institutions of $10 \nbillion or less.\n  Let me tell you what that means. With the modification--changing it \nfrom $1 billion to $10 billion--it will have a dramatic difference. \nWith a $10 billion exemption, 99 percent of banks would be exempt. All \nbut the very largest banks in America--the ones that have a controlling \ninterest in establishing interchange fees, I might add--99 percent of \nbanks would be exempt. And 99 percent of credit unions would be exempt. \nAll but three credit unions in the United States have less than $10 \nbillion. And 97 percent of thrift institutions would be exempt--19 \nthrift institutions across America.\n\n  When I have talked to my friends on both sides of the aisle, they \nhave said: If you can find a way to resolve the opposition of the \ncommunity banks and credit unions, then we are open to this. Many of \nthem have said they believe small businesses and retail establishments \nare being treated unfairly and they wish to support this. But they \nwanted to make sure they did not harm local and community banks.\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\n  Well, I have gone from a $1 billion exemption to a $10 billion \nexemption. There are very few communities across America that have \nbanks that will not be protected because of this enlargement of this \nexemption, and I urge my colleagues to consider that, and to also \nconsider the other side of the equation. Think of the hundreds, if not \nthousands, of small businesses in your State that are being \ndisadvantaged and treated unfairly with these interchange fees.\n  What we are asking for is to have an arbiter--in this case the \nFederal Reserve--determine whether the interchange fees, particularly \nfor debit cards, are reasonable and proportional.\n  We also say you ought to allow a commercial establishment which \naccepts a credit card to establish a minimum amount which you can \ncharge to a credit card. I went into Washington National Airport, \nstanding at a news stand there, and was behind a woman who was charging \n35 cents to a credit card. I said to the person at the cash register: \nIs that the lowest amount you have ever had charged to a credit card? \nShe said: No. We had 25 cents charged one day.\n  If you look at the actual calculations of fees paid by that business \nfor the use of that credit card, they lost money on that transaction. \nThey did not make any money on that. By the time they paid the swiping \nfees and the interchange fees, at the end of the day, they made \nnothing. They could have lost money.\n  Is it unreasonable for a business to say: We are not going to accept \ncredit cards for any purchase under $5 or $1? I do not think that is \nunreasonable since they are going to lose money in the process, and yet \nthe credit card companies prohibit small businesses from even \nestablishing those basic standards. They prohibit small businesses from \nsaying: We will give you a discount on the price if you pay cash. Why? \nIf we are truly going to have a competitive atmosphere and give small \nbusinesses in a struggling economy a fighting chance, why would we \nprohibit these things? Why would we give a monopoly--a virtual \nmonopoly--situation here, where two major credit card companies can \nimpose rules on small businesses which are so costly to them?\n  That is why I have submitted this amendment. It is not an easy \namendment--I understand that--because we have some competition among \nfriends here and Members will have to decide which they think is the \njust position. I hope they believe this amendment is. I hope they \nbelieve that small businesses--which currently have no bargaining power \nagainst these monopolies, such as Visa and MasterCard--deserve a voice \nin the process. I hope they believe that some of the unreasonable \nstandards set by credit card companies and imposed on small businesses \nhave to stop across America.\n  I cannot tell you how many glowing speeches are given in Congress on \nbehalf of small businesses. We all know how much they mean to us in our \ncommunities and in our overall economy. Well, here is our chance. \nSenators will have a chance to vote on behalf of retail establishments \nand small businesses all across their States who have come to me, \nbegging me to move forward on this amendment.\n  I have said--and I believe it is true--this is the first time anyone \nhas offered an interchange fee amendment on the floor of the Senate or \nin the House of Representatives. The fact is, it has not been offered \nbecause it is controversial. Some people do not want to touch it: Stay \naway from it. Don't bring it up. Well, that is not fair to small \nbusinesses. They deserve for us to step forward, and to offer these \namendments, and to make a policy choice.\n  When I tried to offer this amendment on the Credit Card Reform Act, \nthey said: Wrong place. When I try to offer it on this bill related to \nbanks and financial institutions, some have said: It is the wrong \nplace.\n  I have concluded there is no right place. This is a good place \nbecause it relates to consumer protection, it relates to financial \ninstitutions, it relates to our economy and making sure it thrives, and \nthrives in a responsible way. That means making sure interchange fees \nare reasonable across the board.\n  This amendment is needed. It is a response to price fixing by Visa \nand MasterCard. Interchange fees are received by the card-issuing bank \nin a debit transaction. However, Visa and MasterCard--which control 80 \npercent of the debit market--set the debit interchange fee rates that \napply to all banks within their networks. Every bank gets the same \ninterchange fee rate regardless of how efficient they have been in \nconducting debit transactions.\n  Visa and MasterCard do not allow banks to compete with one another or \nnegotiate with merchants over interchange rates, and there is no \nconstraint on Visa's and MasterCard's ability to fix rates at \nunreasonable levels. VISA and MasterCard consistently raise interchange \nrates because the more interchange fees the banks receive, the more the \nbanks will issue cards. Visa and MasterCard receive a fee each time a \ncard is swiped, so rising interchange rates enrich them as well.\n\n  Visa and MasterCard incidentally have reduced debit card interchange \nfees in other countries while they have increased them in the United \nStates. Let me repeat that. Visa and MasterCard have reduced debit \ninterchange rates in other countries while they have increased them in \nthe United States. Visa and MasterCard continue to raise U.S. \ninterchange rates, which are already the highest in the world.\n  The General Accounting Office found that regulators in other \ncountries have worked with VISA and MasterCard to voluntarily reduce \ntheir interchange rates. Just last month, VISA lowered many European \ndebit card rates by 60 percent while increasing many U.S. debit card \nrates by 30 percent.\n  What can businesses do about it? Nothing--no bargaining power. So \nthese American-based companies are cutting their charges in overseas \nmarkets and raising them at a time when we are facing one of the worst \nrecessions in American history. They are making it tougher for that \nsmall business to survive. They are making it tougher for them to keep \ntheir employees at work. Is that the right thing to do when our economy \nis facing a recession? I don't think so.\n  I don't set an interchange fee rate in this law. Some have argued \nthat we would reduce credit availability by regulating credit card \ninterchange rates. However, the amendment's reasonable fee requirement \nonly applies to debit cards; it doesn't apply to credit cards.\n  The Durbin reasonable debit fee requirement exempts small banks and \ncredit unions with assets under $10 billion, which, as I say, includes \n99 percent of all banks, credit unions, and thrift savings and loans \nacross the United States.\n  This amendment would not enable merchants to discriminate against \ndebit cards issued by small banks and credit unions. VISA and \nMasterCard contractually require merchants to accept all cards within \ntheir networks, and the amendment does not change that requirement. The \namendment would not have the Federal Reserve set interchange prices. \nUnder this amendment, the Fed would not set them. Instead, it would \noversee the debit interchange fees set by card networks to ensure they \nare reasonable and proportional to cost.\n  It is the same standard which the Banking Committee and Senator Dodd \noffered when it came to credit card reform. It is not a radical notion. \nIt is in the law already.\n  There is an argument some make that consumers benefit greatly from \nthe current interchange fee structure. Let me tell my colleagues the \nreality. This statement is contradicted by statements from groups that \nrepresent consumer interests.\n  Ed Mierzwinski, who is the consumer program director at U.S. PIRG, \ntestified before the House Judiciary Committee and said as follows:\n\n       The deceptive anticompetitive practices of the two credit \n     card associations VISA and MasterCard have injured consumers \n     and merchants for years. Interchange fees or hidden charges \n     are paid by all Americans, regardless of whether they use \n     credit, debit, checks, or cash. These fees impose the \n     greatest hardship on the most vulnerable customers: The \n     millions of American consumers without credit cards or \n     banking relationships. These consumers subsidize credit card \n     usage by paying inflated prices for many goods and service. \n     These prices are inflated by the billions of dollars of \n     anticompetitive interchange fees used to subsidize reward \n     programs.\n\n  The industry of credit cards also argues that merchants benefit from \nthe\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\npresent interchange system. A 2009 GAO report found that merchants \nreceive benefits from the existence of credit and debit card systems. \nIt does not say those benefits are the result of the present \ninterchange system. In fact, the same report starts with the title, \n``Rising Interchange Fees Have Increased Costs for Merchants,'' citing \nnumerous growing costs that the interchange fee structure imposes on \nmerchants. For example, the report states:\n\n       Although accepting credit cards provides benefits, \n     merchants report card costs are increasing faster than their \n     ability to negotiate or lower these costs.\n\n  I would say basically if we are going to revitalize small business in \nAmerica in retail establishments, if we are going to give them a \nfighting chance, we cannot ignore this any longer.\n  There are some who say: Withdraw this amendment. Wait for another \nday. Well, I have waited for a year and I don't want to wait anymore. I \nthink we ought to go on the record. I think we ought to have the \ncourage to stand up and say reasonable and proportional debit card \nrates that will be regulated by the Federal Reserve is not \nunreasonable; and secondly, that the anticompetitive practices which \nare imposed on small businesses and retailers across America have to \ncome to an end.\n  Most of the people I talk to on the floor of the Senate understand \nthis. I hope this modification I am making to my amendment--creating an \nexemption for banks with assets valued at lower than $10 billion--will \nmake it clear that we are not trying to create any hardship on \ncommunity banks and credit unions. Instead, we are going after the \nlargest banks and credit card companies for what I consider to be \nunreasonable conduct when it comes to the treatment of small businesses \nand retail businesses as well.\n  I hope to call up this amendment either late today or tomorrow. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in standing up for small business. We \ngive a lot of speeches about small businesses and retail businesses. \nThis will give my colleagues a chance to vote for them on this \ninterchange fee regulation reform.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto the Landrieu amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3992 to Amendment No. 3956\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I call up a second-degree amendment, which \nis at the desk.\n  Mr. DODD. First, Mr. President, are we temporarily laying aside the \nSnowe-Landrieu? What is the pending amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Landrieu amendment No. 3956 is \nnow pending.\n  Mr. DODD. OK.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3992 to amendment No. 3956.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To improve the credit risk retention provisions)\n\n       On page 1 of the amendment, strike line 3 and all that \n     follows through page 3, line 7, and insert the following:\n       ``(i) a portion of the credit risk for any asset that is \n     transferred, sold, or conveyed through the issuance of an \n     asset-backed security by the securitizer; or\n       ``(ii) a reduced portion or no portion of the credit risk \n     for an asset described in clause (i), if the originator of \n     the asset meets the underwriting standards prescribed under \n     paragraph (2)(B) or subsection (e)(4);\n       ``(C) specify--\n       ``(i) the permissible types, forms, and amounts of risk \n     retention that would meet the requirements of subparagraph \n     (B), including--\n\n       ``(I) retention of--\n\n       ``(aa) a specified amount or percentage of the total credit \n     risk of the asset;\n       ``(bb) the value of securities sold to investors; or\n       ``(cc) the interest of the seller in revolving assets;\n\n       ``(II) retention of the first-loss position by a third-\n     party purchaser that specifically negotiates for the purchase \n     of such first-loss position and provides due diligence on all \n     individual assets in the pool before the issuance of the \n     asset-backed securities;\n       ``(III) a determination by a Federal banking agency or the \n     Commission that the underwriting standards and controls of \n     the originator are adequate for risk retention purposes; and\n       ``(IV) provision of adequate representations and warranties \n     and related enforcement mechanisms; and\n\n       ``(ii) the minimum duration of the risk retention required \n     under this section;\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this is a second-degree amendment to the \nLandrieu-Isakson amendment. It is not a competing amendment; it is an \namendment to add additional provisions. I support the material in the \nLandrieu-Isakson amendment, which deals with the home mortgage market. \nThis amendment has further provisions in the same section of the bill \nto deal with risk-retention issues relating to the commercial real \nestate market and other asset classes.\n  According to market analysts and financial regulators, the provisions \naimed at the securitized credit market in this bill will undoubtedly \nimpact access to credit for millions of American consumers and \nbusinesses.\n  These issues--such as ``risk retention''--are very complicated.\n  The reforms are aimed at the ``residential and subprime'' market, and \nI am quite concerned that have not been carefully examined for all \nmarkets.\n  Additionally, they are have not been reviewed in the context of other \nmoving parts outside the bill, such as changing accounting standards, \ncapital requirements, other regulatory mandates, etc.\n  When combined, these significant changes create a huge amount of \n``uncertainty'' in the market, which today serves one of the greatest \nimpediments to new and private lending and investing.\n  The stakes are high. As Treasury Secretary Geithner has stressed, \n``no financial recovery plan will be successful unless it helps restart \nsecuritization markets for sound loans made to consumers and \nbusinesses--large and small.''\n  Yet, the ``totality'' of regulatory and account changes impact the \nfuture viability of these markets. In fact, both market participants \nand financial regulators agree that the outcome is unclear in both the \nshort and long term. The ``warning signs'' are there and cannot be \nignored after comments by the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC, and the \nInternational Monetary Fund, among others.\n  As such, we must carefully examine any new mandates to determine the \nmost appropriate and direct way to strengthen our lending markets, and \nto better serve consumers and businesses, while avoiding negative \ncomplications.\n  Such reforms are very important, and it is critical that we get them \nright.\n  This ``middle ground'' approach has two basic components:\n  First, because ``skin-in-the-game'' is important and can come in many \nforms, the proposed language improves the existing framework--using the \ncurrent language and construct in the Dodd bill--and requires the \nregulators to examine and consider equally which method of ``skin-in-\nthe-game'' is most appropriate:\n  A percent retention; Underwriting standards; strong, standardized and \ndisclosed ``representations and warranties''; Other methods--e.g. a \n``third party'' retention for CMBS in the ``Minnick-Bean-Moore-Adler-\nCampbell-Miller amendment that passed in the House unanimously--or the \nlike.\n  Second, it clarifies existing language in the bill that requires \nreforms to be considered by ``asset class.''\n  Under the Landrieu amendment, the regulators shall create the \n``qualified mortgage'' framework important to the residential market.\n  Under this secondary amendment, the regulators shall consider the \nappropriate forms of retention by ``asset class'' and type of loan--as \nwell as risk profile associated with it. This would include allowing \nthe regulators to consider using and strengthening a ``third party'' \nretention framework that is important to CMBS and CRE market \nparticipants. \n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\n  Ultimately, we think such an overall amendment is important because \nit comprehensively addresses all asset classes, (residential and \ncommercial mortgages, student loans, auto loans, etc.) and helps to \nhave a better format for approaching risk retention.\n  What the amendment does is take the exclusive focus off of just one \nform of risk retention and allows the regulator to evaluate the best \napproach to address risk retention by asset class.\n  This still includes a percent retention (if necessary), as well as \nunderwriting standards that actually get at the heart of the loans and \neven strong and uniform ``representations and warranties''--which are \nimportant to the investors--such as pension funds, mutual funds and \nendowments--who fuel lending in the securitized credit markets.\n  The amendment simply gives important direction to the regulators on \nstructuring reforms by ``asset class.'' This is critical in the context \nof conflicting rules and proposals aimed at these markets--some of \nwhich prejudge or disregard the House and Senate language in this area.\n  Most important, when taken with the Landrieu amendment, it would \naddress and encourage well underwritten loans--including the \n``qualified mortgage'' framework--as well as uniqueness of very \ndifferent markets--such as commercial real estate, auto loans, student \nloans, etc.\n  And, by avoiding a single asset ``carve-out'' for just \n``residential,'' it simply allows the regulators to customize ``skin-\nin-the-game'' for all asset classes--particularly ones that were not a \n``root case'' or ``systemic risk''. This protects consumers and \nbusinesses that are struggling to get access to credit.\n  Without ``reinventing the wheel'' on the Dodd bill, this approach \nprovides important reforms, while avoiding negative complications \nconcerning capital, liquidity and credit availability--particularly in \nthe commercial real estate market, which faces challenges and has a \nvery different structure.\n  Such an approach is crucial for business and consumer credit, and for \nan overall economic recovery.\n  And, for that reason, it is supported by lenders of all sizes and in \nall markets, commercial borrowers who have been active on this issue, \nand investors who fuel lending and are seeking certainty and \nconfidence.\n  Lastly, some of the language in this bill, particularly related to \nthe commercial mortgage market, passed the House Financial Services \nCommittee unanimously, as offered by Representatives Minnick, Bean, \nAdler, Moore, Campbell, and Miller.\n  I urge all my colleagues to accept this amendment as an addition to \nthe Landrieu-Isakson amendment, not a change of it, to help us address \nmore than simply the issues dealing with the residential real estate \nmarket but also, and most important, the commercial real estate market \nand other asset classes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. First, let me acknowledge the contributions of Senator \nCrapo to the Banking Committee efforts. While not endorsing the bill as \nit presently reads, he has been a valuable member of the committee for \nmany years. I deeply appreciate his input. His ideas are always \ntremendously constructive in any debate we have. I thank him for that.\n  I have asked my staff to meet with his staff to try to clear up some \nthings. I would like to be in a position of where we can accept the \namendment. I am not trying to prejudice one over the other. We would \nlike to keep some risk retention or good underwriting standards so the \nchoice is there. We are not trying to impose both.\n  I know the staffs are talking. On page 2 of the amendment, beginning \naround line 18, paragraph (I), beginning ``retention of'' and then it \nlists three paragraphs and possibly a fourth. We are looking for some \nclarity on the meaning of ``the value of securities sold to investors \nor the interest of the seller in revolving assets.'' On those two, we \nparticularly need some clarity on what that means. It seems vague to us \nas to how that would apply.\n  Rather than rush this along, we would like to take a few minutes and \nsee if we can come to some resolution of that and possibly accept it. \nSenator Landrieu will have to come over. It is her amendment we are \namending. We will see if we can reach accommodation and adopt it, if \npossible.\n  Let's take a few minutes and look at how we might work on this \ntogether. If we can come to a conclusion, I will be prepared to support \nthe Senator's amendment. I am not trying to distinguish real estate \nfrom commercial. I realize there are some differences. They are \ndifferent transactions, obviously, but the point is the same. We would \nlike to make sure the securitization, on which the Senator is \nabsolutely correct--I think these words become pejorative. When done \nwell, it expands opportunities tremendously in terms of creating \nadditional liquidity, making resources more available for more loans, \nhome sales, and the like, providing there are sound underwriting \nprinciples involved so we are not getting ourselves into trouble again. \nThat is why we have had an insistence on strong underwriting standards \nand risk retention, the old skin in the game. That is what risk \nretention means. If you have equity in it, you will be careful about \nwhat goes out the door and becomes securitized.\n  I am not interested in having risk retention if, in fact, we have \ngood standards that apply and we don't end up where we were 2 years \nago, discovering a lot of these instruments that got securitized ended \nup being worthless, even worse than worthless, in some cases, because \nof the problems they caused.\n  I respect where my colleague is coming from. If we can spend a few \nminutes and try and resolve this, then maybe we can come to some \nagreement. That would be my hope.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's remarks and \nwillingness to work on this amendment. We are both trying to get at the \nsame thing. I believe we can work out the questions with regard to the \nlanguage so we can move forward in a fashion that will help us to \naddress these problems to make sure the ultimate objective, on which we \nall agree--namely, making sure we have confidence in the quality of the \nassets that are utilized in securitization--is achieved.\n  I welcome that opportunity and look forward to working with the \nchairman.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Daily Digest clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3918\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay \naside the Landrieu-Isakson amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe we are prepared to have a voice \nvote on the Snowe-Landrieu amendment, which is the pending amendment, \nif I am not mistaken.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate, the \nquestion is agreeing to amendment No. 3918.\n  The amendment (No. 3918) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me once again thank Senators Snowe and \nLandrieu for their very valuable contribution to this bill in more \nclearly refining and making it abundantly clear that merchants and \nretailers and others are not included as financial services or \nfinancial products companies and are not to be covered by the consumer \nfinancial product bureau. I am very appreciative to both of them for \ntheir contribution.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see my colleague from North Dakota is \nhere, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know this is beginning to be a lengthy \ndebate\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\nand process on the floor of the Senate to get through amendments. My \ncolleague from Connecticut exhibits great patience to try to work \nthrough this. I know there are a lot of interests that have different \nviews about this, and they come to the floor and they want this \namendment or that. I understand all that. I know my colleague from \nConnecticut views this with the same seriousness of purpose as I do and \nunderstands that many of us not on the Banking Committee have not had \nthe opportunity to be involved in the debate until now--until it comes \nto the floor of the Senate--and have not been able to offer amendments.\n  I think that represents the appetite in the Senate to be engaged and \nto understand what has caused the most devastating financial event for \nour country since the Great Depression--something that collapsed some \n$15 trillion in value for the American people, caused very substantial \nunemployment, dramatic losses in income, the loss of homes and has led \nto hopelessness and helplessness for many Americans.\n  What happened to cause that? Was this some sort of natural disaster? \nNo, it wasn't a fire, a flood, a tornado, or an earthquake. It wasn't a \nnatural disaster. This was made with human hands. This is a manmade \ndisaster and, by the way, it could well have been predicted, in my \njudgment, and some of us did. Without pointing at myself necessarily, I \nsaid 11 years ago that I thought we were setting ourselves up for \nmassive taxpayer bailouts. I will not show the charts again, but it is \nnot surprising. We were going to modernize the financial system a \ndecade ago in order to compete with the Europeans and to bring it into \nthe modern age. Modernizing meant deciding let's deregulate everything. \nLet's not look at everything that is going on. The result is, a decade \nlater, a very substantial collapse in our economic system.\n  Mr. President, I have been thinking about the work that has gone on \nin the last couple of weeks on the floor of the Senate. I came in early \nthis morning to get something from the radio addresses of Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt in 1933 and 1934. The situation in this country, while \ndifferent by many decades, is similar with respect to what caused a \nsubstantial problem in this country. Then it was the Great Depression.\n  Let me read, if I might, just a couple of excerpts of what then-\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt said about our country and about \nwhat was needed to be done because it has, I think, significant \napplication to today. Here is a quote from Franklin Delano Roosevelt on \nMarch 12 of 1933:\n\n       We had a bad banking situation. Some of our bankers had \n     shown themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their \n     handling of the people's funds. They had abused the money \n     entrusted to them in speculation and unwise loans. This was \n     of course not true in the vast majority of our banks but it \n     was true in enough of them to shock the people for a time \n     into a sense of insecurity and put them into a frame of mind \n     where they did not differentiate, but seemed to assume that \n     the acts of a comparative few had tainted them all. It was \n     the government's job to straighten out this situation and do \n     it as quickly as possible. And the job is being performed.\n\n  This was, again, from President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. Quoting \nagain, he says:\n\n       After all, there is an element in the readjustment of our \n     financial system more important than currency, more important \n     than gold, and that is the confidence of the people. \n     Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in \n     carrying out our plan. You people must have faith; you must \n     not be stampeded by rumors or guesses. Let us unite in \n     banishing fear. We have provided the machinery to restore our \n     financial system; it is up to you to support and make it \n     work.\n\n  He was talking about a time in the shadow of the Great Depression. On \nSeptember 30, 1 year later, in his address to the Nation, Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt said:\n\n       The second step we have taken in the restoration of normal \n     business enterprise has been to clean up thoroughly \n     unwholesome conditions in the field of investment. In this we \n     have had the assistance from many bankers and businessmen, \n     most of whom recognize the past evils in the banking system, \n     in the sale of securities, in the deliberate encouragement of \n     stock gambling, in the sale of unsound mortgages and in many \n     other ways in which the public lost billions of dollars. They \n     saw that without changes in the policies and methods of \n     investment there could be no recovery of public confidence in \n     the security of savings.\n\n  Interesting. You could read that today, and it describes the task we \nhave before us today. But this wasn't language of today. This was from \n1933 and 1934. The thoroughly unwholesome conditions in the field of \ninvestment, in the sale of securities, in the deliberate encouragement \nof stock gambling, the sale of unsound mortgages. That is the year \n2005, 2009. Yet Franklin Delano Roosevelt described it in 1934, and he \nput together a plan. That plan included Glass-Steagall and other things \nto protect this country; to say never again will we allow that to \nhappen.\n  Then, a little over a decade ago, in this Chamber and in the White \nHouse, they said: We have to modernize our system. We have to get rid \nof all those protections from the Great Depression. They are old-\nfashioned. Let's dump them. So the Congress dumped them. I didn't \nsupport that. I vigorously opposed that. But they dumped them.\n  So the country had a very serious problem--the runup of a substantial \namount of new exotic securities, things that people didn't understand \nvery well--CDOs, securitization of almost anything somebody could \nsecuritize, getting fees from the sale of the transfer of securities, \nand then the development of something new called the credit default \nswap.\n  The credit default swap was a new approach. It was an insurance \npolicy against a bond default. But then there was a synthetic CDO or a \nsynthetic credit default swap, or what some called naked default swaps. \nThat meant that you could buy one of these instruments back and forth \nwithout ever having an insurable interest in the instrument itself, \njust making a wager with someone else about what might or might not \nhappen in the future.\n\n  During all of this time we watched a very substantial amount of \nactivity, on Wall Street particularly, take place that I think has been \npretty unwholesome for our country. This is an article of September 30, \n2008, which talks about the money from Wall Street that is beyond the \nlegal reach. It says there is $1.9 trillion of money that is run out of \nthe New York metropolitan area that sits in the Cayman Islands--a \nsecrecy jurisdiction. Another $1.5 trillion is lodged in four other \nsecrecy jurisdictions.\n  Let me quote from this article by Robert Morgenthau in the Wall \nStreet Journal on September 30, 2008.\n\n       Following the Great Depression, we bragged about a newly \n     installed safety net that was supposed to save us from such a \n     hard economic fall in the future. However, the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve System, the \n     Comptroller of the Currency and others have ignored trillions \n     of dollars that have migrated to offshore jurisdictions that \n     are secretive in nature and outside the safety net--beyond \n     the reach of U.S. regulators.\n\n  Well, it is not surprising that at the same time that money was being \nhidden in other parts of the world by some of the same Wall Street \ninterests that a massive amount of money was being paid one to another \non Wall Street and in the investment banking area.\n  Just to cite a couple of these examples, I have a description from \nabout a year and a half ago when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. The \nLehman Brothers bankruptcy followed Lehman Brothers Holdings agreeing \nto pay a total of more than $23 million to three executives leaving the \nsecurities firm just days before it collapsed.\n  The reason I point this out is there was so much money around for \neverybody--for everything--days before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. \nThere was $23 million paid to three executives leaving the securities \nfirm days before it collapsed. You wonder why. Does that make any \nsense? Does anybody think that is something that is worthy?\n  Here is a payment of $19 million to a man named Alan Fishman. He was \nthe CEO of Washington Mutual, which was run right into the ditch and \nwent belly up and had to be acquired by another company. Alan Fishman \nworked 3 weeks for Washington Mutual, and he got a severance deal of \n$19.1 million--$19.1 million.\n  In the heyday of executive compensation a couple of years ago on Wall \nStreet, in 2007, the head of Merrill Lynch made $161 million. That was \nStanley O'Neal. John Thain at Merrill Lynch made $83 million; Lloyd \nBlankfein of Goldman made $54 million; John Mack of Morgan Stanley made \n$41 million; James Dimon of\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\nJPMorgan Chase made $29 million; and--well, the list goes on. Kenneth \nLewis of Bank of America only made $20 million. He must be looking up \nat Stanley O'Neal's $161 million and asking: Where did I miss the boat?\n  But this kind of money was hanging around all of these issues and \nthese firms, and it was, Katey, bar the door. We are making massive \namounts of money and we are going to pay almost never before heard of \nsums to individuals for running these big companies--$150 million, $50 \nmillion, $83 million. So it is not surprising, then, that the American \npeople have a pretty dim view of what was going on on Wall Street when \nwe announce that what went on on Wall Street led to this dramatic \neconomic devastation to our country.\n  By the way, the devastation doesn't apply to everybody. I just saw \nthis morning that the unemployment rate among the higher income \nAmericans is 3 percent. So they are not feeling the pinch so much. But \nin the bottom 20 percent of the American people, the unemployment rate \nis around 18 percent. So there are a whole lot of folks at the bottom \nof the economic ladder who are paying the price for this unbelievable \nbehavior.\n  So the question is, What do we do about all this? What do we do to \nmake sure that when we are done in the Congress on something called \nfinancial reform, the American people have some notion that we will \nhave done the right things to prevent from happening again that which \nhappened to us in the last couple of years?\n  The presentations I have made on the Senate floor have perhaps led \npeople to think that I believe investment banks have no merit or no \nworth. That is simply not the case. I understand that our country and \nthe ability to produce in our country through a productive sector needs \nfinancing and that financing would include a range of financing \nopportunities. You do need investment banks, you need commercial banks, \nyou need venture capital firms, you need securities. I understand all \nof that.\n  But I also understand--it was a comedian, Mark Russell, who once \ndescribed investment banks by saying: ``Investment banking is to \nproductive enterprise like mud wrestling is to the performing arts.'' \nIf ever that applied, it surely must apply now when we look back to see \nwhat has happened in the last decade in investment banking. If we do \nnot fix it in this legislation, put a cork in it, and we leave this \nChamber and this Congress and claim to have fixed it and have not done \nit, then shame on us.\n  We have a responsibility. Let me tell you what I think the \nresponsibility is. It relates to a range of things that are not yet \ndone. It relates to dealing with the issue of too big to fail. I know \nwe had one vote, and we failed, unfortunately. There are other ways to \ndo this. But if we have institutions that are too big to fail, that are \nso large that they cause moral hazard to this country should they fail, \nso large that they cause completely unacceptable risks of bringing the \ncountry's economy down should they fail--if we do not do something \nabout that, we cannot claim ever that we have done something about this \nsystem. It is not about saying big is bad. It is about saying no-fault \ncapitalism doesn't work if you allow financial institutions to become \nso large that their failure can bring down this country's economy. That \nis what the issue is, and that needs to be fixed.\n  It appears to me we are probably not on the way to fixing that, but \nhope still arises. For me, it is not a triumph of hope over \nexpectation; it is a triumph of hope, believing it is still possible \nfor us to do the things necessary to fix what we need to do.\n  I also think the set of issues, in addition to too big to fail, \nincludes an amendment I will be offering banning naked credit default \nswaps, saying that if there are credit default swaps issued that have \nno insurable interest in bonds, then it seems to me that is just \nwagering and that can be done at our gambling centers in our country \nbut ought not be done in the lobbies of banks. That is an amendment \nwhich is very important. If we don't fix this, we will leave this town \nsaying we did financial reform but we did nothing about too big to fail \nand we did nothing about the binge of speculative activity in \ninstruments that have no insurable interest in bonds, credit default \nswaps that have no insurable interest in bonds.\n  Mr. Pearlstein, who writes a column for the Washington Post, asked a \nquestion which led me to be interested in the question, Why should \nthere be more insurance policies against bonds than there are bonds?\n  In any event, why should we, in our financial institutions, have \npeople wagering about whether a bond will default when, in fact, they \nhave no interest in the bond? We do not allow people to buy life \ninsurance on someone else's life because they don't have an insurable \ninterest. We don't allow someone to buy fire insurance on someone \nelse's house because there is not an insurable interest. Yet we have \ntrillions of dollars out there, called credit default swaps, making a \nwager on someone else's bond, whether someone else's bond will fail, \ndespite the fact that they have no insurable interest in the bond. If \nwe do not put a dagger in the heart of that kind of intense speculation \nthat has caused a significant amount of these problems, then we will \nhave, in my judgment, failed to have addressed the real causes and \nfailed to have done what we should do to make sure this cannot happen \nagain.\n  I believe my colleague from the State of Washington is going to offer \na restoration of sorts of the old Glass-Steagall law, which I think \nmakes sense. Others will offer legislation that would say to insured \nbanks: You ought not be trading securities and derivatives on your own \nproprietary accounts. It makes a lot of sense to me. All of those are \nimportant.\n  I mentioned before that I wrote the cover story for the Washington \nMonthly magazine 15 years ago titled ``Very Risky Business.'' At that \ntime, there was $16 trillion of notional value of derivatives, and I \nwrote the article saying it was very risky business because even then \nbanks were beginning to trade derivatives on their own proprietary \naccounts. That is not what insured banking should be. That is far too \nrisky and puts the taxpayer at risk.\n  Now we see that unemployment is at 9.9 percent. We are still trying \nto recover from this devastating recession. We are making some \nprogress.\n  Wall Street is back on track for record profits. This is 5 months \nago, now, from the New York Times. In a report released Tuesday, the \ncomptroller of New York State said Wall Street profits in 2009 are on \ntrack to exceed the record set 3 years ago at the height of the credit \nbubble. He also talked about bonuses at six banks that he thought would \nexceed the $162 billion paid in 2007. By the way, fueling these record \nprofits by these institutions is from the firm's own securities trading \naccounts, according to this story, as they borrow at near zero interest \nrates and put the money to work in the securities markets. It sounds as \nif nothing has changed. That is what helped cause this mess. Yet here \nwe are, back again, and the question is, Who is healing? The big \ninvestment banks are healing.\n  Let me for a moment remind everyone how important regulation is. This \nbill has a lot of regulatory allowance--some instruction but a lot of \nit allowance that says to regulators: Here is your responsibility.\n  One of the key issues that has exacerbated this substantial economic \ncollapse was something that happened in 2004, on April 28, in the \nbasement of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On the afternoon of \nApril 28, 2004, there were five members of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission who met in a basement hearing room to consider a request by \nthe five biggest investment banks. They wanted an exemption for their \nbrokerage units from the old regulation that limited the amount of debt \nthey could take on. What they said is: We want to be able to unshackle \nbillions of dollars now that we hold in reserve as cushions against \nlosses on investments. If we could unshackle that money we have to hold \nin reserve against losses, we could use that to flow up to the parent \ncompany and we could enable it to invest in a fast-growing world of \nmortgage-backed securities and credit derivatives and so on.\n  The five investment banks that led the charge--one of them was \nGoldman Sachs, headed then by Henry Paulson, who 2 years later was \nSecretary of the Treasury and inherited the mess that\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\nwas in part created by it. They had 55 minutes of discussion that \nafternoon, and after 55 minutes of discussion, the Securities and \nExchange Commission voted unanimously to allow these biggest banks in \nAmerica to take on leverage, going from about 12 to 1 or so, to 33 to \n1. In other words, for every dollar in equity, it could leverage about \n$33 in debt. By that notice in a basement hearing, with no press there \nat all--I think one reporter was there; it was barely reported--they \nset the stage for loading up dramatic amounts of debt in these \ninstitutions.\n  Now these institutions are, of course, very opposed to the amendment \nI am going to be offering here at some point, I hope, I expect, or I \ninsist--one of the three--that would ban naked credit default swaps \ntrading. They are very opposed to that. I understand why. They are \nmaking a lot of fees and profits as a result of this massive bubble of \nspeculation in these kinds of securities. But I don't think we have any \nchoice but to be taking on the center of the cause of this economic \ncollapse in our country.\n  The amount of effort that has been made to water down some of the \namendments that have been offered is troublesome to me. I think the \nlegislation that came out of the Banking Committee is meritorious. It \nhas value. I appreciate the work the committee did. But, as I said when \nI started, most Members of the Senate have not had a chance to weigh in \non this, and there are some substantial improvements that can be made--\nI hope should and will be made to the Banking Committee product. But \nthe improvements will not be improvements that strengthen our ability \nto prevent what happened from ever happening again if the so-\ncalled improvements are diminishing the strength of this bill.\n\n  We need regulatory oversight. If we have learned one thing in the \nlast decade, it is that you have to have regulators on the beat who \ntake regulation seriously. You also have to decide to put a stop to the \nthings that don't represent the kinds of business practices that give \nany strength to this country at all and, in fact, represent business \npractices that undermine this country's economy. That is why I believe \nit is critically important we continue to address the issues as I have \njust described--too big to fail and credit default swaps and related \nissues.\n  I am going to read, just for a moment, something from the November 5, \n1999, New York Times article when Congress passed a new piece of \nlegislation called financial modernization. This was written by Stephen \nLabaton. This is a quote, after the passage of the bill. I voted \nagainst it. I believed strongly then that it was a dangerous mistake \nfor our country. It turns out it was even more dangerous than I \nthought.\n  The architects and others said:\n\n       Today, Congress voted to update the rules that have \n     governed the financial services industry since the Great \n     Depression and replaced them with a system for the 21st \n     century. This historic legislation will better enable \n     American companies to compete in the new economy.\n\n  Another quote--in fact, that was from the White House, by the way. \nThat was from someone at Treasury.\n  This is from a Senator:\n\n       The world changes and we have to change with it.\n       We have a new century coming and we have a new opportunity \n     to dominate this century the way we dominated that century. \n     Glass-Steagall in the midst of the depression came at a time \n     when the thinking was that government was the answer. In this \n     era of prosperity, we decided that freedom is the answer.\n\n  Another Senator said:\n\n       If we don't pass this bill, we could find London or \n     Frankfurt or, years down the road, Shanghai becoming the \n     financial capital of the world. There are many reasons for \n     this bill but first and foremost is to ensure that U.S. \n     financial firms remain competitive.\n\n  The passage of that bill set this country up for the biggest fall \nsince the Great Depression.\n  The question on the floor of the Senate is this: Are we going to pass \na piece of legislation that has real strength in deciding that which \ncaused this deepest recession since the Great Depression cannot be \nallowed to happen again? Are we going to pass a piece of legislation \nthat has real regulation and real rules that work? Are we going to pass \na piece of legislation that says too big to fail is too big, period? \nAre we going to pass a piece of legislation that pierces the balloon of \nspeculation in instruments such as naked credit default swaps--\nsomething that was not even in our language 20 years ago. Are we going \nto address the questions of the securitization of everything, in many \ncases just for the sake of being able to capture fees? Are we going to \naddress the question effectively of rating agencies that gave AAA \nratings to bonds that were worthless? Are we going to address all these \nquestions or are we just going to pass a bill to say: We did it, good \nfor us, this is success, only to find out 5 years later or 10 years \nlater that we are right back in the same swamp?\n  I wish to simply say today that the American taxpayer has now been \nobligated--in addition to the joblessness and homelessness and other \nthings visited on the American people and the loss of about $14 \ntrillion or $15 trillion in value, the American taxpayer has been \nobligated to the tune of somewhere around $11 or $12 trillion lent, \nspent, or borrowed to interests that we do not now know because the \nFederal Reserve Board says: It is none of your business to whom we gave \ntrillions of dollars.\n  Given that, given the economic catastrophe that has visited a lot of \nthe American people, I think we owe them a piece of legislation here \nwith amendments that improve it, a piece of legislation that allows all \nof us at the end of this day to say no, we didn't water it down, we \nstrengthened it. We recognize the value of our financial institutions, \nbut we don't recognize the value of financial institutions that run \nthis country into the ground, pay $83 million in salaries, $20 million \nin bonuses, buy things they will never get from people who never had \nthem and claim fees on both ends, and claim they have done something \ngood for the country.\n  This country can do better than that. This is one of those times--I \nknow this is not seen perhaps by some with the same passion as some of \nthe other issues that get peoples' blood boiling, but I tell you, what \nwe do here will long be remembered because it will have consequences, \nwhether this country has a growing, strong economy for many years \nahead, and whether we avoid economic collapse or a deep recession.\n  I watch every morning and read the stories about Greece and other \ncountries that are in great difficulty. Our country is in some \nsignificant economic difficulty. We have sent people off to fight wars \nfor 8, 9 years, not paid for one single penny of it. Unbelievable to \nme. Every single bit was borrowed and put on the debt.\n  Then we have got people who thumb their suspenders and talk about how \nawful the debt is. We have a trade deficit that is relentless and means \nwe end up owing other countries, which will be paid with a lower \nstandard of living in our country. In addition to those issues, we have \ngot this issue of the near collapse of our economy by unbelievable \nspeculation coming from the banking industry.\n  We have got to fix all of these things if we want a country that \ngives our children the same opportunities we had. We cannot fix it by \nglossing over things with a coat of light paint. This has to be fixed \nwith real policies that tackle the central issues on what caused this \ncollapse.\n  I am here and I am ready to offer my amendment. In fact, the sooner \nthe better. I have been anxious to do that. I will stick around. As \nsoon as I am told my amendment will be in order, I am going to offer \nit. I guess we will be here until we finish this debate and complain \nuntil I get to offer the amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I will be hanging around.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, what is the current business before the \nSenate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Crapo amendment and the \nLandrieu amendment are the pending questions.\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\n                Amendment No. 3816 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  (Purpose: To implement regulatory oversight of the swap markets, to \nimprove regulators' access to information about all swaps, to encourage \nclearing while preventing concentration of inadequately hedged risks in \n   central clearinghouses and ensuring that corporate end users can \n continue to hedge their unique business risks, and to improve market \n                             transparency)\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside and I be allowed to call up my \namendment No. 3816.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object at \nall, I have chatted with my friend, Senator Chambliss, as well. I know \nhe is inquiring among his members, as is my colleague from Arkansas as \nwell, about a time agreement on the Chambliss amendment.\n  My hope would be it would not take too long. I know that is the plea \nof every manager, majority and minority leader. So if they can inquire \nas soon as possible on a time. There are several other amendments \ntonight I think we will be able to deal with, some of which will not \nrequire any rollcall votes.\n  But, obviously, Members like to get some sense of when votes will \noccur. I am not trying to suggest we truncate anything. I know my \ncolleagues agree that we need to find a time agreement. So I make that \nplea to both the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  With that, I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nunderstand the unanimous consent request is to set aside the pending \namendment. Is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not object. Let me respond for a moment, if I \nmight, to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I have indicated I wish to offer an amendment at some point. I want \nto know if I am on the list.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my good friend, he is on the list. We are going to \ntry to get to that amendment as soon as we can. I promise the Senator \nthat.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the word ``promise'' actually made the day \nfor me. So I will not object, and look forward to offering that \namendment at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for himself, Mr. \n     Shelby, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Johanns, Mr. \n     Cochran, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Thune, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3816 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of May 5, 2010, under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, first, let me thank the chairman. And \nhe is exactly right, I would encourage all of those who have indicated \nto me they wish to speak on my amendment, from both sides of the aisle, \nto let us know, come down to the floor. We wish to dispose of this \namendment as soon as possible. I am prepared to enter into any kind of \nreasonable time agreement as soon as we get an idea of exactly how many \nspeakers there will be in order to accommodate those folks.\n  I am going to talk in detail about the amendment, but first I do want \nto respond to the Senator from North Dakota who makes some good points \nwith which I agree. But when we talk about the elimination or not \nallowing credit default swaps, let me say what bothers me about that.\n  In 2000, when we passed the Commodities Futures Modernization Act, \nnobody envisioned that credit default swaps would mushroom as they did. \nThe fact is that not only did they grow larger in number, they grew in \ndollar volume, and they grew in a way that certainly did participate in \nthe collapse that occurred in 2008.\n  But the real problem with it is not that we had those products on the \nmarket but that the regulators did not have the power and authority and \nthe tools to deal with those products, rather than thinking about \neliminating a specific product, knowing these smart folks who are in \nthis business in the financial industry are out there right now looking \nat this bill, and trying to figure out other products they can design \nthat will be different from a credit default swap, but yet be as \ndangerous as what happened in 2008. We need to give the regulators the \npower and authority to look at these products and put 100 percent \ntransparency in place. That is what I want to see, and that is what my \nchairman, Senator Lincoln, wants to see, and I think everybody in here \nagrees we ought to have full transparency.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Surely.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me clarify that my position is to ban \nwhat are called naked or synthetic credit default swaps, not ban credit \ndefault swaps. Those with no insurable interest of any kind are \nconsidered naked credit default swaps. It appears to me that 70 to 80 \npercent of all credit default swaps are in that category; they have no \ninsurable interest. So I did not want the Senator to think I want to \nban credit default swaps. That is not the case. Naked credit default \nswaps, yes.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I understand that. My point is the same, though, that \nif we give the regulators the authority to regulate those products, \nthen I think we can deal with it better that way than targeting \nspecific products to be eliminated or banned.\n  Among the many complex issues this body deals with every day, there \nare few more complicated than the issue of derivatives. However, we \nshould not let the complexity of the swaps market be an excuse for \nignoring good public policy and ensuring that our markets are both safe \nas well as functional.\n  In the past couple of years, a lot of people have become acquainted \nwith one particular type of derivative known as, as we have just talked \nabout, a credit default swap or CDS, which permits one party to \ntransfer the credit risk or bonds or syndicated bank loans to another \nparty.\n  Since AIG was heavily involved in CDS, it seems simple enough to \nblame swaps generally for what went wrong in the system. However, that \nwould be an inaccurate oversimplification, because the real situation \nis much more complicated. We need to distinguish between credit default \nswaps and the actual underlying assets represented by those swaps, in \nthis case mortgage-backed securities or mortgages that were themselves \nthe root of the problem.\n  There are so many other types of swaps that U.S. businesses rely on \nevery day to mitigate just about any risk they face in the ordinary \ncourse of doing business. Before we make a big policy change that makes \nthese over-the-counter products less desirable to market participants \nor require that these products trade only on an exchange type facility, \nwe need to ask ourselves whether this will even address the underlying \nproblem.\n  Why take a chance in these uncertain times to make legislative and \nregulatory changes that could possibly make things worse, potentially \ndry up more capital or force the cost of business going higher? This \ndoes not mean there is not room for improvement. That is why I have \njoined with several of my colleagues today in developing an amendment \nto apply strong and reasonable regulation to the derivatives markets.\n  Let me be clear. We share the desire to apply stronger safeguards in \nthese markets to regulate swap market participants and to ensure that \nswap transactions are more closely monitored by the regulators. I am \nabsolutely convinced that the market volatility and financial meltdown \nof the recent past makes the case for more market transparency.\n  How can we in the Congress be sure of the outcome of sweeping reforms \nwithout first properly identifying the exact cause of these problems? \nHow can we identify the cause of the problem without authorizing and \nrequiring more transparency through the collection of necessary data?\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\n  For this reason, I have worked with several of my colleagues to \ndevelop an amendment that would require all swap transactions be made \nknown to the appropriate regulators so effective regulation can be \napplied where necessary.\n  Additionally, there will be public dissemination of prices and \nvolumes of completed swap transactions in order that investors and \nother market participants might be assisted in marking existing swap \npositions to market, making informed decisions before executing future \ntransactions, and assessing the quality of transactions they have \nexecuted.\n  Beyond requiring more transparency, I also believe we should provide \nthe CFTC and the SEC with the necessary authorities to more properly \nregulate those market participants who are potentially contributing to \nthe type of risk that jeopardizes our financial system: swap dealers, \nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac, large hedge funds, and AIG-type entities.\n  Many may not even realize that swaps are statutorily excluded from \nthe current regulatory oversight of both the CFTC and the SEC. That is \nright; current law does not provide for clear regulation of swap market \nparticipants. Our amendment would ensure that these market participants \nare fully regulated and that their swap positions are cleared through a \nfully regulated clearinghouse. This is a huge departure from current \nlaw.\n  Speaking of clearing, we need to determine how best to encourage the \nclearing of certain derivative products without jeopardizing either the \nuse of these risk management tools or the sustainability of our \nclearinghouses. For that reason, our amendment would enable true end-\nusers, those businesses that use swaps to hedge their risk, not for \nspeculative purpose, but true hedging, to avoid an expensive mandate to \nclear their swaps.\n  These businesses had absolutely nothing to do with the financial \ncrisis and should not be punished with increased costs and burdens. We \ncertainly do not want to discourage them from managing their risk, \nespecially not in the current economic environment.\n  Last Friday, the Department of Labor published their unemployment \nreport for the month of April. Again, unemployment rose from 9.7 \npercent to 9.9 percent. In my State, it is in excess of 10 percent. Why \nwould we subject U.S. companies to expensive mandates when we should be \nadvancing policies that lessen their financial burdens so they can \nemploy more people?\n  Why is Congress considering slapping an additional cost on them in \nthe form of a clearing mandate? This does not make sense, when these \nindividual companies are the true end-users of the products they are \ntrading in, and they were absolutely not the cause of the financial \nmeltdown. Those mandates should be targeted and in such a way to lessen \nthe risks of those large financial institution swap dealers who are \nresponsible for the bulk majority of all swap transactions and, \ntherefore, contributing to systemic risk.\n  But a clearing mandate is not appropriate for businesses using swaps \nto manage their risks and keep their costs down. This is very simple. \nIf their costs go up, they will either pass it along to consumers or \nstop managing their risk, and then they certainly cannot afford to hire \nmore workers.\n  Our amendment has a more targeted clearing mandate designed to reach \nthose who are actually responsible for this crisis we are in, Wall \nStreet and not Main Street businesses.\n  The Senate will soon have the chance to vote on this substitute \namendment on derivatives. I am looking forward to further debate on our \namendment because it will highlight a handful of significant \ndifferences between the derivatives language in the Dodd-Lincoln \namendment versus our amendment. I believe our approach on transparency, \non clearing, on end users, on capital requirements, and on trading \nmandates is much more appropriate, much more reasonable, much more \nbusiness friendly, and, frankly, much more secure. My amendment will \nensure that Main Street businesses will still be able to appropriately \nuse derivatives in hedging their daily business risks, while ensuring \nthat appropriate regulatory standards are put into place for the \ninstitutions and transactions that contribute to systemic financial \nrisk.\n  If Congress is truly interested in addressing the problem as opposed \nto politicizing a solution, we can no longer ignore the complexities of \nthese markets. We must seek to understand the legitimate purposes these \ncomplex instruments serve for large and small businesses in each of our \nStates. Unfortunately, the language currently before the Senate misses \nthe mark when it comes to the appropriate regulation of derivatives. \nThe underlying bill would have many unfortunate consequences--some \nintended, some unintended--resulting from applying complicated \nregulations too broadly and will subject our American businesses to \nmore risk, not less.\n  Three consequences of the underlying bill on derivatives are these: \nOne, the users will pay huge clearing fees and pass on those expenses \nto consumers; two, no longer will businesses use the derivatives \nmarket, and they will pass on the higher, unstable market costs to \nconsumers; and three, these businesses, instead of using U.S. markets, \nwill simply take their business offshore. As they do today, they will \ntrade in the dark, and no U.S. regulator will ever see what they are \ndoing. That is not right. That is not what any of us intend to see \nhappen.\n  The fact is, if we pass the derivatives provisions in the underlying \nbill, there is going to be a significant number of end users who take \ntheir business offshore. That truly is unacceptable. Our amendment \nmakes good business sense and good common sense.\n  We have received support for our amendment from a wide array of \nbusinesses. These are not banks that stand to make profits. These are \nindividual users. I have a letter from the National Association of \nManufacturers which states:\n\n       We have serious concerns that the current end-user \n     exemption in S. 3217 (and in the pending Dodd Substitute) is \n     not strong or clear enough. In addition, other provisions in \n     the derivatives title could effectively eliminate the \n     exemption for many companies and, in some cases, subject them \n     to capital and margin requirements or higher costs. \n     Conversely, the Chambliss/Shelby substitute includes a clear \n     and strong end-user exemption that appropriately exempts \n     businesses that use OTC derivatives to hedge their business \n     risk from the regulatory scheme applicable to swap dealers.\n\n  From the Coalition for Derivatives End-Users, we have the following: \nThat my amendment would ``strike the right balance between bringing \nfundamental and needed reforms to the over-the-counter (OTC) \nderivatives market while also ensuring significant and burdensome new \ncosts are not necessarily imposed on business end-users.''\n  Lastly, I have a letter signed by several energy supply groups which \nstates that they ``remain concerned about the potential impact of the \nproposed financial reform legislation on end-users.'' They go on to say \nthat:\n\n       Due to the broad definition of ``swap dealer,'' end users \n     may be ineligible for the end-user exemption if they engage \n     in hedging business risks in the ordinary course of business.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these respective letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2010.\n       Dear Senators: The National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM), the nation's largest industrial trade association \n     representing small and large manufacturers in every \n     industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges your support \n     for the Chambliss/Shelby Substitute Amendment (SA 3816) to S. \n     3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act.\n       While the NAM supports initiatives to prevent excessive \n     speculation and improve transparency and stability in the \n     derivatives market, it is critical that policymakers preserve \n     the ability of responsible companies to access over-the-\n     counter (OTC) derivative products. Manufacturers of all sizes \n     use customized OTC derivatives to manage the cost of \n     borrowing or other risks of operating their businesses, \n     including fluctuating currency exchange, interest rates and \n     commodity prices. In today's challenging economy, these risk \n     management tools help businesses keep operations going, \n     invest in new technologies, build new plants and retain and \n     expand workforces.\n       NAM members believe strongly that any derivatives reform \n     effort should ensure business end-users' continued access to \n     OTC derivatives, providing them with greater financial \n     certainty and allowing them to allocate resources to core \n     business activities. In addition, we have called for clear \n     exemptions\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\n     from central clearing, bilateral margining and exchange-\n     trading requirements for business end-users to avoid drawing \n     large amounts of capital from business operations, including \n     job creation.\n       We have serious concerns, however, that the current end-\n     user exemption in S. 3217 (and in the pending Dodd \n     Substitute) is not strong or clear enough. In addition, other \n     provisions in the derivatives title could effectively \n     eliminate the exemption for many companies and, in some \n     cases, subject them to capital and margin requirements or \n     higher costs.\n       Conversely, the Chambliss/Shelby Substitute includes:\n       Clear exemptions from central clearing, bilateral margining \n     and exchange-trading requirements;\n       A clear and strong end-user exemption that appropriately \n     exempts businesses that use OTC derivatives to hedge business \n     risk from the regulatory scheme applicable to swap dealers;\n       Clarification that any increases to capital charges on swap \n     dealers are based on actual risk of loss and designed to \n     promote the safety and soundness of the financial system \n     rather than to penalize the use of OTC derivatives; and\n       Prospective application recognizing that market \n     participants negotiated current derivatives contracts with an \n     understanding as to their potential obligations based on the \n     laws and market practices in place at that time.\n       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that \n     all votes related to the Chambliss/Shelby Substitute \n     Amendment (SA 3816), including procedural motions, may be \n     considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the \n     111th Congress. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jay Timmons,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Coalition for\n\n\n                                        Derivatives End-Users,\n\n                                                     May 11, 2010.\n       To the Members of the United states Senate: The Coalition \n     for Derivatives End-Users strongly supports an amendment that \n     has been filed by Sen. Chambliss, SA 3816 to S. 3217, the \n     ``Restoring Financial Stability Act,'' because it would bring \n     important and needed reforms to the derivatives markets. If \n     this amendment is brought to a vote, the Coalition urges you \n     to support it.\n       The Chambliss amendment would strike the right balance \n     between bringing fundamental and needed reforms to the over-\n     the-counter (``OTC'') derivatives market, while also ensuring \n     significant and burdensome new costs are not unnecessarily \n     imposed on business end-users. Consistent with the \n     Coalition's position, the amendment:\n       Provides explicit exemptions from central clearing, \n     bilateral margining, and exchange trading requirements for \n     business end-users that do not pose a threat to financial \n     stability and that primarily use OTC derivatives to hedge \n     business risk;\n       Ensures increases in capital charges continue to be based \n     on risk of loss and aimed at promoting safety and soundness \n     of the financial system, and not used to penalize OTC \n     derivatives;\n       Provides legislative certainty that any new requirements \n     are applied prospectively, recognizing that market \n     participants negotiated existing trades based on the laws and \n     market practices in effect at the time of these transactions.\n       Throughout the legislative process, the Coalition has \n     advocated for a strong derivatives bill that brings full \n     transparency to OTC derivatives market, imposes new \n     regulatory standards on swap dealers and market participants \n     whose activities in the OTC market could impact the stability \n     of the financial system, and provides a strong clear \n     exemption from mandatory clearing and bilateral margining for \n     business end-users.\n       The Coalition remains concerned that Title VII of S. 3217 \n     does not provide a strong clear exemption for end-users. If \n     implemented, we believe many end-users of derivatives would \n     be forced to divert precious working capital away from \n     productive use to margin accounts, move their hedging \n     practices overseas, or forego hedging altogether--leaving \n     them exposed to the volatility and price uncertainty that OTC \n     derivatives have so effectively mitigated. A survey and \n     analysis conducted by the Business Roundtable and Keybridge \n     Research found that a requirement to impose initial margin on \n     OTC derivatives could lead to a loss of 100,000 to 120,000 \n     jobs within the S 500 companies alone. The additional \n     impact of variation margin could significantly increase this \n     negative impact on jobs.\n       The Coalition urges you to support the Chambliss amendment. \n     We stand ready to support any further amendments that will \n     ensure a viable OTC market for companies across the country, \n     and look forward to working with Members of the Senate to \n     that end.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Petroleum Institute; Business Roundtable; \n           Financial Executives International; National \n           Association of Corporate Treasurers; National \n           Association of Manufacturers; National Association of \n           Real Estate Investment Trusts; The Real Estate \n           Roundtable; U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 29, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Chairman Lincoln: Commercial end-\n     users support transparency and efforts to control systemic \n     risk in U.S. financial markets. As you know, commercial end-\n     users use over-the-counter derivatives as a risk-management \n     tool to hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices, \n     interest rates, and currency exchange rates. This process \n     creates market stability, and keeps costs down for businesses \n     and for the consumers who use their products.\n       To that end, we would like to express our appreciation for \n     your inclusion of a commercial end-user exemption in your \n     compromise language. This exemption is critical to ensuring \n     that end-users are not faced with the costly requirements of \n     mandatory clearing and bilateral margining.\n       However, we remain concerned about the potential impact of \n     proposed financial reform legislation on end-users. Due to \n     the broad definition of ``swap dealer,'' end-users may be \n     ineligible for the end-user exemption if they engage in \n     hedging business risks in the ordinary course of business.\n       To clarify and strengthen the exemption, we recommend the \n     legislation define ``Swap Dealer'' as ``any person who--(i) \n     holds itself out as a dealer in swaps; (ii) makes a market in \n     swaps; (iii) regularly engages in the purchase and sale of \n     swaps in the ordinary course of business; and (iv) engages in \n     any activity causing the person to be commonly known in the \n     trade as a dealer or market maker in swaps'' instead of as \n     any person meeting any one of those criteria.\n       We would also ask that you include the following de minimis \n     exception, which ensures that end-users whose swap \n     transactions are nominal will be exempt from the designation \n     of ``swap dealer.'' ``De Minimis Exception.--The Commission \n     shall exempt from designation as a swap dealer an entity that \n     engages in a de minimis quantity of swap dealing in \n     connection with transactions with or on behalf of its \n     customers.''\n       Our concerns can also be addressed by clarifying that \n     commercial end-users are not swap dealers. This can be \n     achieved in the following way: ``In General.--The term `swap \n     dealer' means any person (other than a commercial end-user) \n     who--''\n       Again, thank you for the inclusion of an end-user \n     exemption. We would ask that you carefully consider our \n     suggestions. Clarification of the definition of ``swap \n     dealer'' is critical to ensuring that end-users have access \n     to the capital needed to remain competitive in the global \n     marketplace and expand job growth in the U.S.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Petroleum Institute; National Association of \n           Manufacturers; Natural Gas Supply Association; US Oil & \n           Gas Association.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I have had numerous discussions with \nboth the chairman of the Banking Committee as well as the ranking \nmember and the chairman of the Ag Committee about this issue for weeks \nand months. I know we have the same goal in common: to ensure there is \ntransparency in the marketplace and that we have regulators who will do \nthe job we ask them to do. Frankly, I am not sure that was the case 5 \nyears ago or even 2 years ago. But if we give these regulators the \ntools and if we give them the opportunity to look at every transaction, \nirrespective of whether it is going through a clearinghouse or whether \nit is over the counter, and they have the opportunity to review every \nlarge institution or every small institution that engages in these \ntransactions and they also have the opportunity to look at the other \nside and see which companies are using these products or which entities \nare using them and they can then deal with those entities that become \nsystemically risky--they didn't have that power and authority before, \nand we are going to give them that power and authority now--I have all \nthe trust and confidence that they will use it in the right way and \nthat with those tools and with that transparency and with the bringing \nof these trades out of the shadows and into the sunlight, we will be \nable to control the financial markets in a way that allows our end \nusers, those who did not cause any of the problem and are not part of \nthe problem, from being thrown into the same basket with those folks \nwho did become systemically risky and caused the financial meltdown \nthat occurred.\n  My amendment does that. It does it in the right way. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise with great respect for my \ncolleague from Georgia, my ranking member on the Ag Committee, and all \nhis attempts and ideas on how to make our\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\neconomy stronger and better. I do rise to speak in opposition to the \nChambliss amendment. Again, with the greatest respect for my colleague, \nthe ranking member, he and I and our respective staffs spent several \nmonths developing draft legislation in the Agriculture Committee. I am \nunbelievably grateful to him and his staff as well as my staff. We have \nmade progress. In the end, we accomplished 80 to 90 percent of what is \nnow the Dodd-Lincoln substitute. But as with all policy decisions, some \ntough choices needed to be made. Senator Chambliss and I simply could \nnot resolve our final differences. We ran out of time, basically, in \nthe committee.\n  Let me be clear. As chairman of the committee, I made the decision to \nmove forward with a strong reform bill, a bill that was voted out of my \ncommittee on a bipartisan vote. I know to my colleagues the Agriculture \nCommittee derivatives title is the only legislation to gain bipartisan \nsupport in this debate. We want to strive to continue in that vein and \nto work in a bipartisan way to get to a good resolution of something \nthat is going to be beneficial to this Nation, to our economy, and that \nis going to gain the respect of Americans who have suffered from this \nfinancial crisis.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment being considered today by Senator \nChambliss and some of my Republican colleagues does not contain the \nessential reforms required to ensure the stability of our markets. It \ncreates loopholes and fails to bring the transparency and \naccountability Americans are demanding of us at this juncture. This \namendment would be detrimental to our economy and to our markets.\n  The derivatives title of the Dodd-Lincoln bill is strong reform. Our \nbill provides necessary transparency and accountability to our \nshattered financial markets and regulatory system. Today this \nderivatives market is completely in the dark with no--I repeat, no--\nregulation, no oversight, and no public disclosure. The Dodd-Lincoln \nbill will bring a completely unregulated market into the light of day \nfor the first time ever. But it is important to point out, it is not \nregulation for regulation's sake. The steps we have taken in this bill \nhave meaningful issues in terms of what they are dealing with. It \nmaintains a narrow end-user exemption, appropriate restraints on the \nregulators, where necessary, and provisions that recognize we are \ncompeting in a global financial marketplace.\n  Many have commented about what might happen in these markets, in \nmoving markets overseas. I will address that in a moment. But I believe \nall Americans are certainly demanding good, sound marketplaces. I think \npeople globally are clamoring for those same types of sound \nmarketplaces.\n  The facts speak for themselves. The Chambliss amendment does not meet \nthe test of what our markets require. It is a stark reminder that if we \ndo not act boldly in the face of the near collapse of our economy, \ntragic Wall Street abuses and abysmal regulatory failures, we will all \nsuffer the consequences.\n  I have a number of concerns with the Chambliss amendment. Clearing \nand exchange trading is at the heart of reform, mitigating risk, \nreducing leverage, and forcing accountability on the derivatives \nmarketplace. This amendment would remove the underlying bill's \nmandatory exchange trading requirement and remove the mandatory \nclearing provisions. This is not acceptable. We understand and know \nfrom our experience with the futures market what the clearing does and \nthe stability it brings to the marketplace. It is absolutely essential.\n  This amendment removes real-time price transparency to the public. \nThe Dodd-Lincoln bill provides real-time price transparency to the \npublic and to the regulators. Without robust transparency, the markets \nwould not function, and the regulators can't do their jobs. That real-\ntime, 100 percent transparency is what moves these activities into \nthose exchanges, into the clearing that is so necessary to ensure we \nbring that stability to the marketplace.\n  Information is power. This amendment will keep this power in the \nhands of those on Wall Street instead of giving it to Main Street. We \nhave watched as these selected few on Wall Street have maintained their \ngrip on these dark markets and on this information. What have they done \nwith it? They have benefited themselves. It has not produced the kind \nof benefit across this great country that people in communities in \nplaces such as Arkansas and other States could see the benefit of that \ninformation because we had no access to it. Shedding sunlight on that, \nthat sunlight, which is the disinfectant we need on Wall Street, is \ngoing to be critically important to making sure we are a success, and \nensuring that transparency is here is part of what we have done in the \nDodd-Lincoln bill.\n  If we do not capture the AIGs of the world, we cannot claim to have \nreal reform. This amendment would miss many of the largest and riskiest \nplayers by narrowly defining both swap dealer and major swap \nparticipant and exempting too many market participants. More so, this \namendment requires less of the largest, riskiest market participants. \nThey will have fewer business conduct standards, fewer recordkeeping \nrequirements, and fewer regulatory core principles to follow. This \namendment also weakens the capital standards in the underlying bill. \nCustomized, bilateral, over-the-counter transactions are less safe than \nthose that are cleared and exchange trading. There is no way to get \naround that. We should expect more capital to back up those riskier \ntransactions, not allowing the obligation to rest on the taxpayers or \non the depositors in these banking institutions.\n  This substitute misses that opportunity in terms of making sure those \nriskier tools and those riskier transactions are required to have \ngreater capital backing them as well as greater regulation, which is \nappropriate for their expanded risky nature.\n  To the comments of those who have said this is going to be pushed \ninto other markets, into other countries, the American people are \ndemanding stability. Consumers are demanding stability in our \nmarketplaces. Why should we think that other countries are any \ndifferent, particularly as we have seen what has happened in these \nother countries?\n\n  We can seize this as an opportunity to be a leader globally--\nglobally--in this world to create sounder markets, stronger markets, \nnot just for us but for the global economy, which we are such an \nenormous part of now and will continue to be in the 21st century.\n  I would prefer to see us seizing that opportunity to be a leader in \nthose global economic markets, and I think we should with a good, \nstrong, stable bill that will be recognized by both markets as well as \nconsumers.\n  This amendment also delays the implementation of regulatory reform \nfor at least a year. The American people are demanding real reforms, \nand why we would want to delay implementation is beyond me. The time is \nnow. People are wondering why it has taken us this long already to take \nthese actions, and I think it is clear we must get started.\n  This amendment removes an important provision that would require swap \ndealers to put the financial interests of State and local governments, \nretirement plans, pensions, university endowments, and retirees before \ntheir own. The stories of abuse in this area are alarming and need to \nbe addressed.\n  Jefferson County, AL, is one of the starkest examples we have. \nJefferson County was taken advantage of by Wall Street and is now on \nthe edge of bankruptcy, in part because of a $3 billion derivatives \ndeal on bonds that went wrong. Without any responsibility to those \nentities, we will continue to see these types of circumstances \nperpetuated, and we have to stop that.\n  This amendment creates loopholes and broadly defines hedging. We \ncannot have a situation where the exemptions swallow the rule. Under \nthis amendment, few will end up being regulated, and we will be back to \nbusiness as usual, and I think we cannot allow that to happen.\n  The Dodd-Lincoln bill gives regulators explicit authority to \nprosecute swaps dealers who are aiding and abetting those who commit \nfraud using swaps. The Chambliss amendment would remove that authority. \nThe Chambliss amendment also fails to require registered entities such \nas swap repositories or swap execution facilities to have chief \ncompliance officers, allowing these entities to avoid regulatory \ncompliance and further, again, endangering Main Street investors.\n  This amendment completely removes an important whistleblower program\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\nfor commodities markets. The amendment also removes the underlying \nbill's additional stronger antimanipulation authorities. The amendment \nalso removes important authority for the regulators to close loopholes \nand strips key anti-evasion language that would allow the regulators to \ngo after anyone who tries to evade the law.\n  This amendment arbitrarily moves jurisdictional lines and removes \nmore than 30 years of good-faith agreements between regulators, \nignoring the expertise of individual agencies and jeopardizing the \nability of regulators to act quickly. This is a dangerous path to go \ndown for the ranking member of the Ag Committee, and I hope we will be \nable to stop this amendment and continue to work in a way that will \nbring about the kind of solid regulation, transparency, and oversight \nthat needs to be in this bill.\n  Finally, the Dodd-Lincoln bill includes important conflict of \ninterest provisions that would allow the regulators to ensure that no \nmarket participant unduly influences or monopolizes the market. What \ndoes the Chambliss amendment do with this provision? It would eliminate \nit--in effect, handing more power over to Wall Street.\n  These changes are simply an effort to weaken the bill and riddle it \nwith loopholes. I understand many of my colleagues are being pressured \nto take this path. But we must forge ahead and enact meaningful--\nmeaningful--reform. The American people deserve no less. They have seen \nwhat this financial crisis has done to them--in middle America, where \nthey have seen their savings for their children's college funds, their \nretirement funds, other things put at risk because of risky businesses \nand risky deals that have happened in a small group of Wall Street \nbanks that have chosen basically to take those risks, with \nunfortunately, the liability falling on the depositors as well as the \ntaxpayers.\n  The same claims and worn-out, catch-all defenses of ``unintended \nconsequences'' or ``driving business overseas'' have been used for \ndecades as reasons to weaken financial reform efforts, and critics are \nusing the very same arguments again today. We are here to tackle \ncomplicated problems and find real solutions--meaningful solutions--\nthat will again bring the kind of confidence to the marketplace and \nconsumers we need to be able to strengthen our Nation and our \nmarketplaces and our economy to create the jobs all Americans want to \nsee, and to set the example globally of what good, strong regulations \nand solid markets can do in terms of growing the global economy.\n  We certainly should not squander the opportunity for historic reform, \nnor support any efforts to weaken it. Therefore, I intend to vote \n``no'' on this amendment, and I respectfully encourage my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Mr. President, I know I have other colleagues on our side who want to \nspeak on this amendment, and I know there are others on the Republican \nside. I would encourage all of our colleagues to come to the floor to \ntake the opportunity to speak on this amendment. I know Chairman Dodd \nis anxious to move the bill, as well as others, and we have a great \nopportunity here to visit about and debate this portion of the bill, \nand I encourage my colleagues to do that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, once again, we are debating a comprehensive \nbill. This one, of course, is only 1,407 pages, as opposed to 2,700 \npages that did health care. But this probably does not affect \neverybody--just almost everybody. This could have been three separate \nbills, and we could have put a lot more effort into getting it right if \nit were three bills instead of one. This is one that takes care of the \nproblem with big banks. There is another one that provides consumer \nprotection that people are going to be stunned at, to find out every \nsingle transaction, practically, they can make can be controlled by a \nnew board that has no oversight, gets to write their own rules, and has \nvirtually an unlimited budget.\n  But the piece we are talking about right now has been labeled \n``derivatives.'' I keep thinking maybe it has been labeled \n``derivatives'' so the American public would not know what we are \ntalking about. It is important they know what we are talking about.\n  I rise in strong support of Senator Chambliss's effort to improve \nthis ``derivatives'' section in the bill. But I am disappointed Senator \nChambliss is even required to offer his amendment. Senators Lincoln and \nChambliss were well on their way to moving toward a bipartisan package \nof reforms for the derivatives market.\n  This is the market used to hedge against risk, and if we make a \nmistake in dealing with it, businesses will suffer, students will \nsuffer, farmers and ranchers will suffer. Many businesses want to lock \nin a price, so they hedge their risk. They make a long-term commitment \nto purchase something at a particular price, so they have certainty and \navoid the risk that the price will change.\n  For example, many airlines use this market to lock in long-term fuel \nprices they can rely on. That is a derivative. That contract can be \nbought and sold as the market changes--again, to take an acceptable \nrisk. Sometimes I think we call it a derivative, as I mentioned before, \nso the American people will be confused and will not pay attention.\n  Senators Lincoln and Chambliss were on the verge of putting together \na key piece of financial reform in a bipartisan fashion. Unfortunately, \nbuoyed by the passage of the extraordinarily partisan health care \nreform bill, the White House intervened in negotiations. They urged an \nend to bipartisan negotiations. They pushed the bill further to the \nleft, and we are now faced with a product that will make it harder for \nAmerican companies to obtain capital or to assure future purchase \nprices for essential products. This will drive some American jobs \noverseas, and perhaps entire businesses as well.\n  It is disappointing that this is becoming commonplace in the Senate. \nDuring the health care reform debate, I worked with five other members \nof the Finance Committee on a comprehensive health care package. We \nwere making progress on a bipartisan bill when the majority, with the \nguidance of the White House, decided to go it alone, decided that was \nbetter politically.\n  Now we are having a debate about the future of the financial \nindustry. We are working to protect our economy from future collapse \nand, unfortunately, we are having this discussion in a mostly partisan \nmanner because the White House is interested in scoring some more \npolitical points. It is an election year, and these are election-year \npolitics at their worst, and I am disappointed it is becoming the norm.\n\n  The White House believes they can win political points on this issue \nbecause the word ``derivatives'' is something of a boogieman. People \nhear that word and they assume it is a group of Wall Street bankers \nplotting how to increase their end-of-the-year bonuses, as they seek to \nruin the rest of the economy. My constituents are told by fear mongers \non the left that derivatives are risky transactions, and they are \nmisled into believing there is nothing about derivatives that is useful \nto ordinary businesses.\n  The facts do not support those claims. Derivatives are, by their very \nnature, measures to help limit risk. It is hedging the bet. The vast \nmajority of Fortune 500 companies and many smaller companies are \ninvolved in the derivatives market. Employee pension funds are involved \nin the derivatives market. The agriculture derivatives market is one of \nthe oldest and most established financial markets in the United States \nbecause agriculture can be an inherently risky business unless you lock \nin a favorable price. Producers are at the mercy of the weather, \ntransportation networks, varying input costs, and the global supply of \nagricultural commodities. These unique market conditions mean that \nwithout risk management, markets fluctuate wildly.\n  I think it could be helpful to those listening to the debate to try \nto make clear how these transactions actually work. Oftentimes, in \nbusiness, the greatest potential for profit involves the greatest risk. \nIt only makes sense I would have greater potential to make money if I \ninvest in a startup company than if I invest in a Treasury bond or an \nold established company. It is also more likely I will lose money with \nmy\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\ninvestment if I invest in that startup company. I may want to limit the \nchance I will lose all my money. I may want to figure out a way to \nlessen my risk. Another company may believe my investment was good, so \nI will essentially sell them some of my investment in the startup \ncompany--along with my chance for maximum profit--in order to have \nmoney to invest in a more stable Treasury bond and less profit--hedging \nmy bet. The entity that facilitates that sale is a swaps or derivatives \ndealer, and they play an important role by helping find willing buyers \nand sellers to help companies limit exposure--to hedge the risk.\n  The goal of this legislation should be regulating the market in a way \nthat ensures companies, individuals, and other entities can have access \nto as much money for investment to create jobs as possible, at the same \ntime that we create a situation where we will never again be forced to \nbail out the biggest banks, and where we never allow another AIG to \noccur.\n  I am not convinced the bill as written addresses the concerns, \nalthough I feel confident the bill will lead to less access to money \nfor businesses at a time when our economy is struggling.\n  In my home State, I am hearing from the energy industry and from \nagricultural groups that the bill has the potential to treat companies \nthat are trying to limit risk as major banks. Although the bill does \nprovide an end-user exemption, it is unclear if companies can avoid \nbeing misclassified as a swap dealer or major swap participant, and if \nthey are misclassified, they lose their end-user exemption.\n  The Chambliss amendment clarifies the end-user exemption to ensure \nthat bona fide hedging transactions, including those used by a wheat \ngrower in Wyoming or a power company in the Midwest, remain regulated \nin a reasonable fashion.\n  One of the difficulties with the way we are doing things here with \nmost of the work being done on the floor is that you cannot pick the \nglimmer of an idea out of one and the glimmer of an idea out of another \nand put it together and have a good amendment. Plus, there is all this \npressure that the party line should be protected. That is not what this \namendment involves. This is trying to make a bona fide change to it. It \nhas to be done in a more global way than we would like, but we are \nlimited on the number of amendments we get to do. There is already talk \nabout how we need to close this debate. I know of dozens of amendments \nout there that people believe are good changes to this bill to make it \na working bill that we probably will not get to debate.\n\n  In a meeting yesterday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, \nthe Chairman emphasized that what has become known as section 106 \nprovisions remain problematic. In the current version of the \nlegislation, the provisions have been moved to section 716 and require \nthat swap business be conducted and affiliated separate from the FDIC-\ninsured banks.\n  Chairman Bernanke didn't think this section was nearly ready to go, \nand I suspect the FDIC folks don't either. Although the idea appears to \nmake sense on its outset, the provision will further reduce access to \ninvestment money to create jobs as banks are required to hold \nadditional money in their related businesses to limit credit exposure. \nInstead of using the capital at the bank to limit credit exposure, they \nare forced to have a second pot of money that they will be unable to \nlend. The provision will result in less investment money entering the \nmarket. It will lead to further consolidation of the market because \nfewer institutions will be able to meet the credit risk requirements, \nand it will increase costs to end users.\n  Putting on my hat as the ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, the Chambliss amendment also helps \nresolve a concern that pension and retirement plans have with the \nLincoln-Dodd substitute. Many people do not realize that pension plans \ndislike big fluctuations in the market. Private pension plans invest \nfor the long term and would prefer to have steady, long-term growth \nrather than investing in a volatile market which could cause a \ncompany's pension obligation payments to skyrocket when the market \nfalls. Pension plans enter into swap agreements and derivative \ncontracts to hedge price fluctuations and to keep risk at a minimum. \nFor example, pension plans use these contracts to make sure they don't \nhave too high of an interest rate that may be unsustainable or too low \nof an interest rate that will give too low a rate of return that would \nnot provide enough money to pay pensions as they come due. Even the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, uses swaps and derivative \ncontracts to dampen the value swings of the pension trust funds.\n  Recently, 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, IRAs, have \nbeen using ``stable value funds'' as an alternative to money market \nfunds to offer a very stable and steady increase of earnings. These \nstable value funds are stable because of the use of swap contracts, \nagain, because they make sure the underlying investments don't go too \nhigh and don't go too low.\n  Originally, Senator Dodd's language in the Banking Committee-reported \nbill may have caused pension and retirement plans to register as \n``major swap providers.'' This, of course, would not work because the \nregulation and registration requirements may have run afoul of pension \nrequirements for solvency. Senator Lincoln tried to remedy this, but \nher solution was to place the swap dealers on the spot by requiring \nspecial paperwork for just touching a swap contract for a pension plan.\n  I believe the Chambliss amendment strikes the right balance. Pension \nplans are not trying to create a market in swaps, nor are they trying \nto use swaps to game the markets. Pension plans that use swaps assure \npension funds will be there when needed for the people retiring, and \nthe approach taken by the Chambliss amendment allows that to happen.\n  The Chambliss amendment is a far superior effort to the bill we have \non the Senate floor. At one time I was confident that we would be \nseeing a bipartisan, workable Lincoln-Chambliss provision. It is \nunfortunate the White House got involved, pushed this bill to the left, \nand is now pushing us to pass some sort of financial reform \nlegislation--any sort at this stage--at the expense of passing a \nstrong, workable bill. Congress needs to stop with this ``shoot first, \nask questions later'' approach, or as we call it in Wyoming, the \n``ready, fire, and then aim'' approach that might never hit the target.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate can support the Chambliss \namendment or at least get together and cover some of the things we have \ntalked about that are a major problem with the bill. This is one-third \nof what we are talking about, and it is going to have the potential to \nruin a lot of things for individuals, working Americans. We don't want \nthat to happen.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Chambliss amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by expressing my gratitude to \nSenator Lincoln of Arkansas and Senator Chambliss of Georgia and \nmembers of their committee for their tremendous work. In fact, there is \nsome overlap in membership. I think a couple members of the Banking \nCommittee are also members of the Agriculture Committee.\n  I know how hard they have worked on what is such a critically \nimportant piece of this legislation. It is probably an area with which \na lot of people are not terribly familiar. A lot of the language we use \nin describing this area of the bill sounds pretty foreign to a lot of \npeople, but it is terribly important we get this right, for reasons I \nwill try to briefly explain this afternoon.\n  For many Americans who aren't necessarily experts on our financial \nsystem, this is one of the most confusing parts of our work, but it is \nalso incredibly important in terms of our overall reform of the \nfinancial system. I am sure this has already been described by the \nSenator from Arkansas and the Senator from Georgia, so this may be \nsomewhat repetitive.\n  People ask me: What is a derivative? It is a fancy word, \n``derivative.'' Really, what it amounts to, in simple terms that most \nAmericans can understand is, it is a bet. It is a wager, in a sense--an \nimportant wager but nonetheless a wager. It is a wager placed on the \nfuture value of something, either as a future protection against change \nin the\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\nvalue of that instrument or a way to make some money off of it. It is a \nlegitimate operation, provided it is done properly. There is nothing \nwrong with them. In fact, they play a very important role. If used \nresponsibly as a way to hedge a commercial risk, they are tremendously \nimportant.\n  Many of us have heard about, for instance, the candymakers. We hear \nthis example all the time. Candymakers are able to keep their costs \nstable as a production company through the use of derivatives. If you \nare an end user, as they are called, and your costs depend upon future \nprices of a commodity such as sugar or other additives, that is a way \nto stabilize those costs and provide some certainty to that particular \ncompany; or it can be the future direction of interest rates which can \nhave a huge impact on the cost of a product and the success and well-\nbeing of a company as well.\n  Derivatives can serve as a form of insurance against an unexpected \nspike in either the price of a product or interest rates. But the \nproblem is this: As companies have come up with new and innovative ways \nto use derivatives--and they have--much of this activity has taken \nplace in the shadow economy where there is little sunlight at all to \nexpose what these instruments are and how they affect the overall \neconomy of our country. They operate outside the supervision of any \nregulator, and that is where the problems arise. Not in derivatives \nthemselves, but how they are perceived, how they are seen.\n  That is how one night in September of 2008, I found myself, along \nwith several other Members of this body, in a room not far from where \nthis Chamber exists listening to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBank, Mr. Benjamin Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson as \nthey explained what had happened to AIG, the largest insurance company \nin the world, and what would need to happen to fix the problems posed \nby the activities in which the company was involved.\n  Just as some international corporations create shell companies in the \nCayman Islands to avoid tax responsibilities, AIG created a subsidiary \ncalled AIG Financial Products to sell complex and risky products. It \nwas thus able to take advantage of the fact that there was no \nregulatory requirement that AIG hold enough capital to cover its \nexposure to these products.\n  Meanwhile, because AIG was rated AAA by the rating agencies as a \ncompany, their counterparties didn't demand much in the way of \ncollateral or margin. Essentially, AIG guaranteed other people's bets; \nthat is, these counterparties--Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale, a \nFrench bank--without having the money to pay them if those bets failed. \nAIG was able to do so without anyone knowing how many of these \nguarantees they had actually sold. As we now know, they sold trillions \nof dollars' worth. When it turned out that AIG couldn't pay up, our \ngovernment--or more sadly, the American taxpayer--was left holding the \nbag. We were faced as a country with the unprecedented and unpleasant \ntaxpayer bailout to prevent this shocking failure from bringing down \nour whole economy, or melting down as we were warned.\n  To make the problem worse, we now know AIG wasn't alone. Unregulated \nderivatives also helped to mask the credit-worthiness of nonfinancial \nusers such as the Government of Greece. We all know about that and what \nhas happened over the last few days and the problems created in Europe \nas a result of that problem, to their own ultimate or eventual \ndetriment, as we now know. Hedge funds such as Long-Term Capital \nManagement, energy companies such as Enron, industrial concerns such as \nProctor and Gamble, and a wide array of governments at home and abroad \nhave all fallen prey to the problems in the derivatives market.\n\n  I think the solution is becoming obvious--at least we hope it is--to \nput an end to risky, uncovered bets that leave taxpayers and our \nfinancial system as vulnerable as it has been. That is why capital and \nmargin requirements, imposed either by regulators or by central \nclearinghouses, are so critically important in this area of our \neconomy.\n  Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve described margin \nrequirements as ``an appropriate cost of protecting against \ncounterparty risk.''\n  The sad truth is this solution has been obvious for some time. You \ndon't need to have just the events of the last couple of years to \nunderstand this problem. You can go back 16 years ago. At that time, in \n1994, the General Accounting Office produced a report entitled \n``Financial Derivatives: Actions Needed to Protect the Financial \nSystem.''\n  At the time of their report, the General Accounting Office determined \nthat the size of the derivatives market was $12.1 trillion--not an \ninsignificant amount in 1994. The report described risks arising from \nthe interconnected relationships between dealers of derivatives and end \nusers, not to mention the rapid growth and increasing complexity of \nderivative activities because the relationships between the major \nderivatives dealers and end users, and the exchange-traded markets were \nso close, the failure of any one part of this system could prove \ndevastating to our entire financial system. This, we knew in 1994, 16 \nyears ago. That was their report.\n  By 2008, 16 years later, the derivatives market had grown from $12.1 \ntrillion that I mentioned a few minutes ago to an astonishing $600 \ntrillion in 16 years. In a related story, it had gone almost entirely \nunderground.\n  Each time the Congress had a chance to act, it chose a legislative \npath that created even more loopholes, more opportunities for these \nrisks to migrate to unregulated pockets of our economy. In 2000, the \nCongress passed the Commodities Futures Modernization Act which, to a \nlarge extent, explicitly exempted over-the-counter derivatives from \nregulation by the CFTC and the SEC.\n  So whereas in 1998, 41 percent of derivatives were traded in the \nshadows, by 2008, 10 years later, that proportion grew to 60 percent--\nalmost a 20-percent increase in 10 years.\n  Essentially, over time, our financial system came up with more and \nmore ways to take bigger and bigger risks with fewer and fewer \nsafeguards and less and less supervision. That, of course, as we now \npainfully have learned, was a recipe for disaster, and disaster is what \nwe got. That is why Chairman Lincoln, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland, Senator Judd Gregg, Senator Saxby Chambliss, and others of our \ncolleagues have worked so hard over these last number of months to \nbring the derivatives market out of the shadows and into the sunlight \nwhere they belong. That is why the derivatives language in this bill is \nso critically important if we are going to live up to our descriptions \nof this bill as a major reform of the financial markets in our country.\n  For the first time in our Nation, over-the-counter derivatives would \nbe regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission. It includes the Banking \nCommittee's tough requirements for central clearing, exchange trading, \ncapital margin, and reporting that are critical to reducing systemic \nrisk and ensuring that taxpayers would not have to clean up the mess \nresulting from another AIG implosion.\n  I know the financial sector lobbyists don't like these rules. In \nfact, over 1,000 corporate lobbyists have flooded this town--this body, \nin fact--in an attempt to water down these proposals.\n  But Joe Dear, the chief investment officer of the California Public \nEmployees Retirement System, explained it well when he said:\n\n       Every firm has reasons why its contracts are \n     ``exceptional'' and should trade privately; in reality, most \n     derivatives contracts are standardized--or standardizable--\n     and could trade rather on exchanges.\n\n  Thanks to the work of Senator Lincoln and the Agriculture Committee, \ncommercial end users have been carefully exempted from these new rules, \nso companies such as those candymakers I talked about can keep hedging \ntheir commercial risks. In fact, the market in which these companies \noperate will become safer and less expensive because of the new rules \nfor big players: the swap dealers and major participants.\n  Those big players--the VIPs in the derivatives casino--will have to \nregister with the SEC and CFTC and meet strict requirements for \nbusiness capital, business conduct, and reporting.\n  Every single transaction will be reported through a clearinghouse or \ntrade repository or directly to a regulator.\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\n  The SEC and CFTC will have enhanced authority to police these markets \nfor fraud, manipulation, and abuse. Those don't sound like radical \nideas. Those are commonsense proposals that I think most Americans can \nunderstand, even if they don't appreciate the complexities of these \ninstruments.\n  The combination of these regulatory tools will provide market \nparticipants and investors with a lot more confidence during times of \ncrisis, taxpayers with protection against the need to pay for mistakes \nmade by companies, derivatives users with more price transparency and \nliquidity, and regulators, of course, with more information about the \nrisks in the system.\n  Instead of an underground gambling club, derivatives will be traded \nin a well-regulated, transparent market, with rules that must be \nfollowed and safety provisions that must be respected.\n  Everyone is a winner. Derivatives are valuable and important, and we \nneed to have them out there to help our economy grow. Why should some \nof these ideas be so frightening to people? It seems to me that if we \ndo exactly what we are talking about here, everybody is a winner in the \nchain, particularly the derivatives users who will have much more \nclarity, and regulators and taxpayers are protected against abuses that \nwill occur if we don't try to provide what is being proposed with this \nlegislation. I welcome these improvements. Again, this is a debate back \nand forth.\n  Despite a lot of hard work between Members of this body to come to \nsome common answers, there are differences that emerge in this debate. \nThe substitute being offered by my friend from Georgia has no \nrequirement for transparent trading and weakens, in my view, those \nsafeguards for major market players.\n  It loosens capital requirements on the large Wall Street firms. That \nis a huge mistake, in my view, after what we have gone through that \nwould practically beg for another AIG-type crisis.\n  The substitute limits the central clearing requirement to only those \ntrades that take place between the very largest firms, providing a \nblanket carve-out to other financial firms, and letting much of the \nmarket continue to operate without the accountability, transparency, \nand regulation that I think is so critically important.\n  Unfortunately, there is sort of the status quo. There is some \nimprovement. I acknowledge that. We have an opportunity to make a \ndifference now with the proposals being made by the Agriculture \nCommittee. The status quo is a system in which companies you have never \nheard of take risks they cannot back up in markets nobody can see.\n  When they collapse, as they inevitably will--one of the things we \nhave said over and over again in this bill is that we are not going to \nstop the next economic crisis. We are going to have them. The question \nis, Do we have the tools in place to minimize collapses when they \noccur? That is what we are trying to do with this bill. Even with the \nAgriculture Committee proposals, I cannot imagine--and I am sure I am \nspeaking for her when I say this--there is no suggestion that we are \ngoing to stop another company from having great difficulties. We want \nto minimize that when it happens so it doesn't migrate into the rest of \nthe economy. So we are looking to minimize that kind of chaos that can \noccur when some company collapses for reasons unrelated to this, as we \nsaw with AIG. When they fell, the price the country paid was vastly in \nexcess of one company having difficulties. Taxpayers were put on the \nhook to fill the capital holes when they occurred.\n  This has to stop. This market needs oversight and regulation. It \nneeds to exist, as well, if our economy is going to grow and jobs are \nto be created. It has been 18 months since AIG proved that once and for \nall. It is time to bring this trail of destruction to an end and take \nthe steps necessary to allow this market to operate and people to make \nthese kinds of investments and hedge against the kinds of problems that \ncan emerge down the road, so they don't collapse for reasons unrelated \nto their own difficulties.\n  That is why hedging is important and why derivatives are important. \nBut also, these safeguards need to be in place if everyone is going to \nbe a winner, as a result of what we are trying to achieve with this \nlegislation. There are debates about various aspects of this bill, and \nI look forward to that discussion.\n  I hope we will reject this particular proposal, with all due respect \nto it, and adopt what has been proposed by the Agriculture Committee \nand consider that there are additional changes we may work on in order \nto satisfy some legitimate interests. It seems to me we ought to vote \non this proposal and move on to other aspects of the legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I see my friend from Nebraska as well \nas my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Chambliss-Shelby \nderivative substitute, and I am very pleased to indicate that I am a \ncosponsor of that amendment.\n  There is no doubt, when you are talking about derivatives, you are \ntalking about contractual obligations that are as complicated as any \nfinancial industry in our system. So going about trying to figure out \nhow best to regulate them is no easy task. I think that is acknowledged \non both sides.\n  Both the Banking and the Agriculture Committees have wrestled with \nwhat is the best approach to regulating this market that, to date, has \nbeen somewhat unregulated, to say the least. I regret to say that the \ncurrent derivatives title that is in the bill being debated--if you \nstudy it--is overregulation 101.\n  I worry about the host of unintended consequences that will beset our \neconomy if it passes in its current form. It is not accidental that \nthere has been article after article pointing out how much heartburn \nthere is on both sides of the aisle relative to the current proposal \nthat is being debated.\n  The Chambliss-Shelby derivatives substitute is a sensible approach. I \nhave talked to dozens and dozens of those impacted. I have to tell you \nthey are very concerned about the downside impact on our economy.\n  They say it is unnecessary with the new, robust clearing regime that \nis in place. Yet the Dodd bill has an exchange requirement.\n  Why would we not enact meaningful clearing regulations and then add \nanother layer on top, if necessary?\n  Additionally, I worry about the trickle-down effects for community \nbanks that hedge their interest rate risks with large banks. I come \nfrom the State of Nebraska. I don't even think there is a Wall Street \nin the State of Nebraska. We are basically small community banks. I \nhave had some of our smallest banks warn me about the dangers of the \nDodd proposal.\n  If these larger institutions are banned from engaging in swaps, as \nthe Dodd bill would do, who will work with the community banks to keep \ninterest rates low for our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses?\n  Furthermore, banning banks from engaging in derivatives isn't going \nto stop the practice. We don't pass laws for the world. We pass laws \nfor the United States. All we are going to end up doing is sending this \n$600 trillion market out of this country. In fact, I had a small \ncommunity banker in my office recently who said to me: Mike, these \nproducts are absolutely essential to what I do.\n  If they are forced to another part of the world, we will be forced to \nacquire that product from another part of the world.\n  Driving this activity back into the dark--which is what we would do \nif that were to happen--and actually increasing our risk and putting it \nin an economic climate outside the United States is a meltdown recipe.\n  The underlying bill treats farm credit system institutions similar to \nthe big Wall Street firms. It doesn't exempt them from coming up with \ncostly capital and margin requirements. Does anybody believe for a \nsecond that isn't going to hurt farmers and ranchers and the cost of \ntheir loans? I was the former Secretary of Agriculture. Please, believe \nme, you cannot do this and not expect to have a very negative \nconsequence on farmers and ranchers and small businesses.\n  Farm credit institutions, our farmers, and farm cooperatives had \nnothing\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nto do with this financial meltdown. Yet they are being dragged down \nwith the ship.\n  Finally, certain trades are simply so unique but so necessary and so \nspecialized that the clearing requirements simply don't work. That \ndoesn't mean they should not be transparent or that they should not be \ndisclosed, but we should recognize the uniqueness of that situation. \nWhy punish these trades that may pose no systemic risk by imposing \nhigher capital requirements? Yet that is what the Dodd bill does.\n  The bill before us has the potential to have very negative impacts on \nour economy. It is simply an overreach. I am not the only one here \ntoday who has serious concerns.\n  The White House, the Federal Reserve, former Federal Reserve Chairman \nPaul Volcker, and the Chair of the FDIC have raised similar concerns \nrelative to this approach.\n  On April 30, 2010, in a letter from FDIC's Sheila Bair, she says \nthis:\n\n       If all derivatives market-making activities were moved \n     outside of bank holding companies, most of the activity would \n     no doubt continue, but in less regulated and more highly \n     leveraged venues.\n\n  A Federal Reserve staff memo says this:\n\n       The prohibition would not promote financial stability or \n     strong prudential regulation of derivatives or derivatives \n     dealers; would have serious consequences for the \n     competitiveness of U.S. financial institutions; and would be \n     highly disruptive and costly, both for banks and customers.\n\n  My point exactly. Finally, Chairman Volcker also expressed concerns \nwith the derivatives title of the bill:\n\n       The provision of derivatives by commercial banks to their \n     customers in the usual course of a banking relationship \n     should not be prohibited.\n\n  I worry that at some point the Senators are going to come to the \nfloor and pass this mess, and we are going to be stuck with it.\n  The Shelby-Chambliss amendment is a thoughtful and reasonable \napproach. It will increase transparency and government oversight of the \nderivatives market. If we do what is proposed with this Dodd bill, we \nwill push derivatives right back into the shadows. They will be \nunregulated and they will occur in another part of the world and we \nwill bear the risk and the cost of that.\n  These individuals simply used derivatives--these people I am talking \nabout are farmers, ranchers, farmers co-ops--to protect themselves from \nrisk. They are not Wall Street speculators.\n  This proposal from the Shelby-Chambliss approach simply says: Let's \nuse common sense when it comes to the derivatives market. It brings the \ncurrent unregulated over-the-counter derivatives market into the light \nwhere transparency is paramount.\n  This is an enormous departure from current law. In fact, it is a 180-\ndegree change. It attempts to bring swap trades onto a clearing \nplatform. Yet it also recognizes that companies across our country use \nthese complex products as part of their business activity every day to \nprotect themselves from unreasonable risk.\n  Look who is supporting this proposal. This approach has gained the \nsupport of the National Association of Manufacturers. That can hardly \nclaim to be Wall Street insiders.\n  The alternative recognizes the negative consequences businesses would \nface with too rigid a law. Those dangers are obvious--loss of jobs, \njobs moving overseas, constriction in liquidity, lack of credit, higher \ninterest rates for farmers in my State, and higher farm input costs.\n  It also distinguishes that these businesses were not part of the \neconomic meltdown. They are not the AIGs of the world. Instead, they \nare the companies that use derivatives to manage their finances to keep \ndown their costs, to control interest rate fluctuations, to manage \ncurrency volatility and other risk mitigation tools.\n  The recent prices revealed how inadequate our oversight of \nderivatives was and how complex this area is. But if we adopt this \nblanket approach on the rhetoric of punishing Wall Street, what we will \ndo is punish our farmers, our ranchers, our small business people. We \nwill punish the people who are working this area by literally \neliminating their jobs.\n  I thank Senators Chambliss and Shelby. They understand what is at \nstake. This is a reasonable approach and an approach I am glad to \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to reject \nthe proposal by Senator Shelby and Senator Chambliss. It is well \nintentioned. It is designed, as other proposals are, to try to provide \nsome appropriate regulation to a very complex and complicated area of \nfinancial transactions--derivatives.\n  Like my colleagues, I have spent some time trying to understand this \narea. The only major point I can make is that in concept, derivatives \nare simple. It is a contract that derives its value from reference to \nanother entity such as soybeans or mortgages. That is where the \nsimplicity stops.\n  These financial instruments are incredibly complicated, and they have \nbeen made more so by very sophisticated financial engineers on Wall \nStreet.\n  What we have recognized in the last several months is we have to take \nan appropriate step to regulate their sale in the United States and, \nfrankly, influence the worldwide sale and use of derivatives.\n  The Dodd-Lincoln proposal in this bill is, I think, not only a \nprincipled but an effective way to deal with the issue of the sale and \nuse of derivatives. They start off with a premise which is fundamental: \nWe need transparency in the marketplace. There was no transparency in \nthe marketplace when it came to derivatives.\n  Senator Levin held hearings which brought forth individuals from Wall \nStreet, from Goldman Sachs. Frankly, if you listen to the hearings, \neven they did not understand the products they were selling--\ncomplicated, deduced, created by Ph.Ds in mathematics using \nsupercomputers. We need transparency. People have to know what they are \nselling. Apparently, some people on Wall Street did not even know what \nthey were selling. But certainly consumers have to know what they are \nbuying. Transparency is the key.\n  The way you arrive at it, in my view, is the way this underlying \nlegislation Chairman Dodd has sponsored, along with Chairman Lincoln, \ndoes.\n  First, it establishes the requirement that all derivatives \ntransactions be reported to a repository so that regulators will have a \nsense of where the market is moving in terms of specific products.\n  Second, there is a requirement that you clear these products. \nClearing is absolutely critical because an over-the-counter transaction \nis bilateral in nature. It is someone dealing directly with another \nparty. What you have there is the danger of counterparty risk, the fact \nthat one side of the transaction cannot perform. They go bankrupt, they \ndo not have the resources, they miscalculated tremendously as to the \nnature of this transaction. And their failure affects other financial \ninstitutions.\n  In those bilateral situations, the danger for counterparty risk is \nsignificant. To minimize that, you put it on a clearing platform. You \nput a party between the two parties of the contract who will assess \ncollateral and margin and do it in a systematic way. These transactions \non a clearing platform will be more transparent and there will be \nreduced risk between counterparties. That is, I think, a sensible and, \nat this point, nondebatable point because the Chambliss proposal also \nhas a clearing platform aspect to it.\n  But the next step--and I think it is an essential step--is to move to \na trading platform because there you further reduce and manage \ncounterparty risk because it is not just an intermediary clearinghouse \nthat is handling the risk, it is participation in a market. It is \nindividuals who broker deals who come in and buy and leave. It is at \nthe heart of price discovery because the key aspect in all of these \ndiscussions is what is this instrument worth? Is it worth $100 or $2? \nIf I am betting it is worth $100 and, of course, it is $2, I will lose. \nIf I am betting it is $5 or $6 and it is $100, I lose on the other \nside.\n  Part of this is essential price discovery. This is an esoteric point. \nIt goes right to the nature of our markets--price discovery. That is \nwhy we all claim markets are the best form of economic transaction \nbecause in a market, you know the price, and if you can meet the price, \nyou can make the transaction.\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\n  One of the things that is implied in a marketplace, though, in Econ \n101, is perfect information. Buyers and sellers each know what it \ncosts. One of the problems with the derivatives markets is information \nis asymmetric, it is skewed, it is dramatically skewed to the Wall \nStreet insiders who designed these products. That was one of the \nlessons of the Goldman Sachs hearings: Who knew what these things were? \nThey did not even know, but they knew a lot more than people they were \nselling them to.\n  We have to reduce that asymmetric nature of the market, and the best \nplace to do that is not simply clearing a product, having someone say \nyou have to have this much margin if you want to participate, but \nactually trade in the product. Again, this is not an academic issue.\n  Let me paraphrase a story from Michael Lewis's book called ``The Big \nShort.'' On February 21, 2007, the market began to trade an index of \ncollateralized debt obligations. They called it the TABX--T-A-B-X. For \nthe first time, everyone in the marketplace could actually see on a \nscreen what these CDOs were worth, what someone was going to pay for \nthem. No longer were they waiting on just the dealer, the Wall Street \ninsiders saying: No, no, these are great, buy them; they are terrific, \nbuy them. There was a price. The price confirmed a simple thesis in a \nway that as Lewis says no amount of conversations with market insiders \never could ever have.\n  After the first day of trading, those AA-rated tranches closed at \n49.25 from a par value of 100. They lost more than half their value in \none day of trading. There was now this huge disconnect, and I quote:\n\n       With one hand the Wall Street firms were selling low \n     interest rate-bearing double-A rated CDOs at par, or 100; \n     with the other hand they were trading this index composed of \n     those very same bonds for 49 cents on the dollar. In a flurry \n     of e-mails, their sales people at Morgan Stanley and Deutche \n     Bank tried to explain to clients that they should not deduce \n     anything about the value of their bets against subprime CDOs \n     from the prices on these new, publicly traded subprime CDOs. \n     That it was all very complicated.\n\n  Trading illustrates the real value of a product. When the Shelby-\nChambliss proposal says, We are not going to trade these, what they are \nsaying is business as usual. Let's let those folks on Wall Street tell \nus what they are worth. Tell it to the banks, the small community \nbanks, tell it to the farmers, tell it to all those business men and \nwomen at the National Association of Manufacturers, this is what it is \nworth. They will not have to explain the fact that a market might rate \nit half of what they are claiming the value is.\n  If we really want to reform what is happening on Wall Street, we are \nnot going to abandon the requirement to trade as many products as we \ncan trade.\n  I will admit some products are so unique that a trading market might \nnot be established. But the presumption by Wall Street--in fact, I \nthink the head of J.P. Morgan said practically 70 percent of the \nderivatives could be cleared and probably a significant fraction of \nthat could be traded. If you want transparency, if you want price \ndiscovery, if you want efficient markets, reject the Chambliss \nproposal, support the Dodd proposal.\n  There is another aspect of the bill, and that is section 716, which \ndoes not deal with the mechanics of trading derivatives as much as who \ncan do it. Can it be in a bank? Must it be separated? There are \ndiscussions about different approaches. Senator Levin and Senator \nMerkley have an approach that bars proprietary trading, that would \nleave that out of the bank but still leave traditional hedging within \nthe bank. That is part of the debate. That, I think, is a seriously \nsignificant open question. In my mind, there is absolutely no question \nthat to accept the Chambliss-Shelby approach that doesn't require \ntrading is the wrong way to proceed.\n  There is another issue here, too, and that goes to the nature of \nthese over-the-counter contracts. Some of them could be cleared, but \nsome are so unique they cannot. It goes to the exemption for end-users. \nIn the Dodd bill, they have made a successful attempt to separate those \nover-the-counter transactions which have an economic rationale--it is \nan airliner hedging their fuel prices--and they have done it in a way \nwhich makes sure that this is not a loophole for the sophisticated \nfinancial engineer to exploit but a way in which business can continue \nto conduct their operations.\n  The exceptions in the Shelby-Chambliss amendment are much too large. \nIn fact, I think this is a drafting error, but as I read the amendment, \nit could be read as only requiring clearing of swaps between two \ncounterparties under common ownership within the same company, which \nessentially means there is no requirement whatsoever. I do not think \nthat is what the sponsors proposed but that is what the language says, \nat least as I read it.\n  If you want huge loopholes to begin this process, support this \namendment. If you want to maintain well-structured exemptions for the \neconomic use of derivatives, that is incorporated within the underlying \nDodd-Lincoln bill, and it makes a great deal of sense to me.\n  There are issues here we have to be conscious of and we can still \ndebate about the allocation of responsibilities between regulatory \nauthorities with respect to these derivatives. That is an issue that I \nthink is still outstanding. But the underlying architecture of \nderivative regulation has been accomplished by Senator Dodd and Senator \nLincoln in their bill.\n  Again, we have learned a lot. I think we should have learned a bit of \ncollective humility about the ability to deal with these complicated \nproducts. So we have to build in multiple lines of defense, if you \nwill. Simply requiring the reporting of transactions to a repository--\nthat is good but not sufficient. Requiring that the majority of these \ninstruments be cleared unless they have an economic value or they are \nso unique that the clearing would be inappropriate--that is a step \nforward, too, but insufficient. It is only when you put together the \nentire spectrum of reporting, clearing, and trading of appropriately \ntraded derivatives do you have the full panoply of protections we need \nto deal with these complicated products today. Frankly, there is a \nsense that maybe we haven't seen nothing yet. The sophistication, the \ningenuity of the financial engineers may be absent at the moment, but \nit will return, and we need these multiple lines of defense.\n\n  There is another point I wish to make. We have to recognize when we \nare building this new structure that it, too, has weaknesses. One of \nthe most significant weaknesses is that in a clearing platform, if \nthere is not full transparency and if the clearing platform isn't adept \nat setting margin requirements and collateral, there is a danger that \nplatform becomes a source of systemic risk. And these platforms are \ndealing with notional values of trillions of dollars. If they misjudge \nby a little bit, a clearinghouse could have a significant situation in \nwhich it is unable to meet its responsibilities. Once again, I think \nthat is a strong argument for, not a single or a double line of \ndefense, but a triple line of defense with respect to trading also.\n  Because if there is trading and price discovery, they will have a \nmuch better idea of what the product really is worth and they will be \nable to set margin and collateral much more adequately.\n  There are many issues that have to be dealt with as we proceed \nthrough this markup and on to the conference, I hope. But in my mind, \nclearly the superior vehicle to pursue those ends is the language \nincorporated in the Dodd bill, and I would urge all my colleagues to \nreject the amendment by the gentleman from Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to compliment my colleague from \nRhode Island and thank him for his hard work. He and his staff have \ndone a tremendous job on the Banking Committee on this particular \nissue. It has been a pleasure to work with him and his staff and \ncertainly to see the good work they have done, and I want him to know I \nam grateful to him for his hard work in helping us come up with a good \npackage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, a key part of the bill we are considering \nis title VII, which we all know addresses the regulation of the over-\nthe-\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\ncounter--OTC--derivatives markets. While there is still debate among us \nregarding the root cause of the financial crisis, there is no debate \nthat the lack of transparency in the OTC derivatives market was a \ncontributing factor to the financial debacle.\n  When Lehman Brothers failed, there were press reports that banks and \nother large financial institutions had written credit default swaps--we \ncall them CDSs--on Lehman Brothers that could potentially result in \n$360 billion in cash payouts. As it turned out, though, the number was \nless than $6 billion. But a lot of needless anxiety preceded the \nrealization that the cash payouts on Lehman Brothers' CDS contracts \nwere manageable. The regulators simply did not have the information \nthey needed to know about the magnitude of the problem they faced.\n  Limited regulatory information also played a role in the demise of \nAIG. It is worth remembering that AIG's problems arose both in its \nregulated insurance subsidiaries, which were exposed to the troubled \nsubprime mortgage market through their securities lending programs, and \nin its financial products unit, which sold credit default protection \nfor subprime mortgage products and other customized derivatives \nproducts.\n  AIG's financial products unit, on the strength of its credit rating, \nbuilt up an extremely large, one-sided book of swaps transactions. The \ncontracts were written in such a way that when AIG's credit rating was \ndowngraded, AIG, you will remember, was forced to post collateral on \nall these transactions.\n  Regulators at that time did not have the flow of information about \nOTC derivatives transactions to see this problem building. Without this \ninformation, they obviously could not take steps to address the \nproblem.\n  I believe the AIG bailout and the Lehman Brothers failure provided us \nwith one simple lesson that should serve as the basic test for any OTC \nderivatives legislation proposal. The lesson is that prudential and \nmarket regulators must have the tools to properly oversee OTC swaps \nmarkets. The lack of transparency regarding counterparty exposures and \nthe lack of adequate regulatory tools made it difficult for regulators \nto respond quickly and effectively to this financial crisis 18 months \nago.\n  Unfortunately, the Lincoln-Dodd derivatives bill fails that most \nbasic test. The Lincoln-Dodd bill does not provide regulators with \naccess to the information they need to do their job. It requires all \nother regulators to go through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nto get information. It gives only begrudging access to the Securities \nand Exchange Commission--the SEC--to data about the swaps markets and \nthus limits the SEC's ability to get the information it needs to \noversee the securities markets.\n  Much of this bill reads more like a jurisdictional power grab to some \nof us than an honest attempt to ensure that all the relevant regulators \nhave the information and the authority they need to do their jobs.\n  I believe the Lincoln-Dodd bill contains a number of other fatal \nflaws. For example, key provisions in one title directly contradict key \nprovisions in other titles and also in the current law. One provision \nin the Lincoln-Dodd bill that has gotten a lot of attention is a \nprohibition on Federal assistance to any ``swaps entity,'' which \nincludes entities that do not handle any swaps. All clearinghouses, \nregardless of whether they handle swaps, would be precluded from \nreceiving Federal assistance, which is interpreted to include access to \nthe Federal Reserve's discount window. This provision contradicts \nlanguage in title VIII, which empowers the Federal Reserve to grant \ndiscount window access to clearinghouses.\n  Also, the bill imposes a fiduciary duty on dealers when their \ncounterparties are pension plans, endowment funds, and municipalities. \nAs understood in current law, pension plans cannot engage in \ntransactions with entities with which they have a fiduciary \nrelationship.\n  The proposed regulatory framework also poses new risks to the system. \nFor example, the bill anticipates generally imposing a clearing mandate \non most market participants as soon as a clearinghouse will accept a \nswap for clearing. For-profit clearinghouses will have an incentive to \nclear as many swaps as possible. If they do not properly assess and \ncollect margin for risks associated with these products or do not have \nsufficient operational capacity, an unanticipated event in the market \ncould topple a clearinghouse and send devastating shock waves \nthroughout the rest of the system. We witnessed that for a few minutes \nlast week.\n  This bill is also anticompetitive because it further concentrates \nbusiness within existing dealers. The prohibition on Federal \nassistance, including FDIC insurance, to swap entities means \nneighborhood banks will be unable to hedge their own interest rate \nrisks, let alone offer swaps to customers who need to hedge their \nrisks. Bank dealers are given preferential treatment with respect to \nboth capital and margin requirements.\n  Another disadvantage in the bill for nonbank dealers is that even the \ncommercial aspects of their business will be subject to bank-like \ncapital requirements, which is an unprecedented expansion of bank-like \nregulation to the nonfinancial corporations. Nonbank dealers may simply \nexit the derivatives business and leave the swaps business more \nconcentrated among a few large Wall Street dealers, which is not a good \nresult from a competitive or systemic risk standpoint.\n  I believe the so-called end user exemption contained in this bill is \nillusory. Main Street corporations that buy swaps in the ordinary \ncourse of business to hedge their own business risks will be subject to \nthe same regulatory treatment as Wall Street banks. This means \nmanufacturing firms, power companies, and even beer producers will be \nrequired to hold massive amounts of cash and other collateral simply to \nengage in risk management. I believe this will work as an anti-stimulus \nplan to pull resources out of the economy, hurt growth, and slow job \ncreation. It will also lead to price increases and price volatility.\n  For my colleagues interested in increasing their constituents' \ncooling costs in the summer or heating costs next winter; for those \ninterested in seeing the price of orange juice, cereal, lightbulbs, \nmedicine, office supplies, building materials, cars, and computers \nrise; for those who would like to make the overall cost of living for \nall Americans go up and the prospect of getting a job go down, the \nDodd-Lincoln bill is for you.\n  Finally, I believe this bill is unworkable as it is now written. The \nderivatives title is the one piece of this legislation that will be \ntested every day. The bill would make massive changes in a huge market \nin 180 days without the usual notice-and-comment rulemaking period that \nallows for broad public input during that time. Neither agency has the \nstaff it needs to write or implement the rules at this time. There will \nbe enormous operational challenges for the SEC and the CFTC as they \ngear up to monitor and receive data on all swap transactions for which \nthere is no data repository. Companies all across the United States \nwill face operational, legal, and financial challenges as they strive \nto come into compliance with record-keeping, reporting, capital, \nmargin, clearing, and business conduct requirements.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Check for yourself. Take the words of \na recent Bloomberg article, which was aptly titled ``How `Hard to \nFathom' Derivatives Rule Emerged in the U.S. Senate'' or take the words \nof the National Association of Manufacturers, which warned that the \nend-user exemption ``is not strong or clear enough. In addition, other \nprovisions in the derivatives title could effectively eliminate the \nexemption for many companies, and in some cases, subject them to \ncapital and margin requirements or higher costs.''\n  Take the words of a well-respected lawyer in a memo to his clients \nwhich contained the following criticism of the Lincoln-Dodd bill:\n\n       Ordinarily, in writing with regard to a proposed law, the \n     expected role of the law firm lawyer is to provide a \n     description rather than commentary. In the case of the \n     Lincoln-Dodd bill the law firm lawyer attempting a \n     noncommittal description must confront the following \n     problems:\n       (1) the Lincoln-Dodd bill's substance is inconsistent with \n     its stated purposes; (2) it would give a degree of \n     discretionary power to the U.S. Government that is far out of \n     the ordinary; (3) the Lincoln-Dodd bill is loosely drafted in \n     even its key provisions; (4) it\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\n     could make for radical changes in the financial system that \n     seem not to have been considered; (5) the Lincoln-Dodd bill \n     would likely motivate institutions to move jobs to Europe, \n     damaging the U.S. economy and particularly the northeastern \n     financial center economy; (6) it would discourage banks' \n     capital market and real estate lending in the United States \n     by increasing their risks; and (7) the Lincoln-Dodd bill \n     would hurt banks' profitability at a time when they are \n     struggling.\n\n  Or take the words of an industry representative who urged us to \nchange a certain provision that would prevent pension plans and \ngovernment agencies from getting the services they need, and another \nprovision that could force purchasers of swaps into deals with less \ncreditworthy counterparties.\n  Or take the actions of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nWhile several of them have privately admitted that they fear the wrath \nof the administration for speaking out publicly against the Lincoln-\nDodd derivatives bill, their actions speak louder than their silence. \nThey are apparently hard at work, we know that, behind closed doors, \ntrying to make numerous last-minute changes to this flawed bill.\n  Or take the words of my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for \nwhom I have a lot of respect, the chairman of the Banking Committee. He \nwas quoted earlier this week saying:\n\n       We still have work to do on [derivatives]--there's no \n     question. We have always known that. So a lot of people are \n     spending a lot of time trying to come to some common points \n     on this.\n\n  I agree with the committee chairman; the derivative title needs a lot \nmore work. Fortunately, that work has already been done: the substitute \nderivatives bill that we offer as amendment No. 3816, the Over-the-\nCounter Swaps Markets Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010. This \namendment was crafted and cosponsored by several members of the \nAgriculture and Banking Committees. The substitute derivatives bill is \na bipartisan product. The bill is built from the framework of the \nChambliss-Lincoln bipartisan process. It also incorporates key concepts \nfrom the Gregg-Reed bipartisan working group that was formed by \nChairman Dodd himself to hammer out real derivatives reform. The \nsubstitute derivatives bill is also a multicommittee product.\n  My colleague from Georgia and I appreciate the input from the \nAgriculture and Banking Committees, as well as the important input from \nthe Judiciary Committee, on provisions that strengthen protections for \ncustomer funds in the event of a counterparty bankruptcy.\n  The derivatives substitute amendment addresses five key areas of \nreform: introducing regulatory transparency and regulatory authority \nover the OTC swaps markets, mandating clearing for Wall Street dealers, \nminimizing threats to the financial stability of the United States, \npreserving Main Street's ability to hedge their business risks, and \nimproving public transparency. I will briefly explain each of the five \nareas of reform.\n  First, we address regulatory transparency and regulatory authority. I \nbelieve we must repeal the statutory provisions that prohibit \nregulators from overseeing the OTC swaps markets and give them access \nto the information they need so they can do their job.\n  Second, we mandate in our amendment clearing for Wall Street dealers. \nWe must encourage the clearing of derivative transactions among Wall \nStreet dealers and dealer-like firms in well-regulated clearinghouses. \nThis will account for a combined 80 percent to 90 percent of all OTC \nderivatives transactions.\n  Third, we minimize threats to the financial stability of the United \nStates. We must prevent the concentration of inadequately hedged risks \nin individual firms or central clearinghouses.\n  Fourth, we preserve economically beneficial hedging for Main Street \nbusinesses. I believe we must ensure that so-called corporate end users \ncan continue to hedge their unique business risks through customized \nderivatives. Main Street businesses do not pose any threat to the \nfinancial stability of the United States. In fact, prudent use of \nderivatives for hedging makes their businesses, the financial system, \nand the economy safer. The prudent use of derivatives enables \nbusinesses to protect themselves from changes in interest rates, swings \nin foreign currency, exchange rates, and the changing prices for raw \nmaterials that all of our manufacturers use.\n  If businesses in America are not able to use derivatives or if the \ncost of using derivatives increases, they may choose to move operations \noverseas or curtail business operations, which will mean the loss of \njobs when we really need jobs. If they must refrain from hedging their \nrisks, prices will go up for all our consumers--all of us.\n  Fifth, we improve, in this amendment, public transparency. Without \nmandating that swap trades must occur on an exchange, we must direct \nregulators to provide investors and other market participants with \ninformation about recently executed transactions for the purpose of \nhelping them to mark existing swap positions to market, make informed \ndecisions before executing future transactions, and assess the quality \nof transactions they have executed.\n  The Lincoln-Dodd derivatives title does not achieve these reform \nobjectives but, in fact, threatens to stymie real reform.\n  The substitute derivatives amendment we offer represents a change in \ncourse from the Lincoln-Dodd bill. The substitute amendment is a strong \nbill that offers real reform. This is why the National Association of \nManufacturers has indicated that all votes related to the Chambliss-\nShelby substitute amendment, including procedural motions, may be \nconsidered for designation as key manufacturing votes in this Congress. \nI think it is important to American business that we adopt this \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nChambliss substitute amendment and to ask my colleagues to think about \nthis substitute in a significant way because it dramatically changes \nthe underlying bill. In fact, I almost want to ask my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle if they are serious--if they are serious that \nthis is the proposal they are going to put before us in response to the \ncatastrophe that we have seen on Wall Street.\n  I know we have been on the Senate floor and we have had a lot of \nhistory with this, starting in 2001. I think it must have been 2002 or \n2003 when we tried to regulate derivatives after the Enron crisis, and \none of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said: We can't \nregulate derivatives; we don't know enough about them.\n  What lessons have we learned since this catastrophe? I can tell you \nthis: We were wrong to say we can't understand derivatives because our \nmisunderstanding or not paying attention has led us to the catastrophe \nwe are in today. For the other side of the aisle to say we can't even \npropose exchange trading, that is like saying the stock market should \nmake changes in options and stock without being on an exchange. That \nwould be like the Presiding Officer and I swapping back and forth \nMicrosoft or Starbucks stock and selling it to other people and having \nnone of the trade basically being reported.\n  Why would we tolerate that for the stock market? Yet we are saying \nsomehow it is OK for derivatives, this product that has become this \nunbelievable $600 trillion market, to operate in the dark.\n  The other side does not even want to have exchange trading? I cannot \nbelieve that. I cannot believe somebody would even propose that. I know \nsome people will say they have clearing, but the clearing requirements \nin this legislation would leave 60 percent of the market uncovered. So \nwe are talking about not having the product on exchange and not having \na lot of it cleared. So the two primary principles, learning from the \nmistakes of the last 10 years, are basically going unnoticed, \nunaccounted for on the other side of the aisle.\n  Let's go back to how we got into this situation because we used to \nhave a law that basically said, yes; let's protect consumers. We had \ntransparency in trades--that was reporting to the CFTC; we had on the \nbooks capital requirements, we had speculation limits, we had antifraud \nand antimanipulation laws, we had trader licensing and registration and \npublic exchange trading. So, yes, we actually had it right. We had it \nright. We had some tools in\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\nplace. We had an oversight agency that was supposed to do this job, all \nof these things that protected the investments of millions of people \nand made the functionality of people who legitimately had to hedge, \nsuch as farmers or airline industries, rules of the road so they \nweren't taken to the cleaners or the price wasn't artificially driven \nthrough the roof.\n\n  What happened to these things? What happened to these things is, in \n2000, somebody came out on the Senate floor, basically at 7:30 on a \nFriday night, and stuck into an over 2,000-page bill a little exemption \nthat said: Don't regulate these derivatives. That is what happened.\n  What happened in the marketplace is that derivatives were a very \nsmall business, only a few hundred billion dollars, as you can see, in \n1999. It was kind of an uninteresting little market. But we ended up \nderegulating them, and since then, in this short period of time, it \nturned into a $700 trillion market.\n  How do you go, in that period of time, to this $700 billion? You go \nbecause we made it a dark market. We basically said: You don't have to \nhave the rules of the road or the regulation or the oversight or the \nbasic things that make this a functioning market.\n  What happened? We had no transparency, no requirements to keep \nrecords. That means you didn't have to be able to prove to the CFTC \nexactly what you were doing in the market. That way, you could not \nactually prove fraud because you didn't know what anybody was doing \nbecause nobody had to make records. It is like Bernie Madoff on \nsteroids. We had no large trader reporting and no speculation limits.\n  The reason you have things on an exchange is because when an exchange \nsees that somebody is making the market or has too large a position--\nand oftentimes across several exchanges--you have a regulator who can \ncome in and say, you know what. We have speculation limits and you \ncannot do that much trading because you were driving the market.\n  So after that we had no speculation limits, we had no capital \nrequirements, and we had this high-risk manipulation and excessive \nspeculation. That is what we did.\n  A lot of people thought: You know what. I wasn't here, but I know a \nlot of people said this is going to revolutionize things. Derivatives \nare going to be the wave of the future. It is going to help us in our \nfinancial markets and the amount of liquidity. Everything is going to \nbe great.\n  Some people said don't worry about this because they are not going to \nbe a very big resource, they are going to be very small and it is only \ngoing to be a few people who are going to trade back and forth.\n  I showed you the chart. It turned into a $700 trillion industry. It \nwas a big opportunity for people to make a lot of money without the \noversight.\n  Where are we today? Have we learned the lessons of this catastrophe? \nHave we? It is not to say that it isn't hard to be ahead of the \nsmartest guys on Wall Street. I will say it is very hard. That is why \nyou have to have bright lines because otherwise people do come up with \nnew tools. I saw it with Enron in my State. I have seen it now with \nderivatives. There will be something else. Unless we have rules of the \nroad, then there will be people who will try to continue to have opaque \nmarkets and drive trading.\n  But our underlying proposal, by the chair of the Agriculture \nCommittee and this underlying bill, working with the chair of the \nBanking Committee, has the rules of the road. The other side of the \naisle is proposing a substitute that would take those away. This is \nclear. If you have unregulated trading, none of this happens. If you \nhad exchange trading, this is what the American public gets protected \nwith: transparent pricing, real-time trade monitoring, transparent \nvaluation, speculation limits and public transparency. That is what \nthis underlying bill does and that is what the amendment is trying to \nget rid of.\n  They want this to be blank over here. They want this to be blank. \nThey don't want those things to have to be met.\n  How could you possibly propose that after what we just went through? \nYou had, prior to 2000, regulation. Things were working hard. You have \nafterwards a major catastrophe, and these are fundamentals that we have \nbehind all of our markets and exchange trading. So why would you let \none thing off the hook?\n  I will never forget the day when one of the former CFTC staff came \nand testified before the Energy Committee and said to our committee: Do \nyou know that hamburger in America has more regulation on it than \nenergy futures?\n  I thought he couldn't be serious, but he was right. Futures of beef \nhave reporting requirements, have to have transparency and real-time \nmonitoring, have speculation limits. But these energy derivatives, \nbecause they were exempted by this 2000 act, did not. So somehow we \nwere saying that hamburger in America--making sure it played by the \nrules--was more important than whether oil or electricity or these \nother things--as we know, CDOs--played by the same rules.\n  Make no mistake. This underlying bill gives us this kind of \npredictability and certainty in the tried and true ways that markets \nfunction, with transparency.\n  We are talking about old-fashioned capitalism. We are not talking \nabout oligarchies where people hide behind things and only a few people \nknow. Who knows when we are going to find out what happened with the \n``fat finger'' the other day and what moved the markets? But I know \nthis: If you come back to capital trades with transparency in pricing \nand real-time monitoring and those speculation limits--their \nlegislation on the other side does nothing to make sure we prohibit the \nexcessive speculation that can move the market in a manipulative way.\n  So I hope we do not adopt this substitute amendment. Let's show \nAmerica we are serious about the kind of transparency that has worked \nin markets in the tried-and-true part of our capitalist system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of \nSenator Chambliss from Georgia and to express my very serious concerns \nabout the language which has been brought forward by the chairmen of \nthe committees--both the Agriculture Committee and the Banking \nCommittee--relative to derivatives.\n  Let's begin with what our purposes should be. Let's remember that \nderivatives, as has been said before on this floor numerous times--the \nSenator from Alabama said it extraordinarily well--are a critical part \nof how Main Street maintains its economic vitality. You know credit is \nwhat makes America work. One of the great geniuses of our society is \nthat we are able to produce credit in a fairly ready manner which is \nreasonably priced and which people who wish to take risk can take \nadvantage of in order to create economic activity and jobs. The oil \nthat basically keeps the credit available in the American capital \nsystem is derivatives, for all intents and purposes.\n  As has been pointed out, if you are manufacturing an item somewhere \nin America and you enter into a contract to sell that item--let's say \noverseas--there are a lot of risks on how you are going to make money \non that item which you have no control over.\n  Let's say you make it one day and you are going to sell it 6 months \nlater. You enter into a contract when you get the order and you produce \nit 6 months later. There is a lot of risk there over which you have no \ncontrol. You know how to manufacture. You know how to create it. If it \nis credit, you know how to produce it. But you do not have control over \nthe exchange rates you are dealing with. You do not have control over \nthe cost of the raw materials you are using. You do not have control \nover whether the various parties that enter into this transaction as it \nmoves through the commercial stream survive or go out of business or \nexperience some huge economic upset.\n  Well, in order to avoid all of that and just be the person who wants \nto produce the good and sell it, you buy derivatives, which are \nessentially insurance policies, to make sure you have insurance against \nthe risk which you cannot control. That is derivatives in their \nsimplest form. It also affects all sorts of other instruments, of \ncourse, financial instruments, commodity instruments. But basically it \nis the capacity of someone to make an\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\nagreement with somebody else and know that agreement is not going to be \naffected by outside events or, if the outside events do occur, there is \ngoing to be a vehicle in place to protect you from the risks that \noutside event may create for you. So derivatives are crucial to our \ncapacity as a society to be economically vibrant.\n  We also know that during the economic downturn, during the very \nsevere financial crisis we had, the fact that we had so many \nderivatives in place which were based off of contracts which were not \nproperly supported created a huge cascading event which almost forced \nour entire financial structure to come to a halt--in fact, it did on \none evening--and was about to put our economic house into extreme \ndistress because the derivatives markets had not been properly \nregulated or managed.\n  Now, that wasn't the primary cause of the event of the late 2008 \nperiod. The primary causes of the events of the late 2008 period were \nvery bad underwriting--in fact, virtually no underwriting standards in \nsome instances--for the loans which were being made, easy money, and \nregulatory arbitrage. But the accelerant which took those causes and \nbasically turned them into an event of immense proportions which almost \nshut down America and would have caused massive dislocation in our \nNation had it been allowed to go uncontrolled, had the Fed and Treasury \nnot stepped in and taken very definitive action, the accelerant was the \nderivatives market.\n  The classic example of that, of course, is the AIG situation, which \nhas been cited here on the floor numerous times as the example of what \nwas wrong with an unregulated market, where essentially you had a \ncompany which was issuing insurance based on its good name and \nvirtually nothing else behind the insurance besides its good name. When \nthat insurance started to get called because the contracts started to \nfail and the counterparties became concerned, there was no capacity to \nsupport the insurance.\n  So our purpose here should be to reorganize our regulatory structure \nso that type of an event doesn't occur again--I mean, that should be \nour purpose--while at the same time recognizing that we need a very \nrobust and vibrant derivatives market if we are going to be successful \nas a nation, if we are going to continue to have economic vitality as a \nnation. So our goal should be, one, to put in place a structure which \nas much as possible foresees and limits systemic risk caused by the \nderivatives market or that could be caused by the derivatives market \nand, two, maintains an extremely vibrant derivatives market where \nAmerica remains the best place in the world to create capital and get \ncredit.\n  Unfortunately, the pending bill undermines the second part of that \neffort. It could be argued that the first part of the effort--\nforeseeing and trying to anticipate systemic risk--is addressed in this \nbill, but it addresses it in such an unwieldy and unmanageable and in \nsome ways counterproductive way, it actually undermines the basic goal, \nwhich is to keep the system sound and also keep credit markets vibrant.\n  Why is that? Well, there are a number of reasons for it, but the two \nmost difficult parts of this proposal relative to getting it right are \nthe fact that it forces the swap desks to be spun off from the \nfinancial houses and it essentially forces instant movement from and \nbasically almost total coverage of derivatives from clearinghouses into \nexchanges. In both those instances, you are basically going to create \nfairly close to the opposite result you are seeking if you pursue this \ncourse.\n  I would predict that if this bill were to become law in its present \nform, it would be likely that, one, a large amount of derivative \nactivity would move overseas; two, a large amount of derivative \nactivity which presently occurs and which is necessary for commerce \nwould have to be restructured in a way that would be extraordinarily \nexpensive for the people who are doing that commerce and would \ntherefore significantly curtail commerce; three, the credit markets \nwould inherently contract by a significant amount of money, probably as \nmuch as $\\3/4\\ trillion; and four, the institutions which would be \nresponsible for creating the derivatives market would actually be less \nstable. The market makers would be less stable than what we presently \nhave today.\n  You do not have to believe me to understand the seriousness of this \nand accept this as a statement or an assessment of what the present \nbill does. I mean, granted, I am just one Member of this body who has \nan opinion on it. But we do hire people, as a government, to take a \nlook at something like this and say, does this work or does that work, \nand they are charged with the responsibility of accomplishing the two \ngoals I mentioned: one, avoiding systemic risk, and two, having a \nvibrant credit market.\n  One of those agencies is the Federal Reserve. They have taken a look \nat this language in the Dodd-Lincoln bill and they have concluded: \nSection 106 would impair financial stability and strong prudential \nregulation of derivatives, would have serious consequences for the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. financial institutions, and would be highly \ndisruptive and costly both for banks and their customers. That is the \nconclusion of a fair umpire, the Federal Reserve.\n  Now, there are a lot of people around here who do not like the \nFederal Reserve. But we pay them. Their job is to look at something \nlike this and say: Does this work or does that work in making our \nmarkets more stable, more sound, more risk averse, and more \ncompetitive? Their conclusion is this language does just the opposite--\nwould be highly disruptive and costly for both banks and their \ncustomers.\n  But if you do not like the Federal Reserve, listen to the FDIC. The \nFDIC, under Sheila Bair, during the crisis we have just gone through, \nhas probably been one of the best performing agencies in our Federal \nGovernment. They really have stepped in on numerous occasions and \nstabilized banks, which had far overextended their capacity and had \ngotten into very serious liquidity positions, and basically settled \nthose banks out in a way that very few customers lost anything.\n  What does the FDIC say when they look at this, because their \nresponsibility is to maintain safety and soundness of banks. The \nChairman of the FDIC, Sheila Bair, said in her letter to--I am not sure \nto whom it went; I will check that--I think it was to Members of \nCongress:\n\n       By concentrating the activity in an affiliate of the \n     insured banks, [and that means spinning them off under the \n     proposal under this bill] we could end up with less and lower \n     quality capital, less information and oversight for the FDIC, \n     and potentially less support for the insured bank in a time \n     of crisis. Thus, one unintended outcome of this provision \n     would be weakened, not strengthened protection of the insured \n     bank and the deposit insurance fund, which I know is not the \n     result any of us want.\n\n  Then we have Chairman Volcker, who I think everybody agrees is a fair \narbiter around here, and he has also said this language in this bill \noverreaches and does not work.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Volcker \nletter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Paul A. Volcker,\n\n                                        New York, NY, May 6, 2010.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: A number of people, including some \n     members of your Committee, have asked me about. the proposed \n     restrictions on bank trading in derivatives set out in \n     Senator Lincoln's proposed amendment to Section 716 of S. \n     3217. I thought it best to write you directly about my \n     reaction.\n       I well understand the concerns that have motivated Senator \n     Lincoln in terms of the risks and potential conflicts posed \n     by proprietary trading in derivatives concentrated in a \n     limited number of commercial banking organizations. As you \n     know, the proposed restrictions appear to go well beyond the \n     proscriptions on proprietary trading by banks that are \n     incorporated in Section 619 of the reform legislation that \n     you have proposed. My understanding is that the prohibitions \n     already provided for in Section 619, specifically including \n     the Merkley-Levin amended language clarifying the extent of \n     the prohibition on proprietary trading by commercial banks, \n     satisfy my concerns and those of many others with respect to \n     bank trading in derivatives.\n       In that connection, I am also aware of, and share, the \n     concerns about the extensive reach of Senator Lincoln's \n     proposed amendment. The provision of derivatives by \n     commercial banks to their customers in the usual course of a \n     banking relationship should not be prohibited.\n       In sum, my sense is that the understandable concerns about \n     commercial bank trading in derivatives are reasonably dealt \n     with in Section 619 of your reform bill as presently drafted. \n     Both your Bill and the Lincoln\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\n     amendment reflect the important concern that, to the extent \n     feasible, derivative transactions be centrally cleared or \n     traded on a regulated exchange. These are needed elements of \n     reform.\n       I am sending copies of this letter to Secretary Geithner \n     and to Senators Shelby, Merkley, Levin, and Lincoln.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Paul.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. So we have these independent arbiters, these fair umpires \nof what we should be doing in order to maintain financial stability and \nstrong credit markets saying: Listen, do not do it this way. Do not do \nit this way.\n  There are ways to do this, however, ways to make sure we have a \nstrong derivatives market which is also safer, more sound, and is not \nsubject to systemic risk. Senator Chambliss's amendment accomplishes \nthat in a very effective way.\n  How do you basically do it? Well, in concept, you do it this way: You \nmake sure that for the most part, all of the derivatives are cleared. \nThey go through a clearing process. What does a clearing process mean? \nWell, it basically means that you get counterparties having to put up \nmargin. They have to put up actual assets, margins, liquidity, in order \nto be sure there is something behind their position so that if they \nhave a problem and they have to be called on to pay up their position, \nthey have the capacity to do it and it is there. That is why you have a \nclearinghouse, because the clearinghouse becomes basically the place \nwhere that occurs and it becomes the process by which that occurs. And \nyou make sure the clearinghouse itself, because it stands in and \nbasically is the guarantor, for lack of a better word, of the contract, \nhas the capital and the adequacy to make sure those contracts will not \nfail.\n  So as a very practical matter, you can do this by creating a proper \nstructure using clearinghouses. You make sure the clearinghouses have \nproper oversight from the SEC or the CFTC. And then as these \ninstruments, these various types of derivatives--there are lots of \ndifferent types of derivatives--become more standardized--and a lot \nalready are standardized--you move them over to an exchange, which is \nthe ultimate process of making sure you do not have an issue of \nsolvency behind the instruments. So as you move them to an exchange, \nyou are able to create an even stronger market. But you do not mandate \nthat everything goes through an exchange right out the door because if \nyou did that, you would end up with a lot of derivatives which are \nstill too customized to be able to move to an exchange and they would \nsimply not be able to be brought forward, and thus you would contract \nthe market again.\n  You also don't take the swap desks and move them out of the financial \nhouse because, in doing that, you would have to create a whole new \ncapital base for the swap desks, which is the concern expressed by the \nFed and by the FDIC and by Chairman Volcker, which would inevitably \nforce a massive contraction in credit because that capital would no \nlonger be available to underwrite credit. In addition, you would have \nmuch weaker institutions standing behind the swap desks, which is again \na point made by the Fed, the FDIC, and Chairman Volcker.\n  It is not necessary to go down the route outlined in this bill in \norder to accomplish the goals which we all have. In fact, if you go \ndown the route presented in this bill, you actually undermine the goal \nwhich we all have, which is to have a derivatives market which is less \nprone to systemic risk and which is strong, sound, and vibrant.\n  Rather, what Senator Chambliss has proposed makes the most sense, \nwhich is a comprehensive reform of the derivatives market in a way that \ninsists that for the vast majority of derivatives, they end up going \nthrough a clearinghouse process and that if they are standardizable, \nthey end up on an exchange. If they are for purely a commercial \npurpose, a single-purpose commercial undertaking, then they are able to \nbe exempt from the clearing activity. This would create a much more \nrobust undertaking of a creation of credit. It would maintain the \nvitality of the derivatives market while at the same time protecting \nand making sure we had a sound derivatives market. It would avoid what \nI believe the inevitable outcome of this language will be under the \nDodd-Lincoln bill, which is that we would weaken the derivatives \nmarket, weaken the systemic protections, and end up forcing overseas a \nlarge amount of economic activity which appropriately should be done in \nthe United States and which is very important to our Nation's capacity \nto be competitive on Main Street. Remember, this is about Main Street.\n  I certainly hope Members will support the Chambliss amendment. It \nmakes a lot of sense. It is well thought out. It is not exactly what I \nwould do were I writing this myself, but it is a very good piece of \nlegislation. It should be supported. I hope my colleagues will do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I appreciate all the debate we have had \nand the discussion. I thank my colleague from Georgia, my ranking \nmember on the committee. He and his staff are a tremendous group to \nwork with. I appreciate all that. I am confident we have worked hard. \nIn the underlying bill we have come to agreement with Chairman Dodd on, \nwe lower the systemic risk by requiring mandatory trading and clearing, \nwhich my colleague, Senator Cantwell, did a tremendous job of \nexplaining, bringing that 100 percent transparency to the market with \nreal-time price reporting, protecting municipalities and pensions and \nretirees, regulating foreign exchange transactions, and increasing the \nenforcement authority to punish the bad behavior we have seen. To that \npoint, again, I believe not since the Great Depression have we seen \nsuch devastating consequences of a banking and financial system gone \nwrong. It does call us to action.\n  We are not here to take easy votes. We are here to tackle complicated \nproblems and find the solutions we know are going to benefit all of \nAmerica. We certainly should not squander that opportunity for historic \nreform, nor support any effort to weaken it.\n  Therefore, I certainly recommend a ``no'' vote on the Chambliss \namendment and respectfully encourage my colleagues to do the same. \nAgain, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his hard work. We will \ncontinue to work together to find the common ground we know is going to \nbe the best place for us to all be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me extend the same courtesy to my \nchairman. She is my dear friend. We work very closely together on \nvirtually every issue. It is extremely unusual for us to disagree on \nany major issue. She and her staff have been great to work with, as \nalways. They have been very open. We have had an ongoing dialog. We \njust simply disagree about the way this issue needs to be dealt with.\n  Let me say that an indication of how complex this issue is and why \nthis issue is so important and why we don't need to have our \nconstituents expend money when they don't need to expend money that is \ngoing to be passed on to consumers of every single product virtually \nmade in America is this: There are a lot of people who have gotten up \non the other side and spoken about this amendment. I know they don't \nintend to get up here and make statements that are not correct. But \nfrankly, that is what we have heard. All I can attribute that to is the \nfact that this is such a complex issue, that the folks who have been \nspeaking about my amendment simply don't understand it.\n  Let me give some examples. We talk about large companies falling prey \nto derivatives. Large companies use derivatives in a very meaningful \nway that is advantageous to every single American customer. Everybody \nwho buys something--I don't care whether it is an automobile, a widget, \na drug--and every major manufacturer uses derivatives. They are very \nsophisticated individuals who deal in these products. They know what \nthey are doing. They are not falling prey to the use of these products.\n  There have been a couple folks who have said we don't have \ntransparency, that we ought to let these products come out of the \nshadows. Let me make clear--and I think the chairman will agree with \nme--100 percent of the transactions under our amendment would be out in \nthe open. There would\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\nbe a clearing of about 85 to 90 percent of all derivatives contracts \nunder our amendment. The others, the end users, the manufacturers, the \nenergy companies that go out and not only borrow money but buy coal or \nbuy natural gas and that want to have stability in their products, \nthose individual end users would be exempt from the clearing \nrequirement. But every single one of them would have to report every \nsingle contract to the CFTC or to the SEC, 100 percent transparency on \nevery single derivative.\n  I don't know why folks can't understand that in our amendment because \nit is pretty plain. I think Senator Gregg did a good job of explaining \nexactly how that is done.\n  Somebody said they don't want to return to old-fashioned capitalism. \nIf I am considered to be one who is promoting old-fashioned capitalism \nin my amendment, I plead guilty. Old-fashioned capitalism has made this \ncountry the strongest economy the world has ever seen. Old-fashioned \ncapitalism has an alternative. It is called socialism. I do not believe \nin socialism. I believe, if somebody wants to work hard and generate \nmoney to make a better quality of life for themself and their family, \nthey ought to have the opportunity to do so. That is what old-fashioned \ncapitalism is all about.\n  I could go on and on giving examples of things that have been said \nthat are out of context. Let's get down to the bottom line; that is, \nwho supports the underlying bill? Who supports the Dodd-Lincoln bill? \nThe simple answer is Wall Street. Why do I say that? At a hearing in \nthe Government Relations Committee last week, Goldman Sachs was called \nto the Hill to testify before Senator Levin and Senator Coburn's \ncommittee. Senator Coburn asked a question directly of the Goldman \nSachs agent and said: Do you support the underlying bill that is now \nbeing debated on the floor of the Senate? Without hesitation, he said: \nYes. Why would they support it? They are going to make a lot of money \noff this underlying bill. Why do I say they are going to make a lot of \nmoney? Who is going to clear these contracts? They are going to be \ncleared by clearinghouses owned by Wall Street banks.\n  Under the underlying bill, there is another provision that has not \neven been talked about today: Transactions are required to be executed \non what is called a swaps execution facility. It is a mini exchange. In \naddition to going to that swaps execution facility, that contract, \nafter that, has to go to a clearinghouse. So what you have is a party \nwho agrees with a manufacturer that they are going to enter into an \nagreement on a derivative for an interest rate, let's say. That entity \nthat has put that deal together is going to charge a fee. They would do \nthat anyway. That entity is also likely to be charged by the swaps \nexecution facility where the contract is executed. They are going to \ncharge another fee for doing that. Then they are going to have to go to \na clearinghouse that is going to charge another fee.\n\n  So it is pretty easy to see why Wall Street likes this provision, \nlikes the underlying bill, because they are going to make a lot of \nmoney in fees off these contracts.\n  The only other comment I wish to make, with reference to comments \nthat have been made, is whether these end users leave the U.S. markets \nand go overseas. There has been contention made that is not going to \nhappen. They are not going to do that. Well, they are. Other markets \nhave already indicated they are not about to follow our lead. The \nLondon regulator has openly said they will not follow our lead. We have \nheard nothing out of the Europeans, nothing out of Singapore. Why \nhaven't we? They are watching to see what we do. They are going to be \nsoliciting U.S. customers to go to their markets because our \nconstituents are not going to have to pay these huge fees in their \ncountries that are required under this bill.\n  It only makes sense that if they can generate more money for their \nbottom line and they can sit in their office in New York City, Atlanta \nor Moultrie, GA, and execute a contract in Singapore, where they don't \nhave to pay that fee, you better believe that is where they are going \nto go. They have no more risk. It is the same amount of risk. Is the \nCFTC or the SEC going to know they have done that? Absolutely not. It \nwill not be reported to them.\n  I could go on and on. At the end of the day, if you want to see 100 \npercent transparency and you want to see the end users in this business \nwho utilize these swaps and derivatives in a nonsystemically risky way \ncontinue to have access, then you need to support my amendment. If you \nlisten to the manufacturers across America that know because they have \nused these products for decades and have done so in a safe way and a \nway that provides a cheaper product for their consumer, you need to \nsupport my amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Chambliss amendment No. 3816, at \n5:30 p.m.----\n  Mr. SHELBY. It is 5:30 now.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. With no amendment in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote; that upon the disposition of the Chambliss amendment, the \nnext two amendments be the Reed amendment No. 3943 and the Sessions \namendment No. 3832.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Chambliss amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could have the attention of our \ncolleagues to give them some sense of things.\n  Senator Reed and Senator Brown of Massachusetts have an amendment \nwhich will take just a very few minutes to discuss, and then they would \nlike to have a vote on that, which we have agreed to. At the \nconclusion, that would be the last vote of the evening.\n  Then the next amendment would be the Sessions amendment. Senator \nSessions has agreed to debate his amendment tonight. We will vote on \nthat in the morning. Senator Specter would be the following amendment \nand we will debate his amendment this evening and vote on that tomorrow \nas well. Senator Collins, I know, has an amendment and she can debate, \nif she would, this evening and we will try and\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\nline that up in the morning so we have a series of votes when we come \nin.\n  So the last vote today would be on the Reed-Brown amendment, if \nMembers would stay around for just a few minutes to hear that, and then \nwe could be free of any more votes. At least that is the plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3943 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3943.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself and \n     Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3943 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a specific consumer protection liaison for \n      service members and their families, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 1219, after line 25, insert the following:\n       ``(e) Office of Service Member Affairs.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Director shall establish an Office \n     of Service Member Affairs, which shall be responsible for \n     developing and implementing initiatives for service members \n     and their families intended to--\n       ``(A) educate and empower service members and their \n     families to make better informed decisions regarding consumer \n     financial products and services;\n       ``(B) coordinate with the unit of the Bureau established \n     under subsection (b)(3), in order to monitor complaints by \n     service members and their families and responses to those \n     complaints by the Bureau or other appropriate Federal or \n     State agency; and\n       ``(C) coordinate efforts among Federal and State agencies, \n     as appropriate, regarding consumer protection measures \n     relating to consumer financial products and services offered \n     to, or used by, service members and their families.\n       ``(2) Coordination.--\n       ``(A) Regional services.--The Director is authorized to \n     assign employees of the Bureau as may be deemed necessary to \n     conduct the business of the Office of Service Member Affairs, \n     including by establishing and maintaining the functions of \n     the Office in regional offices of the Bureau located near \n     military bases, military treatment facilities, or other \n     similar military facilities.\n       ``(B) Agreements.--The Director is authorized to enter into \n     memoranda of understanding and similar agreements with the \n     Department of Defense, including any branch or agency as \n     authorized by the department, in order to carry out the \n     business of the Office of Service Member Affairs.\n       ``(3) Definition.--As used in this subsection, the term \n     `service member' means any member of the United States Armed \n     Forces and any member of the National Guard or Reserves.''.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I propose to make very brief remarks about \nthis amendment. My colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Scott Brown, \nwill make remarks. We would like to expedite a vote, but I would ask \nthat the yeas and nays on a recorded vote be taken when I conclude and \nwhen Senator Brown concludes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. It \nwould provide within the new office of consumer financial protection a \nmilitary liaison, an individual who is charged with protecting the \ninterests of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines as consumers.\n  Let me tell my colleagues--and I will elaborate later, but let me be \nvery brief and to the point. We have soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nmarines, and their families who are consistently exploited by \nunscrupulous car dealers, payday lenders--a whole panoply of people who \nflock around military bases to exploit these individuals. They are in a \nvery difficult situation. They have stress because they are on constant \ndeployments. In many cases, military families today have one spouse \ndeployed and one military spouse back taking care of children. I don't \nhave to go much further. The Presiding Officer understands this from \nhis dealings with the USO and families across the country.\n  Let me give my colleagues two examples. I could give you 200 \nexamples. If this was not true, it would be almost humorous, but it is \nsadly true. This is one I like. This is the ``free transportation to \nthe beach'' ploy. True story: A car dealer from Virginia Beach went to \nCamp Lejeune and offered free round trips to the beach. These are young \nmarines. If you have been to Camp Lejeune, you know it is not the Paris \nof North Carolina. It is a place where you need a little diversion. \nThey wanted to go to Virginia Beach. They were given this round trip. \nThey got to Virginia Beach. There was no round trip unless they bought \na car from this car dealer. Well, he was caught, lost his license, but \nreappeared later without a license, making the same ploy.\n  I wish to make a point. I am not condemning car dealers. In my home \nState, they are great. They do wonderful work for the community. But \nexploitation by car dealers of military personnel is a significant \nproblem. Seventy-two percent of military financial counselors recently \nsurveyed had counseled Servicemembers on auto lending abuses in the \npast six months.\n  One other example. Fort Riley, KS. Army Specialist Jennifer Howard \nbought a car while she was stationed there. It turns out the dealership \nwhich arranged her financing charged her for features on the car she \nnever got, such as a moon roof and alloy wheels. In her words:\n\n       The dealership knows that we're busy, we're tired. We don't \n     take the time, because we don't have a lot of time. It's like \n     get in, get out, do what we got to do. If we get taken \n     advantage of later, we'll deal with it then.\n\n  That is no way to treat soldiers. It is no way to treat consumers. \nThis liaison would be very important, but I should say it has to have \nthe authority within the bill to actually act against the disruptive \nbehavior of auto dealers, payday lenders, and a whole host of \nindividuals.\n  The rent-to-own people, they are trying to scam our troops. They are \ntrying to scam consumers.\n  Frankly, they don't care if you are wearing a uniform or not, they \nare out to scam who they can. We need to set up a strong consumer \nfinancial protection agency, and we particularly have to have somebody \nin there watching over the troops.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reed from \nRhode Island for his idea and his thoughtfulness in trying to protect \nour troops.\n  I want to discuss this amendment, as well. Senator Reed has a \ndistinguished career in both the Army and as a Senator. He has always \ndone his duty looking after the men and women not only of his State but \nalso those in uniform. I thank him for the opportunity to work on this \nparticular amendment with him.\n  As a 30-year member of the Army National Guard, I share Senator \nReed's interest and commitment to our Nation's soldiers and their loved \nones. As we all know, they make extreme sacrifices to keep us safe and \nkeep our Nation safe.\n  This amendment would dedicate resources within the new Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau to serve as a watchdog for military \npersonnel and their families.\n  As you know, our military culture of honor, courage, and commitment \ndemands prompt repayment of debts. As a result, payday lenders often \ncongregate outside military facilities. Unfortunately, the financial \nterms offered by these lenders are not always clear, not always offered \nup in free form, and typically lead to very expensive and bad loans. \nOther financial predators have sold military personnel bogus life \ninsurance policies.\n  These practices take advantage of our soldiers. Our young enlisted \nsoldiers are particularly vulnerable. They don't have the necessary \ntools, resources, guidance, and financial assistance to make their \ndecisions. They often spend time deployed far from their support \nnetworks at home, have steady paychecks, and promised pension benefits. \nAs a result, those financial predators see them as a way to make money.\n  As they risk their lives defending our Nation in places such as Iraq \nand Afghanistan, at home they also wear a big target on their back. If \na soldier gets into financial trouble with an unscrupulous lender, how \nis that soldier going to dispute those charges while\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\nthey are deployed or getting ready to be deployed? Debts can pile up \nquickly. This dedicated office would be able to help sort out the truth \nand get them back to financial stability.\n  This issue, as you know--and I am about to conclude--has received a \nlot of attention. Today, there was an article in the Washington Post \ntalking about how extra consumer protections are needed for our \nfighting men and women, citing the specific example of car dealerships \nemploying high-pressure tactics to trap military families into \nexpensive loans.\n  I urge colleagues to support this amendment, to put a cop on the beat \nto make sure our men and women in uniform have a chance to fight back \nagainst financial predators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I strongly support the amendment offered by our two \ncolleagues from New England, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and \nSenator Brown of Massachusetts. Both of these colleagues speak with \nsome authority on this amendment. Jack Reed is a graduate of West Point \nand served in uniform for our country for a number of years with great \ndistinction. Senator Brown has spent some 30 years in the National \nGuard in Massachusetts and also speaks with more than just passing \nauthority about the importance of the amendment they offer.\n  It is a very important amendment because it sets the table for a \ndebate tomorrow regarding a certain area of finance companies. The \namendment establishes an Office of Military Liaison within the consumer \nbureau we have created in the overall legislation.\n  In today's New York Times, there was a description of the case of \nMatthew Garcia, a 25-year-old Army specialist who was recently \nsubjected to a trick called yo-yo financing by an unscrupulous car \ndealer, just as he was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. According to \nthe story, Specialist Garcia, stationed at Fort Hood, TX, bought an \nautomobile at a used car lot and signed up for a loan at a 19.9-percent \ninterest rate. That is not even the abuse, believe it or not, as high \nas that rate is. The problem came when Specialist Garcia drove the car \nhome. The dealer called Specialist Garcia several days later to say \nthat the financing contract had actually fallen through and demanded an \nadditional $2,500 in cash. To make sure he paid up, the dealer blocked \nthe soldier's car in so that no one could leave. That is the way some--\nfew but some--auto dealers are treating our men and women in uniform. \nThat is why we need the Office of Military Liaison within the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau.\n  Unfortunately, the story of Specialist Garcia is not unique. It is \nall too common, whether it is in the area of auto financing, payday \nlending, mortgage lending, check cashing, these unregulated areas of \nfinance so many of our fellow citizens are subjected to on an hourly \nbasis, let alone a daily one.\n  Creating an office within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to \nfocus on the problems of our young men and women in the military and \ntheir families is an important contribution to this legislation. I \nthank both of our colleagues for offering this proposal.\n  The office we are creating with this amendment will help resolve many \nof the complaints brought to the office by our service men and women. \nIt will help advise the director of the bureau's rule writing to take \ninto account the special needs of military families. By doing this, it \nwill help our military readiness as well.\n  I have letters from the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the \nArmy, sent to me and to other Members, laying out the value of having \nsome protection within the automobile financing area.\n  It is important we have this language in the bill. Let me emphasize \nas well that unfortunately we are not talking about many auto dealers \nthat engage in financing that cause these problems, but, like most laws \non the books, if they were only written because there were a majority \nof people committing the offenses, it would be hard to make the case \nagainst them. But we don't write laws for the many; we write laws for \nthe few, those who will abuse their offices, abuse their operations in \nsuch a way as to cause harm to people who otherwise have no protection.\n  I have talked a lot about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nover the last number of days. The importance of this is that for the \nfirst time in the history of our country, individuals who are taken \nadvantage of in the financial services sector will have someplace to \nseek redress for the grievances to which they have been subjected. I \ndon't think this is a radical idea, particularly in light of what so \nmany of our fellow citizens have been through over the last several \nyears where homes have been lost, jobs lost, the tremendous abuse that \nhas occurred in too many of the areas of what I call the shadow \neconomy, the unregulated areas of our economy.\n  The most important purchase the average American makes is buying a \nhome, and we all know what can happen, as we have seen with brokers and \nmortgage lenders who were unregulated taking advantage of people by \ngetting them into situations they knew they couldn't afford. People say \nit ought to be buyer beware. I don't argue with that. Obviously, we all \nbear responsibility to be better informed about financial arrangements. \nBut to suggest this is a level playing field when it comes to home \nmortgages or car financing is to belie the facts. The analogy may not \nbe perfect, but it has some value.\n  We don't expect patients necessarily to be as well informed when they \nare making decisions about their health care. There is something called \nmedical malpractice. Obviously, we have an obligation to ask questions \nbefore we submit ourselves to surgery or other things. But we know in \nthe end that if a doctor has abused the Hippocratic Oath and put a \npatient at risk, there is an ability to seek redress of those harms. It \nis called medical malpractice. It allows a person who has been injured \nor harmed because of the misfeasance or malfeasance of someone in the \nmedical profession to get recovery. We understand it is not exactly a \nlevel playing field when the average person is trying to make \nintelligent decisions about their medical care.\n  The same could be said for mortgage lending. You can't expect the \naverage person to understand all of the details, necessarily, involved. \nI suggest there is a higher degree of responsibility in the area of \nmortgage financing by a borrower than there would be necessarily in the \ncase of medical malpractice, but nonetheless there are some legitimate \ncomparisons.\n  Some have suggested mortgage malpractice may be an appropriate \ndescription for what happens when you are across that table from a \nlender. You have picked out the home you have fallen in love with. Your \nfamily is excited about this new place. In many instances, it is the \nfirst home you are buying. The idea that you will have your own home to \nraise your family in is a very emotional time. That lender across the \ntable who is being unscrupulous in his or her behavior can extract \ncommitments, and so forth, from that borrower that could put them at a \ndistinct advantage. We believe in those instances there should be good \nunderwriting standards by law. And if there is some harm done through \nthe misfeasance or malfeasance of someone in the mortgage lending \nbusiness, you can get some redress when that occurs.\n  Car financing is not the same as a home mortgage, but if you are an \n18- or 19-year-old young person in uniform and you find that automobile \nyou love and you are so attracted to it--I am not suggesting borrowers \ndon't have a responsibility to be well informed--most Americans know \nwhat happens. All of a sudden, you end up like Specialist Garcia. You \nthink you have bought the automobile. And at 19, almost 20 percent \nfinancing, that in itself ought to be illegal. But the fact that you \nthen find you have a $2,500 extra charge and the wheels have been \nblocked so you can't drive away--that is the kind of individual who \nought not to be allowed to continue to operate under those \ncircumstances.\n  We believe when it comes to financing such as this we should not say \nto one sector: You are exempt; we will carve you out; you don't have to \nworry about any of the laws.\n  We make that local banker, who also might like to extend that loan, \nsubject to the law's protections. The credit union is subject to the \nsame laws. Why should someone engaged in the financing of a product--an \nautomobile--be exempt? The local bank isn't. They\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\nhave to meet their requirements under the law to make sure they are not \nabusing--not that many do but some do--the rights of an individual and \nprotect them from a disadvantage in that second largest purchase a \nperson may make aside from their home.\n\n  I know tomorrow there will be a debate. Senator Brownback will offer \nan amendment to exempt auto dealers and financing. Auto dealers are not \ncovered. If you are a dealer, you are not affected by this any more \nthan you are if you are a butcher or a dentist or any other retailer \nmerchant. If you are in the financing business, you are the one who is \nengaging in that contract despite the fact the papers may have been \nwritten up by some other lender that is doing business with the auto \ndealer. Shouldn't we provide to that individual the same kind of \nprotection they would expect if they went to the local bank, the \ncommunity bank to get a car loan or to the credit union to get a car \nloan? We require them to meet basic rules, not exaggerated rules but \nbasic protections so you are not taken advantage of.\n  I have a wonderful relationship with the auto dealers in my State. I \nfought hard for them last year. The program we had on the clunkers that \nallowed for people to turn in older automobiles, I fought hard for \nthat. I have a great relationship. In fact, they offered me a nice \naward last year for my efforts on behalf of auto dealers in my State. I \nam very proud of it. The overwhelming majority of my dealers, as I know \nis the case in all of our States, do a good job and are fair. They \nwouldn't be in business very long if they did not. But all of us also \nknow there are people who take advantage. Certainly to be exempt from \nany kind of rulemaking when it comes to protecting people ought not to \nbe the decision we are making.\n  Here we have the Reed-Brown amendment that says we will establish \nwithin the office of consumer financial protection an office to protect \nthe men and women in uniform from the abuses of people who would take \nadvantage of them. Then less than 24 hours later we write an exemption \nand take away one of the major problems these young men and women have. \nWhat an irony. What is this institution saying? On the one hand, we say \nour young men and women in uniform ought to be protected from people \nwho take advantage of them. Then less than 24 hours later we say: But, \nby the way, in a major area of abuse that occurs, you are exempt. Don't \nworry about it. The law doesn't apply to you. I am sorry, Mr. Community \nBanker. I am sorry, Mr. Local Credit Union. You will have to live by \nthe rules. So there is a great disadvantage at the local level. The \ncommunity bankers and credit unions are rightfully annoyed that they \nmay be subjected to one set of rules and the person down the street who \nfinances an automobile for an unsuspecting purchaser is exempt. That \ndoesn't make any sense to me.\n  I hope that tomorrow my colleagues will react as I am to this. Again, \nI am not in any way indicting automobile dealers--quite the contrary. \nThey have been through an awful lot. They have seen the struggle with \nmajor problems of the industry in this country. We made major efforts \nhere to get them back on their feet. I am proud to have been involved \nin that, to see to it we restore and maintain a strong manufacturing \nsector in our country of automobile dealerships and manufacturers. But \nto turn around at the local level and say: I will give you a pass on \nthose who would abuse the law and take advantage of people--in fact, it \nis an invitation to do it. It seems to me, by carving this out, we are \nnot just sending a message to those who are presently engaging in this \nbut to those who may decide this isn't a bad area of business in which \nto get involved.\n  The local bank has to meet those obligations and the local credit \nunion or some other financing operation covered under our legislation. \nNow we will no longer have shadow operators. We cover payday lenders. \nWe cover the check-cashing operations involved in financial services or \nproducts. But in the second largest purchase the average American ever \nmakes, you are going to be exempt from any of the laws involving \nconsumer protection when it comes to financing.\n  I know there is a lot of pressure, a lot of lobbying going on all \nover the place to carve out this exception. But I urge my colleagues to \nplease be careful about this, to walk in tomorrow and to basically gut \nthe Reed-Brown amendment by saying in this one major area of abuse--\nread the letter from Secretary Gates. Read the letter from the \nSecretary of the Army. Listen to our colleagues who are listening to \nthe people on their military bases in the respective States, what goes \non every single day by those who take advantage of people who are in \nuniform.\n  I urge my colleagues, tomorrow, when we have an opportunity to debate \nthe Brownback amendment, not be lured away from their support of \nputting an office within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and \nbasically gut the very bureau before the ink is dry on the amendment by \nallowing for a massive exception which would allow for consumers, \nparticularly men and women in uniform, to be taken advantage of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield to the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut. He \nwas aware that I was going to ask consent for 30 minutes for a colloquy \nbetween Senators Barrasso, Roberts, and myself, as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Berwick Nomination\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just make a few observations, \nand then I will turn first to Senator Roberts.\n  The subject we would like to discuss is the Berwick nomination to be \nadministrator of CMS. To be perfectly frank with you, I think many of \nus are alarmed by this nominee's focus on the British system, where \ngovernment makes decisions for people on their care. In fact, I am \nreminded of a decision by the Department of Health and Human Services \nthat I personally had a good deal of concern about last summer to limit \nthe dissemination of information by companies who were in the Medicare \nAdvantage business so that they could not communicate with their \ncustomers--clients--their opinions about legislation that would affect \ntheir product.\n  It was a stunning government gag order in effect saying to a \ncorporation: You are not free to discuss a public issue before the \nSenate and the House; we are going to tell you what you can say. It was \none of the most blatant examples of the government basically\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\nsquashing free speech as a condition for doing business with the \ngovernment.\n  Now we have this nominee who is applauding--applauding--a system \nwhere care is delayed, denied, or rationed. So I am particularly \nconcerned this attack on free speech is just a first step toward much \ngreater government intervention.\n  I will be talking with Dr. Berwick about his plans, but now I would \nlike to turn to Senator Roberts, whom I know has already spoken to Dr. \nBerwick, maybe as recently as today, to get his thoughts on this \nnominee for this very important position.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the distinguished Republican leader will yield, I \nwill be happy to respond.\n  First, I thank the distinguished leader and the doc from Wyoming, who \nis always bringing forward new and important information about the \nhealth care bill and some of the problems that we are experiencing with \nit, for allowing me to join in this colloquy.\n  We are talking about President Obama's nominee to be administrator of \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service--CMS is the acronym. Rest \nassured, every health care provider in America knows about CMS, and the \nnominee is Dr. Donald Berwick. I just met with Dr. Berwick and had an \nopportunity to hear some of his thoughts on the direction he thinks \nAmerican health care, and particularly Medicare and Medicaid, should \ntake.\n  He is a very affable, friendly doctor from Connecticut. He has a wide \nbackground in terms of health care. I have also been reading up on Dr. \nBerwick, who has a prolific record of statements and speeches and books \nthat further lay out his ideas for the future of health care. I \nrecommend everyone within the health care industry and every health \ncare consumer get hold of these speeches and these statements and, if \npossible books and read them.\n  Here is what I have learned. Dr. Berwick, I would tell the \ndistinguished Republican leader, is a huge fan, a major champion, and a \ncontributor to the British national health care system called NHS. As a \nmatter of fact, I have a quote of Dr. Berwick regarding the NHS.\n\n       I am romantic about the National Health Service; I love it. \n     The NHS is not just a national treasure; it is a global \n     treasure.\n\n  Well, I understand that people become very passionate about their \njobs, but romantic seems to me a little unique, but we will let that \ngo.\n  Now, why is this important? Because the NHS rations health care. The \nNHS denies and delays patient access to therapies in regard to breast \ncancer, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, kidney cancer, macular \ndegeneration--this happens to be my favorite example: patients required \nto go blind in one eye first before they get treatment for the other \neye--and brain tumors. A patient group coalition called the group that \nrations health care in Great Britain unfair and unacceptable.\n  The quote by Dr. Berwick is:\n\n       The decision is not whether or not we will ration health \n     care--the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes \n     open.\n\n  Consequently, I think the good Senator from Wyoming has something to \nsay about that in regard to rationing health care and the British \nsystem.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I agree absolutely with my colleague \nbecause that is exactly what is happening in the British health care \nsystem. It is delayed care, and delayed care, to me, equals denied \ncare.\n  This has been such a major topic for discussion among the people in \nBritain that it was brought up in the recent debate for the prime \nministership in the election, in the first televised debate ever. One \nof the questions that was asked of then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown was \nwhat about the National Health Service; people have to wait too long. \nHere is the quote. We have a transcript because I read about this in \nthe local papers and got the transcript. He talked about people with \ncancer.\n  Now, this is very important to me, Mr. President, because my wife \nBobbi is a breast cancer survivor. She was diagnosed in her forties as \na result of a screening mammogram. So we spend a lot of time thinking \nabout, talking about cancer, as do many families in this country.\n  Well, this is what he said about people who have cancer. This is \nGordon Brown answering the question, what about the National Health \nService and the long delayed time before treatment.\n  He said, ``They will also be able to know that their operation will \nbe in 18 weeks.'' Mr. President, 18 weeks, if you are a cancer patient \nin need of an operation--18 weeks for your cancer operation. That is \nwhat the Prime Minister of England is promising the people as an \naspirational goal. It makes you wonder how long is the delay right now.\n  So it is no surprise that the British medical journal, the Lancet \nOncology, in their August 2008 summary of statistics, says in every \ncategory Americans survive cancer at higher rates than patients in \nother developed countries. American cancer patients have a higher \nsurvival rate for every major form of cancer than patients in Canada \nand Britain. American women have a 35-percent better chance of \nsurviving colon cancer than British women. American men have an 80-\npercent better survival rate for prostate cancer. I have a list, cancer \nby cancer--breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer--and the \nsurvival rates are much better in the United States than they are in \nBritain. It is not that our doctors are any better, it is that the \ntreatment is more timely.\n  Imagine, Mr. President, being diagnosed with cancer and being told \nthat your operation will be coming in September. Here we are in May, so \n18 weeks from now--September--is when you will have your operation. All \nof that time the cancer can be growing. The cancer can be spreading.\n  As a patient in the United States, you may say: Do I really want Dr. \nBerwick? Do I want somebody who favors the National Health Service of \nBritain, someone who says they have incredible respect for the way it \nworks and thinks it is the right way to go? Would an American citizen \nwant that person to be in charge of Medicare and Medicaid for this \ncountry?\n  So I just have to respond to my colleague that, as a physician who \nhas practiced for 25 years, and as a husband of a wife who is a breast \ncancer survivor--who has had detection through a screening mammogram \nand then very rapid surgery, where there actually was the spread of the \ncancer from the breast to one of her lymph nodes--I think she is alive \ntoday because of the screening mammogram and the timeliness--the \ntimeliness--of her surgery and treatment in the United States.\n  I see the minority leader, and I see he is incredulous that we would \nbe considering that sort of a system and that sort of a director for \nMedicare and Medicaid in this country.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. And I would say to my friends that Wyoming and \nKansas and Kentucky have a lot of rural areas. One of the things that \nDr. Berwick has made very clear--and there was an article he wrote \ncalled ``Buckling Down to Change,'' in which he says there ought to be \na concentration of change, in which he says there ought to be a \nconcentration of services in metropolitan areas. He says most \nmetropolitan areas in the United States should reduce the number of \ncenters engaged in cardiac surgery, high-risk obstetrics, and neonatal \nintensive care services.\n  What he is really saying is narrow the specialties down to \nmetropolitan areas only. I just think of how that would work in a State \nsuch as mine. We have a city--Pikeville, KY, in the mountains--about \n2\\1/2\\ hours from the closest major city--Lexington. I wonder how it \nwould work in my State to have to drive 2\\1/2\\ hours to put a baby in a \nhospital's neonatal intensive care unit. I mean, clearly, what he is \ntalking about is major rationing of services.\n  That would be bad enough for the urban areas that are lucky enough to \nstill have the service at all, but for States such as Wyoming and \nKentucky and Kansas, where we have a lot of people in rural areas who \nare pretty far removed from major urban centers, we are talking about a \ncatastrophe, as I see it.\n  Senator Barrasso has practiced medicine for 25 years. I wonder what \nhis take is on that kind of approach.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My take is that it wouldn't work for Wyoming. But this \nentire health care bill--law, travesty--isn't going to work for \nWyoming. We look at the numbers, and the Congressional Budget Office \nsays 15 percent of hospitals in a few years are going to\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\nfind they are losing money and they can't stay open. People are going \nto have to travel long distances, very long distances, to get quality \ncare. Sometimes with weather and with winter, it is very difficult. So \nI have lots of concerns for all of the rural communities in this \ncountry because we have somebody from Boston, or the big city, who \ndoesn't think the way we do in Wyoming or Kentucky or in Kansas.\n  The other travesty of this is that the President of the United States \nhas been in office now for well over a year--almost a year and a half--\nand it is only just now he has nominated someone to be in charge of \nMedicare and Medicaid. I have continued to ask on this floor why that \nis. Why has the President intentionally refused to send a name to the \nSenate to be in charge of Medicare and Medicaid at a time when this \ncountry was debating health care legislation; at a time when the \nPresident was proposing cutting $550 billion from our seniors on \nMedicare; at a time when the President was pushing--cramming--into \nMedicaid another 18 million people?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If my friend will yield, some have believed the reason \nhe didn't want to send Dr. Berwick up during the health care debate is \nbecause it would confirm the obvious, which was the direction in which \nwe were headed and which Senate Republicans said repeatedly during the \ndebate on health care was the direction we were headed--and nobody has \nbeen more accurate on this issue than has Senator Roberts on the \nFinance Committee--which was massive rationing.\n  But it is hard to believe they had not decided to send the expert on \nrationing as soon as the debate was over.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the leader will yield, it is one thing to use the \nBritish health care system and be romantic about it, to quote Dr. \nBerwick, as an example for rationing, for practicing health care cost \ncontainment. It is another thing to do it by age, which is happening. \nBut it is rationing by region, which the leader has pointed out and Dr. \nBarrasso has pointed out, that should strike fear in the hearts of any \nperson living in any rural area in the country. His tenet for \nmodernizing the American health system is reducing what he calls ``the \noversupply of inventory.'' That is how he defines it. Dr. Berwick's \noversupply of inventory is, in truth, the rural patients' lifeline.\n  I know Dr. Barrasso understands that.\n  As the leader has said, in Kentucky--well, in Kansas, demanding a \npatient in Kansas drive 200 or 300 miles to Wichita or Kansas City or \nDenver so their infant can get proper care is ridiculous. I can foresee \na time when the rural health care system will consist of a bandaid and \na bed pan.\n  Dr. Berwick is the perfect nominee for a President whose aim has \nalways been to save money by rationing health care.\n  I would like to add, at this particular time, in addition to the \nrationing the good doctor talked about, the national health system in \nGreat Britain utilizes an end-of-life pathway to death; an end-of-life \npathway to death--that is a shocking description--that many British \ndoctors say leads to premature death in patients who could have \notherwise recovered.\n  To say that is noteworthy is unjust. It is egregious. Dr. Berwick's \nideas on end-of-life care seem to mirror this death pathway. The quote \nis: ``Most people who have serious pain do not need advanced methods; \nthey just need the morphine and the counseling that have been around \nfor centuries.''\n  This is a rather stunning statement, it seems to me. But it is very \nsimilar to President Obama's remarks about the elderly approaching the \nend of their life. The President has said that as you get older, \n``maybe you're better off not having the surgery, but taking the shots \nand the pain killer.''\n  The only thing missing in that is the walker.\n  Consequently, he has also remarked that ``the chronically ill and \nthose towards the end of their life are accounting for 80 percent of \nthe total health care bill out here.'' We know that. ``[T]here is going \nto have to be a very difficult democratic conversation that takes \nplace.'' That is the end of the quote by the President.\n  It sounds like this ``difficult democratic conversation'' has already \nhappened in the United Kingdom and that their pathway-to-death solution \nmirrors Dr. Berwick's and President Obama's ideas exactly.\n  But age rationing, as has been indicated, is not the only way to do \nit, as the leader has pointed out. We have regional discrimination as \nwell.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is interesting, looking at this whole thing, because \nwhat we see happening in Britain right now--they call it NICE, but \nthere is nothing nice about it--National Institute for Health and \nClinical Excellence--what Dr. Berwick has had to say about it is very \nmuch the opposite of what doctors who practice there have said. What he \nhas said about this system is that:\n\n       Those organizations are functioning very well and are well \n     respected by clinicians, and they are making their \n     populations healthier and better off.\n\n  But a London colon cancer specialist says:\n\n       A lot of my colleagues also face pressure from managers--\n\n  Managers in the British health system--\n\n     not to tell patients about new drugs. There is nothing in \n     writing, [he says] but telling patients opens a Pandora's box \n     for health services trying to contain costs.\n\n  So it gets down to not quality of care, not availability of care but \nthe cost of care.\n  Dr. Berwick says NICE is extremely effective and a conscientious, \nvaluable and--importantly--knowledge-building system.\n  This is what--someone--says:\n\n       Doctors are keeping cancer patients in the dark . . .\n\n  These are specialists, polled by Myeloma, United Kingdom:\n\n       Doctors are keeping cancer patients in the dark about \n     expensive new drugs that could extend their lives. . . .\n\n  So let's keep people in the dark rather than tell them what is there \nthat can help extend or save their life. That, to me, is not a system \nthat the American people want.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could I ask my friend from Wyoming, who practiced \nmedicine for 25 years, the Congressional Budget Office just said \nyesterday that this bill is going to cost $115 billion more than was \nportrayed on the Senate floor. Would it not be reasonable to assume, \nbased on this nominee's views on the issue of rationing, that it could \nbe that the way they intend to save that $115 billion, if they do, is \nwith massive and extensive rationing, by nominating an individual who \nhas expressed himself so clearly and unambiguously on the virtues of \nrationing? The exploding costs that everyone, the administration's own \nactuaries, the Congressional Budget Office, everybody who knows \nanything about the subject is weighing in, in the aftermath of the \nhealth care debate, and confirming the concerns that Senate Republicans \nraised during the debate, every single one of them has been confirmed \nby independent groups that this is the way they intend to cut costs.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I say to the leader, this isn't anything new. Dr. \nBarrasso has been predicting this for some time. Those of us on the \nFinance Committee and the Health committee, we got a double dose. \nDuring the health care debate, we tried to warn of the ``four \nrationers'' that were embedded in the bill. That is what we called \nthem. I made several statements on them. We have: the Patient-Centered \nOutcomes Research Institute, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, \nthe CMS Innovation Center, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n  Dr. Berwick was actually the vice chair of the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force until 1996. You may remember this, as Dr. Barrasso \npointed out, this was the body that recently ignited a firestorm by \nrecommending that women wait until age 50 before they receive a \nmammogram. That certainly angered many doctors in America, and whoever \nsaid that beat a hasty retreat.\n  We also warned that ObamaCare, I say to the leader and my friend from \nWyoming, will result in higher costs, not lower, a prediction not only \nby the CBO but by the bravest man in America, CMS expert, Richard \nFoster, who--it is amazing to me that he is still on the job, thank \ngoodness. He recently backed all that up, in terms of higher premiums, \nhigher cost, rationing, access to doctors by the elderly, and has \nrenewed his warning time and time again.\n  Now our predictions are coming true and President Obama's CMS \nnominee,\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\nDr. Berwick, will be the man who cuts health care costs by putting the \nrationing plans into practice. We will call it cost containment, but it \nwill be rationing.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in carefully reviewing the \nstatements and the speeches and the books and everything else that good \nDr. Berwick has stated in the last 30 years on rationing. I think if we \ndo that, most of us will agree he is the wrong man, wrong time, wrong \njob.\n  I thank the leader and the good doctor for allowing me to join in \nthis colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3879 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and call up amendment No. 3879, which is pending \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3879 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To mandate minimum leverage and risk-based capital \n     requirements for insured depository institutions, depository \ninstitution holding companies, and nonbank financial companies that the \nCouncil identifies for Board of Governors supervision and as subject to \n                         prudential standards)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LEVERAGE AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--\n       (1) Generally applicable leverage capital requirements.--\n     The term ``generally applicable leverage capital \n     requirements'' means--\n       (A) the minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to average total \n     assets, as established by the appropriate Federal banking \n     agencies to apply to insured depository institutions under \n     the prompt corrective action regulations implementing section \n     38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, regardless of total \n     consolidated asset size or foreign financial exposure; and\n       (B) includes the regulatory capital components in the \n     numerator of that capital requirement, average total assets \n     in the denominator of that capital requirement, and the \n     required ratio of the numerator to the denominator.\n       (2) Generally applicable risk-based capital requirements.--\n     The term ``generally applicable risk-based capital \n     requirements'' means--\n       (A) the risk-based capital requirements as established by \n     the appropriate Federal banking agencies to apply to insured \n     depository institutions under the agency's Prompt Corrective \n     Action regulations that implement section 38 of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Act, regardless of total consolidated asset \n     size or foreign financial exposure; and\n       (B) includes the regulatory capital components in the \n     numerator of those capital requirements, the risk-weighted \n     assets in the denominator of those capital requirements, and \n     the required ratio of the numerator to the denominator.\n       (b) Minimum Capital Requirements.--\n       (1) Minimum leverage capital requirements.--The appropriate \n     Federal banking agencies shall establish minimum leverage \n     capital requirements on a consolidated basis for insured \n     depository institutions, depository institution holding \n     companies, and nonbank financial companies identified under \n     section 113. The minimum leverage capital requirements \n     established under this paragraph shall not be less than the \n     generally applicable leverage capital requirements, which \n     shall serve as a floor for any capital requirements the \n     agency may require, nor quantitatively lower than the \n     generally applicable leverage capital requirements that were \n     in effect for insured depository institutions as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Minimum risk-based capital requirements.--The \n     appropriate Federal banking agencies shall establish minimum \n     risk-based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for \n     insured depository institutions, depository institution \n     holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified \n     under section 113. The minimum risk-based capital \n     requirements established under this paragraph shall not be \n     less than the generally applicable risk-based capital \n     requirements, which shall serve as a floor for any capital \n     requirements the agency may require, nor quantitatively lower \n     than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements \n     that were in effect for insured depository institutions as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Capital requirements to address activities that pose \n     risks to the financial system.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to the recommendations of the \n     Council, in accordance with section 120, the Federal banking \n     agencies shall develop capital requirements applicable to all \n     institutions covered by this section that address the risks \n     that the activities of such institutions pose, not only to \n     the institution engaging in the activity, but to other public \n     and private stakeholders in the event of adverse performance, \n     disruption, or failure of the institution or the activity.\n       (B) Content.--Such rules shall address, at a minimum, the \n     risks arising from--\n       (i) significant volumes of activity in derivatives, \n     securitized products purchased and sold, financial guarantees \n     purchased and sold, securities borrowing and lending, and \n     repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements;\n       (ii) concentrations in assets for which the values \n     presented in financial reports are based on models rather \n     than historical cost or prices deriving from deep and liquid \n     2-way markets; and\n       (iii) concentrations in market share for any activity that \n     would substantially disrupt financial markets if the \n     institution is forced to unexpectedly cease the activity.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am calling up tonight the amendment I \ndebated on the Senate floor on Monday, with Senator Dodd and other \nMembers who were present. This amendment would direct regulators to \nimpose strong risk- and size-based capital standards on financial \ninstitutions as they grow in size or engage in risky practices. I am \npleased to offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Shaheen, \nand Senator Brownback.\n  Our amendment is aimed at addressing the too-big-to-fail problem at \nthe root of the current economic crisis by requiring financial firms to \nhave adequate amounts of cash and other liquid assets to survive \nfinancial challenges without turning to the taxpayers for a bailout.\n  I note this amendment would ensure that the Nation's largest banks \nand bank holding companies are required to meet, at a minimum, the same \ncapital standards that are imposed on smaller community banks.\n  That is right. It may be odd to realize, but the fact is, under \ncurrent law, regulators can allow larger financial institutions to \nfollow capital standards that are actually less stringent than those \nthat are applied to smaller depository institutions. That makes no \nsense whatsoever, and that is why this amendment has the strong support \nof the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC \nChairman, Sheila Bair.\n  She has written me a letter endorsing this amendment. She points out \nit is a critical element to ensure that U.S. financial institutions \nhold sufficient capital to absorb losses during future periods of \nfinancial stress. ``It is imperative,'' she writes, ``that they have \nsufficient capital to stand on their own in times of adversity.''\n  This amendment would apply to some of our largest banks as well as \nbank holding companies, and it would also apply to nonbank financial \ninstitutions that are identified for supervision by the Federal Reserve \nby the new Financial Stability Oversight Council, established by the \nbill.\n  This council is the council of regulators that will be created so we \nhave an entity that would look across the economy to identify financial \ninstitutions and practices, risky practices that could pose a systemic \nrisk to our economy.\n  Since I did debate the amendment at length on Monday, I am not going \nto go on at length tonight, especially since there are others of my \ncolleagues who are waiting to speak. I would note that I have had a \nvery good discussion with the managers of the bill, and I look forward \nto working further with them in the hopes that we can schedule this \namendment for a vote tomorrow. I note this is a bipartisan amendment \nand that we have consulted at length with the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Chairman \nof the FDIC be printed in the Record, which letter further describes \nthe amendment and the need for it, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\n\n                                                   Federal Deposit\n\n\n                                        Insurance Corporation,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2010.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for your amendment number 3879 to ensure strong \n     capital requirements for our nation's financial institutions. \n     This amendment is a critical element to ensure that U.S. \n     financial institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb \n     losses during future periods of financial stress. With new \n     resolution authority, taxpayers will no longer bail out large \n     financial institutions. This makes it imperative that they \n     have sufficient capital to stand on their own in times of \n     adversity.\n       During the crisis, FDIC-insured subsidiary banks became the \n     source of strength both to the holding companies and holding \n     company affiliates. Far from being a source of strength to \n     banks as Congress intended, holding companies became a source \n     of weakness requiring federal support. If, in the future, \n     bank holding companies are to become sources of financial \n     stability for insured banks, then they cannot operate under \n     consolidated capital requirements that are numerically lower \n     and qualitatively less stringent than those applying to \n     insured banks. This amendment would address this issue by \n     requiring bank holding companies to operate under capital \n     standards at least as stringent as those applying to banks.\n       The crisis also demonstrated the dangers of excessive \n     leverage undertaken by large nonbanks outside of the scope of \n     federal bank regulation. Notable examples included the \n     excessive leverage of the largest investment banks during the \n     run-up to the crisis, and the extremely high leverage of \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. To remedy this and prevent \n     regulatory gaps and arbitrage, large nonbank financial \n     institutions deemed to be systemic must be held to the same, \n     or higher, capital standards as those applying to banks and \n     bank holding companies. Again, the amendment accomplishes \n     this goal simply and directly.\n       Finally, and more broadly, the crisis identified the \n     dangers of a regulatory mindset focused exclusively on the \n     soundness of individual banks without reference to the ``big \n     picture.'' For example, an individual overnight repo may be \n     safe, but widespread financing of illiquid securities with \n     overnight repos left the system vulnerable to a liquidity \n     crisis. A financial system-wide view requires regulators, \n     working in conjunction with the new Financial Services \n     Oversight Panel, to develop capital regulations to address \n     the risks of activities that affect the broader financial \n     system, beyond the bank that is engaging in the activity.\n       We at the FDIC remain committed to working with you towards \n     a stronger financial system. This amendment will be an \n     important step in accomplishing this goal.\n       If you have further questions or comments, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me or Paul Nash, Deputy for External \n     Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila C. Bair,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now send to the desk a modification of \namendment No. 3739.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3789, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as I understand, we had an agreement I \nwas going to call up an amendment and then it could be set aside, just \nto get it pending.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be set \naside and that amendment No. 3789 be called up as the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send a modification to my amendment \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I want to thank my colleagues for getting these \namendments pending. I would note that the amendment I called up is the \none to exempt auto dealers from the consumer financial products \ncommission created in this bill.\n  These are auto loans already covered under the bill by whoever is \ndoing the financing. If the auto dealers themselves are doing the \nfinancing, then they would be covered under the consumer financial \nproducts commission.\n  What this amendment attempts to do is say, let's regulate auto loans, \nbut let's regulate them by who is doing the loan, not just who is \nprocessing the paper.\n  It would be my hope that we would get the broad bipartisan support of \nmy colleagues. We do have bipartisan support for this amendment. I will \nlook forward to a full debate on it tomorrow. But in the interest of \ntime this evening I will not be talking further on it.\n  I am happy to enter into a time agreement with the managers on this \ntomorrow to debate and get this amendment for a vote tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 1004, between lines 11 and 12, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 929D. PRIVATE CIVIL ACTION FOR AIDING AND ABETTING.\n\n       Section 20(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \n     U.S.C. 78t(e)) is amended--\n       (1) in the subsection heading, by striking ``Prosecution \n     of'' and inserting ``Actions Against'';\n       (2) by striking ``For purposes'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Actions brought by commission.--For purposes''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Private civil actions.--For purposes of any private \n     civil action implied under this title, any person that \n     knowingly provides substantial assistance to another person \n     in violation of this title, or of any rule or regulation \n     issued under this title, shall be deemed to be in violation \n     of this title to the same extent as the person to whom such \n     assistance is provided. For purposes of this paragraph, a \n     person acts knowingly only if the person has actual knowledge \n     of the improper conduct underlying the violation described in \n     the preceding sentence and the persons role in assisting that \n     conduct.'.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have offered this amendment on behalf \nof quite a number of Senators--Senator Reed, Senator Kaufman, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Harkin, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, Senator Menendez, \nSenator Whitehouse, Senator Franken, Senator Feingold, Senator Merkley, \nand myself.\n  This amendment provides that the decisions of the Supreme Court of \nthe United States limiting claims under the securities acts for aiding \nand abetting will be overturned by this legislation.\n  This amendment is very similar to an amendment which was offered in \nthe 107th Congress by Senator Shelby, the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee. For many years, the federal law provided a private right of \naction against aiders and abettors.\n  As of 1994, every circuit of the federal courts of appeals had \nincluded civil liability in a private lawsuit under the securities \nlaws. In a radical departure in 1994, the Supreme Court held, in \nCentral Bank of Denver, that aiders and abettors are not liable in \nprivate suits.\n  The Court's 5-to-4 decision in Stoneridge in 2008 complicated the \nmatter even further, where the Supreme Court held that if the defendant \ndid not make representations directly to the person buying or selling \nthe securities, that the individual was not liable, even if he himself \nhad engaged in fraudulent conduct.\n  This is a subject I have long been interested in. Back in 2007, I \nwrote to President Bush concerning the failure of the Solicitor \nGeneral's office to file a brief that was requested by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission in the Stoneridge case. The Securities and \nExchange Commission was very concerned about that. I urged that the \nSolicitor General take action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter to the President \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the absence of civil liability is \nstriking in this situation, because there is criminal liability for \naiding and abetting under the federal criminal code.\n  I know of no situation where there is criminal liability for conduct, \nbut it does not give rise to a civil claim for relief or a civil cause \nof action. During a hearing on this subject, a very distinguished \nscholar, Professor Coffee of the Columbia Law School, pointed out how \nunusual that was in his experience, much broader than mine, that this \nwas anomalous.\n  In the case of Refco Securities Litigation, reported at 609 F. Supp. \n2d 304 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), Judge Gerald Lynch made the same point:\n  It is perhaps dismaying that participants in a fraudulent scheme who \nmay even have committed criminal acts are not answerable in damages to \nthe victims of the fraud. . . . There are accomplices and there are \naccomplices: after all, in the criminal context when the Godfather \norders a hit, he is only an accomplice to murder-one who ``counsels, \ncommands, induces or procures,'' but he is nonetheless liable as a \nprincipal for the commission of the crime. Likewise, some civil \naccomplices are deeply and indispensably implicated in wrongful \nconduct.\n  But on the current state of the law, there is no accountability for \ncivil damages for aiders and abettors.\n  Prof. John Coffee made this point in our hearing:\n  Does anyone really believe today that in this post-Madoff world, that \nthe SEC, by itself, can adequately deter most secondary participants in \nsecurities fraud?\n  Even when the SEC sues, moreover, its remedial authority is very \nlimited. It can neither recover losses for injured investors nor deter \nfraud in the first place.\n  A comparative impact of private lawsuits has noted that in the Enron \ncase, the private litigants recovered $7.3 billion, and the SEC \nrecovered $450 million. In the WorldCom case, private litigants \nrecovered $6.85 billion; the SEC recovered only $750 million. In the \nDynegy case, private litigants recovered $474 million, the SEC $198 \nmillion. In the AOL-Time Warner case, private litigants recovered $3.1 \nbillion, and the SEC recovered $360 million.\n  According to testimony given on my aiding-and-abetting legislation \nlast year before the Subcommittee on Crime, the SEC recovered a mere $8 \nbillion from security law violators since enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley \nin 2002, whereas the private litigants in Enron alone recovered $7.3 \nbillion. So the impact of the private lawsuits is very important.\n  We have seen the extraordinary impact of Wall Street fraud: the \nlosses of 6\\1/2\\ million jobs, the reduction of the gross national \nproduct enormously. This private right of action is a very important \npart of keeping Wall Street\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\nhonest with the litigation which it has produced.\n  There has been a letter filed by a number of entities in opposition \nto the amendment, headed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, raising a \npoint that, ``The provision would subject defendants to liability \nwhether or not they have any idea that the conduct they are assisting \nis wrongful.''\n  Well, that is a gross misstatement of what this bill does. This \namendment has been very narrowly drawn. It applies only to those who \nknowingly provide substantial assistance to the primary violator.\n  The scienter standard is more defendant-protective than the standard \nset forth in Senator Shelby's legislation which he introduced in the \n107th Congress. The scienter standard in the Shelby bill was \n``recklessness,'' not ``knowingly acted upon.'' The ``knowingly'' \nscienter standard in the amendment is identical to the restrictive \nstandard in 15 U.S.C. 78(t)(e) governing aiding-and-abetting actions \nbrought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  In order to eliminate any conceivable doubt, a modification has been \nadded to the amendment as originally filed, specifying: ``For purposes \nof this paragraph, a person acts knowingly only if the person has \nactual knowledge of the improper conduct underlying the violation \ndescribed in the preceding sentence and the person's role in assisting \nthat conduct.''\n  So, in essence, here we have a very tightly drawn amendment. It had \nbeen introduced earlier as S. 1551. I thank the distinguished chairman \nof the committee for his accommodation in listing this amendment for \nargument. This is a very important amendment. There are a lot of \namendments pending. But I do believe that among the matters to be \nconsidered in this bill, this is one of the most important. You have a \nlot of people very badly damaged by these security fraudulent actions. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is limited in personnel and \nstaff to act on them. These private rights of action have long been a \nsource of enormous aid in enforcing the law in antitrust cases and \nSecurities Act cases. Private prosecutions are enormously important.\n  By way of footnote, this is a subject of a law school comment that I \nwrote many years ago at Yale about the background for private action. \nIt is a very important supplement to what public officials and public \nagencies can do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2007.\n     The President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to express my concern \n     about the Solicitor General's failure to file a brief that \n     was requested by the Securities and Exchange Commission in \n     Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific Atlanta. The \n     outcome of Stoneridge will also determine whether tens of \n     thousands of Enron investors will secure a day in court. \n     Earlier this year, the SEC voted to file an amicus brief in \n     Stoneridge in favor of scheme liability, which is the same \n     position the Commission has previously taken in similar cases \n     in lower courts, including the Enron case. It has been \n     reported that the Solicitor General did not file the brief, \n     based on your views, and that the Solicitor General may \n     actually file an amicus brief arguing the opposite position \n     recommended by the SEC.\n       The SEC is an independent agency and its attorneys can \n     represent the agency in trial courts and courts of appeals. \n     The SEC, however, cannot represent itself at the Supreme \n     Court of the United States--it must convince the Solicitor \n     General to represent the SEC's position. Independence, when \n     used to describe an administrative agency, connotes \n     independence from the President and the ability to take \n     positions or engage in actions that do not necessarily \n     reflect the policies and views of the Administration.\n       Chairman Cox, in response to questions about the SEC's vote \n     to file an amicus brief in Stoneridge, stated at a \n     Congressional hearing on June 26, 2007, that the ``law has to \n     have some objective meaning. It can't be just a question of \n     how we all feel about it'' and that laws should not change \n     with the change in political composition of the Commission. \n     He explained that he did ``not think that there's anywhere \n     where it could be more important for there to be \n     predictability and clarity in rulemaking than when it comes \n     to our capital markets, because so much is at stake that \n     people have to make big bets on whether or not what they're \n     doing is the right thing to do. . . . I think we do a great \n     disservice when we are anything but clear and predictable, \n     rule-based and law-based.'' I agree with Chairman Cox.\n       On the issue of predictability in the law, I note what \n     happened to shareholders who were defrauded by Enron when \n     they brought a lawsuit charging certain Enron executives and \n     directors--along with the company's accountants, law firm and \n     banks--with violation of federal securities laws. The alleged \n     violations included massive insider trading while making \n     false and misleading statements about Enron's financial \n     performance. The shareholders reached a settlement with \n     several financial institutions, but while claims were still \n     pending against a number of additional institutions, in March \n     2007, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the \n     banks complete immunity from liability. The court \n     acknowledged that the banks' conduct was ``hardly \n     praiseworthy,'' but it ruled that because the banks \n     themselves did not make any false statements about their \n     conduct to the shareholders they could not be held liable, \n     even if they knowingly participated in the scheme to defraud. \n     In an extraordinary admission, the court acknowledged that \n     the ruling runs afoul of ``justice and fair play.'' The \n     ruling also is at odds with the position of the SEC, with its \n     wealth of specialized knowledge on the issues of contention \n     in both the Enron case and Stoneridge, and with rulings of \n     other courts.\n       The Solicitor General is entitled to aid the Court in its \n     interpretation of the law, and I applaud his close attention \n     to this critical case. I am concerned, however, that he has \n     been unable to articulate a legal position--either for or \n     against the plaintiffs--that is independent from the \n     Administration's policy preferences. As you have often said, \n     substantive changes to the law should be made through the \n     legislative process, not through the courts.\n       Thank you for attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 3823, 3932, and 3808 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if I may, that the \npending amendments be set aside and that it be in order to call up the \nfollowing amendments and that once reported by number, they be set \naside:\n  Senator Leahy's amendment No. 3823; Senator Durbin's amendment No. \n3932, and Senator Franken's amendment No. 3808.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, May 5, 2010, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, they say the proof is in the pudding. \nThe proof is an ultimate test of an idea or an evaluation. It literally \nmeans you can show us a wonderful recipe and tell us about the fine \ningredients, but we want to know what it tastes like in the end. The \nactual result is what is important. So I think the American people know \nthat in the bill we are dealing with today, we are still too involved \nin the maneuvering of the dissolution of companies that fail. We create \nspecial procedures for larger companies than we do for routine \ncompanies throughout the country. The pudding tastes bad.\n  My colleagues tell us this bill has the right ingredients, but the \nultimate result, I think, is to provide government-funded bailouts in \nsome way or another, through another name, actually now called orderly \nliquidation authority. I understand the provisions are better perhaps \nthan they were when the discussions began and are more rigorous in some \nways. I still feel more needs to be done to create the kind of \nintegrity and the consistency and the principled approach to \ndissolution of a failed corporation that good law requires.\n  The legislation before us provides the government with vast, sweeping \nregulatory authority. I know a lot of people in the country--and I \nrespect my good friend, Senator Dodd. He is such a fabulous Senator and \nso knowledgeable about these areas. But I talked to my car dealers and \nthey have to meet with State regulatory loan officers and they have \nalways had to deal with State legislation and control and certain \nFederal rules apply. But what this legislation does is, it is one more \nexample of an expansive mentality as far as fixing a discrete problem, \nwhich started out to be fixing Wall Street, too big to fail, and now we \nhave a historic alteration of the respect we get for State and local \ngovernment to manage lending matters. We have the Federal Government \nnow doing that under this consumer title. I am not sure we have fully \nthought that through. I don't think it is necessary, frankly.\n  Some of the regulatory authority that was involved in controlling \nfinancial institutions that were part of the financial crisis we faced, \nI think, was\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\nbecause this regulatory authority caused or failed to prevent the \ncrisis. It may have even made it worse. Instead of ending too big to \nfail, this legislation, I am afraid, institutionalizes it.\n  Professor John Taylor, the author of the Taylor rule, which, because \nit was violated, probably helped precipitate this crisis. If his rule \nhad been followed carefully by the Federal Reserve, I think we would \nhave had a far less serious problem than we had. He is a professor of \neconomics at Stanford University. He is well respected. He made this \npoint clear in a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal. This is \nwhat John B. Taylor, the Taylor rule author, observed:\n\n       The financial crisis of 2008 demonstrates why it is \n     dangerous for the orderly liquidation section of the Dodd \n     bill to institutionalize such a process by giving the \n     government even more discretion and power to take over \n     businesses.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The proposed liquidation process would have the unintended \n     consequence of increasing the incentive for creditors and \n     other counterparties to run whenever there is a rumor that \n     the government official is thinking about intervening.\n\n  He goes on to describe other reasons why he thinks the language as we \nhave it is unwise.\n  Peter Wallison, former general counsel to the Treasury Department, \nvoiced his strong opposition to the proposed legislation saying:\n\n       Not only does the Dodd bill establish too big to fail as a \n     national policy, but it makes the idea real by creating a \n     system for bailing out large financial companies if they get \n     into trouble. Of course, ``bailing out'' is not the phrase \n     used in the bill; the preferred language there is ``orderly \n     liquidation.''\n\n  So Mr. Wallison makes clear--I will not go on and quote all of his \nremarks, but he makes clear why he believes this is a dangerous \ninstitutionalization of special privileges for large companies. I think \nthe Dodd amendment signals to creditors they will get a better deal if \nthey lend to the big regulated firms, and this is what Mr. Wallison \nsays:\n\n       They believe they will get a better deal if they lend to \n     the big regulated firms rather than lending to the small \n     competitors. The bill does this by making it possible for \n     creditors to be fully paid when a too-big-to-fail financial \n     firm is liquidated, even though this would not happen in \n     bankruptcy.\n\n  Mr. Wallison hits the nail on the head, I am afraid. Select \ncreditors--those with good lobbyists or those otherwise deemed too big \nto fail--will definitely get a better deal under the backroom process \nof orderly liquidation than they would in bankruptcy.\n  Let me be clear. The unhealthy government connection to Wall Street \ncan only be eliminated, I think, through the legitimate utilization of \nhistoric bankruptcy process. ``Orderly liquidation,'' as defined here, \nwill not achieve the result.\n  When the legislation was first introduced, Senator Leahy wrote the \nJudicial Conference of the United States--that is the Chief Justice and \nhis Judicial Conference group of judges there--and asked him for their \nviews on the legislation. The Judicial Conference responded that the \nbill failed the ultimate test. They said:\n\n       This is a substantial change to bankruptcy law because it \n     would create a new structure within the bankruptcy courts and \n     remove a class of cases from the jurisdiction of the \n     Bankruptcy Code. The legislation, by assigning to the FDIC \n     the responsibility for resolving the affairs of an insolvent \n     firm, appears to provide a substitute for a bankruptcy \n     proceeding.\n\n  That is a significant statement. This is the Supreme Court, the \nJudicial Conference, giving us their insight into this.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       This could be especially problematic if creditors have \n     changed position based on rulings in the course of the \n     bankruptcy proceeding. The legislation does not envision--\n\n  Let me continue to quote this:\n\n       The legislation does not envision objection, participation, \n     or input from the bankruptcy creditors whose rights will be \n     affected in the course of appointing the FDIC as a receiver.\n\n  In other words, the normal process by which creditors and others can \nparticipate, object, cross-examine, is cut short.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Indeed, the legislation proposes to deal with this petition \n     in a sealed manner--\n\n  Not in a public, open manner, where lawyers cross-examine witnesses \nunder oath, but in a sealed manner, the Judicial Conference says.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Only the Secretary and the affected financial firm would be \n     noticed and given the opportunity of a hearing. The financial \n     position of affected creditors may have been changed within \n     the context of the firm's bankruptcy case in such a way that \n     the creditors' rights may have been changed dramatically.\n\n  They go on to say this could raise constitutional questions. They \nsaid:\n\n       Any resulting due process challenges--\n\n  They are talking about the due process clause of the U.S. \nConstitution--\n\n     would impose a significant burden on the courts to resolve \n     novel issues.\n\n  In addition, they go on to say this:\n\n       We note that petitions under this title involving financial \n     firms would be filed in a single judicial district.\n\n  Delaware.\n\n       The Judicial Conference favors distribution of cases in \n     other courts.\n\n  Well, I think the Judicial Conference is making clear one thing in \nits correspondence. Bankruptcy, with its rules and procedures, not \norderly liquidation authority, is the best way to approach dissolving a \nfinancial institution. We are not talking about banks. Banks would be \nstill contained within the FDIC. They have a long history of being able \nto resolve banks in financial trouble. But I think--I can only say I \nshare the opinion of the Judicial Conference. I think it is shared by a \nnumber of presidents of the Federal Reserve banks.\n  In recent testimony on a panel before the Joint Economic Committee, \nCharles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of \nPhiladelphia, stated the following:\n\n       I believe the most credible way to do this would be to \n     amend the bankruptcy code to deal with nonbank financial \n     firms and bank holding companies. Expanding the bank \n     resolution process established under the FDIC Improvement Act \n     as the current Senate bill does would give regulators and \n     policymakers the opportunity to exercise a great deal of \n     discretion in a liquidation or restructuring to reward some \n     creditors and not others. A bankruptcy proceeding would \n     follow the rule of law and thus would be less susceptible to \n     manipulation by private parties or the political process.\n\n  So that is the opinion of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank \nof Philadelphia. Does anybody think that dissolution of GM and other \ncompanies and all the things they have gone through was not politically \nmanipulated? Anybody who has closely followed it does, and that is one \nof the things that outraged Americans. They are angry that big \ncompanies got special procedures for their failure to pay their debts, \nwhere the average small company, mid-sized company, even large company \nin America would be subject to the rigors and the fairness and the \norder of established bankruptcy law.\n  So the president of the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia said it would \nbe less susceptible to manipulation by private parties for the \npolitical process. Amen. That is true. You get a bankruptcy judge, he \nhas a 14-year term. They are used to handling these cases, and they can \nhandle them. Mr. Plosser goes on to say, limiting government choices \nand leaving resolutions to the rule of law and the court system, in my \nview, is the best way to end bailouts--limit unhealthy risk taking and \nextinguish the notion that some institutions are too big to fail. That \nis what the president of a Federal Reserve bank said. I could not agree \nmore. That is why I have introduced the Bankruptcy Integrity and \nAccountability Act, which I believe we will be able to vote on \ntomorrow.\n\n  There is no greater legal system than the one we have in America. It \nis a system that is admired not only because it is efficient, in most \ninstances, but because it is fundamentally fair. You know when you walk \ninto a courtroom that you are going to get the same treatment as other \nparties, whether you are a mom-and-pop organization or big AIG. The \namendment I have offered would provide that same type of security.\n  One issue that has been raised by a number of experts is a lack of \nconfidence in the FDIC to adequately handle these kinds of \ndissolutions. I share those concerns. Professor Wallison stated:\n\n       The absence of any expertise in resolving failed nonbank \n     financial institutions anywhere in the Federal Government is \n     one strong reason for relying on bankruptcy for\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\n     most failures. If there is likely to be expertise anywhere in \n     resolving failed financial institutions, it would be in the \n     bankruptcy courts.\n\n  I agree. Bankruptcy as the first choice for disposing of a failed \nnonbank financial institution would avoid a number of problems. These \nare problems that are associated with creating a government resolution \nauthority. Governments are, by nature, political. It would assure that \nthe prebankruptcy creditors take losses of some kind, avoiding the \nmoral hazard and maintaining market discipline. In other words, if you \ndon't feel like and don't have to take a loss by an improvident \ninvestment, it encourages you to make more risky investments, creating \ndanger of more improvident financial activities in the future. The \nrules will be known in advance under bankruptcy. So creditors will be \naware of their rights as well as the risks.\n  Creditors will decide whether they believe a company has prospects to \nrepay them, and it would outweigh the risk of throwing good money after \nbad in helping maintain the company in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy judges \nlook forward and try to save companies. They stop litigation that can \nshut down a company. They give the company a chance to reorganize and \nsucceed and pay all their creditors. That is always their goal. But \ngood bankruptcy judges know from history that many companies can't be \nsaved. The best thing to do is shut them down before they lose anymore \nmoney and distribute the remaining assets equally and fairly according \nto established rules of priority as part of the bankruptcy process. \nThat is what bankruptcy is.\n  In the amendment I have offered, we make sure the necessary expertise \nfor dissolving these institutions is available. We allow the Federal \nStability Oversight Council, the proper functional regulator, the \nFederal Reserve, and the Department of Treasury to file legal briefs in \nthe court if they need to to make sure their voice is heard concerning \nrelevant issues. This would allow the court to gain valuable \ninformation and insight. We also concentrate Federal bankruptcy \nexpertise by limiting venue in the cases to the 12 districts with the \nFederal Reserve Banks. This is something we vetted with professors and \nbankruptcy experts. Harvey Miller, the renowned bankruptcy expert, \nlooked at this provision and told us he believes it is properly \ntailored to provide the necessary expertise to address these types of \ncases.\n  I believe it is something the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates would agree is better than limiting it to just one court--a \nsituation they raised as problematic. On substance, I think we can't \noveremphasize how the resolution authority fails the ultimate test.\n  Professor David Skeel wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street \nJournal with Mr. Wallison on April 7 of this year, in which they asked \nthis question:\n\n       Which system is more likely to eliminate the moral hazard \n     of too big to fail?\n\n  They concluded that bankruptcy was the answer. They posit:\n\n       In a bankruptcy, as in the Lehman case, the creditors \n     learned when they lend to weak companies, they have to be \n     careful. The Dodd bill would teach the opposite lesson.\n\n  Let me highlight for my colleagues what I believe this amendment does \nand why I think it is necessary.\n  First, the amendment protects against systemic risk by eliminating \nthe moral hazard that arises when financial companies and their \ninvestors think the government will bail them out. Under the Dodd \napproach, the approach of this legislation, financial company \nmanagement and shareholders could have an incentive to seek resolution \nauthority, thus gaining access to taxpayer bailouts. Under the \nBankruptcy Integrity and Accountability Act, which I have offered, the \nonly option for insolvent companies would be through the bankruptcy \nprocess, and they can survive bankruptcy. But if they are not able to \nsurvive it, they should not survive it. That process would be either \nreorganization or liquidation.\n  There is a process for that to be established. Under this system, all \ncosts of reorganizing or liquidating a company are paid by the private \nsector, by the failing company, and those who chose to do business with \nthe failing company.\n  Thus, unlike under the Dodd bill, there will be no federally \nadministered resolution authority with access to bailout funds, or \nborrowed money from the Treasury, Federal debt guarantees, or any other \nkinds of tool that politicians might access to bail out some \npolitically empowered private company, and to avoid the day of \nreckoning that rightly should fall upon companies who can no longer \noperate effectively.\n  Under this bill, there will be no Federal Reserve section 13(3) \nauthority with which the Fed can pump taxpayer money into firms to \nrescue them from insolvency.\n  The second way this amendment would reduce systemic risk is by \nprotecting against the threat that derivatives contracts will cause one \ncompany's failure to cascade through the financial sector like falling \ndominoes. Under the current Bankruptcy Code, derivatives contracts are \nexempt from the automatic stay that prohibits the collection of debts \noutside the bankruptcy court. Virtually all other debts are stayed when \nthe bankruptcy process occurs. As a result of this event, derivatives \ncounterparties can demand collateral and satisfaction of the debt, and \nit can create a run on a failing companies' assets as more and more \nderivative counterparties demand their collateral. Because of the \ninterconnectedness of financial firms and the derivatives holdings, a \nrun on the failing firm's assets can cause failure to cascade through \nthe financial system as party after party becomes exposed to succeeding \ndemands on collateral. This is a problem that has been raised. This \namendment would stop that danger by allowing debtors, with the consent \nof a new Federal Stability Oversight Council, to invoke the automatic \nbankruptcy stay against derivatives obligations when the facts show \nthat the debtor's failure could genuinely trigger cascading systemic \nrisk. This would alter bankruptcy law to deal with these large \nfinancial institutions, where derivatives can play a complicating \nfactor, and this would give the kind of discretion I think would help \navoid that.\n  Finally, the Bankruptcy Integrity and Accountability Act would reduce \nsystemic risk because a new chapter 14 bankruptcy procedure will apply \nto all nonbank financial institutions regardless of the size. Under the \nact, everyone will get the same protection. Nobody will have access to \nspecial Washington favors. This, too, protects against systemic risk. \nUnder the approach of the Dodd legislation, there will be special rules \nfor those companies that are wealthy and powerful enough to be \ndetermined too big to fail. Those special rules will include a publicly \nfunded and government-administered resolution authority that affords \nthe financial firms the right to fail without facing under oath their \ncreditors and without bearing the costs of the proceedings. Also \nincluded will be the right to access taxpayer funds for the payment of \ncertain private debts of the firm.\n  This special system, created by the bill before us, would create \nincentives for smaller companies to consolidate until they, too, are \ntoo big to fail. As a result, risk would be concentrated even more so \nin a few hands that the failure of one company can threaten to bring \ndown the entire financial system. In place of this created system under \nthe Dodd legislation, a system that protects large companies more than \nall others, our amendment would create a fair and equal system for the \nfailure of all financial institutions, regardless of their size. As a \nresult, financial institutions would have no incentives to become \nlarger, and thereby increasing the risk that one company's failure will \ncause the failure of the entire financial sector.\n  There is one critical aspect of the bankruptcy process that we can't \noverlook and cannot be overstated. When people loan money to or buy \nstock or buy bonds in a corporation, or otherwise provide credit, they \nhave an expectation that if that company fails to prosper and is unable \nto pay all the debts the company owes, that the company at least will \nbe hauled into bankruptcy court, and they will have an opportunity to \npresent their claims and to receive whatever fair proportion of the \nmoney that is still left in the company as their payment.\n  It may be 10 cents on a dollar, or it may be 90 cents. They \nunderstand that\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\nbankruptcy judges have the authority to allow the company to continue \nto operate, to stay or stop people from filing lawsuits against the \ncompany to collect debts, to allow the company a period of time to \noperate, to evaluate whether they can pay off more debtors by \ncontinuing to operate than shutting the company down. If a bankruptcy \ncourt sees the company is so badly in financial crisis that it is going \nto collapse anyway, the court can shut it down immediately before they \ncan waste assets and rip off even more people. That is what a \nbankruptcy court does every day.\n  The Judicial Conference letter I referred to earlier notes that under \nthe resolution process, some other problems might arise. They note \nthis:\n\n       The legislation does not envision objection, participation, \n     or input from the bankruptcy creditors (whose rights will be \n     affected) in the course of appointing the FDIC receiver.\n\n  It does this in a way unlike the classical way that company officials \nhave to respond when their companies fail. What happens? The creditors \nall gather. The bankruptcy petition is filed, voluntarily or \ninvoluntarily, by the creditors. They are hauled in by a Federal \nbankruptcy judge who has a 14-year term and specializes in bankruptcy \nmatters. They are required to produce records and documents of the \nfinancial condition of the company. The CEO is called in to testify \nunder oath. The bondholders, the stockholders, the creditors, secured \nand unsecured, the employees, and the workers all get to have lawyers, \nand they examine the witnesses who can be called. They can call their \nown witnesses and, in the result, you create a factual record that \nhelps set the groundwork for the orderly priority setting of who is \nentitled to payment of the limited amount of money in the corporation.\n  This is what they do every day. This is what ought to happen. \nExecutives prefer not to have to do that. They prefer, like AIG, to go \nover there and meet with the Federal Reserve, or with the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, and sit down and wheel and deal and get $70 billion. And \nnobody is under oath, that I can see. None of this is done publicly, as \nit is in a bankruptcy proceeding. They get to continue to operate and \nhave their fat salaries, when any other company would be out of there \nand would cease to exist.\n  This is the problem that upsets the American people, and they are \nright to be upset.\n  We do not need to provide special treatment for the people who \ncreated the financial crisis that has damaged this country for the next \ndecade probably, and set off ramifications worldwide. I know a lot of \nthis was systemic irresponsibility by a lot of people, but I have to \nsay, the failure of these executives to manage their companies \ncorrectly--there are letters to this. They do not need to be provided a \nsweetheart process by which they can get money from the Treasury and \nkeep their companies going and not be subjected to the same \nexamination, the same requirement to produce documents and records to \njustify their existence that average corporations do. They need \nbankruptcy.\n  I believe America would be better if we do that. I believe our \neconomy will be stronger and that there will be more certainty in the \nprocess. If they fail, they fail. If they loan money to a company that \nfails, they may lose some or all of it. That is just the way it is. It \nhappens every day.\n  But some people on Wall Street convinced themselves and they \nconvinced politicians and government officials that they were too big \nto fail. They were so large and were so important that they could not \nbe treated like everybody else; they needed to be bailed out. The \npeople who regulated them and the Secretary of the Treasury, a Wall \nStreet maven himself, a Goldman Sachs guy, and others, met in secret \nand plotted this thing out and got us to pass legislation in Congress \nthat said--my wife corrects me. She said: Quit saying ``got us'' when \nyou voted against it. I voted against the legislation. Congress passed \nlegislation to allow the Secretary of the Treasury to buy toxic \nmortgages and assets from bad banks that were in trouble--in a state of \npanic, if you want to know the truth.\n  What did they do? Ten days later they bought an insurance company, \nAIG. They put $70 billion in it, totally contrary to what we were told \njust a few days before and without the slightest hint of embarrassment.\n  The legislation we passed, the $700 billion TARP bailout, was the \ngreatest abdication of congressional responsibility in the history of \nthis Republic. We have never given one man--the Secretary of the \nTreasury--the power to deal with his friends and have $700 billion to \ndeal with. It is an outrage really. That is why people are upset, and \nthey have a right to be upset. I am upset.\n  All I am saying is, we have a regular process for dissolution of \ncompanies that get in trouble. If they cannot pay their bills, they \nought to fail like any other company, and the big guys on Wall Street \nshould not be given special treatment. This legislation will end \nbailouts and will put them in the same process that any corporation in \nAmerica would be in if they failed to pay their debts in a responsible \nmanner.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the amendment. Remember that \nbankruptcy is a favored process by the Federal Reserve people, that the \nJudicial Conference of the United States Federal courts has raised \nquestions about this legislation as it presently exists. I think the \nprincipled and appropriate way to deal with the dissolution of failed \ncompanies is through the bankruptcy process. Unlike orderly \nliquidation, bankruptcy passes the ultimate test. I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at some point fairly soon, I hope to be able \nto--at the request of the authors of the two amendments--propose two \namendments I believe will be accepted. In fact, I know they will be \naccepted on a voice vote. There is some language being worked out. That \nwill come before we adjourn for the evening.\n  We have also laid down--I believe there will be nine amendments \ntomorrow, equally divided between the minority and the majority, \nincluding the amendment we just heard proposed by my good friend from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, along with others. It will be a busy day \ntomorrow.\n  Today we have done eight amendments, by the time we are finished, \nwhich is a good day's work. Obviously, more needs to be done. Five of \nthem were done by recorded votes and three by voice votes. We hope they \nwill be voice-voted.\n  I want to take a minute or so, if I may, to express my feelings about \nthe Sessions amendment. First of all, I am joined in these sentiments \nby the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, who opposes \nthe Sessions amendment as well. Let me explain why I oppose this \namendment.\n  I say this respectfully of Senator Sessions, who is a good friend. I \nnoticed in his remarks he did not cite any bankruptcy lawyers opposed \nto the provisions in the bill. I am not terribly shocked that \nbankruptcy lawyers would be opposed to a provision in the bill short of \nbankruptcy, although the presumption is bankruptcy in titles I and II.\n  If my colleagues remember, it was the Shelby-Dodd amendment which we \nvoted on a week ago--several days ago--that took care of the concerns \npeople had about title I and title II of the bill which deals with the \nresolution mechanisms. Senators Corker and Warner worked very hard on \nthose two provisions of the bill, as other members of the committee \ndid. I want to briefly describe why those provisions are important and \nwhy they should remain intact.\n  Of course, we voted as a Senate 93 to 5 in favor of the Shelby-Dodd \namendment, codifying the perfections, as Senator Shelby described them, \nin those two titles.\n  I oppose the Sessions amendment to strike the language creating an \norderly liquidation authority, language, as I said, that Senator Shelby \nand I crafted together in order to end the too-big-to-fail argument \nonce and for all. Most nonbank financial firms, including large and \ncomplex ones, will go through the normal bankruptcy process if they \nfail, and they should. That is the presumption in the bill.\n  The new liquidation authority Senator Shelby and I crafted should be\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nused very rarely. It is a painful process to go through and would \ncertainly not be the avenue of choice given the implications. We have \nput in some very high hurdles to trigger its use, including judicial \nreview.\n  Moreover, the advance warning systems that we have included in our \nbill, and the tough new standards we impose on large financial \ncompanies, will put in place speed bumps so these companies slow down \nand become less risky and, therefore, avoid the very issue of \nbankruptcy or resolution. Early on we try to minimize those events from \noccurring.\n  When there is a financial crisis, however, bankruptcy may not be the \nbest option. The experience of 2008, especially the bankruptcy of \nLehman Brothers and its disastrous effects on our financial markets and \nour economy, has taught us we need a workable alternative to bankruptcy \nfor the largest, most interconnected financial firms and that the \nalternative could not and should not be a bailout. Given the choices \nnow, it is just bankruptcy or bailout. We tried to create an \nalternative under rare circumstances for a resolution mechanism.\n  Throughout 2009, the Banking Committee heard testimony from \nadministration and other financial regulators, experts, stakeholders, \nand others who all agree the bankruptcy framework is poorly equipped to \nprotect the Nation's financial stability if a very large and complex \nand interconnected financial firm goes under.\n  Why do we say that? It can be with a large financial firm that is \ninterconnected there are many good, solid firms--it may be that a large \ninterconnected firm will have an effect on some very solvent, well-run \nfirms. Bankruptcy could bring all of these well-run companies down to \ntheir knees. None of us wants to be part of that. So we need an \nalternative other than just bailing out that firm when confronted with \nthat kind of a choice.\n  If the only two choices are bankruptcy, which could take a lot of \nfirms and businesses that are solid, well run, well managed, producing \njobs, contributing to our economy--that is the alternative. Those firms \nthen would be adversely and, unfortunately, affected through a \nbankruptcy process or bailout. Of course, no one wants to write a check \nfor $700 billion again to bail out firms that are failing. The idea of \na resolution mechanism under rare circumstances is the alternative \nchoice which we collectively--Democrats and Republicans--after the long \nwork of this committee believed was the alternative in our bill.\n  The Sessions amendment fails to recognize the fundamental difference \nbetween the new liquidation authority and bankruptcy. The new \nliquidation authority is intended to be an emergency exception to \nbankruptcy. The presumption, again, is bankruptcy. That is where we \nbegin. But if under these rare circumstances that alternative would do \nmore damage to the overall economy, despite our feelings about a \nmismanaged company, we need to have an alternative.\n\n  The new liquidation authority is intended to be an emergency \nexception to bankruptcy when necessary to protect the financial \nstability, the overall stability of the United States, and not to \nprotect irresponsible creditors.\n  The Sessions amendment, like today's bankruptcy framework, is focused \non protecting and repaying creditors of a failed financial firm. It \ndoes not provide the tools we need to protect taxpayers from the \ndevastating effects of the next Lehman Brothers. That is why Senator \nShelby and I sought to create a liquidation process that would provide \nfor the orderly wind-down of large, complex financial institutions, \nwhile still forcing shareholders to be wiped out, culpable management \nto be fired, and creditors to bear losses, in addition to a prohibition \nagainst those very managers who caused the failure from being involved \nfor years afterwards in the financial services sector of our economy.\n  That is a rough road--shareholders get wiped out, creditors suffer, \nmanagement gets fired, and they are banned from being involved in \nfinancial services. That is tough medicine if, in fact, they go the \nresolution route under our bill. But we need to have at least some \nmechanism other than just the two terrible alternatives of bankruptcy, \nthat could cause broader financial problems, or a bailout. This is why \nSenator Shelby and I sought to create this liquidation process.\n  Any payments under our bill to creditors above liquidation value will \nbe clawed back, and large financial companies will be assessed, as \nnecessary, to ensure that taxpayers do not lose a penny.\n  You may recall the debate we had about prepayment or postpayment. We \nhad originally, at the suggestion of my Republican colleagues, a $50 \nbillion upfront assessment on large institutions. Then there was a \nchange of heart by many, and they said: No, you cannot have that out \nthere because that looks like you are providing for a resolution \nmechanism rather than bankruptcy; the optics of that do not look good. \nI was never overly committed to that idea. The only reason I included \nit in the further draft of the bill is because I thought it brought \nRepublican support to the legislation.\n  The irony is, some of the very people who were advocates of it one \nday changed their minds. So we took it out of the bill.\n  The thing I wanted to make sure of was that taxpayers would not be \nexposed. The House-passed legislation has $150 billion in a prepayment \nfund. Again, I heard my good friend from Massachusetts, the chairman of \nthe House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, say he would like \nto take it out as well in light of some of the allegations made about \nthe bill. We took that out. I know my colleague from Alabama referenced \nthat and may not have been aware that was one of the provisions in the \nShelby-Dodd amendment, to remove that prepayment fund created in the \nearlier draft of the bill.\n  Striking the orderly liquidation authority, as the Sessions amendment \nwould, would do just the opposite of what the amendment's sponsors \nintend. It would ensure we face a repeat of the unacceptable choices \nbetween a disastrous bankruptcy where innocent, solvent, well-run \ncompanies could be caught in the vortex and drawn down and destroyed in \nthe process or writing that big check that Americans are furious over. \nSo we created this resolution authority to be used under very rare \ncircumstances.\n  The Senate, of course, supported our proposal, the Shelby-Dodd \napproach, by a vote of 93 to 5. I urge my colleagues, both Democrats \nand Republicans, to reaffirm their support for ending the too-big-to-\nfail concept by rejecting the Sessions amendment.\n  I say that respectfully of my colleague of Alabama. He has been a \nlongstanding member of the Judiciary Committee. He knows these issues \nwell. And I understand his concerns. But I believe as Senator Leahy \nwill speak to, either directly or indirectly, this would do great \ndamage to this bill and expose us once again to that taxpayer bailout, \nwhich none of us wants whatsoever. Because if bankruptcy would cause \ngreater harm for our economy than the failure of one company, then what \nare we left with if we reject that idea and we are back to the bailout \nscenario? None of us wants to be in that situation ever again.\n\n  I urge, when the vote occurs tomorrow, that we reject the Sessions \namendment. Stick with what we have written in this bill--which occurred \nover many months, by the way. This was not drafted over a weekend, I \ncan tell you that. We have gone back literally months trying to get \nthis right and listen to literally hundreds of people who brought their \nexpertise and knowledge of this process to the table. It was purely a \nbipartisan effort in our committee, along with others, to craft the \nfirst two titles of our bill.\n  I urge, again, the rejection of the Sessions amendment when it \noccurs.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3989 and 3991\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Durbin and Franken \namendments be considered withdrawn, and that the Durbin amendment No. \n3989 and the Franken amendment No. 3991 be considered called up in \ntheir place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, again, I want to take a moment and express \nmy gratitude to my colleagues. I want to thank Senator Landrieu. She \nwas involved in a lot of this, so I want to thank her immensely for her \ncontribution. She chairs the Small Business Committee of the Senate and \nshe and my very good friend from Georgia, Johnny Isakson, crafted a \nvery good amendment, which we just adopted. It is going to make our \nwhole section dealing with underwriting a very important part of this \nbill, and I thank them for that.\n  I want to thank Senator Mike Crapo from Idaho, my colleague on the \nBanking Committee. He made a very constructive suggestion to this part \nof the bill. I want to thank his staff as well and the staff of Senator \nLandrieu, who did a very good job in working through the language this \nafternoon that allowed us to come to this conclusion. They both \ncouldn't be here at this particular moment, late in the evening, so I \nam speaking on their behalves, but I thank them both.\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\n  Again, this is exactly what we are trying to achieve in this bill--\nwhich I know is taking a lot of time on the floor of the Senate--with \nthe contributions of Republicans and Democrats--people such as Johnny \nIsakson and Mike Crapo, Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, and so many \nothers who have contributed to this product. We are dealing with a very \ncomplex area but a critically needed one for our Nation.\n  We are getting closer and closer to final passage of this bill. We \nhave more amendments to consider, but my hope is that in the next few \ndays we can wrap up the remaining amendments and have our opportunity \nto vote--to debate on these matters and then get to the point where we \ncan cast our ballots in favor of what I hope will be an overwhelming \nvote in favor of financial reform in this legislation.\n  Tomorrow, as I mentioned earlier, there will be some nine amendments, \nat least, that we have set up for debate. I will be looking for time \nagreements on them. For those who may be listening at this late hour in \ntheir respective offices, I would urge them to work with us on time \nagreements, if they want a decent amount of time, but please do not ask \nfor exaggerated amounts of time. There are still many more amendments \nto consider.\n  We are going to be here on Friday. We won't have votes on Friday, but \nI will want to get to all these matters. There will be amendments voted \non tomorrow, and additional amendments before we finish tomorrow \nevening, and then on Friday I will be here to listen to debate, maybe \nlay down a remaining amendment to be considered on Monday when we come \nback.\n  My hope is that by Tuesday, no later than Tuesday--at the max maybe \nWednesday--we could have final passage on this bill. I know there are \nother matters the majority leader wants to handle, and I can't thank \nhim enough for providing the kind of window that has allowed this \nSenate to operate without tabling motions. We have only had one. We \nhaven't had any second-degree amendments on any amendment so far, and \nno filibusters involved at all on a very major piece of legislation.\n  As I said earlier today, all of us at one time or another talk to \nstudents in our respective States, and they ask us about how the Senate \nfunctions, and we usually describe exactly what has happened. The \nunfortunate part is that it rarely does happen in this way. We are not \ndone yet, so I realize we have not completed the process. But this is \nhow this institution was intended to operate. People have a right to \noffer their amendments, to be heard, to debate them, and then to vote \non critical issues facing our country. I never thought a few weeks ago \nwe might actually get to this point where we are engaging in the \nbusiness of the Senate, offering amendments, debating them, trying to \nmodify where we can to agree on how best to do this.\n  There are 100 of us here trying to craft a piece of legislation that \naffects 300 million of our fellow citizens in this Nation, not to \nmention others beyond our own shores because we are setting rules by \nwhich we are going to operate. My hope is that these rules will be \nharmonized with others around the world so we can avoid the kind of \ncatastrophes occurring in Europe as I speak here, as well as the \nproblems that have emerged in the Asian markets and elsewhere. So this \nis more than just an ordinary undertaking.\n  Yesterday, in speaking to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nhe notified me during one of our debates that the central bankers of \nEurope, because of the availability of technology, were literally \nwatching and monitoring the debate here on the floor of the Senate \nabout a critical issue as it was occurring. That is how the world has \nchanged. Today, the actions we take here not only affect what happens \nin our own country but elsewhere as well. This is a major undertaking, \nand I can't begin to express my gratitude to my fellow colleagues for \nthe manner in which they have conducted this debate.\n  My thanks to majority leader Harry Reid in particular. Only through \nthe majority leader can you create an environment that allows this to \nhappen. That is the leadership that Harry Reid has demonstrated over \nand over and over again in his stewardship as the majority leader of \nthis body. Again, with all the other things he has to grapple with and \ndeal with--many other issues to confront here--this is the kind of \nleadership the American people expect to see, and he is providing it \nfor our country.\n  Again, I thank as well my colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, the \nranking member, for his work and the staffs' work. Again I thank the \nfloor staff and others in their respective offices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Study: Derivatives Rules Would Cost Banks Billions\n\n       Goldman Sachs could lose up to 41 percent of its earnings \n     if Congress approves tighter regulation of the derivatives \n     market, according to an analysis by Bernstein Research. \n     That's equivalent to wiping away $3.9 billion in Goldman's \n     earnings this year if the stricter regulations were in effect \n     for the entire 12 months, according to a subsequent analysis \n     of the numbers by DealBook using Bernstein's 2010 earnings-\n     per-share estimates.\n       Other major banks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, \n     JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, would also withstand cuts \n     of billions of dollars in their earnings if the derivatives \n     rules currently being considered by the Senate are put in \n     place.\n       Estimating how stricter rules on derivatives would affect \n     the bottom line of banks relies on some big assumptions, so \n     Bernstein's estimates should be taken with some caveats. \n     Nevertheless, the assumptions Bernstein makes in its analysis \n     are probably as close to the mark as any, given the lack of \n     disclosure by the banks on their trading activities.\n       For example, banks do not break down their trading revenue \n     by function--so it is hard to find out what percentage of a \n     bank's trading revenue comes from derivatives trading. \n     Bernstein therefore has to estimate that number, fully \n     knowing that it could fluctuate for each bank. It then \n     estimated the percentage of profit that would be lost under \n     the proposed derivatives regulations.\n       That required further assumptions, given that the \n     legislation is pending and could be changed at any time. The \n     big wild card is how much of the business would be taken \n     public. If the bids and asks for over-the-counter derivatives \n     transactions are forced into the open, the spreads that the \n     banks make brokering the deals will fall. Estimating how much \n     they will fall is difficult.\n       In performing their sensitivity analysis, Bernstein \n     therefore had two major sliding assumptions: the percentage \n     of trading revenue that each bank derives from derivatives \n     trading and the percentage of that revenue that could be at \n     risk of going away if strict derivatives legislation passes. \n     The impact on the bottom line varies greatly, as some banks \n     are more dependent on trading revenue than others.\n       Take Goldman Sachs. If the bank derives 30 percent of its \n     trading revenue from derivatives and 50 percent of that \n     amount is at risk of going away, the firm's total earnings \n     would fall by 15 percent. That would be a $1.43 billion hit \n     to the $9.53 billion that Bernstein estimates the bank will \n     earn in 2010. Bernstein's worst-case scenario was if Goldman \n     derived 60 percent of its revenue from derivatives trading, \n     with 70 percent of that revenue at risk. Goldman would then \n     be facing a 41 percent decline in its earnings, equivalent to \n     a $3.9 billion hit to its earnings if calculated using 2010 \n     estimates.\n       JPMorgan is a distant second. If it derives 30 percent of \n     its trading revenue from derivatives and 50 percent of that \n     revenue is at risk of going away, the firm's earnings would \n     fall by 7 percent. That is equal to an $890 million hit to \n     its 2010 estimated earnings of $12.74 billion. The worst-case \n     scenario, using the same assumptions for Goldman, would cause \n     a 14 percent hit to earnings, equivalent to a $1.78 billion \n     reduction of its 2010 estimated earnings.\n       In a conference call with investors this month, Jamie \n     Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, estimated that the \n     proposed derivatives regulations could cost the bank several \n     hundred million dollars to $2 billion in lost revenue. Given \n     that the profit margin is high on derivatives trading, \n     Bernstein's estimates seem to be somewhat on the mark.\n       Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley could have a 9 percent hit to its \n     earnings if 30 percent of its trading revenue comes from \n     derivatives and 50 percent of that revenue was at risk. \n     Bernstein's worst case shows the bank losing 25 percent of \n     its earnings, or $1.1 billion, based on 2010 estimates.\n       Citigroup and Bank of America would not be affected as \n     significantly the other banks, because they derive a smaller \n     proportion of their revenue from trading. Citi would see a 5 \n     percent drop in the baseline scenario and a 15 percent drop \n     in the worst-case scenario, equivalent to a $1.7 billion \n     reduction in earnings, according to 2010 estimates.\n       Bank of America would take a 4 percent hit in the baseline \n     scenario and an 11 percent hit in the worst-case scenario, \n     equivalent to a $1 billion earnings reduction, according to \n     2010 estimates.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is engaging in a vigorous debate \nover how best to bring corporate accountability to Wall Street. The \nSenate's consideration of this legislation is\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\na significant step toward accomplishing that goal, and will ultimately \nensure that we do not fall victim to those same pitfalls and corporate \nabuses that led to the recent financial disaster.\n  As we bring accountability through the Wall Street Reform bill, we \nmust preserve the role of the antitrust laws to promote competition and \ntransparency in the industry. Our Nation's antitrust laws exist to \nprotect consumers, and we must ensure they apply fully to Wall Street. \nThere is simply no reason to risk exempting any industry from laws that \nprohibit price fixing and anticompetitive behavior.\n  In other sectors, we have seen the problems that result from a lack \nof adequate antitrust oversight. The insurance industry, which enjoys a \nstatutory exemption from the antitrust laws, is characterized by high \nlevels of market concentration throughout the country. Millions of \nAmericans suffer the consequences through unaffordably high health care \ncosts, which may not reflect the price that would be set through true \ncompetition. For the past three Congresses, I have worked to repeal \nthis six-decade-old exemption from the Federal antitrust laws. There is \nno justification for it, and I have urged the Senate to take up quickly \nand pass legislation that passed the House with an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority.\n  Statutory antitrust exemptions are rare because, as a general rule, \nwhen the antitrust laws are supplanted, competition, and therefore \nconsumers, are harmed. Unfortunately, while I have been working in \nCongress to repeal unwarranted, special interest exemptions, an \nactivist Supreme Court has been reading new exemptions into statutes \nwhere they do not exist. In Credit Suisse v. Billing, the Supreme Court \ncreated antitrust loopholes in securities law by holding that Congress \nimplicitly exempted the antitrust laws. This Court-made exemption took \naway an important tool consumers had to hold Wall Street accountable \nfor anticompetitive behavior. It is hard enough to bring back \ncompetition by repealing explicit exemptions, but now we must be \nattentive to those loopholes Congress never intended, as well.\n  In the wake of the Credit Suisse decision, we need to be vigilant \nwhen we enact comprehensive legislation such as Wall Street reform, to \nensure there is no ambiguity that could prevent the antitrust laws from \napplying. When courts will read any silence on the part of Congress to \nimply an antitrust exemption, we need to be especially careful in how \nwe craft our laws. Hard-working Americans demand this from their \nlawmakers.\n  To ensure there is no doubt about the role of the antitrust laws in \nthis Wall Street reform bill, I am urging the Senate to include several \nantitrust protections in the Wall Street reform bill that the Senate is \nconsidering. First, the bill should include a comprehensive antitrust \nsavings clause. Second, the bill should maintain Hart-Scott-Rodino \nantitrust merger review for those large financial acquisitions that are \nnow subject to comprehensive Federal Reserve approval. Third, we should \nmake explicit that the antitrust laws apply to those ``bridge'' \nacquisitions of failed firms that will be subject to an expedited \nemergency review. Finally, we need to preserve adequate competition \nsafeguards in the derivatives exchange market.\n  These provisions to protect competition and consumers should be \nincluded in the final version of the Wall Street reform legislation \nthat I hope the Senate will soon pass. Collectively, these provisions \nwill ensure that antitrust authorities have a vital role in Wall Street \noversight for years to come. For too long, large corporate interests \nhave harmed the financial well-being of hardworking Americans. These \nfinancial institutions must be regulated, and including these antitrust \nprovisions will ensure courts will not misread the intent of Congress \nand infer that the activity of Wall Street is exempted from the laws of \ncompetition.\n  Today, I also renew my call for the Senate to take up and pass my \namendment to repeal the antitrust exemption for health insurance \ncompanies. I hope all Senators will join me in supporting that \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3627-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         NOMINATION DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the Clark \nCounty School District's Seventh Annual International Mariachi \nConference and Festival. This event promotes cultural awareness, \npositive citizenry and encourages students in the Las Vegas community \nto succeed academically via the performance of mariachi music.\n  The Clark County School District's Secondary Mariachi Education \nProgram provides an annual 3-day Mariachi Conference and Festival where \nstudents from across the school district participate in 2 days of music \nand dance workshops taught by renowned, professional clinicians/\nperformers of the mariachi and ballet folklorico art forms. In this \nsetting, students learn and perform a variety of musical pieces that \ndemonstrate the highest level of musicianship and performance possible \nfor their level of experience. The Mariachi Conference and Festival \nculminates in a professional concert production in which all student \nparticipants display their musical talents and newly-acquired skills to \nan audience of proud parents, school district personnel, and at-large \ncommunity members. Participation in this program is something to be \nproud of and I congratulate all who are instrumental in the development \nof this local initiative.\n  In 2002, the Clark County School District recruited Jesus Javier \nTrujillo to establish the Mariachi Education Program as a means to \nprovide a creative\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\nand effective alternative for students to remain engaged in their \nschools. I salute Jesus Javier Trujillo for his visionary efforts in \nenabling the growth of such a dynamic program in Nevada. I also would \nlike to thank and congratulate trustee Larry Mason, the board of school \ntrustees, all administrators, teachers, and students for their \ncontinued commitment to this program.\n  As the State grapples with high levels of dropout rates, projects \nlike the Mariachi Program provide creative alternatives for students to \nremain engaged in schools. This is why I have long supported this \nprogram. The Mariachi Education Program has grown exponentially and has \ndrawn national acclaim. Both instructors and students alike have been \nselected to participate in top-level mariachi conferences in New \nMexico, Arizona and California. Aside from their musical talent, they \nhave played a vital role in the formation of the National Mariachi Task \nForce and have partnered with the Gastellum Foundation to award \naspiring young mariachi performers with academic scholarships to \ncollege. I extend my best wishes to the future of the Mariachi Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3628-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3628-S3632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 3295, the \nDISCLOSE Act. I am happy to be joined by several of my colleagues, all \nof whom were essential in putting this bill together: Senators \nFeingold, Wyden, Bayh, Franken, and Bennet. We come to the floor today \nwith a clear and powerful statement: the DISCLOSE Act will provide \nmuch-needed transparency to our political process in light of Citizens \nUnited, and will allow the public to know who really is behind the \npolitical messages they see on TV or hear on the radio. The DISCLOSE \nAct will follow the Supreme Court's advice and make disclosure and \ndisclaimers the cornerstone of our reform efforts and will apply \nequally to all corporations, unions, trade associations, social welfare \norganizations and section 527 groups. It is intended to encourage \npolitical participation by creating an educated electorate. Further, \nthe DISCLOSE Act will not chill speech or political participation, it \nwill enrich it.\n  On April 30, 2010, 37 colleagues and I introduced the DISCLOSE Act, \nDemocracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections, S. \n3295, to respond to the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. \nFEC. The purpose of this legislation is to provide the American public \nwith information on who is speaking when political advertisements and \nexpenditures are made and to prevent them from being misled by \norganizations attempting to disguise their identities through the use \nof shadow groups. I want to reiterate that this act is in no way meant \nto deter political speech or spending, only to provide information so \nthat the public is empowered to make informed decisions. Additionally, \nthe disclosure and disclaimer provisions in the act apply equally to \ncorporations, unions, and groups organized under sections 501(c)(4), \n(c)(5), (c)(6), and 527 of the Tax Code. We play no favorites.\n  In writing the majority opinion for the Court in its January \ndecision, Justice Kennedy was very clear in articulating the Court's \nsupport for disclosure. He said, ``[t]he First Amendment protects \npolitical speech; and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to \nreact to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This \ntransparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give \nproper weight to different speakers and messages.'' Kennedy also stated \nthat ``disclaimers avoid confusion by making it clear that the ads are \nnot funded by a candidate or political party.'' In fact, eight of the \nnine Justices agreed that disclosure and disclaimer provisions were \nnecessary, and in the public's interest, to provide this information. \nThe Court's decision opened the door to allow certain corporate \nspending in elections that was previously disallowed. In line with the \nCourt's support for disclosure and disclaimer provisions, we have \nintroduced the DISCLOSE Act and designed it to strengthen the Court's \nstated protections so that the public knows who is speaking and \nsponsoring these newly permitted messages.\n  This legislation would provide the following increased protections \nfor the American people. It will ensure that they have full and timely \ndisclosure of campaign-related expenditures by corporations, labor \nunions, social welfare organizations, trade associations and 527 \ngroups. It requires these covered organizations to report expenditures \nto the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours if the expenditure \nis $1,000 or greater within 20 days of an election and $10,000 or \ngreater before that date. It will then require the organization to post \nthis information on its own Web site 24 hours after reporting and to \nsend the information to its shareholders or members in any periodic or \nannual reports. This Internet publication requirement and more rapid \nreporting helps implement the Court's opinion that ``prompt disclosure \nof expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the \ninformation needed to hold corporations and elected officials \naccountable for their positions and supporters.''\n  It will also require enhanced reporting to the FEC by those covered \norganizations, requiring those that spend more than $10,000 per year on \ncampaign-related expenditures to either disclose all of their donors \nthat have given over $1,000 or to create a campaign-related activity \naccount for exclusive use in making these expenditures. If this account \nis created, the organization will only need to disclose those donors \nthat have donated over $10,000 in unrestricted funds or over $1,000 in \nfunds specifically designated for campaign-related expenditures.\n  This legislation will also require those organizations that make \ntransfers to other organizations for the purpose of making campaign-\nrelated expenditures to report those transfers in order to drill down \nso that the public truly knows where the money being spent is coming \nfrom. It will also allow donors to covered organizations to designate \nthat their donations will not be used for campaign-related activity. If \na donor makes this designation, the organization must then certify to \nthe FEC that it will not use the donation in this manner. These \nrequirements force organizations making these expenditures to be aware \nof the persons whose money they are spending on campaigns.\n  Our intent is not to seek the names of dues-paying members. Nor do we \nwant to dissuade prospective members or donors from supporting a \nparticular cause or organization. First, as outlined above, we believe \nthat setting up and utilizing a campaign-related activity account will \nshield any organization from having to disclose any donor that does not \nwant to have his or her funds go to political purposes. Second, \ncreating the option for a donor to affirmatively designate that the \ndonation should not be used for political spending will provide a \nmechanism to keep this donation walled-off from disclosure or \ndisclaimers. Third, even if a group decides to transfer money from its \ngeneral treasury to the campaign-related activity account, thus \ntriggering disclosure of its general treasury, we believe the $10,000 \nthreshold will exclude dues-paying members or your average donor who \nwould not want to be disclosed.\n  This legislation also institutes several enhanced disclaimer \nprovisions for political ads to ensure that the public knows who is \nsponsoring them. Current regulations require candidates sponsoring ads \nto stand by their ads and notify the public that they approve the \nmessage. Our language extends this requirement to the newly empowered \norganizations to make the public aware that it is not a candidate or \nparty speaking, in line with Justice Kennedy's language in the \ndecision. Additionally, it requires the top funder of an advertisement \nto record a similar disclaimer, and a list of the top five donors to be \nvisible on the screen.\n  Stand-by-your-ad requirements are constitutional and essential. \nFurther, we believe that it would take 8 seconds to read the two \ndisclaimers, and not half of an advertisement as some opponents \nmisleadingly suggest. For those advertisements that are 15 seconds, the \nact provides for a hardship exemption.\n  We have instituted all of these additional requirements in order to \nbring more awareness to the public. I believe that it is completely in \nthe American peoples interest to know who is speaking about candidates, \nand the Supreme\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\nCourt agrees. This is not about preventing speech or making speech more \ndifficult, it is solely about making the public aware of who the \nspeakers are. This is fully consistent with the Constitution. There is \nno reason that any group would decline to spend unless it was \nattempting to deceive the American public by speaking without \nidentifying who it is. This bill drills down and follows the money so \nthat any organizations attempting to disguise their activities through \nshadow groups are not allowed to mislead the public. It brings \neveryones political speech into the sunlight.\n  I now yield for Senator Feingold, a leader and true champion of \nreform and transparency.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New York \nbringing us together to discuss the DISCLOSE Act, S. 3295, which he \nintroduced last week and which I am proud to cosponsor.\n  As the name suggests, the central goal of this bill is disclosure. It \naims to make sure that when faced with a barrage of election-related \nadvertising funded by corporations, which the Supreme Court's decision \nin the Citizens United case has made possible, the American people have \nthe information they need to understand who is really behind those ads. \nThat information is essential to being able to thoughtfully exercise \nthe most important right in a democracy--the right to vote.\n  It is no secret that the Senator Schumer and I, and all of the \noriginal cosponsors of the bill, were deeply disappointed by the \nCitizens United decision. We reject the Court's theory that the first \namendment rights of corporations, which can't vote or hold elected \noffice, are equivalent to those of citizens. And we believe that the \ndecision will harm our democracy. I, for one, very much hope that the \nSupreme Court will one day realize the mistake it made and overturn it.\n  But the Supreme Court made the decision and we in the Senate, along \nwith the country, have to live with it. The intent of the DISCLOSE Act \nis not to try to overturn that decision or challenge it. It is to \naddress the consequences of the decision within the confines of the \nCourt's holdings. Congress has a responsibility to survey the wreckage \nleft or threatened by the Supreme Court's ruling and do whatever it can \nconstitutionally to repair that damage or try to prevent it.\n  In Citizens United, the Court ruled that corporations could not \nconstitutionally be prohibited from engaging in campaign related \nspeech. But, with only one dissenting Justice, the Court also \nspecifically upheld applying disclosure requirements to corporations. \nThe Court stated:\n\n       [P]rompt disclosure of expenditures can provide \n     shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold \n     corporations and elected officials accountable for their \n     positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether \n     their corporation's political speech advances the \n     corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can \n     see whether elected officials are `` in the pocket' of so-\n     called moneyed interests.\n\n  The Court also explained that disclosure is very much consistent with \nfree speech:\n\n       The First Amendment protects political speech; and \n     disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the \n     speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This \n     transparency enables the electorate to make informed \n     decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and \n     messages.\n\n  The Court also made clear that corporate advertisers can be required \nto include disclaimers to identify themselves in their ads. It \nspecifically reaffirmed the part of the McConnell v. FEC decision that \nheld that such requirements are constitutional.\n  The DISCLOSE Act simply builds on disclosure and disclaimer \nrequirements that are already in the law and that the Court has said do \nnot violate the first amendment. Notwithstanding the Court's strong \nendorsement of disclosure and the fact that for years opponents of \ncampaign finance reform have claimed that timely and exacting \ndisclosure requirements are preferable to other campaign finance \nrestrictions, we are already hearing claims that this bill violates the \nfirst amendment. Let me take a minute to address some of the criticisms \nof this bill that have been made.\n  First, there is the claim that the disclosure requirements are \nintended to chill political expression. It is, of course, entirely \npossible that some organizations will decide not to run ads if they \nhave to identify who is really footing the bill for them. But if that \nhappens, it is not because the disclosure requirements interfered with \ntheir right to speak out, it is because they were not willing to \nprovide the information that the Supreme Court has said ``enables the \nelectorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to \ndifferent speakers and messages.'' Candidates disclose their donors. \nThere is no reason for those who want to elect or defeat those \ncandidates not to disclose theirs. We do not intend to chill speech \nwith this bill. We intend to make it easier for the public to evaluate \nthat speech.\n  Second, some claim that the requirements of the DISCLOSE Act are too \nburdensome, and the expense will prevent some groups from speaking. \nThis seems highly unlikely in light of the already high cost of \ncampaign advertising. Surely any group that is able to spend the kind \nof money it takes to run television ads attacking or promoting a \ncandidate will have the resources to make sure that the American people \nhave the information they need to evaluate those ads.\n  Third, the bill is criticized because it requires additional \nreporting of corporations that spend money directly from their \ntreasuries rather than setting up a campaign related activity account. \nBut this is the wrong way to look at the bill. The Citizens United \ndecision allows spending directly from corporate treasuries. That's the \ndefault way of doing it, and the bill sets up a disclosure system that \nwill ensure that adequate information about the real sources of the \nspending is made available to the public. It then sets up an \nalternative format for disclosure that a corporation can choose to take \nadvantage of if it agrees to spend money on campaign spending only from \na separate account. That promise to spend only from the campaign \nrelated activities account makes the more comprehensive disclosure of \ncontributions to the treasury unnecessary. And it should always be \nremembered that any donor to a corporation or organization who wants to \nremain anonymous need only specify that the contribution cannot be use \nfor campaign spending. These features of the bill show that it is \nnarrowly tailored, not that it is discriminatory.\n  It is also very important to note that the bill applies equally to \ngroups on both sides of the political fence. Corporations, unions, \ngroups on the left and the right, will all have to disclose their \nspending and their donors if they want to spend treasury money on \npolitical ads. This bill doesn't discriminate against anyone. It treats \nall political actors equally. Any argument that the bill favors unions \nor other organizations that mostly support Democrats is simply wrong. I \nhave a long history of bipartisan work on campaign finance issues. I am \nnot interested in legislation that has a partisan effect. This bill is \nfair and evenhanded. It deserves the support of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  Most of the complaints about the bill come from interests that want \nto take advantage of one part of the Citizens United decision--the part \nthat allows corporate spending on elections for the first time in over \n100 years--and at the same time pretend that the other part of the \ndecision--the part upholding disclosure requirements--doesn't exist. \nBut the law doesn't work that way. As the old saying goes, ``you can't \nhave your cake and eat it too.''\n  Once again, I very much appreciate the leadership of the Senator from \nNew York and look forward to working with him and all my colleagues to \npass this bill. I now yield for the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. Like \nSenator Feingold, I am an original cosponsor of the DISCLOSE Act, and \nwould like to address the ``stand by your ad'' disclosure provision of \nthat bill and the recent Citizens United Supreme Court ruling.\n  The Citizens United opinion was a reckless ruling that overturned \ndecades of precedent and threatens the health of the democratic \nprocess. Citizens United laid down, for the first time, a sweeping new \nright for special interests of all types. It said that money is speech \nand corporations must have free speech. This directly overturns the \nposition taken in the Supreme Court's\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\nAustin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce opinion, which recognized the \n``corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth \nthat are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have \nlittle or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's \npolitical ideas.'' But now, the Court says that if individuals have the \nfreedom to express themselves politically, then corporations, as well \nas unions and other special interests, should have the same rights as \nliving, breathing human beings.\n  The DISCLOSE Act offers a significant step in countering this ill-\nconceived opinion. Although the full reach of Citizens United cannot be \nundone short of a constitutional amendment or reversal by the Supreme \nCourt, the DISCLOSE Act would achieve important accountability within \nthe bounds of the Court's ruling. In fact, even while a divided court \nwas striking down common sense limits on corporations, a nearly \nunanimous court upheld disclosure requirements. Disclosure imposes ``no \nceiling on campaign-related activities.'' They said, ``disclosure \npermits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate \nentities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to \nmake informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers \nand messages.''\n  But current disclosure laws were written for a time when corporations \ncouldn't flood the airwaves with commercials and drown out the voices \nof individuals. Those laws need to be updated to mount a forceful \nresponse to this new reality. With those floodgates open, the DISCLOSE \nAct isn't just the smart thing to do--it is essential and it is \nconstitutional.\n  Citizens United is a decision that is deeply unpopular with the \nAmerican people--and for very good reason. The ruling unleashes a flood \nof new money into an election system already awash with too much money, \ntoo many special interests, and not enough accountability.\n  In February, a Washington Post-ABC News poll revealed that large \nmajorities across the political spectrum opposed the decision. Eighty \npercent of respondents disagreed with Citizens United, with 65 percent \n``strongly opposed.'' Even more remarkable, this number barely varied \nbetween Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Regardless of age, \nrace, education, or income, Americans disagree with this decision, and \nlarge majorities want Congress to take action to resist corporate \ninfluence of elections.\n  As part of the McCain-Feingold law, I worked with Senator Collins to \nmake politicians stand by their ads, and now the DISCLOSE Act seeks to \nmake corporations fulfill their civic responsibility in exactly the \nsame way. Also, the bill would make sure that CEOs can't hide behind a \ntrade association, or a shell company. In addition to a CEO disclaimer \nappearing in an ad, the DISCLOSE Act requires the top five funders \nbehind an ad to be disclosed.\n  The bill would also make sure that TARP recipients and government \ncontractors are not allowed to use essentially public money to \ninfluence elections. Finally, the bill would prevent foreigners from \nbuying ads to influence the outcome of U.S. elections. The DISCLOSE Act \nseeks to protect the integrity of elections and to ensure that the \nAmerican people have full knowledge about the messages that are \ndelivered as part of political campaigns.\n  Contrary to critics' arguments, the DISCLOSE Act doesn't chill \nspeech. In fact, it encourages the flow of information. Speak your \nmind, but let the public know who's doing the speaking. The marketplace \nof ideas is open, but like any marketplace, it only functions if \neveryone has the appropriate information. Without transparency, markets \nfail. In large part, it was a lack of transparency that allowed shady \nWall Street deals to be perpetrated by Goldman Sachs and others at the \nexpense of average shareholders and bond purchasers.\n  Without the DISCLOSE Act, there would be nothing to stop Wall Street \nfirms from secretly funding a torrent of ads attacking the legislators \nand candidates working to bring accountability to Wall Street. These \nfirms could covertly funnel money to a shell company or a trade \nassociation, with no way for consumers to know who was really behind \nthose messages. Or, to use another example, BP could spend millions of \ndollars attacking members of Congress who pushed for stiffer laws on \noil exploration and clean-ups, without revealing the source of the \nfunding.\n  This is not idle speculation. It is an absolute certainty that \nspecial interests across the country will take full advantage of the \nopportunity that Citizens United affords them to spend freely on \nelections without disclosing their true identities. The only way to \nmaintain a free and open democracy is to close that loophole. The \nAmerican people are thoughtful and intelligent. If they know what \nspecial interest is behind a barrage of commercials before an election, \nthey will understand the agenda and can evaluate the message \naccordingly.\n  The DISCLOSE Act will shed sunlight on all the new money entering our \npolitics, and sunlight truly is the best disinfectant. I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to enable the will of the American people, to ensure that \ncorporations have the same responsibilities as people, and to guarantee \nthat citizens' voices aren't drowned out.\n  I thank the chair. I yield for Senator Bayh.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupport of S. 3295, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On \nSpending in Elections, DISCLOSE, Act. I would like to thank Senators \nSchumer, Feingold, Wyden, Franken, and Bennet for their hard work in \ncrafting this legislation and their efforts to help protect the \nintegrity of our political process.\n  I rise today to clarify the intent of our legislation. Opponents of \nour efforts have asserted that our bill is intended to chill political \nspeech and discourage participation in the electoral process. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. Our bill is about disclosure and \ntransparency. It is premised on the idea that democracy functions best \nwhen citizens are fully informed. We trust the wisdom of the American \npeople and believe that they deserve to know all of the facts.\n  Throughout my career, I have supported efforts to increase \nparticipation in our political process and worked to eliminate barriers \nthat unduly burden the fundamental right vote. That is why I \ncosponsored legislation to make it easier for military and overseas \nvoters to vote in our elections, opposed Indiana's misguided voter \nidentification requirements, and cosponsored legislation to help \nprevent the use of deceptive practices and voter intimidation.\n  I hope that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in \nquickly passing this important legislation.\n  I now yield for my colleague, Senator Franken, who is deeply \ncommitted to protecting the first amendment.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank Senator Bayh. I also speak today in strong \nsupport of S. 3295, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on \nSpending in Elections, also known as the DISCLOSE Act. In particular, I \nwant to talk about the provisions in title III that will create much \nneeded transparency and accountability in our elections system in \nresponse to the Citizens United decision. That decision is widely \nexpected to trigger a new flood of campaign-related funds from \ncorporations, unions, trade associations, and nonprofit organizations.\n  In that ruling, the Supreme Court drastically changed our election \nlaws to allow unlimited corporate election spending from company \ntreasury funds. It did not, unfortunately, require those corporations \nto disclose--to their shareholders, members, or the American public--\neither where the money came from or how it was spent.\n  Title II of this bill makes sure American voters know who is behind \nthe election ads they see. Title III of the bill makes sure that the \npeople that paid for those ads--like shareholders and union members--\nknow how their money was spent.\n  After Citizens United, massive corporate campaign spending could be \nfunneled through innocent-sounding front organizations like Citizens \nfor the American Dream. That company's shareholders would never realize \nthat the spending occurred or was going to support causes or \norganizations that they may not support. In short, Citizens United will \nallow these corporations to avoid accountability for their campaign \nexpenditures from shareholders, voters, and the American public.\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\n  That is why title III of the DISCLOSE Act imposes disclosure \nrequirements on all campaign-related contributions made by a \ncorporation, union, or nonprofit--even contributions to another \norganization. Under title III, whenever one of these organizations \nmakes a campaign expenditure, it will have to disclose that expenditure \non that organization's Web site within 24 hours of reporting it to the \nFederal Elections Commission. It will also have to disclose that \nexpenditure to its shareholders, donors, or members in regular periodic \nreports.\n  These disclosure requirements will allow shareholders and citizens \nalike to make informed decisions about corporate campaign expenditures. \nAs the Supreme Court even noted in its Citizens United decision, ``the \nprompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens \nwith the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials \naccountable for their positions and supporters.''\n  The Supreme Court rightfully noted that if corporations were to be \nfree to make campaign expenditures, shareholders must be able to know \nwhere the corporation's money--their money--is going.\n  Citizens also have a strong interest in knowing which of their \nelected officials or candidates for office is supported by corporate \ninterests. As the Supreme Court concluded, ``[t]he First Amendment \nprotects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and \nshareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper \nway.'' This necessary transparency--the ability to know who is spending \nmoney to influence elections and to respond accordingly--can only be \nprotected through the robust disclosure requirements of title III.\n  I want to underscore that nothing in title III is an attempt to \nsquelch or limit the court-protected speech of corporations or other \norganizations. Transparency and accountability are necessary elements \nof our marketplace of ideas. Citizens in a democracy need to know who \nis supporting the ideas and causes before them. In Citizens United, the \nSupreme Court made this point exactly, stating that the transparency \ncreated by disclosure regimes ``enables the electorate to make informed \ndecisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.''\n  I believe that the disclosure requirements in title III will increase \npolitical speech because they allow shareholders and citizens to know \nmore about the political process and engage those political actors who \nwould otherwise be unknown.\n  During the recent hearings on the DISCLOSE Act in the House of \nRepresentatives, witnesses testified that the disclosure requirements \nwould be ``onerous'' for corporations that wish to spend corporate \ntreasury dollars to influence elections. One witness alleged that the \ndisclosure requirements would do little but inconvenience, burden, and \nsilence groups that would otherwise participate. They are saying that \nthis makes the DISCLOSE Act unconstitutional.\n  How onerous could it possibly be to disclose expenditures on your Web \nsite? If a corporation wanted to spend money in an election, why would \na simple reporting requirement stop them in their tracks? This just \ndoesn't make sense to me.\n  The government chills speech when it imposes penalties or limits on \nspeech that deter people from speaking. But the first amendment isn't \nviolated just because someone doesn't speak for fear of public \nscrutiny.\n  Campaign disclosure rules have always had bipartisan support in this \nChamber. Full and timely disclosure of campaign expenditures should be \nan ideal that all of us share, regardless of our disagreements over \nother areas of campaign finance reform. American voters deserve and \nneed to know who is making campaign expenditures, and shareholders and \nmember of unions, trade associations, and nonprofits deserve and need \nto know what is being spent on their behalf. Therefore I strongly \nsupport the DISCLOSE Act, and title III in particular.\n  I thank the Chair. I now yield for my friend from Colorado, Senator \nBennet.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Democracy \nIs Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act--the \nDISCLOSE Act. I would first like to thank Senator Schumer for his \nleadership. This legislation is necessary as we work to fix \nWashington's broken campaign finance system in response to the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Citizen's United v. FEC.\n  The credibility of our democracy is damaged by the status quo. \nBecause of the dysfunction in our campaign finance system, the voices \nof special and entrenched interests drown out those of ordinary people. \nThousands of lobbyists line the Halls of Congress every day, and their \nvoices get heard. Only strong reform can begin to turn things around.\n  Campaign finance reform is something Congress has long needed to \naddress. The reforms of the past have proven insufficient and are \ncontinually under assault in the courts. The Supreme Court did us no \nfavors with its decision in Citizens United. As a result of the Court's \ndecision, corporations and labor unions can now spend directly from \ntheir general treasuries on the election or defeat of a specific \nFederal candidate through election day. There are no prohibitions on \nthe timing or reach of these independent expenditures so long as they \nare not coordinated with a campaign. As Justice Stevens wrote in his \ndissent, ``the Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of \nelected institutions across the nation.'' I'm with Justice Stevens.\n  I strongly disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision because it \nleaves individual Americans with an even smaller voice in our system. \nThis ruling rolled back sensible restrictions on corporate influence \nthat date back decades. It stacked the deck further against the \nAmerican people by unleashing a flood of special interest money in our \nFederal elections.\n  Judicial activists on the bench undid decades of precedent at the \nexpense of our democratic process. Corporations, which after all are \nnot voters and do not have the same role in elections as individual \ncitizens, can now drastically influence the outcomes of our elections. \nThis is unprecedented and represents a threat to our democracy. A \nfloodgate of special interest money has now been opened and we are left \nto deal with a number of damaging, foreseeable consequences.\n  Over the long run, I support a constitutional amendment to allow \nCongress to regulate contributions and expenditures. But this is a very \nheavy lift in a Senate that has trouble mustering the required 67 votes \non anything. We can't wait for a constitutional amendment to \nmaterialize. We must act now to fix some of the egregious problems \nopened up by the Citizens United decision.\n  If we let the Court's decision stand as is, then even foreign-\ncontrolled corporations can use the aggregations of wealth inherent in \nthe corporate form to dominate our elections. While foreign nationals \nand corporations have always been barred under traditional law from \ncontributing to campaigns or making independent expenditures, their \nsubsidiaries established in the United States are not covered by this \nnew prohibition. A subsidiary controlled by foreign nationals could run \nads impacting local elections. Petro China, with an estimated net worth \nof $100 billion, could use its profits to purchase ads in congressional \nraces. Saudi Aramco, estimated to be worth $781 billion, could likewise \nspend unlimited sums of money on independent expenditures to shape \npublic perception of a candidate.\n  Further, if we let the Court's decision stand as is, then we are in \njeopardy of institutionalizing pay to play politics or at least the \nappearance of this. Government contractors, whose profits come from \ntaxpayer dollars, will now be able to spend freely to influence \nelections. We already are struggling to address waste, fraud and abuse \nin our government contracting. Citizens United will only make necessary \nreforms more difficult, as government contractors can use taxpayer \ndollars they receive from government contracts to attack supporters of \nreform or support those who make it easier to obtain these contracts.\n  Mostly importantly, the Supreme Court's decision increases the role \nof money in politics without any way to ensure voters are informed of \nwhere this money is coming from. The demands of the money chase already \nleave out many Americans with a desire to serve. Candidates will no \nlonger\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\njust have to raise funds to compete against their opponents, but will \nalso have to compete with independent expenditure campaigns conducted \nby powerful special interests. This has the potential to influence the \npositions a candidate takes and perception the public has of the \npolitical process. Our elected officials will no longer be able to \nfocus on the big issues of the day for risk of opening the door for an \nindependent expenditure attack waged by a regulated interest.\n  What is more troubling is that current law provides for insufficient \ntransparency to ensure voters are aware of who is running these \nindependent expenditures. Special interests and their lobbyists, of \ncourse, will know who is running these ads since they are going to use \nthem for leverage. Voters will be left in the dark.\n  We must utilize--to the fullest extent possible--the tools for \nregulating campaign finance that the Court has provided for in Citizens \nUnited and in prior decisions.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the DISCLOSE Act because I believe it \naddresses some of the unintended consequences of Citizens United and \nemphasizes disclosure requirements, which the Supreme Court has \nhighlighted as ``the less-restrictive alternative to more comprehensive \nspeech regulations.'' This legislation is our best hope for ensuring \nvoters can make informed decisions and making sure our process isn't \ncorrupted or otherwise cheapened by the Court's new blunt restrictions \non our ability to protect the system from outside corrupting influence.\n  And so the DISCLOSE Act extends the existing prohibition on \ncontributions and expenditures by foreign nationals to domestic \ncorporations where: (1) a foreign national owns 20 percent or more of \nvoting shares in the corporation; (2) a majority of the board of \ndirectors are foreign nationals; (3) one or more foreign nationals have \nthe power to direct, dictate or control the decisionmaking of the U.S. \nsubsidiary; or (4) one or more foreign nationals have the power to \ndirect, dictate or control the activities with respect to Federal, \nState or local elections.\n  This prohibition is in line with current laws that prohibit foreign \nnationals from making direct or indirect contributions to campaigns for \nFederal, State or local elections. Under the law, the definition of \n``foreign national'' exempts any person that is ``not an individual and \nis organized under or created by the laws of the United States or any \nState or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States \nand has its principal place of business within the United States.'' The \nFEC has concluded this exemption includes a U.S. corporation that is a \nsubsidiary of a foreign corporation, so long as the foreign parent does \nnot finance political activities in the United States and no foreign \nnational participates in any decision to make expenditures. The \nDISCLOSE Act tightens this exemption and clarifies its reach in order \nto prevent undue foreign influence. This provision makes sure the \nCourt's decision does not leave any possible opening for foreign \ninfluence of our elections.\n  To address the potential for corruption or appearance of corruption \nby government contractors which can now use their treasuries to \ninfluence election results, the DISCLOSE Act bars government \ncontractors from making campaign-related expenditures. Under current \nlaw, government contractors are already barred from making \ncontributions to influence Federal elections. If an individual is a \nsole proprietor of a business with a Federal Government contract, he or \nshe may not make contributions from personal or business funds. The \nDISCLOSE Act ensures that the intent of current law remains by \nprohibiting the general treasury funds of government contractors from \nbeing used to circumvent current restrictions. Further, bailout \nrecipients who have not repaid taxpayers cannot make campaign-related \nexpenditures until taxpayer money is repaid. This is in line with the \nspirit of the government contractor provision since it prevents the \npotential for corruption and abuse of taxpayer dollars by those who are \ndirect beneficiaries.\n  In its provisions for regulating foreign corporations and government \ncontractors, the DISCLOSE Act builds on restrictions already in place \nunder the law to make sure that the unintended consequences of Citizens \nUnited do not come to fruition. These are necessary fixes.\n  The most important provisions in the DISCLOSE Act concern increased \ntransparency in our political process. Given the reality that Citizens \nUnited has opened the door for unmitigated special interest money, it \nis important that we make sure voters are aware whose money is being \nused to influence their opinions.\n  The DISCLOSE Act expands disclosure requirements under current law by \nrequiring corporations, labor unions and a number of tax exempt \norganizations to report all donors who have given $1,000 or more to the \norganization in a 12-month period if the organization makes independent \nexpenditures or electioneering communications in excess of $10,000. \nFurther, leaders of corporations, unions and organizations covered are \nrequired to stand behind their independent expenditure ads by appearing \non camera, as candidates for office are currently required to do. To \nprevent money from being funneled to shell groups to avoid \nidentification, the top funder of ads must stand by the ad and issue a \ndisclaimer. The top five donors to a campaign-related TV ad will be \nlisted on screen.\n  Special interests are already attacking this provision as \nunconstitutional. This is both unfortunate and false. As the Court \nstated in Citizens United, the ``public has an interest in knowing who \nis speaking about a candidate shortly before an election.'' Voters \nshould be able to weigh different speakers and messages accordingly.\n  Citing the Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo, Justice Kennedy \nwrote for the majority in Citizens United that ``disclaimer and \ndisclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they \nimpose no ceiling on campaign-related activities or prevent anyone from \nspeaking.''\n  Under this rationale, the Court upheld disclaimer and disclosure \nrequirements under sections 201 and 311 of the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act of 2002, BCRA, as they applied to the movie that Citizens \nUnited produced and the advertisements it planned to run to promote the \nmovie. The Court found the movie and its advertisements amounted to \n``electioneering communication'' under BCRA and did not find there to \nbe evidence that the disclosure requirements would have a chilling \neffect on donations by exposing donors to retaliation. Thus, the Court \nremoved the ability of funders for Citizens United to lurk in the \nshadows while shaping public perspective. There is no doubt that the \nCourt would find a broadening of current disclosure laws and rules that \npertain to candidates to be appropriate.\n  The ability of the public to be informed of their choices in the \npolitical marketplace is critical. Misinformation campaigns are already \nan unfortunate reality of our politics. With the floodgates of special \ninterest money now fully open, the situation will only grow worse. The \nleast we can do is make sure voters can make informed decisions.\n  Although Citizens United has cast a dark cloud on Washington, Senator \nSchumer is also proving that this deplorable decision also created the \nimpetus for action. The DISCLOSE Act is an opportunity to not only \nprevent the worst of the unintended and the foreseeable consequences \nfrom the Supreme Court's decision, but also improve the information \navailable to voters as they consider candidates and issues. This \nlegislation is a step forward for ensuring that the voices of \nindividual Americans are not drowned out. It is an opportunity to show \nthe public that we will not stand by and allow special interests to \ncontinue to overwhelm Washington and the people's business.\n  I am proud to be joining Senators Schumer, Feingold, Wyden, Bayh and \nFranken here today in support of the DISCLOSE Act. I ask all our \ncolleagues to join us in cosponsoring this legislation and bringing it \nto the floor so that we can prevent further decay of our campaign \nfinance system and ensure voters are informed come election day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3632-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3632-S3633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL PEACE OFFICER'S MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this week marks National Police Week and \nthe\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\nobservance of National Peace Officers Memorial Day. I want to take this \nopportunity to remember the brave men and women of law enforcement who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives in the line of \nduty.\n  Since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have been nearly \n19,000 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. On average, \none law enforcement officer is killed somewhere in the United States \nevery 53 hours. There are more than 900,000 sworn law enforcement \nofficers now serving in the United States, which is the highest figure \never.\n  This year, 116 names will be added to the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial here in Washington, DC. We should remember that there \nare 116 families who grieve the loss of a loved one who gave their life \nto protect their community and keep their fellow citizens safe. The \nsacrifice of those brave officers is the price paid for living in open \nsociety where freedoms are guaranteed by our Nation's laws. When those \nlaws are violated, we look to our protectors who wear the badge to \nanswer the call.\n  During the dedication of the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial in 1991, President George H.W. Bush said, ``Carved on these \nwalls is the story of America, of a continuing quest to preserve both \ndemocracy and decency, and to protect a national treasure that we call \nthe American Dream.'' That is what our dedicated law enforcement \nprofessionals do every day. They protect the American dream.\n  The first recorded law enforcement death in my home State of Utah was \nin 1853. That was when Salt Lake County deputy Rodney Badger gave his \nlife to try to save a fellow Utahn. Since then, 62 of Utah's finest \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice and given their lives in service to \nthe State of Utah. While there were no police officers killed in 2009, \nthere have already been two members of Utah's law enforcement community \nwho have been killed in the line of duty this year. Their deeds and \nservice will not be forgotten, and my thoughts are with their families. \nWe shall always remember that it is not how these officers died that \nmade them heroes, it was how they lived. That sentiment is embodied in \nboth the Utah and National Law Enforcement Officers Memorials.\n  The deadliest day in law enforcement history was September 11, 2001, \nwhen 72 officers were killed while responding to the terrorist attacks \non America. On that day, at the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, and \nat Shanksville, PA, Americans witnessed firsthand the front line on the \nwar on terror. That was the day when Americans saw courage in the midst \nof chaos from our brave men and women in law enforcement. Our Nation \nalso recorded deeds of uncommon valor not only from our military, \npolice, and fire personnel, but also from our citizens who sacrificed \nthemselves as patriots for their country. It is that spirit that sets \nus apart as Americans. It was that spirit of sacrifice on which our \nNation was founded. It is our duty to acknowledge and record the \nsacrifice of those who perished trying to save others.\n  As the recent event in Times Square has shown us, law enforcement has \nhad to bear the responsibility of not only protecting citizens from \ncrime but also from the violence of extreme beliefs and terrorism. The \nmission of the law enforcement officer has been transformed over 200 \nyears to include being a crime fighter, problem-solver, counselor, \nsocial worker, and now protector of the homeland. As the duties of law \nenforcement continue to expand, we recognize that Federal agents, \nofficers, and deputies never shirk the tasks assigned to them. They do \nit willingly and eagerly accept the challenge.\n  There are those in Washington who posture, saying ``failure is not an \noption.'' However, within the law enforcement community, failure is not \nin their vocabulary. Their steadfast dedication to serve victims, \nprotect the weak, and fight crime motivates them to not accept failure \neven if it requires making the ultimate sacrifice.\n  In closing, this week I urge my colleagues to take a moment and think \nabout those who walk the beat, patrol the streets, and watch over us. \nThe men and women of law enforcement stand tall to protect us, our \nfamilies, and our communities. Law enforcement is often a thankless job \nand is truly, more often than not, more of a calling than a vocation. \nIt takes a special person to answer that call and choose to provide the \nblanket of security by enforcing the laws of this great land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3633-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3633-S3634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEHBP DEPENDENT COVERAGE EXTENSION ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program Dependent Coverage Extension Act. \nThis bill will allow Federal employees to benefit immediately from an \nimportant provision of the new health care law.\n  FEHBP is the largest employer-sponsored group health insurance \nprogram in the world, covering more than 8 million Federal employees, \nretirees, former employees, and their dependents. Currently, FEHBP \nenrollees with family coverage can keep unmarried, dependent children \non their health insurance policies until age 22.\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, which moves us to universal health coverage and \nlowers health care costs for our Nation and for families. One of the \nfirst effective provisions of the legislation requires health plans to \nallow parents to keep children on their health insurance policies until \ntheir 26th birthday. Previously, most plans terminated dependent \nchildren's coverage once they tunred 22. While the insurance exchanges \ncreated by the new law will enable millions more Americans to access \naffordable coverage, they will not be operational until 2014. Enabling \nchildren of insured parents to stay on their policies until age 26 is \nan immediate benefit that will begin now to improve our health care \nsystem by increasing the number of people with affordable coverage \nright away.\n  This provision of the law will take effect on the first day of the \nnew plan year after September 23, 2010. For most plans, that means \nJanuary 1, 2011. But I am pleased to report that many insurance \ncompanies have chosen to implement this provision earlier than required \nby law.\n  But unless Congress acts, Federal employees with family coverage will \nhave to wait until next year for this benefit to kick in. This is \nbecause FEHBP law prevents the Office of Personnel Management Director \nJohn Berry from moving up the effective date. Two sections of the law \nhinder OPM from taking action now. According to OPM, ``The first \nsection allows OPM to contract with plans to provide health services to \nemployees and their families. The second defines family members to \ninclude `an unmarried dependent child under age 22.' Unfortunately, \nthis does now allow flexibility for FEHB plans to provide coverage to \nother adult children until the provision in the Affordable Care Act \nbecomes effective.'' Director Berry has stated that he would like to \nbegin expanding coverage for enrollees' adult children now, and that he \ndoes not want to wait until next January to offer this cost-saving \nbenefit.\n  The bill we are introducing today would conform FEHBP law with PPACA \nand ensure that all children of Federal employees can remain on their \nparents' health insurance policies until their 26th birthday and give \nOPM the authority to implement the change immediately.\n  Graduation season is upon us, and many college seniors are preparing \nfor new challenges, including moving out on their own, starting \ngraduate studies, finding a job, and other life transitions. They \nshould not have to endure the additional stress that comes from \nsuddenly losing their health insurance coverage. Young adults just \nstarting their careers often lack access to affordable employer-based \nhealth insurance and must rely on the prohibitively expensive \nindividual market for coverage. That is why so many private insurers \nhave stepped up to the plate. Permitting Federal employees to benefit \nfrom the new law now will ease young adults' transition from college to \nthe workforce and reduce their out-of-pocket expenses.\n  The independent Congressional Budget Office has issued a preliminary \nanalysis indicating that this legislation has no cost associated with \nit. So it will save families money, get more young adults insured, and \nbring greater efficiencies to our health care sooner, all at no cost to \nthe Federal budget.\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me in this bipartisan effort: \nSenators Collins, Akaka, Rockefeller, Mikulski, Bingaman, Johnson, \nKaufman, Kerry, Landrieu, Stabenow, and Warner.

What stood out most from our trip was the quality, caliber, \nand courage of U.S. troops and civilians, who risk their lives every \nday to defend our national security interests in these two critical \nregions. I was humbled by the opportunity to thank them for their \nsacrifice and service and impressed by the progress which has been \nmade.\n  At the same time, I was taken aback by the myriad of challenges that \nlie ahead, especially in Afghanistan. Chief among them is walking the \ntightrope required to balance our complex relationship with President \nKarzai. Partnership with President Karzai is required for success. He \nneeds to work with the United States in both word and deed to promote \neconomic development, build the Afghan security forces, combat \nextremists, tackle the drug trade, eliminate corruption, and improve \nsystems of governance.\n  In Afghanistan, we have begun to successfully implement the strategy \noutlined by President Obama in December, as evidenced by ongoing \noperations against the Taliban, greater emphasis on subnational \ngovernance, and a renewed training and partnering effort with the \nAfghan Army and police. While much attention has been paid to the \ndeployment of an additional 30,000 U.S. troops, it is clear that \nsuccess in counterinsurgency requires far more than a large military \nfootprint, as there is no purely military solution to this problem.\n  In order to meet our goals of ``shape, clear, hold, build, \ntransfer,'' we must also have a strong and capable civilian presence to \nestablish good governance; increase training of Afghan national \nsecurity forces; and further improve cooperation with Pakistan, \nespecially when it comes to securing the border and targeting the \nAfghan Taliban. Without these other elements of our broader \ncounterinsurgency strategy, military success will not be sustained and \nauthority cannot be transferred to the Afghans. And make no mistake--\nthe transfer of power is our ultimate goal, beginning with the \nPresident's announced conditions-based drawdown starting in July 2011.\n  While in Afghanistan in April, we met with President Karzai and gave \nsuggestions of steps we thought he could take to lay the groundwork for \na successful visit to Washington. We raised the issue of corruption, \nwhich, if left unaddressed, threatens to undermine nearly all other \nareas of progress. After all, counterinsurgency is not a struggle \nbetween the United States and the insurgents. It is a battle for \nlegitimacy between the Afghan Government and the Taliban, and \nperceptions of corruption only further distance the Afghan Government \nfrom the population.\n  I am pleased that President Karzai has said many of the right things, \nstarting with commitments made in his November inauguration speech. He \nhas also recently issued a decree giving power to the High Office of \nOversight and Anti-Corruption to investigate government corruption \ncases and has granted greater budgeting and implementation powers to \nprovincial and district officials.\n  These are good first steps, but progress requires more than decrees \nand rhetoric. There is far more that must be done because--as I have \nsaid before--our best defense in Afghanistan is a strong, efficient, \nand accountable Afghan Government. In order to defeat an insurgency, \nthere must be capable and transparent governance and not just in Kabul. \nEffective government must extend to the subnational level, where it can \nprovide essential services and secure the population.\n  On my trip, I was encouraged to learn of district teams collaborating \nwith trainers and mentors to strengthen systems of local governance, \nespecially in Regional Commands South and East. In these areas, \ncivilian officials are working at the provincial and district levels \nwith their Afghan counterparts--especially those from the so-called \n``line ministries'' of agriculture, education, health, security, and \nreconstruction and rural development--to provide basic services and \nimprove the lives of Afghan citizens. They are implementing a system to \nstrengthen the country from the bottom up, which will minimize the \ninfluence of the Taliban and marginalize its shadow governments. This \nwas especially evident in Marjah, where we just concluded the first \njointly planned and implemented U.S.-Afghan, civilian-military \noperation.\n  Last week, the Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on the \n``Meaning of Marjah'' to explore lessons learned as we look toward this \nsummer's Kandahar offensive. While the clearing phase in Marjah was \nquick and decisive, we have now entered the ``hold and build'' stage, \nwhich presents a spectrum of new challenges. As BG John Nicholson noted \nin the hearing, ``The challenge here is to connect the people with \ntheir government, thereby creating a nexus between the citizens of \nMarjah and government officials.'' Thus far, a small group of Afghan \ncivil servants is working with U.S. civilians to provide basic \nservices, but more must be done. A sustained and effective government \npresence free from the stigma of corruption is an essential \nprerequisite to success not just in Marjah, but in all \ncounterinsurgency operations.\n  This was evidenced by a recent community council meeting, or shura, \nattended by President Karzai and General McChrystal in Marjah. At the \nshura, members of the local population made it clear to President \nKarzai that the people surrounding him were contributing to the \nproblem. They told him that corrupt government officials, such as the \nformer chief of police, were creating reasons for the population to \nsupport the Taliban. It is my understanding that this event, which was \nfollowed by a similar experience in Kandahar, may have given President \nKarzai pause, as he realized that he must address the root causes of \ncorruption in order to win over the population.\n  Corruption remains a large hurdle in this effort, but it is not the \nonly one. We must also ensure there are enough civilians to partner \nwith the Afghans. While I am pleased that the Obama administration has \nmade this a priority, tripling the number of deployed civilians over \nthe past year, it must continue to ensure that there are enough \ncivilians outside of Kabul to engage with the population. It is \nremarkable that 13 U.S. Government agencies are now represented, and \nthe recent civilian uplift has been the biggest since Vietnam. At the \nsame time, 1,000 U.S. civilians with less than 400 outside of Kabul is \nsimply not enough to partner with 100,000 U.S. troops and reach a \npopulation of 28 million.\n  We must also continue to focus on increased training for the Afghan \nnational security forces so they can assume responsibility for securing \nthe population. We are on track to reach at least 134,000 in the Afghan \nNational Army, ANA, by October, and the quality of officers and \nrecruits has risen in recent weeks. This is due in part to recent pay \nraises and increased effectiveness given intensified partnering with \nU.S. troops. I am pleased that nearly 90 percent of all units are now \npartnered, and large military operations--such as Marjah--were truly \njoint operations.\n  Unfortunately we have not yet seen the same levels of progress toward \nbuilding the Afghan National Police, ANP, as we have with the army. In \na Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee hearing \nchaired by Senator McCaskill last month, we\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\ndiscussed the range of problems that has hampered the growth and \ntraining of the ANP. I was appalled to hear that $6 billion has been \nspent to date on training contracts with very little to show for it. I \nunderstand the challenges of training a police force which is largely \nilliterate and suffering from high rates of attrition, but the answer \nis not to repeat the same mistakes or renew inefficient contracts.\n  The stakes are simply too high. We cannot afford for this training \neffort to be ineffective or approach police training as an ad hoc \nmission. We must demonstrate better oversight of this critical training \nprogram and ensure that our efforts result in the establishment of a \nqualified and committed Afghan police force. Moreover, we must consider \nbuilding a stronger U.S. Government capacity to oversee future police \ntraining missions. As we look toward a future with fewer conventional \nthreats and an increased number of insurgencies, there is no question \nthat this capacity is needed to defend our security interests globally.\n  President Karzai is under enormous pressure to meet our high \nexpectations and demands. In our recent meeting, we discussed our \nshared interest in a strong partnership and a productive visit to \nWashington. I understand that the pressure is growing as we focus on \nbuilding subnational governance and as our military plans focus \nsquarely on Kandahar, which is the home of the Taliban and an area \nwhere Karzai's family and tribe still exercise great influence.\n  I look forward to seeing President Karzai when he is here, and I hope \nto hear more about his plans to address corruption, improve governance, \nand enhance economic development. I hope he understands that the United \nStates shares an enduring commitment to building a strong and sovereign \nAfghanistan, both in the near term and well into the future, so that \nour joint efforts now can benefit future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3635-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NATIONAL LAB DAY\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, to celebrate National Lab \nDay. While today is the official National Lab Day kick-off, National \nLab Day is much more than just one day. It is an ongoing effort to \nbring scientists and engineers into the classroom to conduct hands-on \nexperiments with students.\n  Last November, President Obama launched the ``Educate to Innovate'' \ncampaign to motivate and inspire students to excel in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, education. As part \nof this effort, President Obama announced the launch of National Lab \nDay and encouraged Americans to get involved. Created through a \npartnership between Federal agencies, foundations, professional \nsocieties, and other STEM-related organizations, support for National \nLab Day grew quickly. Currently, projects are scheduled in every State, \nincluding over 1,000 schools.\n  I have spoken many times on the Senate floor about the importance of \nSTEM education. I advocated for the inclusion of increased service \nopportunities for retired engineers and other STEM professionals in the \nEdward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. National Lab Day is an important \nstep towards creating strong, long-term relationships between STEM \nprofessionals and educators.\n  Importantly, National Lab Day projects are teacher-driven. Teachers \ncan register at the National Lab Day Web site and request funding or \ndescribe a project they would like to do with a STEM professional. \nTeachers can have STEM professionals help them assess, update, and \nrepair current lab facilities and equipment, implement hands-on \nactivities, conduct science fairs, mentor students, coordinate field \ntrips, assist with lesson plans, and more.\n  Once teachers post their requests on the National Lab Day Web site, \nthey will be matched with a list of local volunteers who have \nregistered on the Web site. Volunteers need not only be STEM \nprofessionals, as university STEM students and other members of the \ncommunity can sign up to help as well. Volunteers can browse teacher \nrequests and will be notified of any matches to teacher requests that \nmeet their interests.\n  A quick look at the projects posted on the Web site reveals \nintriguing titles such as VEX Robotics, Tech Genographics, Space--the \nFinal Frontier, and Get Ahead--Design a Shed, to name a few. The Office \nof Science and Technology Policy blog recently highlighted a National \nLab Day project that took place at East Side Community High School in \nManhattan. With the recent major BP oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico, \nthis particular lab was especially timely to students. A local college \nprofessor taught 10th graders how to clean and purify ``contaminated'' \nwater made of tap water mixed with dirt, flour, salad dressing, and \ndish soap. This is exactly the type of hands-on experiment that \nNational Lab Day promotes to expose young people to the real-world \napplications and wonders of STEM.\n  Support for National Lab Day is extensive. Key partners include: the \nNational Science Teachers Association, American Chemical Society, \nMacArthur Foundation, Hidary Foundation, the National Institutes of \nHealth, and the National Science Foundation. Additionally, more than \n200 educational, scientific, and engineering organizations support \nNational Lab Day, including such groups as the National Education \nAssociation and the Association for Women and Science.\n  National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins is \nparticipating in National Lab Day by volunteering in a local District \nof Columbia school and he has encouraged NIH employees to get involved \nas well. American Society for Engineering Education President J.P. \nMohsen is participating in National Lab Day and is encouraging other \nASEE members nationwide to do the same in their local communities. \nFirst Lady Michelle Obama highlighted National Lab Day when she spoke \nto the team finalists at the National Science Bowl.\n  I have said many times that I believe the long-term vitality of our \neconomy rests with our ability to use STEM to solve the major problems \nwe face. Whether it is energy independence, climate change, life-saving \ncures for diseases, security challenges, or new solutions for \ntransportation, STEM professionals are the world's problem solvers. \nFortunately, young people today want to ``make a difference'' with \ntheir lives, but unfortunately, not enough of them see STEM as the way \nto do that.\n  National Lab Day will allow STEM professionals not only to share \ntheir unique skills and knowledge with educators and students, but it \nwill also allow them to share the rewards of a career in STEM and the \nnumerous ways that STEM professionals ``make a difference.'' National \nLab Day, and the relationships it is fostering, will help inspire the \nnext generation of scientists and engineers. I applaud the volunteers, \nteachers, associations, and agencies that are participating in National \nLab Day--today and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3635-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3635-S3639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CRISIS IN THE PHILADELPHIA CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in a four-part series titled ``Justice: \nDelayed, Dismissed, Denied,'' published in December 2009, the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer reported on the failure of the Philadelphia \ncriminal justice system to provide fair and speedy justice. ``It is a \nsystem that too often fails to punish violent criminals, fails to \nprotect witnesses, fails to catch thousands of fugitives, fails to \ndecide cases on their merits--fails to provide justice.'' i \nGiven that Philadelphia has the highest violent crime rate among the 10 \nlargest cities in the United States, this is an urgent problem which \nSenator Specter has worked hard to address.\n  In the past 5 months, Senator Specter has taken a leadership role by \nholding three Senate field hearings, bringing together the experts and \nkey players in the criminal justice system to work collaboratively to \nfind solutions to these problems. He has sought and obtained funding \nfor the U.S. Marshals Service's Fugitive Task Force to provide \nassistance in locating and arresting Philadelphia's fugitives. Finally, \nhe has introduced and supported significant legislation to better \nprotect State witnesses, to fund State witness protection programs, and \nto fund State fugitive recovery efforts and the entry of State warrants \ninto the national warrant database.\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\n  Using statistics from the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania \nCourts and the Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer reported that Philadelphia, among large urban \ncounties, has the Nation's lowest felony conviction rate. For most big \ncities the conviction rate is 50 percent but for Philadelphia the \nconviction rate is only 20 percent, and that rate has been steadily \ndeclining over time. While the city's rate of conviction for murder is \nexcellent--82 percent compared to the U.S. average of 71 percent--for \nother violent felonies it is abysmal: Nearly 2/3 of those charged with \nviolent crime offenses walk free of all charges; Only 1 in 10 people \ncharged with gun assaults is found guilty of that charge; Only 1 in 5 \naccused armed robbers is convicted of that charge; Only 1 in 4 accused \nrapists is convicted of rape; One-half arrested for possession of \nillegal handguns beat the gun charges; and of the 4,500 who reported \nbeing robbed at gun point, only 200, or 4 percent of individuals were \nconvicted.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer identified a number of systemic failings as \ncontributing factors to this crisis, including increasing incidents of \nwitness intimidation; exploding criminal caseloads incentivizing judges \nto dismiss cases rather than to try them (of the violent crime cases in \n2006 and 2007 disposed without a conviction, 92 percent were dropped or \ndismissed and only 8 percent of defendants were found not guilty); the \nnumber of judges not keeping pace with the substantial increase in \ncriminal case filings (since 1989 the criminal docket has increased by \n51 percent but the number of judges has not changed; not surprisingly \nthe number of dismissals has doubled). Additional contributing factors \ninclude trial delays caused by defense attorneys' delay tactics, which \ncause witnesses to stop coming to court and cases to be dismissed; \ndismissals because inmates and/or police officers routinely fail to \ntimely appear in court; and a broken bail system causing Philadelphia \nto have 47,000 fugitives and to be tied with Newark, New Jersey as \nhaving the highest fugitive rate in the Nation.ii\n  Senator Specter's significant actions to address this crisis and to \nrestore confidence in the Philadelphia criminal justice system are \ndetailed below.\n  Witness intimidation and violent crime are problems that Senator \nSpecter has worked on for decades, since he was an assistant district \nattorney and later district attorney in Philadelphia, and on the \nJudiciary Committee, where he has served since 1981 when he was first \nsworn in as a U.S. Senator.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Crime and Drugs Subcommittee, \nSenator Specter chaired a field hearing in Philadelphia on witness \nintimidation at the State and local level on January 8, \n2010.iii This hearing brought together experts and leaders \nin the field to help find solutions for this pervasive and serious \nproblem. At the hearing, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles \nRamsey, as well as Michael Coard, a respected Philadelphia defense \nattorney, and Associate Professor Richard Frei, an academic, testified. \nTwo parents, each of whom lost a child to gun violence, also testified. \nBarbara Clowden testified that her son Eric Hayes, then 17 years old, \nwas killed just 2 days before he was to testify in an arson trial in \nPhiladelphia. Because Eric's life had been threatened, in January 2006 \nhis family entered into the city's witness relocation program. \nEventually the money from the program ran out and they had to relocate \nto northeast Philadelphia, where Eric was murdered. No one, to date, \nhas been convicted of Eric's murder.\n\n  Ted Canada, a Philadelphia resident and SEPTA bus driver, also \ntestified. In 2005, his son Lamar Canada was shot 12 times and killed \nover an alleged gambling debt.iv One witness to the \nshooting, Johnta Gravitt, then 17 years old, was murdered 10 days after \nhe testified at the preliminary hearing and identified one of the \nshooters. Another witness initially cooperated but after his statement \nto the police was publicly posted in his neighborhood identifying him \nas a ``snitch,'' he recanted.\n  The most notorious example of witness intimidation in Philadelphia \ninvolves Kaboni Savage, a drug kingpin who was federally indicted last \nApril on racketeering and murder charges for retaliating against his \nformer drug associate, Eugene Coleman. Coleman had agreed to testify \nagainst Savage in a Federal trial. The Federal charges allege that to \nretaliate for this, Savage orchestrated the firebombing of Coleman's \nfamily home on the 3200 block of North 6th Street in Philadelphia \nduring the early morning hours of October 9, 2004. Killed in the fire \nwere Coleman's mother, Marcella Coleman, age 54; Coleman's infant son, \nDamir Jenkins, 15 months old; Marcella Coleman's niece, Tameka Nash, \nage 34, and her daughter, Khadjah Nash, age 10; Marcella Coleman's \ngrandson, Tahj Porchea, age 12; and a family friend, Sean Rodriguez, \nage 15. In a conversation secretly recorded by court-authorized \nwiretaps, Savage explained how witness intimidation works, ``Without \nthe witnesses, you don't have no case?. . . . No witness, no \ncrime.''v\n  The witness intimidation problem is exacerbated by internet sites, \nsuch as whosarat.com, which expose the identities of witnesses and \ngovernment informants. Gang members and criminals are becoming more \ncomputer savvy. They use the internet to find out who may be a \ncooperating witness by accessing public court dockets. They also access \nother sites to locate these individuals. With this information obtained \nanonymously through the Internet, gang members and other criminals can \neasily threaten or harm witnesses, as well as their family \nmembers.vi\n  The ``stop snitching'' culture in Philadelphia has taken hold even \namong law abiding people. Years ago, popularized in movies and \ntelevision, the code of silence started with organized crime and \napplied only to its members who used intimidation and highly visible \nacts of retaliation against those who broke it to maintain adherence to \nthe code. Today that code of silence has involved into a popular and \npervasive stop snitching culture.vii\n  It has expanded to include threats against people who have no stake \nin a specific case and it is now directed toward anyone providing \ninformation to authorities. It has been strengthened by the strong \ndistrust and alienation many urban youth have toward the police. It was \nshown at the hearing that the more people perceive the justice system \nto be biased, ineffective or corrupt, the more likely it is that they \nwill resort to community self-protection and enforcement.\n  As reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer on December 14, 2009, \n``[p]rosecutors, detectives, and even some defense attorneys say \nwitness fear has become an unspoken factor in virtually every court \ncase involving violent crime in Philadelphia. Reluctant or terrified \nwitnesses routinely fail to appear in court, and when they do, they \noften recant their earlier testimony or statement to police.'' \nviii One Philadelphia assistant district attorney is quoted \nin the article as saying that at least one witness in every murder \ntrial recants. At times, the local prosecutors are forced to lock up \nwitnesses on material witness warrants to assure their appearance at \ntrial.ix\n  In Philadelphia between 2006 and 2008, the District Attorney's Office \nfiled witness intimidation charges against approximately 1,000 \nindividuals. Their conviction rate on these charges, however, is only \n28 percent.x\n  Criminal trials cannot proceed unless there are witnesses, and if \nwitnesses are subject to intimidation or even worse, murdered, criminal \ncases cannot go forward. And unless witnesses can be assured they will \nbe protected, the problem of witness intimidation cannot be expected to \ngo away. Philadelphia's witness relocation program was cut from a high \nof $988,000 in 2006-07 to $747,000 in 2008-09. On average last year the \nprogram spent $11,000 per witness. Compare that with the Federal \nwitness protection program that spends on average $150,000 for each \nwitness in the Federal program. More money is needed to fund \nPhiladelphia's witness relocation program.\n  It is imperative that people be protected if they step forward and \nprovide information to law enforcement. As Philadelphia Police \nCommissioner Charles H. Ramsey testified at the subcommittee hearing, \n``the only way we're going to deal with crime in communities is when \nthe community steps forward, but they have to feel comfortable in doing \nso and know they have support.'' xi\n  To better protect State witnesses from intimidation, threats, and \nviolence, and to send loud and clear the\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\nmessage that serious penalties will be imposed on those who dare to \nobstruct justice in our country Senator Specter on February 23, 2010, \nintroduced The State Witness Protection Act of 2010,'' S. 3017. The \nbill ensures that State witnesses will receive the same protections \nfrom actions of intimidation and retaliation that Federal witnesses \nhave under Federal law. Making this a Federal offense and bringing in \nthe FBI to investigate, as Commissioner Ramsey testified, ``would make \na tremendous difference and make people think twice before they'' \nengaged in witness intimidation. Commission Ramsey explained it this \nway:\n\n       I just think the whole environment or atmosphere when you \n     go into a Federal court versus a local court is just somewhat \n     different, and [defendants] haven't been exposed to it that \n     often. I just think it has an impact in the feedback I've \n     gotten from people on both sides, whether it's another law \n     enforcement agency or from a person who's been in the \n     criminal justice system. They do not want to go into Federal \n     court. (Tr. at 16).xii\n\n  The bill tracks the language of the Federal witness tampering and \nintimidation statutes, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1512 and 1513, and provides \nthe same penalties for crimes against State witnesses as now are \nprovided for crimes against Federal witnesses. For State court \nproceedings, the bill makes it a Federal offense to kill, physically \nharm, threaten to physically harm, harass, or intimidate, or offer \nanything of value to, a State court witness or victim if done with the \nintent to influence another person's testimony; to induce another to \nwithhold testimony or records, alter or destroy evidence, evade legal \nprocess, or be absent from a State proceeding if that person has been \nsummoned by legal process; to hinder or prevent a person from providing \ninformation to law enforcement; or to retaliate against anyone for \nbeing a witness or for providing testimony or information to law \nenforcement.\n\n  Federal jurisdiction is established by prosecuting only cases where \nthere are communications in furtherance of the offense by mail, \ninterstate or foreign commerce by any means, including computer, \ninterstate or foreign travel in furtherance of the commission of the \noffense, or the use of weapons which have been shipped or transported \nacross State lines. Any attempt or conspiracy to commit these same \noffenses is also illegal and subject to the same penalties. The bill \nalso provides for specific sentencing guideline enhancements for all \nobstruction offenses.\n  To further address the growing problem of witness intimidation, \nSenator Specter cosponsored, and voted out of Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on March 22, 2010, the Witness Security and Protection Grant \nProgram Act of 2010, H.R. 1741, a bill which authorizes $150 million in \ncompetitive grants over 5 years to State and local governments to \nestablish witness assistance programs. Specifically, the bill requires \nthe Attorney General to make competitive grants to State and local \ngovernments to establish and maintain short-term witness protection \nprograms for court proceedings involving homicide, violent felonies, \nserious drug offenses, gangs, and/or organized crime. It also requires \nthe Attorney General to collect data and develop best practices--\nwitness safety, short-term and permanent witness relocation, and \nfinancial and housing assistance--from the grantees and report this \ninformation back to Congress, States and other relevant entities. This \nlegislation passed the House with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of \n412-11 in June 2009. The bill is also supported by the National \nGovernors Association, the National Conference of Mayors, the National \nDistrict Attorney Association, and the National Center for Victims of \nCrime. It is currently pending action on the Senate floor.\n  According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Philadelphia bail system \nis broken.xiii For both the Court of Common Pleas and the \nMunicipal Courts in Philadelphia, there are 48,511 cases in fugitive \nstatus and 39,110 individual fugitives. These numbers do not include \nprobation absconders which, if added, would make the total individual \nfugitive number 46,839.xiv\n  According to Bureau of Justice Statistics report from 2004, \nPhiladelphia is tied with Newark, NJ, as having the Nation's highest \nfugitive felony rate of 11 percent. The problem is compounded because \nthere are only 51 officers in the Warrant Unit,xv which is \nassigned the task of rounding up fugitives. That means each officer has \na 900 fugitive case load.xvi The problem is further \ncompounded by the fact that fugitives, after they are caught, are \nroutinely released again on bail and no bail money, once again, is \ncollected. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the city is owed $1 \nbillion in bail monies which cannot be collected because the Clerk of \nQuarter Sessions kept no computerized records.xvii\n  To address the failure of law enforcement to track down and capture \ncriminal fugitives, Senator Specter convened another Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee field hearing on January 19, 2010, titled, ``Exploring \nFederal Solutions to the State and Local Fugitive Crisis.'' \nxviii Seth Williams, the recently elected district attorney \nfor the city of Philadelphia, testified at the hearing. Also testifying \nat the hearing were John Patrignani, the Acting U.S. Marshal for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania; David Preski, the Chief of the Pre-\nTrial Service Division and the person in charge of the Warrant Unit; \nand Roy G. Weise, the Senior Adviser for the FBI's Criminal Justice \nInformation Systems and a senior administrator in charge of the \nNational Criminal Justice Information System, more commonly known as \nNCIC, the national warrant database. A representative from the Clerk of \nQuarter Sessions also testified. That hearing revealed that \nPhiladelphia's fugitive problem, though very serious in scope, is not \njust a local problem but is in fact a significant national problem. \nNationwide, there are an estimated 2.8 to 3.2 million active Federal, \nState, and local outstanding felony warrants. Every day large numbers \nof fugitives evade capture because State and local law enforcement \nauthorities have insufficient resources to find and arrest them. And \neven if found, State and local law enforcement authorities often do not \nhave the funds to pay for the extradition of the fugitive to face \ntrial. Shockingly, many fugitives are released without prosecution. \nMany fugitives go on to commit additional crimes.\n  The nationwide database operated by the FBI's National Crime \nInformation Center, NCIC, is missing over half of the country's 2.8 to \n3.2 million felony warrants, including warrants for hundreds of \nthousands of violent crimes. Fugitives who have fled to another State \nwill not be caught--even if they are stopped and questioned by the \npolice on a routine traffic stop--because their warrants have not been \nentered into the NCIC database.\n  In early 2008, the St. Louis Post Dispatch published a series of \narticles--affirmed by the Department of Justice--documenting law \nenforcement's widespread failure to find and arrest \nfugitives.xix For purposes of the series, ``fugitive'' \nincluded un-arrested suspects with pending warrants that law \nenforcement cannot find, and those who cannot be found after violating \nthe rules of their pre-trial detention, probation, or parole. The \narticles revealed that the reach of this national problem is extensive \nand cited federal estimates from 2 years ago that as many as an \nestimated 800,000 to 1.6 million outstanding State or local warrants \nare inaccessible to law enforcement outside the State or locality in \nwhich they were issued because the information about the warrants had \nnot been entered into the NCIC database.\n  In Philadelphia, while all warrants, including bench warrants, are \nentered into a State database, only a few warrants are entered into the \nNCIC database. The hearing established a little known fact: that the \nPhiladelphia Police Department only entered into the NCIC database a \nfew hundred bench warrants deemed by the District Attorney's Office to \nconcern extraditable offenses and, surprisingly, the Police Departments \nmade these entries manually and not by automatic computer \ntransfers.xx Thus, those who abscond from criminal \nproceedings in Philadelphia and flee to other States likely will not be \ncaptured because information from their warrants was not automatically \nentered into the NCIC database.\n  To make our communities safer by increasing the number of State and \nlocal fugitives arrested and prosecuted, Senator Specter, along with \nSenator Durbin, on March 16, 2010, introduced the Fugitive Information \nNetworked Database Act of 2010, known as the FIND Act, S. 3120. Based \non legislation\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nthat then-Senator Joe Biden and Senator Durbin introduced in 2008, the \nFIND Act bolsters the effectiveness of the NCIC database by providing \ngrants for local governments to develop and implement warrant systems \nthat are interoperable with the NCIC database. The bill also provides \nfunding for authorities to extradite fugitives for prosecution.\n\n  Specifically, the FIND Act improves the entry and validation of \nState, local and tribal warrants in the NCIC database by authorizing \n$10 million for grants each fiscal year 2011 through 2015. It increases \nfor States, local and Indian tribes the resources available for \nextraditing fugitives between States and tribal regions by authorizing \n$30 million for grants each fiscal year 2011 through 2015. The bill \nalso encourage States, local and tribes to reduce the cost of \nextradition by using the U.S. Marshals Service's Justice Prisoner and \nAlien Transportation Service, JPATS, to transport fugitives back to the \njurisdiction which issued the warrant and requires grant participants \nwhich seek renewal grants to provide detailed reports to ascertain \nwhether State, local and tribal pretrial release programs are operating \neffectively. To make certain that funds are properly spent, the bill \ndirects GAO to submit a statistical report to the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees on felony warrants issued by State, local, and \ntribal governments and entered into the NCIC database, and on the \napprehension and extradition of persons with active felony warrants.\n  This important legislation is designed to facilitate State and local \ndata entry into the NCIC database through grants, increase the \nextradition of fugitives travelling in interstate commerce and to \nascertain whether pretrial release programs are operating effectively. \nThe fugitive problem is national in scope, involves individuals \ntravelling in interstate commerce, and requires Federal solutions.\n  After the January 19, 2010, field hearing, on February 24, 2010, \nSenator Specter wrote to the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service, \nUSMS, to advise him ``that Philadelphia has the highest violent crime \nrate in the United States among the ten largest cities and the highest \nfelony fugitive rate in the nation,'' and therefore critically needed \nadditional funding for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania's fugitive \ntask force. On April 2, 2010, John F. Clark, the Director of the U.S. \nMarshals Service, responded to Senator Specter's letter and said that \nthe agency would expand the Philadelphia regional office by at least 10 \nmarshals and staff to ``work aggressively to address the fugitive \nproblem in Philadelphia.''\n  As part of Senator Specter's continued efforts to address the \nPhiladelphia fugitive crisis, he has made several program funding \nrequests for fiscal year 2011 to support the USMS and its partners, \nincluding: $1.207 billion for the U.S. Marshals Service, increased \nfunding for the Edward Byrne memorial justice grants, and $792 million \nfor the COPS program. Additionally, Senator Specter has requested \nreport language that would direct $20 million to be used to support the \nestablishment of a Regional Fugitive Task Force in Philadelphia.\n  On May 3, 2010, Senator Specter chaired the third and final Judiciary \nCrime Subcommittee hearing to bring leaders in the criminal justice \nsystem together to find innovative and cost effective solutions to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of the criminal justice system in \nPhiladelphia, as well as for similarly overburdened state criminal \ncourts.xxi Lynne M. Abraham, former district attorney for \nPhiladelphia, Justice Seamus McCaffery, Pennsylvania Supreme Court, \nEverett Gillison, deputy mayor for public safety for the city of \nPhiladelphia, Ellen Greenlee, chief defender, Philadelphia, and \nProfessor John Goldkamp, chair of the Criminal Justice Department at \nTemple University, testified. The hearing emphasized the need for all \nthe key players--the courts, the prosecutors, the defenders and the \ncity--to work in a collaborative fashion to find solutions to these \ncomplex and systemic problems. The subcommittee and witnesses explored \nthe following ideas:\n  Community based prosecutions and zone courts. Sending police officers \nto many different courtrooms is wasteful and inefficient. A simple \nsolution is reorganizing the criminal courts along geographic lines so \nthat judges are assigned to handle all cases from a particular police \ndivision. Zone courts are more efficient and lead to fewer dismissal of \ncases, fewer trial delays and provide more judicial economy and \naccountability.\n  Improving computer systems for both the District Attorney's Office \nand the Defenders Office. This would expedite discovery and permit \nfaster and more efficient administration of justice. Offices should be \nable to have networked case files and operate as a paperless office. \nThis would require extensive capital investment.\n  Institute new diversion programs for nonviolent and low risk \noffenders.\n  Establish more specialty treatment courts, such as mental health \ncourts, veterans courts xxii and re-entry courts, to reduce \nrecidivism.\n  Reform the bail system. Professor Goldkamp, an expert on \nPhiladelphia's bail system, recommended improving the pre-trial release \nsystem to one which makes decisions about release and confinement based \non the characteristics of the defendants, not by how much cash they can \npost. Risky defendants should be detained, with due-process \nprotections, but those who do not need confinement to meet their \nobligations or those who do not pose that much risk, like most addicted \ndefendants, should not be jailed. Drug addicted defendants should go to \ntreatment; mentally ill defendants should be directed to appropriate \nsupport services.\n  Find effective ways to address the anti-snitch culture, including \npublic service announcements and community outreach.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer's ``Justice: Delayed, Dismissed, Denied'' \nseries rightly identified and proved a number of the systemic failings \nin the Philadelphia criminal justice system which have contributed to \nPhiladelphia having an unacceptably low conviction rate for violent \ncrimes and an unacceptably high rate of fugitives. Many of these \nproblems have been around for decades and over the years have only \ngotten worse. By using statistics from the Administrative Office of the \nPennsylvania Courts and the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer convincingly turned a harsh light on what many in \nthe criminal justice system have known, and what many have chosen to \nignore.\n  Professor Goldkamp stated at the May 3, 2010, Senate field hearing, \n``I think that opportunity comes in at a time of crisis and concern.'' \nBut if the needed changes are not made, Professor Goldkamp said ``the \nPhiladelphia court system risks being held up nationally as an example \nof a dysfunctional court system.'' xxiii\n  Senator Specter noted at the final field hearing that the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer's series was a ``motivating factor'' in his \nworking to obtain Federal assistance to local and overburdened courts. \nNow is the time for change and Senator Specter--by holding three Senate \nfield hearings, by seeking and obtaining funding for the U.S. Marshal's \nfugitive task force, and finally, by introducing and supporting key \nlegislation to better protect State witnesses, to fund State witness \nprotection programs, and to fund State fugitive recovery efforts and \nthe entry of State warrants into the national warrant database--is \nworking hard to make those changes.\n\n\n                                ENDNOTES\n\n       i ``Justice: Delayed, Dismissed, Denied,'' by \n     Craig R.

Available at: .\n       xx When a bench warrant is issued by the \n     Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas and/or Municipal Court in \n     Philadelphia, it is entered into a state-wide criminal case \n     management system called CP/CMS by court staff. CP/CMS \n     electronically transfers that information to the Philadelphia \n     Police Department (PPD) which, in turn, electronically \n     transfers the data to CLEAN, the Commonwealth Law Enforcement \n     Assistance Network database. CLEAN is a computer system used \n     by the Commonwealth's criminal justice agencies for a variety \n     of purposes, including searching for outstanding warrants \n     whenever an individual is detained or taken into custody. \n     From CLEAN the bench warrant data should be electronically \n     transferred to NCIC, the FBI's National Crime Information \n     Center, and to Nlets, the International Justice and Public \n     Safety Information Sharing Network. However, this is not yet \n     occurring in Philadelphia. Instead, in Philadelphia all \n     entries into NCIC are done manually by the Philadelphia \n     Police Department and only those bench warrants designated by \n     the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office as extraditable \n     warrants are entered into NCIC. For a bench warrant to be \n     extraditable, the ADA must get approval from his/her deputy. \n     Usually approval is reserved for those offenders who have \n     significant criminal histories, a number of failures to \n     appear, and/or serious pending criminal charges.\n       xxi ``Helping Find Innovative and Cost Effective \n     Solutions to Overburdened State Criminal Courts.''

Mr. President, the State of Mississippi lost one of its \nmost respected citizens and devoted public servants on December 25, \n2009. Those of us who knew and worked with Charlie Capps were \nprivileged to witness his commitment to the advancement of our State. I \nextend my sincerest sympathies to the family of Charlie Capps--Alinda, \nMargaret, and Charlie III.\n  Charlie Capps was born in Merigold, MS, and graduated from Cleveland \nHigh School. He attended Davidson College until the outbreak of World \nWar II, when he volunteered and enlisted in the U.S. Army.\n  After the war, Charlie founded Capps Insurance and Real Estate \nCompany. However, he was best known as ``Mr. Chairman'' because of his \nservice as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee in the \nMississippi legislature for more than a decade. During his tenure of \nservice in the Mississippi House of Representatives, he served with \nfour speakers of the House--John Junkin, Buddie Newman, Tim Ford, and \nBilly McCoy.\n  Charlie Capps' greatest enjoyment was his association with public \nservice. During his career he was an effective advocate for law \nenforcement, higher education, the arts and cultural heritage, \nworkforce training, agriculture, and wildlife and fisheries \nconservation. Charlie Capps is clearly among our State's finest \ncitizens and certainly one of the most capable public servants of this \ngeneration.\n  The State of Mississippi is a better place to live because of the \nlife of Charlie Capps, and I am privileged that I was able to call him \nmy friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3639-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO TRAVIS SATTERFIELD\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President I am pleased to commend Travis Satterfield \nof Benoit, MS, for his service and contributions to the State of \nMississippi while serving as the 75th president of Delta Council.\n  Delta Council is an economic development organization representing \nthe business, professional, and agricultural leadership of this \nalluvial floodplain commonly known as the Mississippi Delta. The \norganization was formed in 1935 and is widely respected for its role in \nmeeting the challenges which have historically faced the economy and \nquality of life of this region of our State.\n  Travis Satterfield has served as president of Delta Council during a \ntime when our Nation, as well as the State of Mississippi and the \nMississippi Delta, have experienced economic challenges of immense \nproportions.\n  Travis Satterfield took over his family farming operation from his \nparents 40 years ago and has built one of the most successful farming \nenterprises in this intensely agricultural region of our Nation. Travis \nhas brought practical insight and trusted leadership to the cornerstone \nissues confronting the Delta region. His practical approach to problem-\nsolving has had a positive impact on Delta Council's role in many \nimportant areas of work, such as groundwater management, soil and water \nresource conservation, flood control, farm policy and transportation \nimprovements for the region.\n  Travis is a proven leader with strong values. I am confident that \nTravis will continue to be an effective voice for the economic benefit \nof all of the people of the region for many years into the future.\n  In Mississippi, we appreciate Travis Satterfield, his wife Nancy, and \ntheir four sons, Dwayne, Dennis, Darrell, and Kirk, for the sacrifices \nthey have made to help improve the life of all who live and do business \nin the Mississippi Delta.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3639-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3639-S3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL ANGRICK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1972, the Iowa Legislature created \nthe Office of Citizens' Aide to address instances of dissatisfaction \nwith government agencies In 1978, Bill Angrick became the State \nombudsman at age 32, according to the Des Moines Register. Just a few \nweeks ago Bill Angrick announced he would take the State's early \nretirement incentives at age 64.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n  As a member of the State house in 1972, I was enthusiastic about the \ncreation of the ombudsman's office. I had gone from political science \nstudent to state legislator and was beginning to appreciate the value \nof government oversight in the practical world. It is one thing to \nstudy political theory and have a concept of how things should work. It \nis another thing to represent citizens as their elected representative \nand see how things really work. The Federal constitution Framers knew \nwhat they were doing when they built in checks and balances among the \nthree branches of government.\n  The decision to create a State ombudsman wasn't unanimous. The house \nvote was 70 to 28, the Senate vote 30 to 20. Then, as now, those who \nperform government oversight might have been seen as skunks at a \npicnic, fueling fears of those who might abuse their investigative \npowers or among agencies, rein in their power. Inspectors general and \nwhistleblowers at Federal agencies are regularly eyed with suspicion or \ntargeted for retaliation. I run into this at the Federal level all the \ntime. Sometimes the executive branch tries to stifle inspectors general \nor Federal employees who have reports of wrongdoing. Yet those people \nare very often heroes who expose waste, fraud, and abuse, and by \nputting themselves on the line, get problems fixed and strengthen \ngovernment. They deserve honor and protection, which I work to provide. \nAnd I conduct oversight of Federal agencies, just as the voters oversee \nmy performance as their elected representative.\n  By all accounts I have heard, Bill Angrick served his oversight role \nwith the honor, diligence, and integrity envisioned by those of us who \ncreated the State ombudsman's office.\n  His retirement provides a good opportunity to reflect on his work and \non the role of an entity that exists to listen to citizens, investigate \nconcerns, and render findings in the spirit of fixing shortcomings for \npublic benefit. The office exists to perform oversight of State and \nlocal government agencies. Sometimes it initiates investigations upon a \ncitizen phone call of concern or complaint. It receives thousands of \ninquiries every year. Occasionally, my staff in Iowa adds to the \nworkload, referring cases to the ombudsman that deal exclusively with \nState and local government. I appreciate the careful consideration \ngiven in those instances. Other times, the ombudsman's staff sees the \nneed for an investigation of an agency's interaction with a citizen \nover a particular case or multiple agencies' handling of a State matter \nthat is either complex or has fallen through the cracks. As a third \nparty, the ombudsman's office is charged with the responsibility of \nexamining the facts as impartially and thoroughly as possible and \nrendering findings and recommendations in a thoughtful, constructive \nway. The office is removed from the emotions and biases of the people \ninvolved and proceeds without a predisposition toward a certain \noutcome.\n  The workload can involve an issue with broad implications, such as \nState and local governments' treatment of prison inmates, and response \nto child abuse cases. Mr. Angrick's office reviewed whether inmates \nwere held too long in restraining chairs and whether government \nprocedures were adequate to protect children in violent circumstances. \nThe office has given special attention over the years to State and \nlocal governments' treatment of mentally ill and disabled citizens. Mr. \nAngrick recognizes that some challenges are interwoven among segments \nof society and government and merit a comprehensive response. For \nexample, he has given needed understanding of and exposure to the fact \nthat State prisons have become de facto housing for mentally ill \ncitizens in many cases. He is right that government has to address this \nsituation and give appropriate treatment to those who can't advocate \nfor themselves.\n  The ombudsman's workload also involves cases with a more narrow \nfocus. A recent investigation covered a city street superintendent \naccused of using city equipment on his own property and retaliating \nagainst a citizen who complained while local elected officials stood \nby. The resolution of that dispute might not resonate statewide, but it \nis meaningful for the residents of a community who expect their city \nemployees to function aboveboard and expect their elected officials to \nenforce city rules and regulations. The office serves as a check-and-\nbalance backstop on potential abuse of power.\n  However, the ombudsman's office doesn't only conclude that the \ngovernment is wrong. Sometimes it affirms that government agencies \nacted properly, as in 2004 when it concluded that the Iowa Department \nof Natural Resources' investigation of three Asian markets for unlawful \nfish sales was fair and reasonable.\n  The citizens aide office is open to everyone, regardless of position \nand station in life. That equal voice for everyone is critical to its \npurpose and its success. Under Mr. Angrick's leadership, a prison \ninmate's call is taken respectfully and with care for the facts, the \nsame as a mayor's call. Mr. Angrick recognizes that a prisoner should \nnot be abused and is entitled to humane, compassionate treatment and \ncertain rights as he pays his debt to society. This is not only the \nright way to treat our fellow human beings, but it also contributes to \na stronger civic structure. If the prison inmate feels heard, he may \nleave his service with a greater regard for society and the rule of law \nthan he did going into prison. He might not commit a crime the second \ntime.\n  By holding the government accountable, the ombudsman's office builds \nfaith in State and local civic institutions. A well-functioning \ngovernment in which citizens have a voice, are heard, and affect change \nis the best antidote to cynicism about government. My strong impression \nis that Bill Angrick and his staff accomplished the simple slogan of \ntheir office: ``Dedicated to Making Good Government Better.'' I thank \nBill Angrick for his 32 years of service to the people of Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3640-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GREENVILLE SCOTTISH GAMES\n\n Mr. DeMINT.

The school combines \napplied research with concrete field work to produce graduates who are \nhighly skilled and ready to serve successfully in their chosen field. \nUnder the leadership of Dr. Phyllis Ivory Vroom for nearly a decade, \nthe School of Social Work is well positioned to address the \nincreasingly complex problems on a city and state level and beyond.\n  Housed within the School of Social Work is the Center for Social Work \nPractice and Policy Research. This center, established in 2008, seeks \nto facilitate rigorous debate and to expand our understanding of the \nissues affecting disadvantaged individuals, families, and communities. \nThe list of research topics is extensive, from health and human rights \nissues in the Middle East, to women's reproductive health in Africa, to \nsubstance abuse treatment and prevention within our own communities, to \nname only a few.\n  In recent years, the undergraduate degree program has gained \nprominence, ranking first in the nation among social work programs for \nthe last four years by the Gourman Report. The graduate program also is \nhighly regarded. The School of Social Work's graduation rate is among \nthe highest in the university, which speaks to the commitment of the \nfaculty and staff and the hard work and dedication of its student body.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in recognizing past and present \nfaculty, staff, and alumni of the Wayne State University School of \nSocial Work. These individuals have contributed mightily to the \ntremendous success of the school over the past 75 years. I look forward \nto another 75 years of inspired leadership and continued educational \nexcellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3641-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13303 OF MAY 22, 2003--PM-55\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, continuing the \nnational emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. This \nnotice states that the national emergency with respect to the \nstabilization of Iraq declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, \n2003, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken \nin Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 of \nJuly 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, and \nExecutive Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, is to continue in effect beyond \nMay 22, 2010.\n  Obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and \nmaintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development \nof political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq \ncontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with \nrespect to this threat and maintain in force the measures taken to deal \nwith that national emergency.\n  The Iraqi government continues to take steps to resolve debts and \nsettle claims arising from the actions of the previous regime. Before \nthe end of the year, my Administration will review the Iraqi \ngovernment's progress on resolving these outstanding debts and claims, \nas well as other relevant circumstances, in order to determine whether \nthe prohibitions contained in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003, as \namended by Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, on any \nattachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other \njudicial process with respect to the Development Fund for Iraq, the \naccounts, assets, and property held by the Central Bank of Iraq, and \nIraqi petroleum-related products, should continue in effect beyond \nDecember 31, 2010, which are in addition to the sovereign immunity \nordinarily provided to Iraq as a sovereign nation under otherwise \napplicable law.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 12, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3641-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:53 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5051.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3348. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe treatment of documents that express disagreement with decisions of \nthe Board of Veterans' Appeals and that are misfiled with the Board \nwithin 120 days of such decisions as motions for reconsideration of \nsuch decisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am introducing legislation today to protect the \nrights of appeal by claimants before the United States Court of Appeals \nfor Veterans Claims when claimants erroneously file a document with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the document is not transmitted to \nthe court in a timely fashion.\n  Under current law, section 7266 of title 38, United States Code, a \nveteran or other claimant who seeks to have a decision of the Board of \nVeterans' Appeals reviewed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans \nClaims must ``file a notice of appeal with the court within 120 days \nafter the date'' on which the board mails its decision to the veteran \nor other claimant.\n  This measure would respond to a problem identified in a recent \ndecision of the court in the case of Posey v. Shinseki, decided April \n23, 2010. In that case, a veteran sent a document purporting to be an \nappeal to the court to a VA regional office. The document was not \nforwarded to the court within the 120 day period. VA sought to have the \nappeal dismissed as untimely filed. However, the court found that the \ndocument qualified as a motion for reconsideration by the board.\n  Judge Lawrence B. Hagel authored a concurring opinion in which he \nexpressed concern with the number of cases in which a claimant's right \nto appeal to the court had been thwarted because the Secretary had held \ncorrespondence from veterans seeking to appeal to the court until after \nthe time for filing had expired. The Secretary would then argue that \nthe claimant's appeal to the court was untimely and should be \ndismissed. Some of those cases resulted in dismissal of the appeal. \nJudge Hagel suggested that this problem could be addressed by \nlegislation treating a document as a motion for reconsideration by the \nBoard if it was received by the Secretary and not forwarded to the \nCourt within the 120 day period.\n  I do not believe that VA has acted deliberately to impede any \nveteran's right to appeal to the court. However, the failure of VA to \nnotify a veteran promptly of the filing error or to forward the \ndocument to the court should not be allowed to deprive a veteran of the \nright to have a case reviewed on appeal. The bill I am introducing \nwould only apply in those cases where no appeal is filed with the court \nwithin the 120-day time period and the board or other VA agency has \nreceived during that same 120-day period a document expressing \ndisagreement with the board decision.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this bill so that any veteran who \nattempts to appeal a decision of the Board in a timely fashion does not \nhave his or her attempt thwarted by an error.\n  Mr. Presiodent, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3348\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the interest of the United States to promote \n     good governance in the extractive industries sector. \n     Transparency in revenue payments benefits oil, gas, and \n     mining companies, because it improves the business climate in \n     which such companies work, increases the reliability of \n     commodity supplies upon which businesses and people in the \n     United States rely, and promotes greater energy security.\n       (2) Companies in the extractive industries sector face \n     unique tax and reputational risks, in the form of country-\n     specific taxes and regulations. Exposure to these risks is \n     heightened by the substantial capital employed in the \n     extractive industries, and the often opaque and unaccountable \n     management of natural resource revenues by foreign \n     governments, which in turn creates unstable and high-cost \n     operating environments for multinational companies. The \n     effects of these risks are material to investors.\n\n     SEC. 996.

PROHIBITION ON NEGATIVELY AMORTIZING MORTGAGES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2008 financial crisis was caused, in part, by poor \n     quality, high risk mortgages\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\n     that were included in mortgage-backed securities, and that \n     incurred higher rates of delinquency and loss than \n     traditional mortgages, damaging thousands of financial \n     institutions holding the mortgages. Those poor quality, high \n     risk mortgages included billions of dollars in negatively \n     amortizing mortgages.\n       (2) Negative amortization of mortgage loans leads to \n     increased monthly loan payments for borrowers, which, in \n     turn, increases the risk of loan default. During the recent \n     financial crisis, negatively amortized loans defaulted in \n     record numbers, damaging financial institutions and other \n     investors holding those assets.\n       (3) Years ago, Federal banking regulators banned negatively \n     amortizing credit card loans as a threat to the safety and \n     soundness of banking institutions.\n       (4) Federal financial regulators and Inspectors General \n     have testified before Congress that negatively amortizing \n     loans pose a threat to the safety and soundness of United \n     States banks, and to the financial markets where these high \n     risk mortgages are sold and securitized.\n       (b) Prohibition on Negatively Amortizing Mortgages.--\n     Section 129 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1639) is \n     amended by adding at the end following:\n       ``(n) Prohibition on Negatively Amortizing Mortgages.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Any person who sells, transfers, or \n     plans to sell or transfer at least 1,000 mortgages, mortgage-\n     backed securities, or similar financial instruments within a \n     calendar year shall not include or reference in any of such \n     financial instruments any mortgage in which the loan balance \n     may negatively amortize.\n       ``(2) Applicability.--This subsection does not apply to \n     home equity conversion mortgages, as defined under section \n     255 of the National Housing Act (commonly referred to as \n     `reverse mortgages') that are otherwise regulated by a \n     Federal or State agency.\n       ``(3) Rule of construction.--As used in this section, the \n     term `mortgage' shall not be construed to be restricted or \n     limited only to mortgages referred to in section 103(aa).''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The requirements under subsection \n     (n)(1) of section 129 of the Truth in Lending Act (as added \n     by subsection (b)) shall take effect not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4003.

Res. 522\n\n       Whereas since 1990, National Nurses Week is celebrated \n     annually from May 6, which is known as National Recognition \n     Day for Nurses, through May 12, which is the birthday of \n     Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing;\n       Whereas National Nurses Week is a time of year to reflect \n     on the important contributions that nurses make to provide \n     safe, high-quality health care;\n       Whereas nurses are known to be patient advocates, acting \n     fearlessly to protect the lives of those under their care;\n       Whereas nurses represent the largest single component of \n     the health care profession with 3,100,000 jobs;\n       Whereas nurses are experienced researchers, and their work \n     encompasses a wide scope of scientific inquiry, including \n     clinical research, health systems and outcomes research, and \n     nursing education research;\n       Whereas nurses are well positioned to provide leadership to \n     eliminate health care disparities that exist in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas nurses help inform and educate the public to \n     improve the practice of all nurses and, more importantly, the \n     health and safety of the patients they care for;\n       Whereas survey data shows that enrollments in entry-level \n     baccalaureate programs in nursing rose by 3.6 percent in \n     2009, and though this marks the ninth consecutive year of \n     enrollment growth, the annual increase in student capacity in \n     4-year nursing programs has declined sharply since 2003 when \n     enrollment was up by 16.6 percent;\n       Whereas nursing programs in the United States were forced \n     to reject almost 119,000 qualified applicants according to \n     the most recent survey of all prelicensure nursing programs;\n       Whereas according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, \n     employment of registered nurses is expected to grow by 22 \n     percent from 2008 to 2018, which is a much faster rate of \n     growth than the average rate of growth for all occupations;\n       Whereas according to survey data, enrollment in doctoral \n     nursing programs increased by more than 20 percent this year, \n     signaling strong interest among students in careers as \n     nursing scientists, faculty, primary care providers, and \n     specialists;\n       Whereas expanding capacity in baccalaureate and graduate \n     programs is critical to sustaining a healthy nursing \n     workforce and providing patients with the best care possible;\n       Whereas the nationwide nursing shortage has caused \n     dedicated nurses to work longer hours and care for more \n     acutely ill patients;\n       Whereas nurse educators work on average more than 57 hours \n     per week in order to ensure that each and every new \n     registered nurse receives an excellent education, advancing \n     excellence among the next generation of nurses;\n       Whereas nurses inform legislators on the education, \n     retention, recruitment, and practice of all nurses and, more \n     importantly, the health and safety of the patients they care \n     for; and\n       Whereas increased Federal and State support is needed to \n     enhance existing programs and create new programs to educate \n     nursing students at all levels, to increase the number of \n     faculty members to educate nursing students, to create \n     clinical sites and have appropriately prepared nurses teach \n     and train at those sites, to create educational opportunities \n     to retain nurses in the profession, and to educate and train \n     more nurse research scientists who can discover new nursing: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes National Nurses Week;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Nurses Week;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of quality higher education \n     in nursing, including baccalaureate and graduate programs, to \n     meet the\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\n     needs of one of the fastest growing labor fields in the \n     Nation; and\n       (4) supports the nurse capacity initiatives for \n     institutions of higher education included in the Higher \n     Education Opportunity Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/12/senate-section/article/S3662-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING DEEPWATER HORIZON CREW MEMBERS\n\n  Mr. DODD.
