Mr. President, the issue before the Senate today is what we \ndo with Mother Nature. Mother Nature has been very difficult to deal \nwith. The Presiding Officer, being from the State of Alaska, is used to \nthis kind of weather, but most of us are not. We have one snowstorm and \nthat is usually it for the year, but we have had a series of them this \nyear. Maybe it is a result of the Senator from Alaska bringing the \nweather with him.\n  What we are trying to do--we don't have it worked out yet--we may be \nable to get consent to start the judge vote pretty soon and have that \nrun for a reasonable period of time and then have the second vote be \nopen for some considerable period of time so that people, if they are \nhere, could vote on both and then go home if they are Washington \nresidents or some people who are having trouble getting here could be \nhere on time to vote on that. We are close to being able to work that \nout.\n  I would also say we are contemplating, if we can work out the \nprocedural difficulties, not being in session tomorrow. We have some \nthings we have to work out prior to that time because, as most everyone \nknows, we have been working on a bill to end this work period. It is \nreally a nice piece of legislation. It started with a bipartisan jobs \ntax credit with Hatch and Schumer; we have a section 171 small business \ntax issue that small businesses are really looking for; we have a \nhighway bill extension; and we also have Build America Bonds.\n  We also, prior to the end of this month, have to do some things that \nare extremely important to the country. We have to extend the PATRIOT \nAct. We have a number of other things we have to extend. We have only \nbeen able to get agreement to extend those for short periods of time, \nbut they need to be done--some tax extenders. We have to do a number of \nthose things. We hope we can merge the two. We will make that \ndetermination, how we are going to do that, in the next few hours. We \nhave a message that we can use from the House, so we do not need \npermission to move to that.\n  The issue before the Senate and the decision I have to make after \nspeaking to the Republican leader is what we do when we come back here \non Thursday. We will have an intervening day. I would rather not be in \nsession tomorrow if, in fact, we have to file cloture on that package I \njust talked about. I have told everyone what I think would be the \nappropriate way to do it is to get on that bill and to have some \namendments on both sides. I hope we can do that. We really need to \nfinish the bill this week. I hope we can do that in a reasonable time.\n  It appears from what I have been able to determine that the storm \nwill end sometime early tomorrow evening. The problem is, the streets \nin the DC area are pretty difficult, so we would have to make sure \neveryone has time Thursday to get here. There are some people who live \nin the suburbs when they are in Washington, so we have to make sure \nthey have time to get here.\n  Anyway, we are working on these issues. We have the Presidents Day \nrecess. I hope we do not have to work\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\ninto the weekend to complete that. It is really difficult to put all \nthis stuff over. People's lives are really on the line with our being \nable to create some jobs. The four things I have been talking about we \nhave been told by the Congressional Budget Office would create jobs \nimmediately--not next year but now.\n  So I hope we can work through this. I have had one discussion already \nwith the Republican leader today, and I will have some more before the \nday is out. That is about the best information I can give Senators for \nthe time being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S510-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

If I may, I missed the first part of what my friend \nwas saying, but I think I understand the gist of it because we had an \nopportunity to talk a couple of times today.\n  The dilemma we currently have on the proposal the majority leader is \nreferring to is that I believe it is the case that not all members of \nthe Finance Committee are yet fully aware of what the package may look \nlike. We also do not have an entire conference that understands it yet. \nIf we are talking about a roughly $80 billion package, no matter how it \nmay be labeled--whether it is another stimulus, whether it is a jobs \nbill, whether it is a combination of both--I would say to my friend \nthat my members need to be able to feel as if they understand what they \nare being called upon to support. So the sooner we could get the \nparameters of the final package, the better.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I hope to be able to get something to the Republican leader \nvery soon. I was told an hour ago that the document is completed. I \nhope that is the case.\n  I do say to everyone in the Senate at this time that we want to work \nthrough this in an orderly way. I want to make sure both the Republican \nconference and the Democratic conference have a chance to see the bill. \nThat is fair and that is what we need to do. But I do say to everyone, \nin addition to that, if, in fact, there is a procedural deadlock we \nfind ourselves in Thursday because of filing cloture on this package--I \nhave explained to everyone that I have no intention of trying to jam \nanybody on this. It is a jobs bill. We have to let the American people \nknow we are really trying hard to get something done that will create \njobs immediately. So I will do my very best to make sure everybody has \nan opportunity to see everything on this proposed legislation.\n  If we wind up Thursday on this legislation, I will continue being as \ncooperative as I can be to make sure people who want to change this in \nsome way legislatively will be able to do that. I may, as I have \nalready indicated to everybody, have to stop amendments in order to get \nto where we are on Thursday. But I will be happy to open up the vehicle \nand have people offer amendments. I have no concern at this stage \nabout, frankly, whether the amendments are germane or relevant, just if \npeople want to offer amendments on some subject and to have the ability \non both sides to do that, we should be able to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S510-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          PAYING DOWN THE DEBT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, recent warnings from Moody's that the United \nStates will have to begin addressing our debt in order to avoid \ndowngrading our triple-A bond rating mean that we have to get serious \nabout doing something about the latest deficit and debt projections. \nThe President's new budget proposal estimates that the Federal deficit \nfor fiscal year 2010 will be roughly $1.6 trillion, the largest in \nAmerican history. It also projects that the deficit we will accumulate \nover the next decade will increase the U.S. national debt by $8.5 \ntrillion. By the year to 2020, our total public debt will have \nsurpassed $18 trillion and will make up an astounding 77 percent of \ngross domestic product.\n  We all agree that this debt poses a major threat to America's future \nprosperity, and we all agree that slashing debt should be a top \nnational priority. How can we do it? There are four principal ways to \nreduce government debt: No. 1, inflate the dollar; No. 2, raise taxes; \nNo. 3, cut spending; and No. 4, increase economic growth. Let me \nbriefly discuss each.\n  First, inflation. Inflation is tempting for governments looking to \nmitigate their debt problem, but its economic consequences are \ncatastrophic. As President Ronald Reagan famously said, inflation is \n``as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber, and as \ndeadly as a hit man.'' Although America has not experienced painfully \nhigh consumer price inflation since the late 1970s and early 1980s, we \nall remember what it took to kill that inflation: soaring interest \nrates and a deep recession, the worst since the Second World War. As \nformer Wall Street Journal editor George Melloan notes in his new book, \n``The Great Money Binge,'' inflation is ``a tax no one can escape.'' \nAnd it is one that disproportionately hurts lower and middle-income \nAmericans and older Americans with savings.\n  Taxes, a second option for trimming our debt burden, would have to be \nraised significantly. But, of course, raising taxes is the last thing \nwe should do amid a tentative economic recovery. For evidence of what \ntaxes do to a shaky economy, look at what happened during Japan's lost \ndecade. In the early 1990s, the Japanese experienced a stock market \ncrash, a financial crisis, and a recession. The government took several \nsteps to address the downturn. Among other things, it reduced income \ntaxes. Then, just as the Japanese economy was recovering--thanks partly \nto these tax cuts--the government raised taxes. The result: Japan fell \nback into recession. I hope the administration keeps this history in \nmind before raising taxes at the end of the year, as President Obama \nhas pledged to do.\n  A third way to lower the national debt would be to cut Federal \nspending, which is always painful for Congress but particularly in a \nsituation such as this one is absolutely necessary. The administration \nhas been touting a temporary spending freeze that would begin next \nyear, but this freeze would apply only to discretionary nondefense \nspending which comprises a small fraction of the total budget, about 13 \npercent. Moreover, this freeze doesn't go into effect until the next \nfiscal year, and it would not apply to the new stimulus bill the Senate \nwill soon take up. There is a lot of waste in government, and we have \nto look even harder for additional ways to save and be more responsible \nwith Americans' money. Spending less is the only real way to work off \nthe debt in the long term.\n  The fourth way to get out of this debt is through economic growth, \nbut\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\nthis debt explosion could have a significantly negative impact on our \nability to grow by leading to higher interest rates and squelching \ninvestment. Economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff lay hard \nnumbers to this claim in a new paper entitled ``Growth in a Time of \nDebt.'' They write:\n\n       When gross external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual \n     growth declines by about 2 percent; for levels of external \n     debt in excess of 90 percent of GDP, growth rates are roughly \n     cut in half.\n\n  Remember, the President's budget projects debt to reach 77 percent of \nGDP by 2020. So even though growth could eventually enable us to manage \nand, over time, reduce and perhaps even eliminate our debt, there is a \npoint at which the amount of debt itself inhibits growth, our ability \nto grow, and obviously we have to tackle the problem of increasing \ndebt, increasing spending, even if we are to hope to grow our way out \nof the debt problem we have.\n  Over the long term then, the only way to permanently lower our debt \nis to hold Federal spending in check and promote strong economic growth \nsuch as through lower taxes. This has proven to work time and time \nagain.\n  Whether we look to the 1920s, the 1960s, or the 1980s, history shows \nus that reducing marginal income tax rates is a highly effective way to \nstimulate an economic expansion. To that end, I hope the administration \ndecides to make the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent.\n  I also hope it reconsiders its plan to raise taxes on U.S. \nmultinational corporations. The administration argues that many U.S. \ncorporations are keeping their profits overseas. But as the Cato \nInstitute economist Chris Edwards pointed out, the reason that U.S. \nmultinationals are moving their profits abroad is that America has the \nsecond highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. Only Japan \nhas a higher rate.\n  Lowering corporate income taxes would spur investment and job \ncreation at home and make us more competitive abroad. Keeping marginal \ntax rates where they are would enable small business entrepreneurs to \nbegin hiring and expanding. That is the key to recovery and to debt \nreduction.\n  So, again, strong growth and spending discipline is the only \nsustainable solution to the debt problem. I urge my colleagues to keep \nthis in mind as we continue to debate this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nMr. Craig Becker to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board. \nMr. Craig Becker is the first person--I repeat, the first person--\nnominated for a term on the National Labor Relations Board who comes \ndirectly from a labor organization.\n  Mr. Becker is an officer and associate general counsel of two of our \nNation's largest unions, the AFL-CIO and the SEIU. These unions clearly \nhave a substantial interest in the most important decisions presently \npending before the Board.\n  Now, it is one thing to come from private law practice representing \nemployers or unions as clients under the circumstances. It is quite \nanother to come to the Board directly from being an officer and \nassociate general counsel of a labor organization with, as mentioned, \nsubstantial interests in multiple matters pending or that will be \npending before the Board.\n  Last week's hearing was clearly necessary, as it revealed that while \nMr. Becker will recuse himself for a period of 2 years, and only for 2 \nyears, from those instances when his former employers, the \ninternational unions, are a party in a Board proceeding, he did not \ncommit to recuse himself from cases raising issues in which the \ninternationals are involved or impacted, and he did not commit to \nrecuse himself from cases involving the locals of those two \ninternational unions.\n  Parties before the Board, whether union or employer, have a right to \na fair and impartial tribunal. The confirmation of an officer and \nassociate general counsel of two of our Nation's largest unions for a \nterm on the National Labor Relations Board will make the appearance of \njustice and many of the decisions in which he participates impossible \nto achieve.\n  Further, to the extent he interprets the act to adopt the policy \nimperatives of the SEIU or the AFL-CIO and not those expressed by \nCongress in the act, he will further undermine the Board and sow \ncynicism in the labor/management community as well as amongst workers \nwhose rights to engage in protected concerted activity or refrain from \ndoing so are protected under the act.\n  Mr. Becker's writings suggest that he believes the Board can \nimplement provisions of the Employee Free Choice Act into labor law \nthrough decisions of the Board. This view suggesting the Board can do \nwhat Congress has not authorized should raise concerns with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Let me read a quote from Mr. Becker's colleague, Mr. Stewart Acuff, \nthe AFL-CIO's director of organizing from a February 3, 2010, posting \non the Huffington Post. This is just last week.\n\n       We are very close to the 60 votes we need. If we are not \n     able to pass the Employee Free Choice Act, we will work with \n     President Obama and Vice President Biden and their appointees \n     to the National Labor Relations Board to change the rules \n     governing forming a union through administrative action to \n     once again allow workers in America access to one of the most \n     basic freedoms in a democracy.\n\n  This is clear. This is clear. Mr. Becker's colleague, Mr. Acuff, \nclearly indicates what Mr. Becker's agenda would be, which would be to \nviolate what is absolutely only a prerogative of the Congress of the \nUnited States. This type of bias is why the most respected business \ngroups in America are opposing Mr. Becker's nomination. A statement \nopposing Mr. Becker's nomination from the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Nation's largest industrial trade association, \nstates:\n\n       The NAM firmly believes that NLRB members charged with \n     administering our nation's labors laws should protect the \n     principles of fairness and balance that characterize our \n     labor law system. Employees should have the right to \n     information from both employers and union officials and the \n     time to review that information in order to better make \n     important decisions that impact their jobs and families.\n       Unfortunately, Mr. Becker's interpretation of our labor \n     laws does not reflect these principles and casts serious \n     doubt on his ability to administer our nation's laws in an \n     unbiased manner. We are particularly concerned with Mr. \n     Becker's writings in academic journals that argue that the \n     NLRB should limit the ability of employers to communicate \n     with their employees during union organizing campaigns. \n     Specifically, Mr. Becker has claimed in a 1993 Minnesota Law \n     Review article that ``the core defect in union election law . \n     . . is the employer's status as a party to labor \n     representation proceedings.''\n       Mr. Becker has asserted views that the NLRB should rewrite \n     union election rules in favor of union organizers. Such \n     policy decisions should only be determined by Congress. The \n     NAM is particularly concerned that if confirmed, Mr. Becker \n     would seek to advance aspects of the jobs-killing Employee \n     Free Choice Act through actions of the NLRB.\n\n  From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that has only opposed three \nnominees in the last 30 years, I quote from the U.S. Chamber's \nstatement:\n\n       This is only the third time in more than 30 years that the \n     Chamber has opposed a nominee to the Board, most recently the \n     1993 nomination of William B. Gould. Mr. Becker has written \n     prolifically about the National Labor Relations Act, the law \n     he would be charged with interpreting and enforcing should he \n     be confirmed. Many of the positions taken in his writings are \n     well outside the mainstream and would disrupt years of \n     established precedent and the delicate balance in current \n     labor law. These positions have raised significant concerns \n     in the employer community. Among those concerns are the \n     extent to which Mr. Becker would restrictively interpret \n     employers' free speech rights and the extent to which he \n     would seek to expand the use of intermittent strikes and \n     other forms of work stoppages that disrupt the right of \n     employers to maintain operations during labor disputes.\n\n  There may be no one ever nominated to the NLRB more opposed by the \nbusiness community in the entire history of the NLRB. Are we to believe \nthat the President could not find a single person in America who would \nnot elicit this kind of response due to their bias? Last week, over 500 \nemployers signed a letter opposing Mr. Becker's nomination; 23 major \nbusiness associations oppose Mr. Becker's nomination.\n  Mr. Becker's views speak for themselves. But his supporters on the \nleft have explained in full view why they are attempting to seat Mr. \nBecker. From the authors in the left-leaning publication, The Nation, \n``Obama's Pro-Union Nominations to the Labor\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\nRelations Board Stalled,'' January 20, 2010:\n\n       The battle over nominations to the NLRB, even more than \n     EFCA, may be what really determine the extent of labor's \n     gains under Obama. Should Obama persevere and see his \n     nominations confirmed, there is reason to believe that much \n     of what organized labor hopes to accomplish via EFCA will be \n     realized through the rule-making power of the NLRB.\n       If there was any doubt about the euphoria on the left, look \n     no further than what Wade Rathke, the chief organizer of \n     Community Organizations International, formally Acorn \n     International, founder and chief organizer of Acorn, and \n     founder and chief organizer of Local 100, Service Employees \n     International Union, recently wrote:\n       For my money Craig [Becker's] signal contribution has been \n     his work in crafting and executing the legal strategies which \n     have allowed the . . . effective organization of informal \n     workers--home health and home day care--has been the great, \n     exceptional success story within the American labor movement \n     for our generation, leading us to the [forced dues] of \n     perhaps a half-million such workers in unions such as SEIU, \n     AFSCME, CWA, and the AFT.\n       Becker is ``the key lawyer from the beginning in the early \n     1980s who was able to piece together the arguments and \n     representation that allowed those of us involved in trying to \n     organize home health care workers in Illinois, Massachusetts, \n     and elsewhere. . . . [Becker's] role was often behind the \n     scenes devising the strategy with the organizer and lawyers, \n     writing the briefs for others to file, and putting all of the \n     pieces together, but he was the go-to-guy on all of this.''\n\n  Rathke concludes:\n\n       I can remember Keith Kelleher negotiating the subsidy for \n     the SEIU Local 880 in Chicago and always making sure there \n     was the money for the organizers, but that SEIU was also \n     willing to allow access to Craig. . . .\n\n  I just received this, from Alison Reardon of the Service Employees \nInternational Union, who came out with an e-mail today that reads:\n\n       Senator, your attendance is crucial to appointing Craig \n     Becker to the National Labor Relations Board. Please attend \n     Thursday's HELP [executive] Session to report out President \n     Obama's nomination of Craig Becker for Senate confirmation. \n     This is the highest priority for organized labor, and \n     Majority Leader Reid will file Cloture on Friday 2/5, and has \n     assured us [the] Senate will vote to end debate at 5 p.m. \n     Monday 2/8.\n\n  So when this President was elected, he said he would govern from the \ncenter. If Craig Becker's nomination is approved, we will see the \nundermining of a longstanding practice in labor law that should be the \nprerogative of the United States Congress.\n  If the Congress of the United States, in its wisdom, or ignorance, \ndecides to pass EFCA, then that is an act of Congress. It should not \nhappen. Card check should not happen because of an unelected \nbureaucracy, and the National Labor Relations Board is the one to do \nit. Mr. Becker would have that, obviously my conclusion, on his agenda.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the cloture motion on Mr. Becker's \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you take a look at the history of this \ngreat Nation, at least in my lifetime, you cannot miss what happened to \nAmerica immediately after World War II. Veterans came back from that \nwar, thousands of them, and they were greeted with the GI bill, which \nopened the door for them to buy homes, start businesses, start an \neducation, and find good jobs.\n  It may have been one of the most amazing, progressive, positive \nthings we have ever done in our Nation's history: to take a war effort \nand bring it home to create an economic effort in America. Businesses \nwere springing up in every direction. Workers were finding jobs and \nbuilding homes. It was a wonderful time in our Nation's history.\n  Parallel to that GI bill and economic development was the rise of \nunionism in America. More and more workers were able to go into their \nworkplace and bargain collectively for the basics that people need: \nsafety in the workplace, a living wage. So if you work 40 hours a week, \nyou can make enough money to take care of yourself and raise a \nfamily, retirement benefits, health care benefits. These all came about \nat that same period of time after World War II. The rise of the \nAmerican economy, with the returning veterans, and the rise in the \nnumber of people who were belonging to labor unions, in parallel, \nbrought the middle class into reality in America.\n\n  It was a positive force across our Nation. I know a little bit about \nit with my own personal family experience. My mother, my father, my two \nbrothers, and I worked for a railroad in east St. Louis, IL. Dad was a \nlabor organizer. He was not a high-ranking official, but he was a proud \nmember of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks; mom the same. I worked \nvarious times in summer jobs at that same railroad. I knew I was going \nto get not a lavish salary but a decent salary for my work and have \ngood conditions because that union had sat down and bargained so I \nwould be recognized as an employee and protected in terms of the work I \ndid. It made sure I was fairly paid.\n  The same thing was true of many other families, union families, all \nacross America. My mom and dad made it to the 8th grade. They sent \ntheir boys on to high school and to college and I managed to finish law \nschool. It was the American dream, and American unions played a big \nrole in realizing that dream.\n  Now what has happened? Fewer and fewer Americans belong to labor \nunions. Fewer and fewer Americans are able to bargain collectively for \ndecent wages and working conditions and the basic benefits we would \nexpect. What did we see happening across America as a result of that \ntrend? A growing disparity in terms of the wages earned by working \npeople and the amount of money being paid to those who were the \nofficers of corporations. That disparity has reached shocking, if not \ndisgraceful, levels, where people who are at the highest rungs of \ncorporate America are drawing salaries and bonuses dramatically higher \nthan the people who work for them, who actually are productive and \ndoing a good day's work.\n  Many of us believe there is an imbalance here. It is an imbalance \nthat has been created deliberately over the years. As business \ninterests have had more power in Washington, they have made it \nincreasingly difficult for workers to exercise their rights in their \nworkplaces to organize and speak for themselves. The agency that is \nsupposed to be the referee in this battle is the National Labor \nRelations Board. They look for unfair practices by either the workers \nattempting to organize or the business which is being organized. They \nbasically stand by a principle which we all respect; that is, if a \nmajority of the workers want to bargain collectively, they should have \nthe right to do that, to organize in a union, if they wish it.\n  But we know what happens. When organizers come to many businesses--\nnot all of them but many of them--and try to speak to the employees and \ntell them: Here is what we can offer for you if you will join our \nunion, if you will join with your other coworkers in bargaining \ntogether, many times they are not only shunned, they are sent away. If \nthey are fortunate enough to come up with a majority of workers who \nwant to move toward unionizing, they find themselves facing legal \nbattles, one after the other, going on for literally years, until you \nliterally wear out the people who are trying to organize that plant.\n  Complicit in that many times has been the National Labor Relations \nBoard. Without effective and forceful enforcement of the laws that \nexist, without a sense of urgency in decisionmaking, this agency has \nallowed so many workers in America to fall by the wayside and not have \na chance to stand for themselves. Occasionally, it reaches outrageous \nlevels. We saw that in the case of Lilly Ledbetter, a person who was in \na management position, incidentally, at a tire manufacturer down in \nAlabama. She was being discriminated against in the workplace. The laws \ncould not protect her--at least they did not protect her--and she took \nher case to court. The Supreme Court of the United States threw her \ncase out, even though she clearly had been discriminated against. We \nhad to change the law in America because discrimination does take place \nin the workplace and because we say in this country people should be \ntreated fairly.\n  Now the unions come to us and say: We want to change the way we \norganize the workplace. They put together the Employee Free Choice Act. \nThat is their term for the legislation that has been offered. It offers \na new alternative to gauging whether a majority truly wants to organize \na workplace. That bill has been considered in the other\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\nbody. It has not been called in this body, and it is unlikely it will \never be called or passed in its original form. But many of us realize \nit is only fair to make some changes in the way these workplaces are \norganized, so if a majority of workers truly do want to organize, they \nhave that right, they are not harassed and intimidated, threatened and \nfired because they are exercising their right under the law to consider \nbelonging to a union or voting in favor of belonging to a union.\n  Part of this whole discussion relates to the National Labor Relations \nBoard. Before the Senate today is the nomination of Craig Becker from \nthe State of Illinois to be a member of the National Labor Relations \nBoard. You have just heard Senator McCain come and talk about Mr. \nBecker's activities. Senator McCain is my friend. He and I see America \nand perhaps the world in slightly different perspectives from time to \ntime, and we certainly do in this case.\n  The Senator from Arizona was critical of Mr. Becker, saying, well, he \nwas an active organizer for the Service Employees International Union. \nThat is a fact. The fact is, he worked for them in an effort to try to \norganize workplaces, and in many respects he was successful. That was \nhis job. It was nothing illegal. It was an honorable, legal effort on \nhis part to give voice to employees who otherwise did not have one. \nSome of the service employee unions, incidentally, represent people \nwith very modest jobs, people who may be doing custodial work or basic \nmaintenance work or who are overlooked in many organizing efforts. So \nMr. Becker was fighting for them. He was fighting to give folks who \notherwise would not have a chance at least a voice, if not a fighting \nchance, to be treated with some dignity in the workplace.\n  Right now, we know what the facts are when it comes to the National \nLabor Relations Board. If you are in the process of organizing a \nworkplace, and there is a violation of the law, the National Labor \nRelations Board will take 2 years before they make a decision on a \nviolation of the labor laws--2 years. Well, things change in 2 years, \nand the owners of businesses know that. So making a violation and \nwaiting 2 years buys them the time to try to change the sentiment in \nthe workplace. It takes 1 year from actually having an organizing \npetition that is signed before the National Labor Relations Board makes \nits decision.\n  Craig Becker knows that. He comes before us because we believe and \nthe President believes he would be a good person on the National Labor \nRelations Board. It is hard to look at his background and say he is not \nqualified. He clearly is qualified.\n  We know the National Labor Relations Board administers the primary \nlaw governing labor relations in the private sector. It normally has \nfive Members. It currently has only two sitting members, and it is \noften deadlocked on issues. It has led to many legal questions being \nraised about the validity of the Board's decisions.\n  Craig Becker is an accomplished lawyer and academic. As associate \ngeneral counsel for the Service Employees International Union, Craig \nBecker worked to protect the rights of workers to organize. He has \nargued labor and employment law cases at most levels of the Federal \ncourt system, including in the Supreme Court of the United States. Is \nthere anyone who questions this man is qualified for this job? He \ntaught labor law at UCLA, the University of Chicago, and Georgetown \nUniversity. His research and academic work is well respected and cited \nby many others in the field.\n  He was first nominated to fill one of the three openings at the NLRB \nin July 2009. He was renominated by President Obama just last month. \nBoth last year and last month, the HELP Committee--which is chaired by \nmy friend, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who will be on the floor with \nthe ranking minority member, Senator Enzi--approved his nomination. \nSince he was nominated, Mr. Becker has responded to over 300 written \nquestions from Republican Senators--more than nearly any other nominee. \nI do not know how many questions are asked of Supreme Court nominees, \nbut when you ask 300 questions, it is pretty clear it goes beyond \nneeding some information. The idea is to try to trip up the nominee or \nask so many questions you will wear them out. He has met personally \nwith every interested Senator who has wanted to ask him his own \npersonal views. He has addressed the concerns of Senators in \ncongressional hearings--only the second time an NLRB nominee, \nincidentally, had a second hearing in the last 25 years.\n  Throughout this process, Mr. Becker has stated his belief that \nCongress creates labor laws, not the NLRB. I guess there is a parallel \nto this whole argument about judicial activism, where the argument is \nbeing made on the Republican side that if Mr. Becker is brought to the \nNational Labor Relations Board, he is going to make the law. He said, \nclearly, he will not, his job is to basically interpret the law as \nwritten and to implement the law as Congress has passed it. He said, \nrepeatedly, if confirmed, he will apply the law fairly and impartially.\n  Confirming Craig Becker will allow the NLRB to move forward with its \ncongressionally mandated duties, and I am certainly going to support \nhis confirmation.\n  I struggle when I hear my Republican colleagues say: Well, it is not \nfair. When a Democrat is elected President, he might appoint someone to \nthe National Labor Relations Board who is more friendly to the labor \nunions than a Republican appointee. Is that a stunning revelation to \nanyone? What we are looking for are honest people who have no prejudice \nagainst either side and who will try to make the system work and make \nthe National Labor Relations Board work.\n  When I look at some of the statistics about what is going on--the \nnumber of contested decisions issued by the National Labor Relations \nBoard, on a 4-year average, is 426; and the time it takes them, the \nprocessing time from charge to Board decision is 782 days, more than 2 \nyears--it tells me they have broken down in terms of their basic \nresponsibility under the law.\n  If we keep it at two members, and people can question the validity of \nany of their decisions, then those who want to make sure the National \nLabor Relations Board is not an effective working force in our \ngovernment may have their way. I hope they do not. I certainly hope we \nwill reach a point where we will approve this man who has stood before \nthe HELP Committee and this Senate on two separate occasions, answering \nall the questions that have been offered. He comes with solid \ncredentials, in terms of his legal knowledge as well as his life \nexperience. He is a person who I know has worked hard to help those \nless fortunate who are looking for a chance for a living wage and \ndecent working conditions.\n  Are we going to say anyone who comes to the National Labor Relations \nBoard who has worked for a labor union is disqualified? Is that the \nposition being taken by some? I hope not. That is fundamentally unfair. \nIt is akin to saying anyone who owned a business could not be a member \nof the National Labor Relations Board. I would not agree with that.\n  I think we need fairness and balance and impartiality. I think Craig \nBecker will bring that. So I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first of all, just to amplify the record \non the Lilly Ledbetter case, the Supreme Court did not rule against Ms. \nLedbetter. They upheld the statute of limitations of 180 days for \nclaims filed under civil rights laws. She had come to the court, not a \nfew months after the alleged incident, but years and years later. Only \nthen did she try to make a case. The Court was upholding the law which \nthis Congress passed.\n  Secondly, I rise, reluctantly, to oppose the nomination of Craig \nBecker, and I do so based on experience, not based on a whim, not based \non politics but based on what I have experienced in the past 6 months \nin terms of confirmation in labor-related positions.\n  As you may know, I am from Atlanta, GA. That is the home of Delta Air \nLines that has recently merged with Northwest Airlines to form the \nlargest airlines in the United States of America. The National \nMediation Board oversees labor issues with regard to the industry.\n  In the merger of Delta and Northwest, the merger of two different \ncompanies with different cultures--Delta\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nless organized and Northwest more--one of the major questions about \nthat merger as it related to labor law was what would the law be to \ngovern a unionization vote, in this case, of the flight attendants. \nNorthwest flight attendants were organized; Delta's were not. For the \n75-year history of the Railway Labor Act in the United States of \nAmerica, the principle of the National Mediation Board called for a \nmajority vote of all members of the company in the employee class, \nmeaning if there were 1,000 flight attendants in the class, it would \ntake 501 votes to pass a motion to organize.\n  As we considered the nominees for the National Mediation Board in the \nHELP Committee last year, I spent extensive time questioning the two \nDemocrat nominees who were nominated for the Board. I pressed them on \nthis very issue trying to ensure that we had what Senator Durbin \nreferred to; that is, absolutely equal treatment and not a bias in \nterms of determination of labor decisions. I listened to these \nappointees over and over again say they would be fair, they would not \nbe biased, and they did not have a preconceived position, and I voted \nfor them.\n  Within weeks of being seated, they issued a proposed rule at the \nbehest of labor unions, voting 2 to 1 to change the 75-year-old policy. \nIn the face of a unionization vote getting ready to take place at the \nworld's largest airline, they are attempting change the 75-year policy \nof the National Mediation Board. If they are successful, they will \nallow a simple majority of the number of people voting to replace the \ncurrent policy which is a majority of the total number of employees in \nthe class. In the case of the example I gave before in which if there \nwere 1,000 people in the class, under existing law it would take 501 to \norganize. That is fair. By changing to a majority of those voting if \nonly 100 voted, it would only take 51 to vote to organize the entire \nclass of 1,000 employees within a company. That is a radical shift in \nthe balance between labor and management, without any changes on the \nground to merit such a departure from precedent.\n  Secondly, many on the other side are always talking about the \nEmployee Free Choice Act and how we ought to make it easier to \norganize. In 2008, which is the last year for which I have statistics, \n67 percent of all unionization votes under existing law were in favor \nof organizing. EFCA amounts to a solution toward a problem we don't \nhave.\n  Mr. Becker is a very gifted, talented attorney. I sat in for Senator \nEnzi as ranking member at the confirmation hearing we had in the HELP \ncommittee 2 weeks ago, and I asked him about these specific questions. \nHe was very careful and crafty in his answers. I came away not \nconvinced that the statements of Mr. Acuff, the statements of Mr. \nIglitzin, and the statements of former NLRB Member Gould were \ninaccurate. Each of those pro-union experts has written that Mr. \nBecker's appointment offers an opportunity to do by regulatory \nauthority what could not be done on the floor of the Senate in terms of \ncard check and government-written first contracts. This concern, \ncombined with the National Mediation Board's refusal to obey 75 years \nof precedent leads me to only one conclusion. Out of an abundance of \ncaution, I am going to vote against the confirmation of Mr. Becker in \nhopes the administration will send a nominee to the floor who is \ncommitted to a balanced treatment of both organized labor and \nmanagement in this country.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit for the record a list of \nnearly 675 organizations that have written in opposition to Mr. \nBecker's nomination. These groups represent the backbone of our \nNation's economy and the catalysts we will need to create new American \njobs. They believe Mr. Becker's stated views represent a threat to \neconomic growth, and they oppose Mr. Becker as a nominee for the \nNational Labor Relations Board.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to oppose cloture of \nthe nomination of Craig Becker to be a member of the National Labor \nRelations Board. My colleagues know it is very unusual to have a \ncloture vote on a HELP Committee nominee, but this will be the second \nin as many weeks. In fact, these two nominees are the only HELP \nnominations I have opposed. Over 40 HELP nominees have been swiftly \nconfirmed after appropriate consideration in this Congress, but these \ntwo nominees are problematic, and instead of withdrawing the \nnominations as has been done in previous administrations, the majority \nis attempting to force them through.\n  Craig Becker was first nominated last July, and controversy \nsurrounding his nomination has only grown since then. A review of \ndecades of writings by Mr. Becker has revealed that he has advocated \nfor the most radical theories of labor law, pursuing policies such as \nmandatory unionization where an employee would choose which union to \njoin, not whether to join a union; and questioning whether an employer \nhas a right to any involvement at all in the unionization questions in \nhis workplace.\n  In addition to his writings, Mr. Becker has spent the majority of his \ncareer serving as counsel to the two largest labor organizations in \nAmerica, which has raised questions about his ability to fairly \nadjudicate cases involving those unions.\n  On these issues and others, members of the HELP Committee raised a \nnumber of serious concerns. It has been cited as a negative that \nRepublicans on the committee submitted hundreds of written questions to \nMr. Becker, and it is certainly true that we did ask a lot of \nquestions. Last year, Mr. Becker answered 276 questions for the record. \nFollowing his hearing this month, he was sent more than 100 more.\n  The fact that we have submitted over 400 questions and after three \nrounds of questions still do not believe we have gotten definitive \nanswers is merely another sign of the deep concerns about this nominee. \nLast week, the chairman noted Mr. Becker has faced more questions than \nSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. I am not sure I understand the \nrelevance of this fact. I have yet to find the constituent who is \nurging us to ask fewer questions of our nominees to positions of high \npublic trust.\n  Furthermore, if a nominee garners a greater level of public scrutiny \nand larger than usual volumes of questions, we should ask why. This \nunique scrutiny should be a signal that the individual has raised a \ngreat level of concern and controversy. A nominee as controversial as \nCraig Becker should not go forward, and for that reason I will oppose \ncloture today.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has had other \nnominees who, right or wrong, became controversial. Some of those \noccurred while I was chairman. Yet not once did I force through a \nnominee on a party-line cloture vote. We faced partisan opposition for \nnominees for Surgeon General, the Food and Drug Administration, and the \nMine Safety and Health Administration. Oftentimes there appeared to be \nvery little basis for that opposition to my side of the aisle. But \nbecause of the strong opposition, the nominees were not confirmed.\n  In the final 2 years of the last administration, the majority leader \nheld pro forma sessions to even prevent recess appointments, and now \nthe majority, in their control of the calendar, has taken the last 2 \nweeks to try to jam through partisan, controversial nominees while the \npublic is seeking solutions to the many economic problems facing our \nNation.\n  I wish to point out that there is another way. There are three \ncurrent vacancies at the National Labor Relations Board, and the HELP \nCommittee has unanimously approved the President's other two nominees. \nIf the Senate wanted to confirm two new members to the Board, it could \nhave easily done so today. In fact, it could have done so last year. \nOne of these nominees, Mark Pearce, is a labor-side attorney who has \nspent his career representing labor unions. The other is a Republican \nnominee with management-side experience in addition to tenures on the \nstaff of the National Labor Relations Board and in the Senate as my \nlabor policy director, Brian\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\nHayes. Yet these nominees did not inspire objections from HELP members \non either side of the aisle.\n  Both Mr. Hayes and Mr. Pearce met with Senators, answered written \nquestions--not nearly as many because there weren't the same degree or \namount of concerns--and convinced us that they were well qualified and \nable to be impartial. Clearly, being linked to interest groups such as \nlabor unions and having opposing policy positions is not disqualifying \nfor nominees before the HELP Committee. The problem with Mr. Becker's \nnomination is not that he works for unions or that he supports policies \nwhich many of us oppose. We have approved dozens of nominees with whom \nwe disagree.\n  The problem is this nominee has shown in his writings and in his \nresponses to the committee that his thinking is far outside the \nmainstream. This nominee has failed to convince us that he will not \nattempt to circumvent Congress and impose card check-style measures \nadministratively to tilt the playing field against employers.\n  For 7 months Senators have been attempting to address and analyze \nconcerns raised by the employer community and others regarding Mr. \nBecker's writings, particularly the potential for radical changes in \nlabor law that he has advocated and argued can be implemented without \ncongressional authorization. We have also heard concerns about the \nnominee's position on recusal, since he spent more than two decades \nworking with the Nation's two largest labor organizations.\n  There were additional questions about Mr. Becker's status as both an \nemployee of a labor union and as an adviser to the President's \ntransition team. There were questions about Mr. Becker's possible \nauthorship of Executive Orders in that capacity, one of which limited \nthe information given to employees about their right to refrain from \npaying certain union dues.\n  Finally, there were concerns about Mr. Becker's role as SEIU \nassociate general counsel and the SEIU's involvement with the scandal \nsurrounding ACORN and former Illinois Governor Rob Blagojevich. \nSenators attempted to address all of these concerns through interviews, \nwritten questions, and a hearing. However, not all of the concerns were \nfavorably resolved, and last Thursday, the nomination was reported out \non a party-line vote.\n  I have made numerous attempts to alleviate concerns about Mr. \nBecker's stated plans to reinterpret the National Labor Relations Act \nto limit the ability of employers to participate in the process or \notherwise tilt the playing field unfairly against employers. However, \nhis answers have been far from reassuring.\n  When asked if he would ever support imposing the main provisions of \nthe card check bill through regulatory fiat, he left the door open. He \nanswered that while the statute might be interpreted to not permit the \nBoard to uniformly strip employees of the ability to have secret ballot \nelections, impose mandatory binding arbitration, and raise penalties on \nemployers, if presented with arguments that it would, he would keep an \nopen mind.\n  He also told me he believed the Board could impose ``quickie \nelections''--one of the main card check alternatives that has been \ndiscussed. He said he was open to requiring employers to provide \npersonal contact information for all of their employees to any union \nthat asked. He also made it clear he would be open to broadening the \nuse of mandatory bargaining orders in cases where there is no showing \nthat a union has the support of a majority of employees.\n  Despite the hundreds of written questions he has answered, Mr. Becker \nhas failed to convince me he would not enter into the job with a \npreconceived agenda to unfairly tilt the playing field against \nemployers, altering the delicate balance of current labor law.\n\n  The relative freedom from industrial strife that has allowed America \nto prosper since enactment of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 \nis dependent on a balance between the rights of employees to \ncollectively bargain and the right of employers to control their \nworkplace. It is essential that we not allow the balance to be upended \nnow. In this critical time for our economy, our Nation is dealing with \na 9.7-percent unemployment rate, and more than 11 million Americans are \ndrawing unemployment benefits.\n  Comparative studies have shown that enactment of the card check \nprovision will increase unemployment, making the situation only worse. \nBecause of the Board's broad and important agenda, we simply cannot \ntake the risk of supporting this nominee.\n  Two recent developments have given me additional pause in reviewing \nMr. Becker's nomination. First, despite Mr. Becker's vague assertions, \nthere have been several recent articles and statements from his own \nmovement that confirm all our concerns. In The Nation magazine, another \nunion lawyer wrote that all of the card check provisions and the card \ncheck alternative provisions I discussed earlier can be achieved \nwithout congressional authority and stated this as a reason to confirm \nBecker.\n  Former NLRB member, William Gould, made the same point in an article \nlast year, and a union official wrote just last week that:\n\n       If we aren't able to pass the Employee Free Choice Act, we \n     will work with President Obama and Vice President Biden and \n     their appointees to the National Labor Relations Board to \n     change the rules governing forming a union through \n     administrative action.\n\n  There is obviously a high expectation among organized labor \nconstituencies that Mr. Becker can be sent to the National Labor \nRelations Board to deliver wanted policy changes which cannot be \nachieved through Congress. Because he has failed to unequivocally rule \nout that possibility, I can't support his nomination.\n  The second reason I am demanding a high degree of certainty in his \nanswers is my recent direct experience with nominees who claim to have \nno opinions on certain issues and no preconceived agenda but who, once \nconfirmed, immediately take action on what they claim to have no \npreconceived position on. An example of this is the current situation \nat the National Mediation Board, NMB.\n  Last year, the Senate unanimously confirmed two nominees from the \nNational Mediation Board. Some Members, including myself, specifically \nasked each of them about their position on changing the way a majority \nin a unionization election is measured. In response, both these \nnominees testified they had no preconceived agenda to alter rules that \nhad been in place for 75 years. You will recall the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson, had the same concern and asked them \nspecifically, even in private meetings, what their opinion would be. \nYet practically before the ink had dried on their confirmations, these \ntwo nominees began pushing through a regulation that is a wholesale \nreversal of those rules to tilt the playing field to the benefit of \nlabor unions. In their haste, the Democratic members of the Board \nthoroughly disregarded the rights of the single minority member. The \nminority member was given no notice that an effort to initiate \nrulemaking was underway and, instead, was given 1\\1/2\\ hours to review \nthe final rule proposal to determine if she would support it. They even \ntried to stop her from publishing a dissent to the proposal. There are \nstrong indications that the two recently confirmed National Mediation \nBoard members were not forthright with the Senate, and it is clear they \nshowed no respect for the rights of the Mediation Board minority, the \nregulatory process or the legislative process. In promising Senators to \nkeep an open mind going into this decision, these National Mediation \nBoard nominees used the very same language Mr. Becker uses today.\n  Similarly, the President's nominee for the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration faced many concerns from the small business \ncommunity and others about his possible agenda going into office. \nUndoubtedly, the President's nominee for this position would have some \nviews I do not agree with and I fully expect and accept that. But I \nsought to form an understanding with him on an issue that has \ntraditionally drawn bipartisan support; that is, compliance assistance \nprograms at OSHA that substitute ``gotcha'' inspections with advice and \nguidance to cooperatively create safer workplaces and save the \ngovernment money. When it became clear to me the premier compliance \nassistance program--the Voluntary Protection Program or VPP--was being \ndownsized, I asked the OSHA nominee if he supported compliance \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\n  He assured me he ``recognized their great value.'' I asked if he \nwould reevaluate the decision to downsize it. He assured me he would \nand promised to work with the committee. He was confirmed unanimously. \nYet when the budget came out last week, it proposed transferring \nprogram staff to another function and eliminate its funding. This does \nnot meet anyone's definition of ``support.''\n  Now, Mr. Becker is nominated for a different agency and is a \ndifferent nominee. I certainly don't want to impute the actions of \nothers onto Mr. Becker, but my recent experiences with what nominees \nsay in the confirmation process and how they act once confirmed has \nforced me to be far more skeptical of vague assurances.\n  I am also concerned that Mr. Becker's ethics disclosure paperwork has \nnot been updated with the Office of Government Ethics since July 2009, \nnor has the ethics agreement been revised since April 2009. The \nadministration has pledged support for transparency and accountability \nand I, therefore, question their decision to rush this nominee through \nwithout a proper ethics review.\n  Independent boards, such as the National Labor Relations Board, are \nentrusted with a great deal of autonomy. The decisions they hand down \nand the regulations they enforce have a great deal of impact on a very \nsignificant portion of our economy and our Nation's jobs. In the \nSenate, it is our responsibility to determine if these nominees can be \nentrusted with this power or if they would compromise fairness to grant \nfavors to special interest groups or former employers.\n  Late last week, the Senate invoked cloture on Patricia Smith, by a \npartisan vote of 60 to 32, jamming through a controversial nominee who \nmisled the HELP Committee. To be clear, I have been supportive of \nnearly all the nominees who have come before the HELP Committee, and I \nhave worked hard with the chairman to swiftly confirm qualified \nnominees and put them into office. But the Senate has an important \nresponsibility of advice and consent. To regain the trust of the \nAmerican people, we should demand more accountability from the people \nwe are putting into offices of public trust. I urge this administration \nto find qualified nominees who will enjoy broad support in the Senate, \nand I have offered my commitment and past experience to assist with the \nswift confirmation of those qualified nominees.\n  For all the above reasons, I will oppose Mr. Becker's nomination to \nserve as a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I hope the other two nominees who are well qualified, \nuncontroversial, and who had bipartisan support will be brought to the \nfloor. I also hope this controversial nominee will not be put on the \nBoard through a recess appointment if the Senate rejects the nomination \non a bipartisan basis today. As I mentioned before, anytime there were \ncandidates who had that kind of opposition in the past, they were not \npushed through on a cloture vote and I hope that will be the case and \nthe name will be withdrawn.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Entities that Oppose Craig Becker's Nomination to the National Labor \n                            Relations Board\n\n       American Hotel and Lodging Association (AH); American \n     Association of Nurse Executives; American Trucking \n     Association; Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc.

The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise in support of the \nconfirmation of Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board.\n  It is policymakers--not outside organizations, it is not political \nstrategists, it is not anti-union activists, and it is not pro-union \nadvocates--who are making this decision. It is policymakers--100 \nMembers of the Senate who are asked to confirm the nomination of Craig \nBecker to serve as a member of the National Labor Relations Board, \nNLRB.\n  It is something we have done in this country since Franklin \nRoosevelt, in the 1930s, when the National Labor Relations Board was \nformed. Decade after decade, this body has voted for National Labor \nRelations Board nominees who are philosophically pro-union, \nphilosophically anti-union or promanagement and not so promanagement. \nYet, with Craig Becker, the Republicans have drawn a line in the sand--\nsomething that simply didn't used to happen around here. When I hear my \ncolleagues say we can't rush this through, only in the Senate, when \nsomebody is nominated by the President in April--how many months ago is \nthat--8 or 9 months ago--would anybody say we are rushing it through by \ndoing it in February. I guess it is 10 months ago. It doesn't make \nsense to me.\n  Since its creation 75 years ago, the NLRB has served a critical and \nindependent function: Protecting workers against unfair labor practices \nand protecting businesses against unfair allegations. They struck a \nbalance because both sides have been represented. Those with a strong \nmanagement philosophy and those with a strong union philosophy have \nworked together on the NLRB.\n  I have listened to Craig Becker in front of our Committee that \nChairman Harkin chairs and of which Senator Enzi is the ranking member. \nI have listened to Mr. Becker sit there and tell us when he is in \nnegotiations with management--yes, he did represent labor unions. But \nwe are not allowed to have them on the NLRB? Is that the new idea--that \nRepublicans don't want anybody with that philosophy, anybody who might \nhave worked for a labor union? Do we not want them on the Board because \nthey actually believe workers should have more rights rather than less \nrights--the way it was during the Bush administration, when the \nDepartment of Labor did everything they could to weaken labor rights, \nwhen we saw the middle class in these last 10 years shrink because \nworkers were denied the rights to fight back when they wanted to join a \nunion or when workers simply wanted to get backpay or when workers were \nmistreated and earned their pay but weren't getting it. We needed \nsomebody in that administration to fight for them, but they didn't have \nthat at the Department of Labor. I guess those are the good old days we \nshould return to.\n  Even though we have done it this way for decades, people with \npromanagement philosophies and pro-union philosophies getting on this \nBoard--and as Mr. Becker said in his testimony, when he is part of a \nunion-management negotiation, when he is representing a union, he \nunderstands what both sides need to understand. He tries to put himself \nin the shoes of the other side. If you are a union representative, you \nknow management has interests that are legitimate and they have goals \nthey want; and you know management, generally, is going to play \nstraight. If you are on the management side, you look at the union the \nsame way.\n  That is how Mr. Becker has been trained and how he thinks. That is \nwhy I know, even though he has a pro-union philosophy, he will be fair-\nminded. I know he will serve in the tradition of NLRB appointees from \nboth parties for decades. He will serve in the tradition of other NLRB \nappointees--some pro-union and some promanagement. Yet Republicans, \nsince April--Mr. Becker was nominated in April--have tried every trick \nin the book to keep him off the NLRB. So that is April, May, June, \nJuly, August, September, October, November, December, January, and now \nit is mid-February. The Republicans are saying: Why are we rushing this \nthrough? Are they so confident they are going to defeat President \nBarack Obama in the next election that they don't want to put anybody \nwith his philosophy on the NLRB, and do they think they can stall until \nJanuary 2013? Is that the way they want to run the government?\n  Unfortunately, when nominee after nominee--we saw it last week with \nPatricia Smith. If they have anything to do with siding with workers \nand with being proworker or promiddle class, then we cannot rush. We \nhave to keep asking questions.\n  The fact is, you know, Madam President, representing the State of New \nYork, what this has meant. What we are seeing is, they asked dozens of \nquestions. In fact, there have been more questions asked of Craig \nBecker for the NLRB than of Justice Sonia Sotomayor for the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Craig Becker's isn't a lifetime appointment. It is an \nimportant job, but it is not as important as the Supreme Court, which \nis a lifetime appointment. Yet they have gone after him with more \nviciousness, questions, and suspicions--and I might add more cynicism--\nthan perhaps any nominee since I have been in the Senate.\n  The NLRB matters to workers and to businesses. They simply cannot do \ntheir jobs unless we fill these appointments. That is what the \nRepublicans are blocking. I would say it isn't good for business to \nkeep these jobs open. I know my friends on the other side of the aisle, \non the health care bill, protected the insurance companies and the drug \ncompanies, and on the trade bills, they protect the companies that \noutsource jobs overseas. I know they like to do that. They are not \nprotecting business when they keep Craig Becker off the NLRB. What they \nare doing is continuing the dysfunction of the NLRB because too many of \nthose jobs are vacant.\n  That is why it is important the NLRB protects the rights of workers \nto organize into unions and, equally important, it protects the rights \nof businesses to air their grievances. I simply don't understand why \nmost of my colleagues on the other side are opposed to giving working \nAmericans fair treatment. Unions exist in this country and businesses \nexist. Perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nrather only one of those groups existed, but our economy works best \nwhen they work together and get along. If they want to take these \nlabor-management fights, as they have, to the floor of the Senate, what \ndoes that mean for our future and for the middle class?\n  The Chair knows, whether it is in Albany or Buffalo or Schenectady, \nNY, or whether it is Toledo or Youngstown or Mansfield, OH, a union \nworking well with businesses--when labor and management work together--\nstrengthens the middle class. When we have this kind of class warfare \non the floor of the Senate, when my friends on the other side of the \naisle will do anything to keep someone who has a pro-union philosophy \nout of an appointed position--again, in April the President nominated \nMr. Becker, so that is May, June, July, August, September, October, \nNovember, December, January and now it is February and they say we are \nrushing it. I don't think anybody in America--even the most lethargic, \nslow-moving, half-dead operation in the country--thinks it is rushing \nit when it takes us 10 months to get somebody through.\n  We know what they did on the health care bill--delay, delay, delay, \ndelay.\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\nThat is arguable and that is a difficult and complex issue. But on \nthis? Just to be clear, there is no doubt about the qualifications of \nCraig Becker.\n  He earned his bachelor and law degrees from Yale University. He \nserved as an editor on the Yale Law Journal. He clerked for the Chief \nJudge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit for 30 years. \nThis is not some ``newbie'' labor pawn nobody knows anything about who \ndoes not have experience. For almost 30 years he has practiced labor \nand employment law with the highest skill and fairness in front of \nnearly every U.S. Court of Appeals and in front of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  He has been professor at some of the Nation's premier law schools. He \nhas earned the trust and admiration of students, faculty, and opponents \nof labor-management kinds of discussions. His scholarly works have been \npublished in the Nation's leading law journals and periodicals. His \nscholarly works are also mandatory reading for law students taking \nlabor and employment courses, whether they are prolabor or \npromanagement. He is often cited by fellow lawyers and scholars. In \nfact, 66 professors of labor and employment law from our Nation's \npremier law schools have described Becker as a nominee with \n``unparalleled qualifications . . . whose scholarship reflects great \nrespect for and deep knowledge of the law. He weighs and considers all \narguments in a fair and honest manner.''\n  That sounds like the kind of nominee we want on the National Labor \nRelations Board. I would add, most importantly, I said a moment ago to \nserve the interests of the middle class, to serve the interests of this \ncountry, we need to fill these jobs with qualified people. It is bad \nfor labor not to have Craig Becker on that Board. It is bad for \nmanagement not to have Craig Becker on that Board. That is clear by \nwhat respected management lawyers have said. They have urged the Senate \nto quickly confirm Mr. Becker--these are management lawyers--because of \nhis fairness and his sound judgment.\n  He has answered, as I said, in writing, more than 300 questions from \nthe Republicans on the Senate HELP Committee.\n  This is not very entertaining. I was almost entertained when my \nfriends--and I have heard at least three Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle do this with Craig Becker's appointment. They brought up \nACORN. When Republicans cannot think of anything else to say, when they \ncannot think of any arguments that work, they throw in ACORN: He knew \nsomebody at ACORN; he must have had something to do with ACORN. If no \narguments work, it is time to try ACORN out and tie Craig Becker right \nto ACORN, whatever ACORN is. It would be amusing if they did not use it \ntime after time. He must be a bad nominee because he worked with \nsomebody from ACORN or he worked with somebody from the Service \nEmployees International Union or he worked with Governor Blagojevich in \nIllinois.\n  That is the kind of guilt by association that I thought this \ninstitution stopped doing 55 years ago when Joe McCarthy was censured, \nthat we were not going to continue to use guilt by association.\n  It might be ACORN, the SEIU--and I apologize; I need to say this, \nMadam President. My daughter works for the SEIU. So before somebody \npoints out his daughter works for SEIU, that is why he is doing it--the \nfact is, Craig Becker served honorably, he served very appropriately, \nand he is very qualified. It is about time we do this. It has been 10 \nmonths. We have waited too long. I ask my colleagues to put aside some \nof their biases. He has answered 300 questions. Vote to confirm Craig \nBecker.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to share a few thoughts on the \nnomination of Judge Joseph A. Greenaway to the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals on which I think we will be voting later today. I look forward \nto supporting his nomination. He has a good record as a district court \njudge. I think almost all of my colleagues, if not all, will support \nhim. But I wish to take a moment to correct the record regarding some \nallegations that have been made by my Democratic colleagues regarding \nthe processing of this nomination.\n  Sometimes we have controversial nominees, such as Mr. Becker. And if \nanyone would care to listen to Senator Enzi's comments, they will see \nwhy there are legitimate concerns about that nomination. Some of the \nnominees are not controversial and should move forward at a steady pace \nfor confirmation in the Senate. Most of the nominations that have been \nsubmitted for positions in the Federal Government in the Department of \nJustice and on the Federal courts have moved forward rapidly without \ncontroversy. If one is controversial, the Senate should take its time \nand give full consideration of it.\n  Last week my colleague from New Jersey accused the Republicans of \n``objecting'' every time the majority leader tried to schedule a vote \non Judge Greenaway. I have to say my colleagues are seriously \nmisinformed and I am not happy to be unfairly criticized for holding up \nthe nomination. Let me explain exactly what happened.\n  As Chairman Leahy has acknowledged, the majority leader, Senator \nReid, did not seek Republican consent to proceed with this nomination \non the floor of the Senate until 2 weeks ago, and that was late on a \nFriday afternoon. The Republicans were able to clear the nomination and \nallow it to move forward with a modest time agreement before a final \nvote and allow the kind of discussion that we are having today.\n  Ironically, the Judiciary Committee, however, was not even able to \nprocess Judge Greenaway's nomination to move forward with it, which was \nsubmitted to the Senate in June by President Obama. President Obama \nsubmitted the nomination in June, but the committee could not move \nforward with a vote until September. Why was that? The reason was one \nof the home State Democratic Senators down here complaining failed to \nsend in their blue slip. Senator Leahy is not going to move a nominee \nwithout the consent of the home State Senators--and I respect him for \nthat. He is the Democratic chairman of the committee, but he has a \npolicy, as his predecessors all had, that he is going to give the home \nState Senators the opportunity to approve a nominee before he even has \na hearing in committee.\n  The nominee was delayed 4 months by a failure of the home State \nSenators--or at least one of them--to acknowledge their approval by \nreturning what we refer to as a blue slip. After that occurred, the \ncommittee promptly moved forward with a hearing and unanimously voted \nfor Judge Greenaway's nomination in October.\n  Today is the time the majority leader has chosen as the time he \ndesired to bring it up for a vote. He could have brought it up in \nOctober, November, December, or January. He chose to bring it up now. I \nam not one who thinks it is my fault that it has not been brought up.\n  The same thing happened to Judge Beverly Martin to the Eleventh \nCircuit. She was unanimously approved by the committee and had the \nsupport of her home State Senators. Months went by before she got her \nvote. It was unanimous to confirm her. It wasn't anybody's fault but \nthe Democratic leadership's fault.\n  My colleagues always complain about holding up nominees, and they \nthemselves are not moving them in an expeditious manner. Sometimes the \nPresident is slow to make nominations. As a result, we get complaints \nthat it is the Republicans' fault. It is just not.\n  If we have an objection--a serious objection--that should be \nrespected, we should state it, and we should bring it to the floor and \ndiscuss the nomination, as is occurring with Mr. Becker.\n  Compare that to the unreasonable delays of judicial nominations that \nPresident Bush sought. For example, Shalom Stone was nominated for this \nvery seat. The reason it is vacant and the reason it is being filled \ntoday is because Shalom Stone was blocked. Stone was nominated in July \nof 2007 and was basically pocket-filibustered by the Democratic \nmajority. He never received a hearing in committee. He never even \nreceived a hearing in committee. His nomination, therefore, lapsed at \nthe end of President Bush's term. That is how Judge Greenaway was \nnominated.\n\n[[Page S520]]\n\n  On average, President Bush's circuit nominees waited nearly a year \nfor confirmation--a year on average for circuit court nominees.\n  As for Judge Greenaway, he, like many of President Obama's nominees, \nI am pleased to say, has openly rejected the empathy standard.\n  In his response to a followup question, Judge Greenaway stated this \nabout the controversial empathy standard:\n\n       Empathy cannot play a role in a judge's consideration of a \n     case or in determining what the law means. I have told \n     lawyers who appear before me that as a human being, I may \n     have empathy for their client, but as a judge, I have none \n     because that is not my job. The pure exercise of empathy in \n     decisionmaking would lead to unsound and inconsistent \n     decisions.\n\n  That is a solid statement of what I think most judges believe, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. But, unfortunately, it is not the \nphilosophy stated by the President of the United States when he said he \nwas going to look for empathy in nominees to the bench.\n  Empathy is contrary to the oath a judge takes, which states:\n\n       I . . . do solemnly swear that I will administer justice \n     without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor \n     and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially \n     discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me . . .\n\n  That is the oath they take to be impartial. We need judges who are \nhonorable, intelligent, capable, and who understand their role to \nenforce the laws as written and to be impartial as they carry out that \nduty.\n  People talk about their backgrounds, their experiences--what are they \nsaying? They are saying that my background, my ethnicity, my religion, \nmy rural or urban environment allows me to see things in a way that may \nbe different and, therefore, I am empowered to bring those ideas, \nconcepts, and philosophies to my decisionmaking process, which I \nsuggest is very much akin to saying I believe I can bring my biases to \nthe decisionmaking process. They are directly contrary to the American \nideal of an impartial judge, a neutral umpire who calls balls and \nstrikes without regard for which team they are for or not for.\n  These are lifetime appointments. We look at these nominations \ncarefully. These nominees must demonstrate they will follow the plain \nmeaning of the law and not allow their own personal biases and \nprejudices to influence their decisionmaking process.\n  Based on his testimony at the hearing, his assurances and answers to \nfollowup questions, I believe Judge Greenaway will do that. I am proud \nto support him as I have supported most of President Obama's nominees. \nBut we do have a responsibility to analyze these nominees' records, to \nhold fair and rigorous hearings, to ask for additional time, if that is \nnecessary, to ensure each nominee is given the scrutiny that Congress \nis required to give before the elevation to a lifetime appointment by \nwhich they are no longer subject to review by the people of our \ncountry. We allow them to be an independent branch, but we have to \ninsist that they be independent and objective as they render their \nopinions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, in 25 years in the Senate, this is the \nfirst time I've seen a vote on a nominee to the National Labor \nRelations Board fraught with such controversy and subject even to a \nfilibuster. But I regret to say it is controversy manufactured by the \nSenate minority for only one reason--a filibuster as political tactic \nto stonewall President Obama at every turn.\n  Consequently, this nomination is an important test of the minority, a \ntest of all those who for years under President Bush repeated and \nrepeated demands for ``up or down votes'' on nominees, and got them \nwithout the kind of 8-month delays that have scuttled Craig Becker's \nnomination.\n  It is also a test of whether the Senate minority will accept the \nPresident's overtures to work together for the benefit of the American \npeople or whether they will continue to vote strictly along party lines \nto obstruct those efforts for no reason other than political gains for \ntheir party.\n  No one disputes that Craig Becker is one of the preeminent \nauthorities on labor law in the United States. He has taught at \nGeorgetown, UCLA, and the University of Chicago and has authored \nnumerous articles on labor and employment issues. He is a skilled \nlitigator, who has advocated for workers' interests in virtually all \nFederal courts of appeals, including the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed concern about Mr. Becker's \nnomination because of his academic writings. It is true that Mr. Becker \nhas published numerous articles on labor and employment law in \nscholarly journals, including the Harvard Law Review and the Chicago \nLaw Review. His extensive writings argue for law labor reforms to allow \nworkers to exercise their rights to associate and organize. But since \nwhen has there been anything disqualifying about taking a critical \napproach to existing law and challenging convention in his field?\n  Some in the minority object to Mr. Becker simply because he is a \nunion lawyer--a counsel to both the AFL-CIO and the Service Employees \nInternational Union. But that hardly disqualifies him. The Senate has \nconsistently confirmed Board members with backgrounds in unions as well \nas in management. And Mr. Becker has repeatedly said that he will \napproach all the matters before the Board impartially and with open \nmind--just what we need and expect at an agency as independent as the \nNLRB.\n  Here is what he said at his confirmation hearing:\n\n       As an attorney, I have sat across the table from management \n     and also on the same side of the table, in both postures \n     gaining an understanding of employers' concerns and often \n     finding common ground between labor and management. It is \n     this range of experience that, should I be confirmed, I will \n     draw on in collaborating with my fellow Board Members to \n     fairly, efficiently and faithfully apply the law.\n\n  Mr. Becker is widely respected by the legal community and management \nlawyers alike. Last month, 66 labor law professors from the Nation's \ntop law schools wrote Senate leaders urging his immediate confirmation \nand attesting to his ``integrity, fairness, and dedication to advancing \nCongress' purposes in adopting federal labor law and to the role of the \nNLRB.''\n  And yet it has taken almost 8 months for us to get to this point--\njust to reach the point of finally getting to vote on his nomination. \nIt is an 8-month journey that underscores just how committed the \nminority has been to prevent President Obama from staffing the \nexecutive branch of government or moving any agenda forward.\n  Mr. Becker was nominated by the President in July 2009, and in \nOctober the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \napproved his nomination--and it did so with bipartisan support from \nSenator Enzi and Senator Murkowski.\n  But after that, Senator McCain placed a ``hold'' on his nomination, \nforcing the President to resubmit it last month. And then, at the \ninsistence of the Senate minority, the HELP Committee was forced to \nhold a hearing the nomination, something the Committee hasn't had to do \nfor an NLRB nominee since 1980.\n  Moreover, Mr. Becker dutifully answered hundreds of written questions \nfrom Republicans--more questions than Supreme Court Justice Sonia \nSotomayor had to answer during her confirmation process. And when the \nCommittee voted a second time on Mr. Becker, not one Republican voted \nfor him, not even those who had supported him the first time around.\n  Critics have attacked Mr. Becker for his work on behalf of unions in \nthe past. But most labor lawyers devote their careers either to \nrepresenting unions and workers or to representing management. This \navoids conflicts of interest. We have historically confirmed NLRB \nnominees from both backgrounds, and indeed the package of nominations \nbefore the Senate includes Brian Hayes, who practiced for many years as \na management-side labor lawyer and has served as Republican HELP \nCommittee labor counsel.\n  The fact of the matter is that the minority want to turn this \nnomination into a litmus test on legislation we have yet to consider--\nlegislation on reforming how workers exercise their right to organize. \nThe criticism repeated most often of Mr. Becker is that he would use \nhis position on the NLRB to institute a binding system for organizing \nthat would allow workers to select a union by signing cards. That \nsystem is backed by organized labor.\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\n  But here is what is important. Making a card check system binding on \nemployers is something Craig Becker has said he would not and could not \ndo. He is being filibustered over something he has specifically pledged \nnot to do--and which is not the question before us today. It is no \nsurprise that in his role as a labor lawyer, Mr. Becker has been a \nstrong supporter of a legislative proposal to make it possible for \nworkers to organize by signing cards in favor of a union. But he has \nclearly stated--and accurately stated--that only Congress can take such \naction. This confirmation is not, nor should it be about the Employee \nFree Choice Act legislation that we have yet to debate and consider. \nThis is about ensuring that the NLRB can operate. And it is about \nwhether or not a qualified aspiring public servant will be allowed to \nserve. As you know, the NLRB plays a critical role in protecting \nworkers' rights. And yet, in the last 2 years, the NLRB has operated \nwith only two of its five members. And the courts are split on whether \na two-member NLRB can validly issue decisions. The Supreme Court is set \nto decide the matter later this year.\n  Meanwhile, though, the NLRB struggles along with a majority of its \nseats vacant--and I am sorry to be forced to acknowledge that may be \nexactly what our Republican colleagues want. Well over a year after \nPresident Obama's inauguration, nominees to key positions in the \nexecutive branch are still awaiting confirmation because they have been \nplaced on ``hold'' by the minority. In most cases, the objections to \nthe nominees have nothing to do with the nominee's qualifications and \neverything to do with parochial interests. Whether holding a nominee to \ntry to steer a Federal contract to a State or to express opposition to \nCanadian tobacco legislation, the minority is turning the Senate's \npower to advise and consent into the power to bully and extort and, \nabove all, to prevent Barack Obama from having the people in place \nnecessary to govern effectively. And those who lose in this game are \nnot Democrats, it is the American people. They need the executive \nbranch to execute the laws we have passed and we should let it.\n  I think in the elections of 2006, 2008, and yes in the special \nelection in Massachusetts in 2010, we have witnessed a rejection of the \npolarized and too often murky ways of doing business in Washington. But \nI regret to say, there is no better example of that kind of Washington \nbackroom business than the way the minority has behaved on the \nnomination of Craig Becker.\n  And so, I respectfully ask my Republican colleagues to put aside the \ngamesmanship on this nomination and take a hard look at Craig Becker, \nhis testimony, his record and his commitment to the rights of working \nmen and women. He doesn't have to be your first choice to head the \nNLRB. But you have to acknowledge that the President has the right to \nmake his choice. Advise and consent is not a blank check to delay and \nobstruct. And voting along party lines, especially on this nomination, \nwith no regard for the broader national interest is not what any of us \nwere sent here to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nFebruary 4 order with respect to the Executive Calendar be further \nmodified to provide that the debate time be extended until 4 p.m., and \nthat at 4 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote on the nomination of Joseph \nGreenaway, with the time until then divided as previously ordered, and \nthat the remaining provisions of the February 4 order, as modified, \nstill be in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, with only half an hour to go, we are \nhere today to consider two things, but I think most important--and what \nis on everyone's mind now--is the nomination of Harold Craig Becker to \nserve as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.\n  I first wish to thank my colleague from Ohio for a very poignant and \npointed and very clear kind of laying out of what this is really all \nabout. So I thank Senator Brown for that.\n  While I am always proud to discuss the accomplishments of a highly \nqualified nominee such as Mr. Becker, it is unfortunate we got to this \npoint. Last year, we had an agreement with the Republicans on the HELP \nCommittee that we would move Mr. Becker's nomination as a package, \nalong with the other two pending nominees for the Board, one of whom is \na Republican. Well, what happened is, at the end of the year, under the \nrules of the Senate, one Senator on the Republican side objected to \nhaving Mr. Becker continue on the calendar. It is clearly their right, \nbut they did that, and so it went back to the White House and then came \nback to us.\n  I was asked, as the chairman of the committee, to have a hearing on \nMr. Becker. We haven't had a hearing on a nominee for the NLRB since \n1985. We had a hearing for someone to be chairman, but just for a \nmember, not since 1985. Since that time, we have always worked together \nin a bipartisan fashion to have a package. When there is a Republican \nPresident, it is usually two Republicans and one Democrat. When there \nis a Democratic President, it is usually two Democrats and one \nRepublican. But we have never had any hearings on this.\n  I didn't have to have a hearing on Mr. Becker, but I decided to bend \nover backward and say: Look, OK, fine, let's have a hearing on Mr. \nBecker. I could have had a hearing with all three of them. I could have \nhad the Republican up there too. Maybe we could have given him 400 \nquestions. But I don't like to play those games.\n  So we had a hearing, and Mr. Becker came. I thought he presented \nhimself extremely well, answered all the questions, and then we moved \nahead on the nomination. But we had that package before, and that \npackage was supported on a bipartisan basis. But once Mr. Becker got \nseparated from the package by the actions of one Republican Senator, as \nI just mentioned, well, now it is OK to move two of them but not Mr. \nBecker. Well, I find that disconcerting. I find it very disconcerting. \nThat agreement has now been abandoned. It is too bad because there are \nmany other important ways we could be using our time in the Senate \nrather than on just a routine nomination.\n  That is not to say the work of the NLRB is not important. It is \ncritical, especially in these troubled and turbulent times. The NLRB is \na small agency, but its mission is large. Listen to the words of the \nNational Labor Relations Act that sets up the NLRB:\n\n       The NLRB's mission is to encourage the practice and \n     procedure of collective bargaining and to protect the \n     exercise by workers of full freedom of association.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n     . . . to encourage the practice and procedure of collective \n     bargaining.\n\n  That doesn't say the NLRB is just supposed to sit back and say: Well, \nwe don't care whether someone is unionized or not unionized; we don't \ncare whether someone is able to use collective bargaining. That is not \nthe law of the land. Read the law. They are to encourage the practice \nand procedure of collective bargaining. So when I hear people get up \nand say that someone on the Board is going to be pro-union or pro-\ncollective bargaining, I say: Well, that is kind of in keeping with the \nvery words that establish the National Labor Relations Board.\n  In today's challenging economy, when workers are vulnerable, worrying \nabout their future, it is critically important to have strong \nleadership on the Board that understands its mandate. I believe very \nstrongly in the mission of the NLRB, and I have a deep respect and \nadmiration for the dedicated people who work there. But I have made no \nsecret of the fact that I am troubled by some aspects of the Board's \nrecent performance.\n  In recent years, the Board is not doing all it can to inform workers \nof their rights or to assess appropriate penalties for repeat violators \nof our labor laws. And that is not to mention the excessive delays at \nthe Board, because we know justice delayed is justice denied in many \ncases.\n  There is no real penalty for violating workers' rights. In the last 4 \nyears, the median time to process an unfair labor practice charge at \nthe Board has averaged about 782 days. That is more than 2 years. The \nmedian time between the petition for an election and the time when the \nBoard certifies the results of a disputed election is 308 days. What \ndoes this mean? It means that if someone is exercising his or her legal \nright\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\nto help organize a union and the employer fires that person, which is a \nviolation of the National Labor Relations Act, and that employee then \nfiles a case with the NLRB, it takes over 2 years to get to it. Well, \nthat person is fired. What does that person do? Suppose that person--he \nor she--is married; they have a couple of kids and they need that \nincome, so they have to get another job. They have to get another job. \nNow 2 years have gone by, and the National Labor Relations Board finds \nin favor of the employee who was wrongly fired. What does the employer \nhave to do? The employer has to pay back wages minus any other wages \nthat employee made during that intervening time. Well, if that employee \nwas lucky enough to get a job that paid as well, that means the \nemployer pays nothing--nothing. So is it any wonder employers feel they \ncan just fire people willy-nilly for exercising their right to form a \nunion, when there is really no penalty?\n  That is what is happening today. It is a serious problem, and we have \nto put this agency back on track. They have to close down that amount \nof time. I am confident Craig Becker can be an important part of that \neffort. He is one of the preeminent labor law thinkers in the United \nStates and, I might add, a proud son of the State of Iowa, born and \nraised in Iowa. His father was a professor at the university. He has \ntaught labor law at some of our finest law schools, including \nGeorgetown, UCLA, and the University of Chicago, and he has authored \nnumerous articles on labor and employment issues. He is also a skilled \nlitigator who has advocated for workers' interests in the highest \ncourts of this land. He has argued cases in virtually every court of \nappeals and before the U.S. Supreme Court. I have met with him and \nspoken with him at length, and I know he will be an invaluable addition \nto the NLRB. He is an expert on the law, he knows the Board, and he \nbrings a tremendous depth of experience to this important position.\n  His impressive accomplishments have earned the respect of his \ncolleagues in the bar and his colleagues in the academy. This committee \nhas received several letters of recommendation from management-side \nattorneys--people who have litigated against Mr. Becker as \nadversaries--praising his virtues and his potential as a Board member. \nThis chart reflects the comments of one such attorney:\n\n       Over the years, I have worked with Mr. Becker on a number \n     of complex issues and cases. Although we were both aggressive \n     advocates for our respective clients and their positions, we \n     were always able to have an open dialogue. I believe that Mr. \n     Becker always took the time to understand the issues from the \n     employer's side, and was willing to work creatively toward \n     amicable resolutions of the issues. Based on my many \n     experiences, I believe that Mr. Becker's integrity is \n     exceptional, as is his knowledge of labor law, and he will be \n     fair, hard-working, and an asset to the NLRB Board.\n\n  That is a quote from an attorney who represents management.\n  Another one said:\n\n       I have read of the concerns expressed by some that Mr. \n     Becker would prove ``doctrinaire'' and/or biased toward \n     unions in his application of the NLRA. It is my honest \n     opinion, based on firsthand experience dealing with him, that \n     these concerns are completely unfounded. On the contrary, I \n     am convinced that Mr. Becker would demonstrate fairness, \n     integrity, sound judgment, and an abiding respect for all the \n     Congressionally mandated rights of employers, unions, and \n     employees alike. I respectfully urge you to support his \n     confirmation.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord both of the letters from which I have just quoted, along with \nother letters and an endorsement from more than 60 law professors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Laner Muchin Dombrow Becker Levin and Tominberg, Ltd.,\n                                                 January 29, 2010.\n     Re Confirmation of Craig Becker as a Member of the NLRB.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: As a lawyer who \n     has represented employers in the private and public sectors \n     for over (30) years, I am writing to describe my experiences \n     with Craig Becker.\n       Over the years, I have worked with Mr. Becker on a number \n     of complex issues and cases that had significant implications \n     for his union clients, and my employer clients. Although we \n     were both aggressive advocates for our respective clients and \n     their positions, we were always able to have an open \n     dialogue. I believe that Mr. Becker always took the time to \n     understand the issues from the employer's side, and was \n     willing to work creatively toward amicable resolutions of the \n     issues. In other words, he is a problem-solver, a \n     characteristic that is highly-valued in a lawyer.\n       Based on my many experiences, I believe that Mr. Becker's \n     integrity is exceptional, as is his knowledge of labor law, \n     and he will be fair, hard-working, and an asset to the \n     National Labor Relations Board.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Joseph M. Gagliardo.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Sonnenschein Nath &\n\n\n                                                Rosenthal LLP,\n\n                                                 January 28, 2010.\n     Re Confirmation of Craig Becker as a Member of the NLRB.\n\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: As an attorney who, for more than \n     47 years, has practiced exclusively in the area of Labor and \n     Employment Law representing management, I am writing to urge \n     the confirmation of Craig Becker as a Member of the National \n     Labor Relations Board.\n       I have had the opportunity to work together with and in \n     opposition to Mr. Becker on a number of matters involving a \n     significant number of employers and employees, including \n     litigation and collective bargaining negotiations. \n     Throughout, he has consistently demonstrated an impressive \n     grasp and appreciation of and deeply felt commitment and \n     dedication to the principles enunciated by Congress and \n     embodied in the National Labor Relations Act.\n       I have read of the concerns expressed by some that Mr. \n     Becker would prove ``doctrinaire'' and/or biased toward \n     unions in his application of the NLRA. It is my honest \n     opinion, based upon first-hand experience dealing with him, \n     that these concerns are completely unfounded. On the \n     contrary, I am convinced that Mr. Becker would demonstrate \n     fairness, integrity, sound judgment and an abiding respect \n     for all of the Congressionally mandated rights of employers, \n     unions, and employees alike. I respectfully urge you to \n     support his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard L. Marcus.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              New York University,\n\n\n                                 School of Law Faculty of Law,\n\n                                   New York, NY, January 19, 2010.\n     Re Confirmation of Craig Becker as a Member of the NLRB\n\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi: I have \n     practiced and taught labor and employment law for over 30 \n     years, hold the Dwight D. Opperman professorship at New York \n     University School of Law, direct NYU's Center for Labor and \n     Employment Law, and serve as Chief Reporter for the American \n     Law Institute's Restatement (Third) of Employment Law.\n       I am writing in support of the confirmation of Craig Becker \n     to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or \n     Board), and I do on the following basis.\n       The President, in my view, should enjoy a broad latitude in \n     selecting members of his administration, including members of \n     independent agencies like the NLRB. Congress has the \n     responsibility to make sure that the President's selections \n     do not have disqualifying problems of competence or \n     character; if the President's nominees do pass that test and \n     fall within a broad zone of acceptability, Congress has a \n     reciprocal duty to confirm the President's choices. That is \n     particularly true with respect to the NLRB. There is a good \n     deal of controversy over whether the NLRB still functions as \n     an effective agency in enforcing statutory rights and \n     obligations. Much of this controversy has played a role in \n     the debates over the proposed Employee Free Choice Act, still \n     under consideration in Congress. It is therefore in the \n     interest of all--employees, employers, unions, judges and \n     lawyers--that the Board operate with a full complement \n     reflecting the various Presidential choices over time as to \n     the best people for the job.\n       It is clear that Mr. Becker passes the tests of competence \n     and character and falls within the broad zone of \n     acceptability. Although I have sometimes disagreed with his \n     legal positions and his writings, I have consistently found \n     his work to be the product of a highly intelligent, \n     thoughtful person who knows and understands the labor law \n     materials and is open to reasoned discussion. Based on my \n     interactions with him, I am confident that he will be a most \n     able member of this distinguished agency.\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\n       I urge you to confirm Mr. Becker as a member of the Board. \n     If you have any questions or wish to discuss this further, \n     please advise.\n           Sincerely,\n     Samuel Estreicher.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         University of California,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                     Irvine, CA, January 21, 2010.\n     Re Confirmation of Craig Becker as a Member of the NLRB.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: As teachers and \n     scholars of labor law, we write to express our strong support \n     for the confirmation of Craig Becker to be a Member of the \n     National Labor Relations Board. We believe firmly that, if \n     confirmed, Mr. Becker will prove to be one of the most \n     respected Board Members in the history of the NLRB.\n       Mr. Becker possesses unparalleled qualifications to be a \n     Member of the Board. He has practiced labor law for many \n     years and also taught and written extensively about labor law \n     and related subjects. Mr. Becker has had an enormous range of \n     practical experience in the field of labor law, having \n     represented a broad range of unions in the public and the \n     private sector as well as many individual workers, both union \n     members and nonmembers. He has argued cases in virtually \n     every United States Court of Appeals and in the United States \n     Supreme Court, many of them among the most important labor \n     law cases of the last several decades. He has also taught \n     labor law at several of our nation's finest law schools, \n     including the University of Chicago, Georgetown and UCLA. His \n     scholarship reflects a great respect for and deep knowledge \n     of the law and weighs and considers all arguments in a fair \n     and honest manner. His articles are widely cited, regularly \n     used in law school classes, and admired by labor law scholars \n     across the political spectrum.\n       Despite Mr. Becker's obvious qualifications to be a Member \n     of the NLRB, his opponents have made a series of misleading \n     and inaccurate statements about him and, in particular, about \n     his published work. We urge anyone considering Mr. Becker's \n     nomination not to rely on sound bites, fragments taken out of \n     context, and misquotations, but to actually read Mr. Becker's \n     scholarly writing.\n       Those of us who know Mr. Becker personally as well as those \n     of us who have read his work and are familiar with his \n     professional reputation can attest to his integrity, \n     fairness, and dedication to advancing Congress' purposes in \n     adopting federal labor law and to the role of the NLRB. \n     Without qualification we urge prompt confirmation of Mr. \n     Becker to be a member of the NLRB.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Catherine Fisk.\n       Institutional affiliations listed for purposes of \n     identification only.\n\n       I am authorized to state that the following have read this \n     letter and join it.\n\n       James Brudney, Ohio State University, Moritz College of \n     Law; Cynthia Estlund, New York University School of Law; \n     Benjamin, Sachs Harvard Law School; David Abraham, University \n     of Miami School of Law; James Atleson, State University of \n     New York at Buffalo School of Law; Mark Barenberg, Columbia \n     University Law School; Esta Bigler, Cornell University ILR \n     School; Susan Bisom-Rapp, Thomas Jefferson Law School; \n     Christopher Cameron, Southwestern University Law School; \n     Susan Carle, American University, Washington College of Law; \n     Kenneth Casebeer, University of Miami Law School; Carin \n     Clauss, University of Wisconsin Law School; Lance Compa, \n     Cornell University ILR School; Laura Cooper, University of \n     Minnesota Law School; Roberto Corrada, Denver University \n     School of Law; Marion Crain, Washington University School of \n     Law; Charles Craver, George Washington University Law School; \n     llen Dannin, Penn State University Dickinson College of Law; \n     Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, Indiana University, Bloomington--School \n     of Law; Henry Drummonds, Lewis & Clark--Northwestern School \n     of Law; Fred Feinstein, University of Maryland School of \n     Public Policy;\n       Janice Fine, Rutgers University School of Management and \n     Labor Relations; Matthew Finkin, University of Illinois Law \n     School; Michael Fischl, University of Connecticut Law School; \n     William Forbath, University of Texas Law School; Ruben \n     Garcia, California Western School of Law; Julius Getman, \n     University of Texas Law School; Michael Goldberg, Widener \n     University School of Law; Alvin Goldman, University of \n     Kentucky Law School; Jennifer Gordon, Fordham University Law \n     School; Robert Gorman, University of Pennsylvania Law School; \n     William B.

As these records show, those who know Mr. Becker the best \nall agree the President could not have made a better choice.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Becker's nomination has been delayed for months on \nend due to criticisms that are based on misinformation and misleading \ndescriptions of his views. Mr. Becker has gone to great lengths to \ndispel those concerns and set the record straight. The first time his \nnomination was considered by this committee last year, he answered 282 \nwritten questions from committee Republicans. He also said he would \nmeet with any Senator who expressed an interest to personally explain \nhis views. Only two asked to meet with him. This year, he testified \nbefore the HELP Committee, as I mentioned earlier, and answered 158 \nadditional questions. To put this in perspective, Justice Sotomayor, \nseeking a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, only had 220 \nquestions submitted to her.\n  While this exhaustive vetting process should have alleviated any \nconcerns about Mr. Becker's nomination, it appears there is still a lot \nof misinformation going around, so I would like to take this \nopportunity to set the record straight once and for all--not that I \nthink what I am about to say or the letters and things I will point to \nwill change any Republican minds. It seems as though their minds are \nmade up en bloc that they are going to oppose Mr. Becker, just as they \nopposed Patricia Smith. But I think it is important for the general \npublic to get the facts and to understand what this is all about.\n  First and foremost, critics have suggested Mr. Becker would come to \nthe Board with an agenda and that he would try to implement the \nEmployee Free Choice Act by administrative fiat.\n  As you are all aware, I am a supporter of the Employee Free Choice \nAct, as is President Obama. He campaigned on it. I hope to see it \npassed by Congress. I look forward to the debate. I hope it is signed \ninto law by the President. But I have no illusions that those important \nchanges can somehow be accomplished administratively, and neither does \nCraig Becker. He has clearly and consistently explained on numerous \noccasions that all three major reforms in the Employee Free Choice \nAct--the card check, binding arbitration for first contracts, and \nincreased penalties for violations of the law--cannot be accomplished \nwithout a change in the statute. As we all know, statutes can only be \namended by those of us elected to Congress, not by appointees to the \nNLRB. Mr. Becker was unequivocal in his responses on this point.\n  Let's take a look at what Mr. Becker says and not what others say \nabout him, not what others would like him to do. We heard a lot about \nthat on Patricia Smith a week ago, on what others said, but let's take \na look at what Mr. Becker has to say.\n  On the issue of card check, he states:\n\n       The reason the Employee Free Choice Act has been introduced \n     in Congress and the reason that question is before Congress \n     and not the Board is that the current Act clearly precludes \n     certification in the absence of a secret ballot election. \n     Section 9 of the Act, in two distinct ways, makes clear that \n     Congress has intended that a secret ballot election be \n     preconditioned for certification of the union.\n\n  So, again, what Mr. Becker has said is that the Board can't change \nthat.\n  On binding arbitration, he said:\n\n       The second section [of EFCA] establishes procedures for \n     mediation and, if necessary,\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\n     binding arbitration in circumstances where a union or \n     employer engaged in bargaining for a first contract are \n     unable to reach agreement. Action by Congress would also be \n     required to implement these procedures.\n\n  So on the second part of the Employee Free Choice Act, Mr. Becker \nsays that only Congress can change it.\n  Finally, in discussing the new penalties about which I spoke a little \nbit ago, Mr. Becker says:\n\n       The third and final section of EFCA would establish civil \n     penalties and a treble backpay remedy for certain unfair \n     labor practices. I do not believe the Board has authority to \n     award double or triple backpay as a remedy for a violation of \n     Section 8(a)(3) without congressional action nor do I believe \n     that section 10 currently vests in the Board the authority to \n     impose the penalties discussed above.\n\n  Well, I don't think he could have been any clearer in his views on \nthis issue.\n  Earlier, we had some discussion by the Senator from Georgia and also \nmy colleague from Wyoming about the National Mediation Board and how \ntwo people got on the Mediation Board and immediately overturned 75 \nyears of law.\n  What you never heard was that the National Mediation Board acted \nwithin their rights. No one is saying they did something to violate a \nlaw. They acted within the purview of the authority they have. That is \nnot the same case with the NLRB. They do not have this authority. \nSecond, I think it is important, since people listened to this about \nthe National Mediation Board, to clear up one thing. Here is what they \ndid. For 75 years they have said basically in these types of elections, \nif someone doesn't vote it is considered a ``no'' vote. Imagine that. \nIf you don't vote it is a ``no'' vote. Now they say that you only have \nto have 51 percent of those voting to have an affirmative vote. Who is \ngoing to dispute that? That is what we do in bond elections in this \ncountry, that is what we do in referendums, school board elections, and \neven elections for the Senate.\n  Think about this. What if you said if you don't vote that is a ``no'' \nvote. Nowhere else in this country do we say that. If you don't vote, \nit should not be counted yes and it should not be counted no. The \nNational Mediation Board simply applied the general rule of elections \nwe follow in this country.\n  Mr. Becker has also received criticism based on his academic \nwritings. Opponents of his nomination have suggested that he supports \nradical changes in the law that would require workers to join unions \nagainst their will, or take away the free speech rights of employers. \nThese wild assertions have no basis in reality, and Mr. Becker has gone \nto great pains to rebut these mischaracterizations of his academic \nviews.\n  For example on the issue of mandatory unionism, Mr. Becker has \nexplained in response to a question from Senator Burr that: ``The Act \nvests in employees the right to self-organization and to form, join, or \nassist labor organizations and the right to refrain from doing any and \nall of such activities with the limited exception provided in section \n8(a)(3) as modified by section 14(b). If I am confirmed, I will \nfaithfully apply those provisions of the law.'' And again, in response \nto a question from Senator Roberts, he stated without reservation that: \n``I believe workers should have a choice of whether or not to join a \nunion.''\n  Similarly, in discussing allegations that he supports eliminating \nemployer free speech rights, Mr. Becker has responded: ``It's clear \nthat employers have a legitimate interest, and have a right which is \nindisputable to express their views on the question of whether their \nemployees should unionize. So nothing in . . . my writing should be \nconstrued to suggest that in any way I think that employers don't have \na right to clearly express their views on the question of \nunionization.'' That was in response to a question by Senator Isakson.\n  I fail to see why these direct and unequivocal responses do not \nalleviate my colleagues' concerns. I don't know what more his critics \nare looking for.\n  Evidently they are more interested in looking at what other people \nhave to say about him than what Mr. Becker says himself.\n  Finally, some of my colleagues seem to have problems----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have several Senators who wish to \nspeak on the first vote that is coming up this afternoon, the Greenaway \nnomination. Is the Senator going to give us any time? Because our time \nis also being used by him right now. I was wondering if at some point \nwe might have time to speak on the Greenaway nomination.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, I thought we had 45 minutes on our \nside for the nomination of Mr. Becker.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am using that time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my understanding is that time was to be \nused for both Becker and Greenaway. I was wondering, since Greenaway is \nthe first vote we are going to come to, whether we will have time on \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is incurred on both matters.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believed, under the information that I had, 45 minutes \nout of 90 minutes that was evenly split on Mr. Becker. I have been \nwaiting for a long time to speak on Mr. Becker. I see no reason why we \ncouldn't ask for consent to move the vote back a little bit if people \nwant to. I wouldn't object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator would yield further, the \nreason I was here is I was told the time, 45 minutes, was to be used \nfor both nominations. If the Senator from Iowa wishes to use all the \ntime for his nomination, I also point out that Judge Greenaway has been \nwaiting since last June for his vote. But certainly the Senator has the \nfloor. I understand he has the floor and I understand he can take all \nthe time and not leave any time to the other Senators who are supposed \nto receive time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats retain 7 minutes 40 seconds in \ndebate.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I do not want to keep anyone from \nspeaking. I was under a misimpression. I did not know I did not have my \n45 minutes. I apologize. This was not part of my information. I will \ntry to wrap up as rapidly as I can. But I think this is important.\n  Obviously, Mr. Greenaway seems to have a lot of support. There is no \ncontention about him but there certainly is about Mr. Becker and I want \nto set the record straight about Mr. Becker.\n  My colleagues seem to have a problem with Mr. Becker simply because \nhe is a union lawyer and a darned good one. But that should not be a \ncause for concern. Most labor lawyers devote their time either to labor \nor representing management. Indeed, since the Board's inception, 23 \nmanagement attorneys or consultants have served on the Board compared \nto only 3 who came from a background of representing unions--23 to 3. \nNow we have someone come from a background of representing unions and \nnow they do not want him on the Board.\n  Again, these people all came from different backgrounds. I am sure \nMr. Becker will approach this with an open mind and impartiality. No \none has suggested there is an ethical problem with Mr. Becker's \nprevious employment. He has clearly and unequivocally stated that he \nwill recuse himself from matters that may come before the Board \nconcerning his former employers, the Service Employees International \nUnion and the AFL-CIO, for a period of 2 years. He answered 440 written \nquestions. After months of delay, it is time to move on, not only \nbecause Mr. Becker is so abundantly qualified but also because the NLRB \nhas important work to do. We owe it to hard-working Americans to act \nquickly on these nominations. I hope all my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting Mr. Becker's nomination so we can complete this process and \nlet him start his important work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I apologize to my good friend from Vermont but as he can tell, I \nneeded to get the record straight on Mr. Becker.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, no apology is necessary. The only reason \nI raised that is because I heard what the order was earlier this \nafternoon.\n  Today the Senate will finally consider the nomination of Judge Joseph \nGreenaway to fill the vacancy created by Justice Alito on the U.S. \nCourt of\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\nAppeals for the Third Circuit. Judge Greenaway is an outstanding jurist \nwho has served for nearly 14 years on the Federal district court in New \nJersey. President Obama nominated him last June. That nomination was \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee more than 4 months ago, \nwithout a single dissenting vote. He should have been confirmed long \nago. I have been speaking about this nomination for some time to call \nattention to the unexplained and unnecessary delay in its \nconsideration. The Senators from New Jersey have both come to the \nSenate floor on repeated occasions calling for consideration. Judge \nGreenaway will finally be confirmed today.\n  I continue to be deeply disappointed by the delays and obstruction \ncaused by Senate Republicans. Regrettably, Judge Greenaway's long-\nstalled nomination is another example of these tactics. As I previously \nexplained in a statement on January 25, the Senate majority leader came \nbefore the Senate on January 22 to highlight the delay in the \nconsideration of Judge Greenaway. Senate Republicans would not agree to \nconsider his nomination that week, or the next week, or the next. It \ntook the persistence of the majority leader and the vocal support of \nthe Senators from New Jersey, who spoke on January 25 and, again on \nFebruary 2, about the Republican stalling, to pry this nomination \nloose. That is wrong. It should not take such effort to get Senate \nRepublicans to vote on a nomination, especially one that most, if not \nall, of them are likely to support. We should be able in regular order \nto consider noncontroversial nominations like that of Judge Greenaway \nwithout months of delay.\n  Despite the fact that President Obama began sending judicial nominees \nto the Senate 2 months earlier than President Bush, last year's total \nwas the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the first year of a \nPresidency in more than 50 years--since 1953 when President Eisenhower \nonly made nine nominations all year, all of which were confirmed. The \nnumber of confirmations was even below the 17 the Senate Republican \nmajority allowed to be confirmed in the 1996 session.\n  Last week, at the Democratic Policy Committee's issues retreat, I \nasked President Obama if he will continue to work hard to send names to \nthe Senate as quickly as possible, and to commit to work with us, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, to get these nominees confirmed. So far \nsince taking office the President has reached across the aisle working \nwith Republicans and Democrats to identify well-qualified nominations. \nYet even these nominations are delayed or obstructed. The President \nresponded by stating:\n  Well, this is going to be a priority. Look, it is not just judges, \nunfortunately, Pat, it is also all our Federal appointees. We have got \na huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified; \nnobody has a specific objection to them, but end up having a hold on \nthem because of some completely unrelated piece of business.\n  On the judges front, we had a judge for the--coming out of Indiana, \nJudge Hamilton, who everybody said was outstanding--Evan Bayh, \nDemocrat; Dick Lugar, Republican; all recommended. How long did it take \nus? Six months, 6, 7 months for somebody who was supported by the \nDemocratic and Republican senator from that State. And you can multiply \nthat across the board. So we have to start highlighting the fact that \nthis is not how we should be doing business.\n  I could not agree more with President Obama. This should not be the \nway the Senate behave. Last week, the Senate had to vote to invoke \ncloture and end the 15th filibuster of President Obama's nominations to \nfill important posts in the executive branch and the judiciary. That \nnumber does not include the many other nominees who have been prevented \nup-or-down votes in the Senate by the silent filibuster of Republicans \nrefusing to agree to time agreements to consider even noncontroversial \nnominees. Every single Republican Senator who voted last Monday voted \nagainst cloture and to keep filibustering a well-qualified nominee. \nEvery single Republican voted to obstruct the Senate from doing the \nbusiness of the American people.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen the repeated abuse of filibusters, and \ndelay and obstruction have become the norm for Senate Republicans. We \nhave seen unprecedented obstruction by Senate Republicans on issue \nafter issue--over 100 filibusters last year alone, which has affected \n70 percent of all Senate action. Instead of time agreements and the \nwill of the majority, the Senate is faced with a requirement to find 60 \nSenators to overcome a filibuster on issue after issue. Those who just \na short time ago said that a majority vote is all that should be needed \nto confirm a nomination, and that filibusters of nominations are \nunconstitutional, have reversed themselves and now employ any delaying \ntactic they can.\n  The Republican practice of making supermajorities the new standard to \nproceed to consider many noncontroversial and well-qualified \nnominations for important posts in the executive branch, and to fill \nvacancies on the Federal courts, is having a debilitating effect on our \ngovernment's ability to serve the American people. Hard-working \nAmericans who seek justice in our overburdened Federal courts are the \nones who will pay the price for Republicans' obstruction and delay. \nThey deserve better.\n  Even after years of Republican pocket filibusters that blocked more \nthan 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees from even having a \nhearing and led to skyrocketing judicial vacancies, Democrats did not \npractice this kind of obstruction and delay in considering President \nBush's nominations. We worked hard to reverse the Republican \nobstructionism. In the second half of 2001, the Democratic majority in \nthe Senate proceeded to confirm 28 judges.\n  By February 9, 2002, the comparable date in President Bush's first \nterm, the Senate had confirmed 32 circuit and district court \nnominations. Judge Greenaway will be only the 15th Federal circuit or \ndistrict judge allowed to be confirmed. That is less than half of where \nwe were in 2002.\n  During just the second year of President Bush's first term, the \nDemocratic Senate majority confirmed 72 judicial nominations and helped \nreduce the vacancies left by Republican obstructionism from over 110 to \n59 by the end of 2002. Overall, in the 17 months that I chaired the \nSenate Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, the \nSenate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees.\n  We continued to be fair and worked to reduce vacancies even during \nPresident Bush's last year in office. With Senate Democrats again in \nthe majority, we reduced judicial vacancies to as low as 34, even \nthough it was a Presidential election year. When President Bush left \noffice, we had reduced vacancies in 9 of the 13 Federal circuits.\n  As matters stand today, judicial vacancies have spiked again, as they \ndid due to Republican obstruction in the 1990s. These vacancies are \nagain being left unfilled. We started 2010 with the highest number of \nvacancies on article III courts since 1994, when the vacancies created \nby the last comprehensive judgeship bill were still being filled. While \nit has been nearly 20 years since we enacted a Federal judgeship bill, \njudicial vacancies are nearing record levels, with 102 current \nvacancies and another 21 already announced. If we had proceeded on the \njudgeship bill recommended by the Judicial Conference to address the \ngrowing burden on our Federal judiciary, as we did in 1984 and 1990, in \norder to provide the resources the courts need, current vacancies would \nstand over 160 today and would be headed toward 180. That is the true \nmeasure of how far behind we have fallen.\n  Republican Senators insisted on stalling confirmation of the \nnomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who was confirmed with more than 90 \nvotes. They insisted on stalling the nomination of Judge Andre Davis, \nwho was confirmed with more than 70 votes. They unsuccessfully \nfilibustered the nomination of Judge David Hamilton last November, \nhaving delayed its consideration for months. They stalled Judge Beverly \nMartin's nomination for at least 2 months because they would not agree \nto consider it before January 20. They have stalled for 3 additional \nweeks on Judge Greenaway's nomination. We have wasted weeks and months \nhaving to seek time agreements in order to consider nominations that \nwere reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously and who\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\nare then confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate once they are finally \nallowed to be considered.\n  Judge Greenaway's nomination is yet another example. He is a good \njudge who had years of experience as a Federal prosecutor. He received \nthe highest possible rating from the American Bar Association's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Senator Sessions praised \nhim at his confirmation hearing. He should have been confirmed last \nyear, and he would have but for Republican objection.\n  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to reconsider their strategy and \nallow prompt consideration of the other judicial nominees awaiting \nSenate consideration: Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia, nominated to \nthe Fourth Circuit; Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee, nominated to the \nSixth Circuit; Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania, nominated to the \nThird Circuit; Judge Denny Chin of New York, nominated to the Second \nCircuit; Judge William Conley, nominated to the Western District of \nWisconsin; Justice Rogeriee Thompson of Rhode Island, nominated to the \nFirst Circuit; Judge James Wynn of North Carolina, nominated to the \nFourth Circuit; Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina, nominated to the \nFourth Circuit; Judge Edward Chen, nominated to the Northern District \nof California; and Justice Louis Butler, nominated to the Western \nDistrict of Wisconsin.\n  I commend the Senators from New Jersey for their hard work that has \nproven effective in connection with the nomination of Judge Greenaway \nand I congratulate Judge Greenaway and his family.\n  I note the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey and Senator \nMenendez from New Jersey wish to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I regret that the time has been \nshrunken as it has.\n  I want an opportunity to register my full support to confirm an \nexceptionally well-qualified district jurist--Judge Joseph Greenaway--\nto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  For more than 13 years, Judge Greenaway has served on U.S. District \nCourt in Newark, NJ.\n  On the entrance to that courthouse there is an inscription that \nreads:\n\n       The true measure of a democracy is its dispensation of \n     justice.\n\n  I take pride in authorship of that quote because I firmly believe it \nreflects the values on which our Nation was founded--values that must \nendure throughout our government and legal system.\n  While serving as a district judge in that building, Judge Greenaway \nhas demonstrated his unyielding commitment to those values--the same \nvalues that will make him a success on the Third Circuit court of \nappeals.\n  There can be no question that Judge Greenaway is eminently qualified \nfor this position.\n  Let's take a look at his credentials.\n  From humble beginnings, Judge Joseph Greenaway became a graduate of \nColumbia University and Harvard Law School, Assistant U.S. Attorney for \nNew Jersey, Chief of the Narcotics Division, U.S. District Court Judge \nfor New Jersey, was confirmed by the Senate in 1996, presided over more \nthan 4,000 cases, was rated unanimously well-qualified by the ABA and \nhis nomination to the Third Circuit passed unanimously by Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  On top of his outstanding experience and intellect, there has never \nbeen a question about Judge Greenaway's ability, character, or \ncommitment to the community. We are so fortunate that we have this \noutstanding individual.\n  Throughout his career, despite his critical bench responsibilities, \nJudge Greenaway has always found time to help others aspiring to \npreserve our just society's obligations--by teaching criminal trial \npractice classes at Cardozo Law School and courses about the Supreme \nCourt there and at Columbia University.\n  And he has received numerous honors and awards recognizing his work. \nAmong them: Thurgood Marshall College Fund Award of Excellence; Garden \nState Bar Association Distinguished Jurist Award; Chair Emeritus of the \nColumbia College Black Alumni Council.\n  In fact, the only question surrounding Judge Greenaway's confirmation \nis this: What took so long to move him along to this very busy appeals \ncourt?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The time of the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for Senator \nMenendez to be able to have 3 minutes also. I ask for an additional 6 \nminutes for the Senators from New Jersey, which is considerably more \nthan I had.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will just take a couple of more minutes.\n  While I welcome a vote that will establish confidence in Judge \nGreenaway's ability to serve our country, today's vote comes 4 months \nafter his nomination came to the floor of the U.S. Senate because of \nunnecessary and unreasonable delays.\n  Not one of my Republican colleagues has voiced a single objection to \nJudge Greenaway along the way or a single reason for this delay.\n  Judge Greenaway and the people of New Jersey are not alone in falling \nvictim to this obstruction.\n  Republican obstructionism last year led to the lowest number of \njudicial confirmations in more than 50 years.\n  Justice has been delayed while those who refused to let this vote \ntake place had another agenda--purely to score political points. It is \nshameful and the American people show discouragement.\n  I hope today's vote signals a break in the profuse presence of \nobstructionism and will permit us to do our work for the American \npeople in a more timely fashion.\n  If they have objections based on character or ability, tell the \nAmerican people that. Don't hide behind a cloak of procedure.\n  The ABA found Judge Greenaway unanimously well-qualified and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee was unanimous in supporting this nomination.\n  Today, I urge all my colleagues to once again unanimously support the \nconfirmation of this brilliant legal scholar, Judge Joseph Greenaway, \nto the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I first spoke in favor of the nomination \nof Judge Joseph A. Greenaway for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit when I introduced him to the Judiciary Committee on \nSeptember 10. This has been a long 5-month process, unnecessarily long \nfor a good man and a noncontroversial nominee who was once unanimously \napproved by this Chamber under Republican leadership, and I might add \nreceived the full support, the unanimous support of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Yet the minority has continued to delay his confirmation \nalong with many others.\n  If confirmed, he would be only the 15th of President Obama's circuit \nor district court nominees to be confirmed despite more than 100 \nvacancies on the Federal bench.\n  Having said that, today we are finally here to vote on the nomination \nof a man who fully embodies respect for justice and the rule of law \nthat should have made this a simple, clear, easy choice.\n  Let me briefly repeat his impeccable qualifications. At the age of \n38, Justice Joseph A. Greenaway, Jr., was appointed by President \nClinton to the Federal bench and has served for over a dozen years with \ndistinction. He earned a bachelor of arts from Columbia University \nwhere he was honored, in 1997, with the Columbia University Medal of \nExcellence and with the John Jay Award in 2003.\n  He earned his J.D. from Harvard Law where he was a member of the \nHarvard Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Law Review, and an Earl Warren \nLegal Scholar.\n  He later clerked for the late Honorable Vincent L. Broderick, in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, became an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney in Newark and later became chief of the \nnarcotics bureau.\n  In the private sector, he was an associate with the firm of Kramer, \nLevin, Nessen, Kamin, and Frankel--and served at Johnson and Johnson as \nin-house counsel.\n  He is chair emeritus of the Columbia College Black Alumni Council and \nhas been an adjunct professor at Rutgers Law School.\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\n  Currently, he is an adjunct professor at both the Cardozo School of \nLaw and Columbia College where he teaches a seminar on the Supreme \nCourt. But however impressive his experience and qualifications, they \ndo not do justice to the man.\n  He grew up in Harlem and the northeast Bronx not far from where \nJustice Sotomayor grew up, just across the river from Union City, NJ, \nwhere I grew up. He has a deep respect for the rule of law and a \nfundamental belief in fairness and the age-old notion of equal justice \nunder law.\n  He is accomplished and successful in his life and career, and proud \nof the justice system to which he has devoted his career. But he has \nalso given much back to the community, something for which we in New \nJersey will remain forever grateful.\n  In 2006, before Judge Greenaway took the podium at the Benjamin \nCardozo School of Law at Yeshiva, Dean David Rudenstein introduced him \nas a man who touched many of his students' lives in meaningful ways. \nThose students, he said, had the privilege of witnessing his humanness \nand had been inspired by his example.\n  That observation came as a surprise to no one who knows Judge \nGreenaway. He has always been an inspiration to students and graduates \nalike, taking many of them under his wing as law clerks or fellows. \nMediocrity has never been Joe Greenaway's norm. He has always strived \nfor excellence, and taught young lawyers to do the same.\n  In conclusion, the confirmation of Judge Greenaway should have been \nan easy choice, but when all is said and done, when we put aside our \npolitical biases and look for those with the illusive qualities we like \nto call judicial temperament, those who best represent the fundamental \nconcepts of justice and community, for as Edmund Burke once said: \n``Justice is itself the great standing policy of civil society .  .  \n.''\n  Judge Joseph A. Greenaway, Jr. stands out. I am pleased that his \nnomination has finally come to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote for this eminently qualified, capable, nominee.\n  I know I join with all of my colleagues and with the people of New \nJersey in wishing Judge Greenaway good luck and Godspeed on this next \njourney in life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Joseph A. Greenaway, Jr., of New Jersey, \nto be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.

Mr. President, Scouting came to America 100 years ago \nbecause of a good deed. We are now entering the second 100 years of Boy \nScouting. As I said, Scouting came to America 100 years ago yesterday \nbecause of a good deed. An American, William Boyce, was visiting London \nwhen he suddenly got lost in the fog. A young boy found him and helped \nhim find his way. When Mr. Boyce offered to give the young boy money, \nhe said, ``No, thank you, sir, I am a Scout. I won't take anything for \nhelping.'' Boyce was so overcome by the Scout's generosity that he \narranged to meet with Lord Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouts \nin Great Britain. After returning from his trip, Mr. Boyce met with a \ngroup of American businessmen, educators, and political leaders and \nfounded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. Nobody knows \nwhat happened to the boy who guided Mr. Boyce through the foggy streets \nof London that day, but his kindness lives on in the spirit of each Boy \nScout today.\n  The Boy Scouts is one of the largest youth organizations in the \nUnited States--one of the very few recognized by Congress. Since its \nfounding in 1910, it is estimated that more than 110 million Americans \nhave served as members within its ranks. Scouting offers young people \nthe promise of friendship, an opportunity to set positive goals, and \nteaches boys how to experience the outdoors. Above all, Scouting is \nabout service and building character.\n  To understand Scouting, you only need to look at the Scout Oath. The \noath sets out the principles of Scouting and explains just what it \nmeans to be a Boy Scout. It goes:\n\n       On my honor--\n\n  Meaning the Scouts live by their word and promise to follow the Scout \nOath--\n\n     I will do my best--\n\n  Scouts measure their achievements against their own high standards. \nScouts do so without being influenced by peer pressure or what other \npeople do----\n\n     to do my duty to God--\n\n  Scouts are reverent toward God. They are faithful in their duties, \nand Scouts respect the beliefs of others--\n\n     and my country--\n\n  Scouts keep the United States a strong and fair Nation by learning \nabout our system of government and acting as responsible citizens. \nScouts work to improve their communities and seek to protect and use \nour national resources wisely--\n\n     and to obey the scout law--\n\n  Scouts respect and live by the 12 points of the Scout Law. These 12 \npoints are guidelines which lead people to make responsible choices--\n\n     to help other people at all times--\n\n  Scouts recognize that there are many people in need.\n  They know that a cheerful smile and helping hand will ease the burden \nof most who need assistance--\n\n     to keep myself physically strong--\n\n  Scouts pledge to take care of their bodies so that it will serve for \nan entire lifetime. That means eating nutritious foods and exercising \nregularly. It also means Scouts avoid harmful drugs, alcohol, and \ntobacco--\n\n     mentally awake--\n\n  Scouts develop their minds both in the classroom and outside of \nschool. They are curious about everything around them and work hard to \nmake the most of their abilities--\n\n     and morally straight.\n\n  To be a person of strong character, a Scout's relationship with \nothers should be honest and open. Scouts respect and defend the rights \nof all people, and they are clean in their speech and actions.\n  All Scouts reaching the first rank of Tenderfoot must be able to \nrecite and explain the meaning of the Scout Oath.\n  The Boy Scouts also empower young people to pursue meaningful life \ngoals. That includes putting them on the path to Scouting's highest \nhonor.\n  To backtrack just a moment, because one of the points of that Scout \nOath, or promise, was to obey the Scout Law, this is the new Boy Scout \nHandbook. I had a hard-bound one. Now they have a spiral-bound one that \nmakes it much easier to get into. The Scout promise says that you will \nobey the Scout Law. The Scout Law is that ``a scout is trustworthy, \nloyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, \nbrave, clean and reverent''--all good virtues that are promoted. There \naren't a lot of youth organizations now that promote virtues and build \ncharacter.\n  So it has been helpful from that standpoint for a lot of people, \nincluding myself.\n  The Boy Scouts do empower young people to pursue meaningful goals. A \nmajor goal of Scouts is to be on the path of Scouting's highest honor, \nwhich is to be an Eagle Scout. The first Boy Scout Handbook described \nan Eagle Scout as ``the all-around perfect Scout.'' That is a very \ndemanding standard and may explain why fewer than 4 percent of Boy \nScouts reach the rank of Eagle Scout. Pursuing this honor requires \nyoung people to master the skills of leadership, service, and outdoor \nknow-how. It also requires the practice of good citizenship and sound \nethical behavior. Above all, once you are an Eagle Scout, you are \nalways an Eagle Scout. It is something that is listed on resumes for \nthe rest of their life--one of the few works from youth that can be \nlisted on a resume.\n  From 1912 to 2009, 2 million Boy Scouts earned the Eagle Scout rank. \nEagle Scouts have become leaders in all walks of life, including \nbusiness, academics, entertainment, science, and, yes, even government. \nWithin the 111th Congress alone, there are 22 Members who received \ntheir Eagle Scout awards. Eagle Scouts also leave an everlasting impact \non their communities through the civic projects they complete to earn \ntheir rank. Park improvement projects, trail enhancements, organizing \ncommunity events, and construction projects only begin to explain the \nthings Eagle Scouts have done to improve the world around them.\n  Over its 100-year history in America, Boy Scouting has shaped many \nyoung lives. The service that Scouts have performed is immeasurable, \nbut there are many noteworthy moments.\n  During World War I, Scouts played an important role in the war effort \nby collecting used paper and glass from homes. They also sold Liberty \nBonds during World War I, valuing over $147 million. Congress was so \ngrateful for the service of the Boy Scouts that they granted the Boy \nScouts of America a special charter in 1916. President Roosevelt called \non Scouts to help the needy in 1934 during the Great Depression. \nThroughout World War II, they again collected materials and sold war \nbonds to help the allied effort. By 1954, there were over 100,000 Boy \nScout units, and in 2000 the Boy Scouts honored its 100 millionth \nmember.\n  I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of Boy Scouts. I also \nwish to draw attention to the release of the 100th anniversary \ncommemorative stamp to be released by the Postal Service this summer. \nScouting has meant a great deal to me and my family over the years, and \nI wish to recognize this momentous occasion.\n  With the Boy Scouts of America, the values of leadership, service, \ncharacter, and achievement will live on to make our communities a \nbetter place. Remember, it all began with a good deed on the streets of \nLondon. That is why\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\nthe Scout Slogan reads ``Do a Good Turn Daily.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Madam President, the President of the United \nStates has come forth with a budget for the future of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration. I can tell you that, among the \naerospace community, it has not been well received. The perception is \nthat when the President's proposed budget is to cancel the \nConstellation Program, which was the program from the previous \nadministration that was to take us to the Moon by 2020--a position, by \nthe way, that then-candidate Senator Obama had embraced--it has not \nbeen well received because the perception is that it is killing the \nmanned space program for the United States. That perception is not \nentirely true, but we live in a world here in the government where we \nhave to set policy and flesh out that policy with authorization and \nthen appropriations for that policy. We live in a world where \nperception often governs instead of the actual substance.\n  It is my hope, as we have a hearing in our Science and Space \nSubcommittee of the Commerce Committee, which I have the privilege of \nchairing, that we can start to separate the perception from the \nsubstance. What the President has proposed actually has some very good \nthings. In the first place, this ridiculous idea from the previous \nadministration that we were going to shut down the International Space \nStation in 2015, when, in fact, it hasn't even been completed--as a \nmatter of fact, the mission that took off, I guess it was last night, \nthat has the last major component to go up to complete the \nInternational Space Station, and then the remaining four flights of the \nspace shuttle will take up additional experiments and equipment, and \nthen the station will be fully ready for business.\n  The idea from the previous administration that we were only going to \nhave it until 2015, of course, was ridiculous. The Obama administration \nhas come out and said we are going to extend it until 2020. That is a \ngood thing. That is the right thing.\n  The administration also has said NASA is one of the few civilian \nagencies it is recommending, to the Congress, get additional funding, \nand it is no small amount. It is an additional $6 billion the President \nis recommending over the next 5 years. That is substantial, given the \nfact that the NASA budget is a very small budget compared to the rest \nof the Federal agencies. However, that amount is only half of what was \nrecommended by the Obama-appointed blue ribbon panel, called the Norman \nAugustine Commission, looking at the future of spaceflight--only half \nbut it is substantial. I should note that is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  The Obama administration has also recommended a substantial increase \nin research and development and particularly with regard to a heavy-\nlift vehicle that will change NASA's mission from just going to and \nfrom low-Earth orbit, where we have done all our work in the last three \ndecades with the space shuttle--to and from low-Earth orbit, either to \nthe space station or certain projects such as the Hubble space \ntelescope, which has been miraculous, and the refurbishing missions \nthat have kept that space telescope alive and has opened our \nunderstanding and knowledge of the heavens and is peering back into the \nbeginning of time. That has been extraordinary.\n  The President has said: Let's get out of low-Earth orbit and explore \nthe heavens. That is all a good thing. But here is where the President, \nin his rollout of his recommended budget, made the mistake and has \ngiven the perception that he has killed the manned space program. He \njust said we are going to cancel Constellation. They did not explain: \nBut we have to do an aggressive effort toward building the new heavy-\nlift vehicle to take us out into the heavens. They put all their eggs \nin the basket to say we are going to let these commercial companies \ndevelop rockets that are going to take us to and from the space \nstation, first with cargo, and then we are going to human rate them for \nhuman crews.\n  But the first commercial rocket, Space X, is supposed to have flown \nsix times by now. They have not flown that Falcon 9 rocket yet. They \nare saying they are going to fly it this spring. Let's hope they do, \nand let's hope it is successful.\n  But what if it isn't? There is another one, a much smaller rocket \ncalled Orbital Sciences. They want to take cargo. Ultimately, they \nwould like to take humans. But they have not gotten off the ground with \nthe first test rocket.\n  For us, where safety ought to be primacy--and one of the key \nfundamentals for the Constellation Program was to create a rocket and a \nfollow-on heavy-lift rocket that was going to increase, by a factor of \n10, the safety for astronauts because the space shuttle has 1,500 \nparts, any one of which, if it malfunctions, that is it. It is tube \ncity. It is a catastrophic loss.\n  The idea is to have a rocket that builds in a lot more safety for the \nhumans going to and from the space station and ultimately a heavy-lift \nrocket that gets us out of low-Earth orbit.\n  What I think the President needs to do, he has to repair the image \nbecause the perception is he has killed the manned space program. He \ndoes not want to do that. I know the President. The Presiding Officer \nknows the President. He is a great space aficionado. But the perception \nis there, and it has to be corrected.\n  The first thing he should do is set a goal. Presidents are the only \nones who can lead America's space program. A Senate committee cannot do \nit. The Administrator of NASA cannot do it. Only Presidents can set the \nvision and the goal, and that goal ought to be what we all know is \nwhere we want to go and that is to the planet Mars.\n  If you think I am reaching too far, no less than one of the most \ncritical editorial pages of NASA in America this morning endorsed the \ngoal of going to Mars. That is the New York Times editorial page. This \nis what a bunch of us have been saying for years: The goal is Mars. We \nhave to develop the technology, the vehicles, the safety systems, the \nlife support systems to get there. But the President needs to set the \ngoal and set the vision that this is where we are going.\n  If the President would do this, and then if he would turn the \narchitecture over to his science adviser and to his Administrator of \nNASA and that great team, and if they would continue with the testing \nof the rocket that has already flown successfully, that will be a \nprecursor to building the heavy-lift vehicle--if they will continue \nthat testing, then the President will be well on the way of doing what \nhe wants to do, which is for America to be the leader in space \nexploration and combined with other countries, where it is appropriate, \nin international exploration, as we have on the International Space \nStation.\n  I urge the White House to start listening to some of their most \nvigorous supporters in the Congress. I can tell you other Members on \nboth sides of the aisle are not pleased with the way the President's \nmessage about the future of human spaceflight has been received. If we \ncan work together, we can get the perception of our space exploration \nback on track.\n\n\n                           health care reform\n\n  Madam President, I wish to say, in conclusion, I am hopeful that as \nwe have seen over the last couple days, as we have been in this \nblizzard and we have had time to reflect and read and sometimes hear \nthe commentary on the radio and TV, all the shrillness we have seen on \ndisplay over the last several months is going to subside and, in a \nbipartisan way, the country can start healing.\n  For the country to heal, we must change the discourse in the public \nsquare. Civility, not savagery, is the only way a democracy can proceed \nand succeed. Politics cannot be the blood sport that takes people down \non a personal basis, where the attitude is that I am all right and you \nare all wrong because that leaves little room for consensus building, \nand consensus building is so essential to the functioning of a \ndemocracy.\n  As we get into more of the discussion with regard to health care, \nhealth insurance reform, it is my prayer that we have much more \nconciliation and mediation and moderation in our views so we can build \nconsensus. Consensus building is the finest hour of a democracy in \nrepresenting all the people.\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\n  (Mr. UDALL of Colorado assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S530-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S530-S531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HAITI EARTHQUAKE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 2003 I joined my friend, then-Senator \nMike DeWine, in visiting Haiti. While no longer in the Senate, Mike \nremains a tireless advocate for Haiti. Also joining us were Senator \nBill Nelson and Representative Kendrick Meek.\n  At the time, the country was trapped in a political and economic \nslump. Yet, amid the country's grinding poverty and broken political \nsystem, the Haitian people maintained an incredible vibrancy and \nkindness. It is a warmth one notices among the many Haitians living in \nthe United States, including the more than 7,000 who call Chicago their \nhome.\n  I have never forgotten that experience, and over the years I have \nworked to support development and economic programs to help the Haitian \npeople. Last year I introduced a bill with Senator Brownback to help \nreforest Haiti with techniques proven in other nations.\n  A year ago I had the chance to return to Haiti--this time with \nSenator Jeff Bingaman, Congressman Meek, and an Illinois State Senator \nwhose parents are from Haiti, Kwame Raoul. While the country still \nfaced terrible poverty, much had improved since my earlier visit. The \ngovernment and political system had stabilized.\n  A multination U.N. peacekeeping force had brought an end to most of \nthe gang violence, kidnappings, and lawlessness. Special trade programs \nwith the United States had sparked a rebirth of the garment industry, \nproviding thousands of Haitians with jobs. Groups such as Partners in \nHealth and Hands Together were making progress in building health care \ncapacity and educating children from the poorest slums of Port-au-\nPrince. The country had even rebounded from a series of devastating \nhurricanes and tropical storms.\n  And most recently, former President Bill Clinton had become the U.N. \nSpecial Envoy to Haiti, bringing his skill and energy,--along with \nSecretary Clinton's leadership in the State Department,--to help \nimprove the lives of the Haitian people. While still desperately poor, \nmany had sensed the country was turning a corner.\n  Then tragedy struck. On January 12, the largest earthquake in this \nhemisphere in 200 years devastated Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and \nseveral surrounding towns. The Haitian Government estimates that \n200,000 people died. Sadly, that number is almost certain to grow. A \nstaggering number of houses and buildings simply collapsed. It is \nestimated that 1 million people may now be homeless. Hospitals and \ngovernment buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. The U.N. \nheadquarters crumbled to the ground, killing hundreds of international \nstaff who had dedicated their lives to helping the people of Haiti. \nOnly a short 90-minute plane ride from our shores, a small, poor nation \nhas suffered an almost unimaginable catastrophe.\n  President Obama immediately did the right thing. He mobilized the \nwhole of the U.S. Government to help our neighbors in Haiti. Less than \n36 hours after the earthquake struck, President Obama pledged to the \nHaitian people that America would not forget them or forsake them in \ntheir time of need. He pledged $100 million in emergency aid for Haiti. \nThis aid is in addition to the regular development assistance the \nUnited States provides to Haiti, which totaled at least $287 million \nlast year and was planned to reach at least $340 million this year.\n  In addition, over 17,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines--\nincluding 17 members of the Illinois Guard--have been dispatched to \nassist in Haiti recovery and relief efforts. We have all seen their \nheroic efforts: medical treatment provided in the most challenging of \nconditions, survivors pulled from the rubble of collapsed buildings.\n  American leadership is helping to coordinate the largest \ninternational relief effort since the cataclysmic Asian tsunami in \n2004, with governments throughout the world joining in. In Europe, the \n18 member nations of the European Union have pledged a total of $575 \nmillion in emergency aid to Haiti. The E.U. has also sent security \nforces to help strengthen security in the devastated nation. Planeloads \nof rescue teams and relief supplies have been dispatched from nations \nincluding Britain, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, \nand Spain. Other countries--in South America, the Middle East, and \nAsia--have pledged to help. And government help is only the beginning.\n  In typical American fashion, people and organizations from all over \nour country have donated money, organized shipments of medicine, food \nand water, and traveled to Haiti as emergency relief workers to help \nrescue and treat the earthquake victims.\n  The Chronicle of Philanthropy conducted a survey. It found that in \nthe first 13 days after the earthquake struck Haiti, individuals and \ngroups donated $470 million to 39 U.S. nonprofit organizations for \nHaiti relief. Despite the economic pain and anxiety so many American \nfamilies are feeling, Americans are once again demonstrating great \ngenerosity when it is so desperately needed. The American people have \nresponded generously.\n  According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy survey, the pace of giving \nfor Haiti is running ahead of the amount donated in the same period \nafter the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the Asian tsunami in 2004, \nand nearly as fast as the unprecedented outpouring of donations that \nfollowed Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n  Never before have so many Americans donated so much, so fast, to the \npeople of another nation in need. And they have done so in large and \nsmall ways, including a novel approach that has made a significant mark \nfor the first time--using their cell phones to ``text'' donations--a \nmethod that didn't even exist a few years ago.\n  The American Red Cross has received more than $33 million through \ntext-messaged gifts of $10 each. Other organizations have also tapped \ninto the ``mobile giving'' movement to raise funds for Haiti.\n  A global telethon last week has raised $66 million so far, with money \nstill coming in from music downloads and other sources.\n  Corporations are also stepping up. The Business Civic Leadership \nCenter, a nonprofit group affiliated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nreports that 265 companies have contributed more than $122 million for \nHaiti relief.\n  Families around the world, including many in Illinois, have found \nthat the Haitian orphans they were in the process of adopting are \ncaught in the earthquake's uncertain aftermath.\n  My heart goes out to these families and these children. We have been \ncontacted by a number of Illinois families who are asking for help \nlocating or reconnecting with a loved one who was caught in the quake. \nWe have been working to minimize the redtape and put the families \ndirectly in contact with the U.S. Government task force and other \ngroups who are on the ground in Haiti working on locating people and \ngetting them to safety.\n  With loving families waiting anxiously for news, we are doing all we \ncan, in coordination with the Haitian Government, to help these \nchildren. We are also working to find and move to safety newly orphaned \nchildren.\n  That is why I was heartened by the announcement by Department of \nHomeland Security Janet Napolitano that her agency and the Department \nof State have implemented a humanitarian parole policy that allows \nHaitian children already identified as orphans before the earthquake to \nenter the United States temporarily under certain circumstances.\n  We will continue to address the most immediate needs in Haiti: \nrescuing survivors; providing shelter, food, water, and medical \ntreatment; and avoiding the spread of disease. And we must commit to \nworking with the Haitian people and international partners to help get \nHaiti back on its feet over the long term.\n  The United States should join in the upcoming international donor \nconference that will shape a long-term plan to help put Haiti back on \nits feet in a way that is sustainable in the years ahead. We cannot \nundo the terrible loss Haiti has suffered, but we can show the best of \nAmerican compassion, generosity, and ingenuity in helping the Haitian \npeople rebuild their nation. I urge my colleagues to support these \nefforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S531-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   20TH ANNIVERSARY FOR THE TRANSPORTATION TRADES DEPARTMENT, AFL-CIO\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nTransportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO as it marks its 20th \nanniversary as an advocacy organization for America's transportation \nworkers.\n  The Transportation Trades Department, TTD, has been an outstanding \nleader on behalf of the men and women who form the backbone of this \ncritical industry. In the face of repeated economic and security \nchallenges, these workers continue to do all they can to safely and \nefficiently move passengers and freight across town and across the \nglobe. In these difficult times for the transportation industry and its \nemployees, TTD has effectively brought workers' voices to bear on \nimportant policy debates in Washington.\n  TTD has been one of the leading advocates for a strong investment in \nour Nation's transportation infrastructure. They have been at the \nforefront, explaining to policymakers and the American people the need \nfor a stronger, safer, and more efficient transportation network. New \ntransportation investments are the building blocks of economic \nrecovery, as they create skilled, family-supporting jobs. They help \nrebuild our Nation, facilitating faster and more efficient movement of \npeople and goods. Throughout our Nation's history, strong investments \nin transportation infrastructure have proven to be a successful \nstrategy to create good jobs and improve the quality of life for the \nAmerican people.\n  As chairman of the Senate Transportation, Housing, and Urban \nDevelopment Appropriations Subcommittee--and as a Senator from a State \nwith many transportation hubs--I have enjoyed a close and productive \nrelationship with TTD. Its leaders and front line workers have always \nbrought a highly knowledgeable and responsible approach to their \nefforts. TTD has helped workers in such a large, complex industry speak \nwith a clear and effective voice as our Nation seeks to address these \nimportant economic and homeland security issues.\n  I congratulate the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO on this \nmilestone anniversary and look forward to continuing to work closely \nwith our nation's transportation workers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S531-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S531-S532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this evening the Senate will proceed to a \nvote on a well-qualified nominee for the seat vacated by Justice Alito \nwhen he was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Two weeks ago, I came to \nthe floor to address one of the latest Supreme Court cases where \nJustice Alito's vote was both decisive and divisive. The decision in \nCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission was a 5 to 4, and it \nillustrates how the change in just one justice on the Supreme Court can \nhave serious consequences for hardworking Americans and for our \ndemocracy.\n  This controversial decision is receiving much attention for its \nconservative activism, its lack of deference to the elected branches, \nand its disregard for the rule of law. With the stroke of a pen, five \nJustices overturned a century of law to permit corporations to \noverwhelm and distort the democratic process. The five Justices in the \nactivist conservative bloc reached out to grant corporations rights \nthat were once reserved for individual Americans. This divisive \ndecision puts the special interests of big oil, banks and insurance \ncompanies ahead of the interests of the American people.\n  I believe that corporations are not the same as individual Americans. \nThis is certainly true in the context of the rights and freedoms \nenshrined in our Constitution. Corporations do not have the same \nrights, the same morals, the same ideals. Corporations cannot vote in \nour democracy. Corporations do not have the same motivations and \ninterests as individual Americans. This is common sense. Contrary to \nthe preferences of the five Justices who decided the Citizens United \ncase, corporations were not part of the ``People'' who sought to \nestablish a more perfect Union through the ratification of the \nConstitution and the adoption of the Bill of Rights.\n  I have heard many Republican Senators praise the Citizens United \ndecision as a ringing endorsement for the free speech rights of \ncorporations. Of course, what they fail to mention is that this \ndecision does not just put the rights of corporations on equal footing \nwith individual Americans. The moneyed corporations that can now \ndominate the airwaves and election discourse will prevent a multitude \nof individual voices from being heard. The biggest corporations can be \nthe loudest and most dominant. What the Republican supporters of the \nCitizens United decision do not say is that these new rights for \ncorporations come at the expense of our democratic principles by \nallowing corporate funded megaphones that will drown out the \nunamplified voices of hardworking Americans.\n  Two weeks ago, Justice Alito shook his head when President Obama \nwarned Americans about the risks of money from foreign corporations \nflowing into our elections. But the conservative majority in Citizens \nUnited did not limit the new ``speech rights'' it granted corporations \nto purely American corporations. The corporation before the court in \nCitizens United appears to be domestic, leading some to argue that the \nprecise holding of the case does not apply to foreign corporations. \nHowever, the legal rationale articulated by the slim majority will no \ndoubt apply beyond non-profit corporations like Citizens United. For \nexample, many observers have concluded that the decision will apply to \nlabor unions as well, even though no union was before the court in this \ncase. The ambiguity about how this decision could apply to corporations \nwith investors who are not American citizens, or directors who are not \nAmerican citizens, to subsidiaries of foreign corporations and to \nmultinational corporations threatens to introduce unprecedented foreign \ninfluence into our elections.\n  The court's ruling exacerbates the already existing loophole allowing \ncampaign contributions from American subsidiaries of foreign \ncorporations. Today, an American subsidiary of a multinational \ncorporation is treated as an American corporation under the campaign \nfinance laws. With the newly-expanded ability of corporations to make \nunlimited independent political expenditures, that right is conferred \non U.S. subsidiaries of multinational corporations as well.\n  How will the Federal Elections Commission be able to police whether \nthe actual source of a campaign contribution comes solely from the \ndomestic entity, and not its foreign affiliations? When a multinational \ncorporation funds a political advertisement, is the FEC expected to \naudit the foreign and domestic sides of the corporation, to ensure that \nthe source of the contribution came purely from the U.S. subsidiary? \nHow can the FEC ensure that American subsidiaries of foreign \ncorporations do not become a front for foreign interests who want to \ninfluence American elections?\n  The American people do not want the domestic subsidiaries of foreign \ncorporations to be able to drown out their voices during the upcoming \ncampaign season. Saudi Aramco is estimated to be worth $781 billion \ndollars. Petro China's estimated net worth is $100 billion, with \nprofits rivaling Exxon Mobil's in the tens of billions each year. \nLikewise, Venezuelan oil takes in tens of billions a year. The German \ninsurance company, Allianz, is worth $2.5 trillion; ING Group is valued \nat $2 trillion. HSBC Holdings is valued at almost $2.5 trillion, with \nannual sales of almost $150 billion. Bank of American itself has sales \nof over $100 billion a year. The temptation for these powerful \ncorporations to begin exploiting the Citizens United decision will be \ngreat. Imagine the influence that a small percentage of these profits \ncould buy to sway elections of legislators considering climate change \nrestrictions or reform of the financial services industry.\n  I fear that the Supreme Court's decision here has invited foreign \ninfluence over our political process. Given the vague legal reasoning \nand disregard for legal precedent that the majority employed to expand \ncorporate power in this case, it is now even uncertain whether those \nexisting restrictions to prevent wholly foreign corporations from \ncontributing directly to the political process can withstand a \nconstitutional challenge.\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\n  The effect of the Court's decision also poses a serious threat to the \nability of state and local governments to police their own elections. \nTwenty-four states currently have laws to restrain corporate spending \non elections. All of those laws are now called into question in the \nwake of the Citizens United decision.\n  At a Senate Rules Committee hearing last week, Montana Attorney \nGeneral Steve Bullock gave compelling testimony about the threat to \nMontana's century-old law prohibiting corporations from ``paying or \ncontributing in order to aid, promote or prevent the nomination or \nelection of any person.'' That law was designed to ensure that \n``Corporations are represented in Montana campaigns, but on equal terms \nalongside other political committees, all of them speaking through \npurely voluntary associations of their money, ideas, and voices.''\n\n  Montana's law, like many state and Federal campaign finance laws, is \nnot new. It stemmed from what Attorney General Bullock described as \n``the infamous bribery of the Montana Legislature by Senator William A. \nClark, which led to its refusal to seat him.'' In 1912, when Montana \nenacted its law, the ``Copper Kings'' dominated not only elections but \nall political debate in Montana and so the fed-up citizens of that \nstate responded.\n  Now, the challenges to state campaign spending laws that are sure to \nfollow Citizens United pose a grave threat to the will of Montana's \npeople, as well as citizens in the 23 other states with laws on the \nbooks limiting corporate spending on elections. Attorney General \nBullock testified that its elections for state senate cost an average \nof $17,000. That is an insignificant expense to a large corporation \nsubject to governmental oversight or regulation.\n  Like Montana, Vermont is a small state. It is easy to imagine large \ncorporations flooding the airwaves with election ads and drowning out \nthe voices of Vermont's citizens. I know that the people of Vermont, \nlike other Americans, take seriously their responsibility as citizens \nto choose wisely when making choices on Election Day. Vermonters \ncherish their critical role in the democratic process and are staunch \nbelievers in the First Amendment, refusing to ratify the Constitution \nuntil the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791. The rights of \nVermonters and all Americans to speak to each other and to be heard \nshould not be undercut by corporate spending. I fear that is exactly \nwhat will happen unless both sides of the aisle join with President \nObama to try to restore the ability of every American to be heard and \neffectively participate in free and fair elections.\n  In this connection, I urge Republicans to heed the advice of our \nformer colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Warren Rudman. He recalls \nthe time when Republicans were in favor of campaign finance reform, \nbefore they flip-flopped on that issue as they have so many now that \nthe American people have elected a Democratic President. I ask that his \ncolumn from the February 5 Washington Post be included in the record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  It is difficult to understand the Justices' lack of concern in \nCitizens United for the potential of massive corporate spending to \ndistort elections, especially in light of the Supreme Court's ruling \nissued only months ago in Caperton v. Massey. In that case, Justice \nKennedy wrote that the possibility of bias due to campaign \ncontributions in a state judicial election meant that the judge was \nwrong not to recuse himself from deciding a case involving a defendant \nwho had spent $3 million supporting his election campaign to the bench. \nI agreed with that decision. There, Justice Kennedy wrote: ``We \nconclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias--based on \nobjective and reasonable perceptions--when a person with a personal \nstake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate \ninfluence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or \ndirecting the judge's election campaign when the case was pending or \nimminent.'' What I do not understand is how these same standards and \nobvious logic were not applied to corporate spending in election \ncampaigns.\n  The campaign finance laws passed by Congress, as well as the 24 \nstates that have enacted restrictions, reflect a clear reason for \ntreating individuals and their free speech rights differently from \ncorporations--especially foreign corporations--and their money. These \nlaws were well-founded on principles dating back not just a century to \nthe Tillman laws, but to the distinction dating back to the time of our \nNation's founding.\n  As early as 1819, the great Chief Justice John Marshall acknowledged \nthat ``A corporation is an artificial being . . . the mere creature of \nlaw, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its \ncreation confers upon it. . . .'' That 191-year-old precedent is one of \nthe many betrayed by the five Justice majority in Citizens United when \nit ignored the nature of corporations as artificial, legally-created \nconstructions and wrongly described them merely as indistinguishable \nfrom other ``associations of citizens.'' Corporations are created by \ngovernments and given special rights and privileges. They are not \npeople. Describing them as indistinguishable ignores not only the long \ndevelopment of the law but logic and reality.\n  The threat posed by the Citizens United goes well beyond the specific \nlimitations on corporate spending that were struck down in its \ndecision. The same lawyers who initiated the Citizens United case are \nalready seeking to overturn other limits on election spending and \ntransparency in campaign fundraising. If those lawyers are successful \nin a case called SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission--a case \ncurrently before the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit, a court like the Supreme Court controlled by Republican-\nappointed conservative activists--it could gut laws meant to ensure \nthat the public knows who funds political ads. That means unaccountable \ngroups would be free to distort elections with anonymous attack ads, \nunanswerable to the American people.\n  I fear that we have not seen the last of the efforts of the newly-\nconstituted Supreme Court to knock down long-established precedents. \nThe Citizens United decision may have a dramatic impact on American \ndemocracy, but it is only the latest in a growing set of examples of \nwhy every seat on the highest court affects the lives of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S532-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S532-S534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THE LYNN BROTHERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, lucky is the town that has a good civic \nminded newspaper.\n  Vermont is fortunate to have several, and two reasons for that are \nthe brothers Emerson and Angelo Lynn. The Lynn brothers have shown how \npublic spirited newspapering is also good business.\n  A profile of the Lynn brothers in a recent edition of Vermont's Seven \nDays newspaper, written by Ken Picard, opens with this: ``Newspapermen \nEmerson and Angelo Lynn learned a long time ago that it's not enough \nfor a community paper to be good. It's also got to do good. And the one \nthat achieves both goals can thrive in its niche--even when larger \ncorporate newspapers are struggling.''\n  Emerson and Angelo Lynn--with roots in Kansas and newspapering in \ntheir heritage--have made their homes in Vermont since the 1980s, and \nit was the chance to publish newspapers that brought them to our State. \nEmerson has published the St. Albans Messenger since 1981. Angelo \narrived soon after to purchase and publish the Addison County \nIndependent.\n  The Messenger, the Independent and the other publications they own \nand manage have flourished under their management. Not only have they \ninvested significant time and energy into the success of their own \nnewspapers; they also generously mentor and support other local \npublishers.\n  This is a time of uncertainty and introspection in the Nation's \nnewspaper businesses. Alternate media streams and a severe economic \nrecession have driven down earnings and have driven some papers out of \nbusiness. New formulas will be tried. But in the meantime, Emerson and \nAngelo Lynn have shown that the old formula of civic minded journalism \ncan still work.\n  The Lynn brothers have been successful because they care deeply about \nwhere they live, and they invest in their communities in every sense, \nincluding their hearts and souls. They\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\nact out of a sense of responsibility to their readers. Their tone is \ncivil and constructive. Mr. Picard quotes veteran Vermont journalist \nStephen Kiernan: ``These guys have a real sense of place. They know \nwhen a business is doing well; they know when something is changing; \nthey know what's in the wind. A sense of place is essential to any \nbusiness in Vermont, but it's especially true in the media business.''\n  These two extraordinary Vermonters continue to give their best, and \ntheir businesses have become keystones in the civic infrastructure of \nFranklin and Addison Counties, and beyond.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article from Seven Days, \n``Brothers in Ink,'' by Ken Picard, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Seven Days, Jan. 27, 2010]\n\n                            Brothers in Ink\n\n\nWhile others elegize print journalism, Emerson and Angelo Lynn are hot \n                             on the presses\n\n                            (By Ken Picard)\n\n       Newspapermen Emerson and Angelo Lynn learned a long time \n     ago that it's not enough for a community newspaper to be \n     good. It's also got to do good. And the one that achieves \n     both goals can thrive in its niche--even when larger \n     corporate newspapers are struggling.\n       Emerson Lynn, editor and publisher of the six-days-a-week \n     St. Albans Messenger since 1981, knows his paper has \n     influence in the community. Shortly before Christmas, the \n     Hannaford supermarket in his town participated in a company-\n     wide ``Fund-a-Feast'' campaign. Throughout the holidays, \n     shoppers could buy a $10 box of food to donate to their local \n     food shelf. The store in Vermont that sold the most boxes \n     would win $1000 for its food shelf, and the winning store in \n     the entire 171-supermarket chain would get an additional \n     $2500.\n       A week before the contest ended, Emerson approached store \n     manager Dan LeCours and asked him how many boxes he needed to \n     win. LeCours said he didn't know, but was sure he didn't have \n     enough on hand to even come close.\n       ``Emerson said, `You get me that number, and I'll take it \n     from there,' '' LeCours recalls. ``Coming from Emerson, if he \n     says it, he means it.''\n       Knowing that one in eight Vermonters is now on food stamps, \n     Emerson ran free full-page ads in the Messenger the following \n     week, asking his readers to rise to the challenge. They did.\n       ``That last weekend we sold $9000 worth of Fund-A-Feast \n     boxes. None of that would have happened were it not for \n     Emerson Lynn,'' says LeCours. ``It just goes to show the \n     power of the press when the person behind it is highly \n     trusted and highly respected.''\n       Lately, it's hard to find any good news about print \n     journalism. In December, the now-defunct-in-print Editor & \n     Publisher magazine essentially wrote its own obituary when it \n     reported that more than 40,000 newspaper jobs disappeared in \n     2009, nearly twice as many as the 21,000 that vanished in \n     2008. Mainstream newspapers such as the New York Times and \n     the Boston Globe have continued to echo that death knell.\n       But you won't find that story anywhere in the pages of a \n     Lynn publication, or in their bottom lines. Emerson's younger \n     brother, Angelo, has been editor and publisher of the twice-\n     weekly Addison County Independent since 1984. According to \n     Emerson, 2008, the first year of the current recession, was \n     the Lynns' best year ever. Emerson admits that profits are \n     down, but only slightly, and neither brother has laid off \n     staff.\n       In fact, both the Messenger and the Independent have \n     employees who've been with them for more than 30 years. In \n     the Messenger's newsroom, editor Gary Rutkowski and staff \n     writer Leon Thompson have a half-century of combined \n     experience between them. Emerson and Angelo insist their \n     papers wouldn't be where they are today without that level of \n     institutional memory.\n       Of course, reaching out to the next generation is crucial, \n     too. Both the Messenger and Independent routinely devote \n     space to publishing the work of students in the Young Writers \n     Project. Once a month, Angelo delivers 200 free copies of the \n     ``Addy Indy,'' as it's often called, to Middlebury Union High \n     School. Inside each is a copy of the Tigers' Print, the \n     student newspaper. Emerson does the same thing for Bellows \n     Free Academy--St. Albans.\n       This isn't just smart PR for the Lynn newspapers--it's also \n     a long-term investment in their readerships.\n       ``For our newspapers,'' says Emerson, ``this is our seed \n     corn.''\n       It's a fitting metaphor, coming from two Kansas brothers \n     who moved to Vermont more than 25 years ago to sow the seeds \n     of community journalism in the Champlain Valley. Since then, \n     the Lynns have reaped the journalistic equivalent of a bumper \n     crop. In addition to the Messenger and the Independent, the \n     brothers now publish the Colchester Sun, Essex Reporter, \n     Brandon Reporter and Milton Independent. Angelo also puts out \n     Vermont Ski & Ride Magazine, a winter monthly on the ski \n     industry, and several telephone books in southern Vermont.\n       In an age when the public has an overabundance of news \n     sources to choose from--websites, blogs, social networking \n     sites, 24/7 cable-news channels--how do Lynn publications \n     manage not just to survive, but to thrive? Very simple, \n     Emerson explains. They remain faithful to their core mission: \n     Give readers in-depth local coverage--school board meetings, \n     high school sports, property taxes and so on--that they want \n     and can't find anywhere else.\n       ``When you have a tight-knit community, everybody likes to \n     know that everybody else is on the same page, and Addison and \n     Franklin counties are pretty tight-knit communities,'' Angelo \n     adds. ``What you find now is that, increasingly, the \n     community newspaper is the glue that binds.''\n       Stephen Kiernan agrees. A former staff writer at the \n     Burlington Free Press for 15 years and a longtime Middlebury \n     resident, he's impressed by how involved Angelo and Emerson \n     are in their respective communities. This means, for example, \n     that he sees Emerson out running at a middle-school lacrosse \n     jamboree attended by hundreds of parents and children. Or he \n     spots Angelo at a performance of the play Our Town, and the \n     next day reads his editorial about how the play reflects \n     Middlebury's diversity.\n       ``These guys have a real sense of place,'' Kiernan says. \n     ``They know when a business is doing well; they know when \n     something is changing; they know what's in the wind . . . A \n     sense of place is essential to any business in Vermont, but \n     it's especially true in the media business.''\n       Steve Terry, also a longtime Middlebury resident and former \n     editor of the Rutland Herald, agrees. He says that whenever \n     big institutions in Addison County want to break a story, \n     they make sure the Independent gets it first.\n       ``People could read in the Herald or the Free Press that \n     something happened in Middlebury,'' Terry says, ``but they \n     just wouldn't believe it or feel it was covered until they \n     read it in the Independent.''\n       Tyrone Shaw, director of the journalism program at Johnson \n     State College, is an aficionado of sorts of small community \n     newspapers. Shaw says that Lynn newspapers consistently \n     provide ``aggressive but responsible'' news coverage of \n     important local issues. He's especially fond of their \n     editorial and letters sections, which he calls ``meaty and \n     interesting.''\n       In large part, that's because Angelo and Emerson typically \n     write their own editorials. They come from opposite ends of \n     the political spectrum. Angelo is more left leaning than \n     Emerson and far more likely to criticize the governor, Jim \n     Douglas' residence in Middlebury notwithstanding. Emerson, a \n     regular contributor to the conservative blog Vermont Tiger, \n     is more likely to attack Bernie Sanders and the actions of \n     the left-dominated legislature. In the last election, \n     however, he supported Barack Obama.\n       Despite some divergent views on elected officials, economic \n     growth and job creation, the Lynn brothers insist they see \n     eye to eye on all social issues, such as abortion and \n     gay rights. Back in July 1997, the Messenger was the first \n     daily paper in the state to endorse civil unions. It's \n     that sophisticated understanding of the issues, Shaw says, \n     that makes the brothers' papers invaluable reading in \n     their communities.\n       ``I think they were both born with newspaper ink in their \n     blood,'' he concludes. ``They're old-fashioned newspapermen \n     in the very best sense.''\n       That assessment of the Lynn DNA isn't far off. Emerson and \n     Angelo are fourth-generation newspapermen. Their great-\n     grandfather, Charles F. Scott, bought the Iola Register, a \n     small weekly in southwestern Kansas, in 1882. His son, Angelo \n     Scott, took over the paper and ran it until 1965, when he \n     turned it over to Emerson and Angelo's father, who's also \n     named Emerson.\n       The elder Emerson and his wife, Mickey, met at college in \n     Australia, but returned to Kansas in 1950. They published \n     first the Humboldt, Kan., Humboldt Union, then the Bowie News \n     in Bowie, Tx., where Emerson and Angelo lived for seven \n     years.\n       ``Every single Wednesday night Dad would load us into the \n     car and take us down to the paper, and we'd insert the \n     papers,'' recalls Angelo. It's a job the brothers still do on \n     occasion in the Messenger's ancient, lime-green press room in \n     St. Albans.\n       In 1965, the Lynns' parents returned to their Kansas roots \n     and took over the Register. They ran it until last year, when \n     Emerson and Angelo's mother died and their father turned over \n     the publishing duties to their sister, Susan Lynn. The \n     siblings have a third brother, Michael, a pastor in Hamden, \n     Conn. Angelo jokes, ``The four of us are either preaching \n     from the pulpit or from the editorial pages.''\n       Perhaps it was inevitable that Emerson and Angelo would \n     choose the newspaper business. In 1970, when Angelo was 16, \n     he attended a summer camp at the University of Kansas for \n     kids interested in journalism. On the third day, he recalls, \n     antiwar protesters bombed the student union. He happened to \n     be in the office of the photography instructor, who grabbed a \n     camera and dashed to the scene.\n       ``Minutes later,'' Angelo remembers, ``we were crouched \n     behind a police car, the cops with pointed guns surrounding \n     the student union, and us with our cameras clicking . . . I \n     was hooked.''\n       Both Emerson and Angelo eventually graduated from KU's \n     William Allen White School\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\n     of Journalism. Emerson got married and moved east to work on \n     Capitol Hill as a speechwriter for then-U.S. Sen. Jim \n     Pearson, a Kansas Republican--then for his successor, Sen. \n     Nancy Kassebaum.\n       But Emerson quickly grew bored with his duties and began \n     looking around for a newspaper to buy. He considered some in \n     the Rocky Mountain area, but quickly realized he'd never \n     afford one. In 1981, a broker approached him with a proposal \n     to buy a stridently right-wing daily in northwestern Vermont. \n     The St. Albans Daily Messenger, then owned by publisher \n     William Loeb, had never made money. Emerson bought the paper \n     and quickly improved its reputation and financial \n     performance.\n       Three years later, Gordon Mills, owner of the Addison \n     County Independent, approached Emerson and asked him if he \n     was interested in buying his newspaper, too. Emerson declined \n     but suggested he contact Angelo, who at the time was running \n     the Yates Center News, a small, struggling weekly in \n     southeastern Kansas.\n       So in August 1984, at age 30, Angelo bought the Vermont \n     weekly. Four years later, he turned it into a twice-weekly \n     paper. Today the Addison County Independent has a staff of 21 \n     employees, seven of whom (including Angelo) work in the \n     newsroom. Angelo insists that his commitment to news coverage \n     continues to pay off. Though he says he's made only a modest \n     investment in the paper's website over the years, in 2009 the \n     Vermont Press Association named it the state's best.\n       Meanwhile, the Lynns have continued to acquire flailing \n     newspapers and turned them into money-making ventures. And \n     they've done so with seemingly boundless energy.\n       ``As Angelo likes to say, we're always the last ones on the \n     treadmill,'' Emerson says. ``You may be smarter than us, but \n     you'll never outwork us.''\n       Indeed. As kids, Emerson and Angelo spent most summers at a \n     family cabin in Colorado. Each morning they'd wake at the \n     crack of dawn, load their packs and spend the next 10 to 14 \n     hours hiking to a summit.\n       That commitment to rigorous outdoor exercise hasn't \n     flagged. Emerson and Angelo are well past 50--in a rare show \n     of vanity, Emerson declines to disclose his age, and Angelo \n     won't betray his brother. But neither looks or acts it. Trim, \n     hale and handsome, the brothers have chiseled bodies and \n     resting heart rates that would be the envy of men half their \n     age.\n       Both routinely compete in marathons, triathlons, canoe \n     races and other competitions that demand iron-man stamina. \n     Angelo skis 40 to 50 days per year. Last year, he competed in \n     the Canadian Death Race, a three-day endurance course that \n     traverses a raging river and three mountain summits and \n     includes 17,000 feet of elevation change.\n       Never one to be outdone by his younger brother, Emerson \n     recently took on a 3100-repetition weight-training workout \n     challenge. He completed it in under one hour and 50 minutes.\n       ``We're excessive,'' Emerson admits unapologetically. ``The \n     two of us are extraordinarily competitive. But it's never me \n     against him or him against me. It's ``Let's see what we can \n     do.' ''\n       That drive for peak performance is reflected in their \n     careers. Both are self-described workaholics--Emerson is \n     still married, Angelo divorced--and are intimately involved \n     in every detail of their publications, from writing daily \n     editorials to selling ads to distribution. On a recent visit \n     to Seven Days, Angelo's station wagon was filled with \n     newspapers that needed delivering.\n       ``I have never met anyone in daily journalism who has \n     maintained such a high level of energy day after day after \n     day,'' notes Chris Graff, the former Associated Press writer \n     who ran the Montpelier bureau for 26 years. Speaking of \n     Emerson, he recalls, ``When I was at the AP, his routine was \n     to arrive at work at 5 a.m. every day--and he wrote an \n     editorial every day.''\n       But the Lynns' competitive spirit doesn't come with a \n     bullying or predatory attitude. The brothers have helped \n     fellow Vermont publishers, including those at Seven Days, who \n     benefited from Angelo's free advice when this paper launched. \n     Angelo was also on hand when a group of journalists and \n     publishers gathered recently in Grafton to discuss working \n     cooperatively in the digital age.\n       M. Dickey Drysdale, editor and publisher of the Herald of \n     Randolph, calls the Lynn brothers ``the best gift that Kansas \n     has ever given to Vermont journalism.'' Drysdale, who's been \n     at the Herald since 1971, says Emerson and Angelo have given \n     him business advice and suggestions for advertising campaigns \n     over the years, never expecting anything in return.\n       ``You can sometimes get the idea that press lords are \n     supercilious and very, very serious,'' Drysdale adds. ``Both \n     [Emerson and Angelo] seem to approach their jobs with a high \n     seriousness, but also a cheerful attitude that makes them fun \n     to deal with and makes their newspapers very approachable.''\n       The Lynns say they don't view other community newspapers as \n     competition, even in markets where they compete for ad \n     revenues. As the state's biggest dailies shrink in size--\n     lately, the Monday Burlington Free Press has had fewer pages \n     than the Monday Messenger--neither brother sees any reason to \n     alter their course.\n       ``I don't think you get stronger because other people get \n     weaker. You're stronger because of your adherence to your \n     mission,'' Emerson concludes. ``We're not having to \n     rediscover that local news is important. We've been doing \n     that forever. That's our bread and butter.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S534-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HILLSBOROUGH AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to call the Senate's \nattention to a significant agreement that was signed late last Friday \nnight to preserve the current government in Belfast and continue the \nlong road toward permanent peace in Northern Ireland.\n  The 12 years since the signing of the Good Friday Peace Accords have \nnot been easy ones for the people of Northern Ireland. The power-\nsharing government was suspended in 2002, the British resumed direct \ncontrol, and violence has flared at times. However, all sides have been \ncommitted to working towards the blueprint for peace worked out in \n1998--the Irish Republican Army formally ended its armed campaign in \n2005, the St. Andrews Agreement returned control of the government to \nNorthern Ireland, and all sides have resisted a resurgence of the \nbrutality of the past.\n  In recent months, disagreements over a variety of issues have \nthreatened to bring down the fragile government again--tensions over \nBritish control of prosecutors, the judiciary and the police, and the \nrights of the Protestant Orange Order to parade through heavily \nCatholic neighborhoods have prevented both sides from moving forward.\n  I commend the Northern Irish First Minister Peter Robinson of the \nDemocratic Unionist Party and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness \nof Sinn Fein who met at Hillsborough Castle near Belfast with Prime \nMinister of Britain, Gordon Brown, and Taoiseach Cowen of the Republic \nof Ireland, whose leadership has been vital. Friday's agreement set \nApril 12 as the date for the transfer of the Judiciary and Police \nforces to local control, and laid out a plan and timeline for the \nresolution of disagreements on parades before ``marching season'' in \nJuly of 2011.\n  Northern Ireland's long peacemaking process has been difficult, \ndemanding painful concessions by both sides. Yet both sides also seem \nto have reached a point where return to the conditions of the last 40 \nyears is no longer an option. The last few years have seen \nopportunities for Northern Ireland to return to sectarian strife, and \nyet both sides, their leaders, and the people of Northern Ireland have \nlooked over the edge and stepped back with the knowledge that no matter \nhow difficult the road forward is, the road back must not be travelled.\n  I am proud of the critical role the United States has played in the \nprocess. Former President Clinton was intimately involved in the Good \nFriday Agreement, and Secretary of State Clinton deserves a great deal \nof credit for her part in these talks. All of us in this chamber also \nare proud of the role that former Senator George Mitchell played at \ncrucial junctures earlier in this long process. I assure the people of \nNorthern Ireland that this Senator--and all Americans of good will--\nremains committed to remaining with them every step of the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S534-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S534-S535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the many accomplishments and \ncontributions of black Americans to our Nation.\n  This month, we honor the brave citizens who struggled and fought \nthroughout the years for a better day for their children. A day when \neveryone is treated with respect and dignity.\n  One of those brave citizens was Portland resident Dr. J.N. Merriman, \nwho in 1914--united with a few pioneering sprits--commissioned Oregon's \nfirst NAACP chapter, a mere 5 years after the nationally acclaimed \norganization was formed.\n  The work of Portland's NAACP chapter and Urban League helped to spur \na grassroots movement that succeeded where many previous campaigns had \nfailed, repealing in 1926 and 1927 the State's sordid exclusion laws. \nThese Jim Crow laws, written into the State's Constitution, prevented \nAfrican Americans from living freely in the State, settling, owning \nproperty or voting.\n  It is in the spirit of these pioneering Oregonians and so many brave \ncitizens of every color across this country, that\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\nwe remember and reflect on the history and contributions African \nAmericans have made.\n  Our American identity is tied to the music of outstanding artists \nlike Sarah Vaughan and Duke Ellington, the literary work of authors \nlike Maya Angelou and Langston Hughes, the groundbreaking \naccomplishments of athletes like Jackie Robinson and Jackie Joyner-\nKersee, and the discoveries and inspiration of scientists like Benjamin \nBanneker and Mae Jemison. Thanks to the inventions of African \nAmericans, we now ride on elevators, preserve food in refrigerators and \ntravel safely on the road with traffic lights.\n  The contributions of these and millions more Black Americans are part \nof the very fabric of our Nation.\n  It is in the spirit of these brave citizens, and in recognition that \ntheir remarkable accomplishments are that much more remarkable for \nhaving overcome a history of racial discrimination, that we must \ncontinue to forge ahead on the path of justice and equality. We have \ncome a long way in Oregon and in America--but there is far more to be \ndone.\n  As the Urban League of Portland recently pointed out in their \ncommissioned ``State of Black Oregon'' report: 30 percent of Black \nOregonians are living in poverty--5 percent higher than the national \naverage; only 34 percent of Black Oregonians own their own homes--12 \npercent lower than the national average; and the unemployment rate of \nBlack Oregonians is nearly double the State unemployment rate.\n  These statistics are troubling and are another reminder that we must \ndo much more to ensure that every citizen has the opportunity to lead a \nthriving, productive life free of institutional barriers and policies \nthat prevent success. We must continue to remember the struggle so many \nhave endured to push equity, fairness and justice forward. And we must \nensure that our education system is the best in the world, and that our \nfamilies have access to workforce and training opportunities that lead \nto living-wage jobs.\n  Today, we honor the brave citizens who have made my State, our \ncountry and our world better. Today, we celebrate and reflect--but \ntomorrow, we must get back to work to truly reach equity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S535-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND TEAM IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my \ngratitude to GEN Douglas M. Fraser, Commander, and the men and women \nserving within the U.S. Southern Command, SOUTHCOM, for what was a true \nact of heroism. Certainly, all the members of America's great military \nexemplify a ``can do'' spirit and selfless service to our Nation each \nand every day. And, as we all know full well, our military has ever-\nchanging missions; yet the men and women of our armed services \ndemonstrate time and again their ability to adapt and perform, as is \nthe case with America's most recent humanitarian mission in Haiti.\n  Recently, staff from Creighton University in my home State of \nNebraska sought emergency assistance for some critical patients in \nJimani, Haiti. The Creighton medical team on the ground there needed a \nrapid response for these Haitian patients, but they were unable to \nconnect with any support agencies in the region to get the immediate \nattention this situation required.\n  The team at SOUTHCOM quickly saved the day, airlifting these \ncritically injured patients from Jimani to Milot, Haiti, where they \ncould be properly treated. The entire American and international teams \nin Haiti have saved an untold and incalculable number of lives since \nthe devastating earthquake, but I would be remiss if I did not \nhighlight the incredible effort by the men and women of SOUTHCOM. The \nservicemembers under General Fraser's command managed to evacuate 37 \npatients and their families over the course of January 31 and February \n1, 2010; and these individuals will be forever grateful to the men and \nwoman of America's military for saving their lives.\n  All Americans should recognize this valiant effort by the members of \nSOUTHCOM. General Fraser showed great leadership in overseeing this \nmission, and the courageous service of the men and women at SOUTHCOM \nhas the gratitude of not only the medical team and others from \nCreighton University, but the people of Haiti as well. You are all a \ncredit to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S535-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RECOGNIZING CHICK-FIL-A\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record of \nthe Senate a great Georgia company, Chick-fil-A, Inc., and a great \nGeorgian, its founder S. Truett Cathy.\n  Last May, at age 88, Truett Cathy, founder and active CEO of Chick-\nfil-A, celebrated 63 years in the restaurant business. In 1946, he \nopened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill, in Hapeville, GA. In \nDecember, Chick-fil-A, which Mr. Cathy founded in 1967, reached the $3 \nbillion mark in system-wide sales and posted its 42nd-consecutive \nannual sales increase since the company's inception.\n  While our economy was facing difficult times, the Cathy family and \npresident and COO, Dan T. Cathy, was prepared and committed to carrying \non a family tradition. The Chick-fil-A model of slow and steady growth \nthat has proven so successful in the past has paid off during these \ntough economic times.\n  The chain maintained its pace for new restaurant openings by opening \n83 new restaurants across the country in 2009, creating approximately \n4,200 new jobs. In addition, Chick-fil-A continued its reinvestment in \nits existing restaurant infrastructure by remodeling or expanding 60 \nrestaurants across the chain. Despite the uncertain economy, Chick-fil-\nA continues to be on track to honor the commitment Truett Cathy and his \nfamily made at the end of 2006 to eliminate all company debt by 2012.\n  I am also proud to say that this Georgia-based company also continues \nits strong commitment to education. In August 2009, Truett Cathy \nawarded the 25,000th Chick-fil-A Leadership Scholarship since creating \nthe program in 1973. To date, the leadership scholarship program has \nawarded more than $25 million in financial assistance to more than \n25,000 Chick-fil-A restaurant team members who have attended 2,300-plus \neducational institutions throughout the country. In 2009 alone, Chick-\nfil-A awarded $1.4 million in scholarships to 1,425 Chick-fil-A team \nmembers across the country.\n  Congratulations, Chick-fil-A, and best wishes to Truett Cathy and the \nentire Cathy family for their ongoing success in Georgia and throughout \nthe country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S535-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S535-S536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING CHAPEL HILL FLORAL\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this Sunday, we celebrate \nValentine's Day, when couples across the world take a moment to slow \ndown and show each other their appreciation and love. Along with ``Be \nMy Valentine'' cards and boxes of chocolate, one of the symbols most \nconnected with this special day is a beautiful bouquet of red roses. \nWith that in mind, I wish to recognize a small florist in my home State \nof Maine that continually provides customers with quality flowers and \ngifts--and at this time of year, makes Valentine's Day a sweet event.\n  Chapel Hill Floral, a small flower shop in Bangor, opened its doors \non the corner of West Broadway and Hammond Street in October of 2000. \nThe full service florist sells a wide variety of floral arrangements \nfor all occasions, from weddings to birthdays to everyday moments. \nAdditionally, Chapel Hill stocks a number of plants, as well as baskets \nand hangers for them. The store also sells a vast array of gifts to \ncomplement any floral selection, including Boyd's bears, local wines \nfrom nearby Winterport Winery, and delicious staples from Maine-based \nStonewall Kitchen.\n  A name synonymous with quality in the Bangor region, Chapel Hill has \nthree Maine master floral designers on staff. This designation was \nestablished in 2003 for those passing a wide-ranging course in floral \nmechanics and techniques offered by the Maine State Florists' and \nGrowers' Association. Indeed, Chapel Hill's dedication to excellence \nand its employees' sense of pride in their work has led to a truly \nsatisfied clientele.\n\n[[Page S536]]\n\n  Additionally, to build a bond with the local community, Chapel Hill \nFloral offers a series of timely and entertaining classes on how to \ndesign beautiful floral arrangements. Most recently, in preparation for \nValentine's Day, Chapel Hill offered the ``Prelude to a Kiss'' class, \nwhere students turned a half-dozen red roses into a beautiful display \nwith several accoutrements, such as babies' breath and Calyx leaves. \nOther classes in the near future include the hopeful and aptly named \n``Tropical Getaway'' and ``Spring in a Basket.'' Additionally, for \nanyone who places an order prior to Valentine's Day, their name will be \nautomatically placed in a drawing for an overnight weekend stay at the \nLucerne Inn, one of Maine's most quaint and historic hotels. The \npackage includes dinner for two, Sunday brunch, and a dozen beautiful \nred roses, making it the perfect romantic getaway!\n  Finally, Chapel Hill's superb work has been recognized by Market \nSurveys of America as the ``Best Flower Shop'' in the Greater Bangor \narea 3 years in a row, from 2007 to 2009. Additionally, Mark Pellon, \nwho is one of Chapel Hill's Maine master floral designers was named the \nMaine State Florists' and Growers' Association's Designer of the Year \nfor 2008, a distinct and well-\ndeserved honor.\n  Clearly, Chapel Hill Floral has made a lasting impression on its \ncustomers in the Bangor area, and the company's unique marketing \nefforts are truly noteworthy. My sincerest thanks to owners Barbara and \nRick Frye and everyone at Chapel Hill Floral for all of their excellent \nwork, and my best wishes for a pleasant Valentine's season and a \nsuccessful year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S536-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4061.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduced a resolution \nwith my colleague, Mr. Chambliss of Georgia, recognizing hardwood trees \nas an abundant, sustainable and renewable resource. Specifically, the \nresolution states that the U.S. Senate\n\n       Recognizes that United States hardwoods are an abundant, \n     sustainable, and legal resource under United States law; and \n     urges that United States hardwoods and products derived from \n     United States hardwoods should be given full consideration in \n     any program to promote construction of environmentally \n     preferable commercial, public, or private buildings.\n\n  Hardwoods are found throughout the U.S., but they are a major \ncomponent of forests from New England, through the Lake States, and the \nSouth-Central and Southeastern states. Hardwood inventories are \nexpected to increase by 27 percent over the next 40 years, according to \nthe Forest Service. Most of these forests are owned and managed by \nfamilies who make substantial investments in these lands, sometimes \nwithout the expectation of timber income in their lifetimes. This \nresolution recognizes the environmental qualities of hardwood lumber, \nas well as the generational commitment of America's family forest \nlandowners who grow and nurture this valuable resource.\n  The Arkansas timber industry has suffered badly during the recession. \nThis resolution will provide new markets for our State's hardwood \ngrowers, many of whom are small family landowners who may harvest trees \nonly once or twice in a generation. With more than 60 hardwood \nfacilities in Arkansas, the industry is an important piece of our \neconomy. Hardwood is valued world-wide as a superior and long-lasting \nbuilding material and I am proud to encourage their use.\n  The U.S. House of Representatives passed a similar resolution, H. \nRes. 81, on September 15, 2009, by voice vote. It enjoyed widespread, \nbipartisan support and had more than 50 cosponsors. I urge my \ncolleagues join us in supporting U.S. hardwoods, the hardwood industry \nand an abundant and renewable resource.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution today \nrecognizing that hardwood trees are an abundant and sustainable \nresource in the United States, and that the products derived from \nhardwood trees should be given full consideration in programs promoting \nthe construction of environmentally friendly buildings, including \ncommercial, public or private buildings. This resolution will hopefully \ndemonstrate Congress's support for the hardwood industry and that these \nhardwood materials, a USA product, are sustainable building materials. \nI invite and encourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor this \nbipartisan resolution.\n  The Nation's forests are a bountiful resource. Not only do they \nprovide forest products and related jobs, but they also are prized for \ntheir scenic beauty, recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat, and \nmaintaining clean air and water.\n  Today, about one-third of the Nation's landscape is forested. The \nmajority of this forestland, about 57 percent, is privately owned. In \nmy home State of Georgia, 24 million acres, about 67 percent of the \nland, is covered by forests. These forests have a direct economic \nimpact of nearly $13 billion per year. About one-third of Georgia's \nforests are hardwoods, which supports the nearly 300 hardwood \nfacilities in the State. Most of these are small, family owned \nbusinesses, just as they are in the rest of the country. Unfortunately, \nin Georgia and the rest of the country, this industry has been in \ndecline for more than a decade as paper and wood mills have closed and \n158,000 jobs, many in rural areas, have been lost.\n  I hope that with this resolution my colleagues and the Nation \nremember the numerous benefits of forests and hardwoods. They are a \nsustainable and renewable resource and should be recognized for the \nenvironmental benefits they provide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S538-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 412--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2010 AS ``NATIONAL \n                  CHILDHOOD OBESITY AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 412\n\n       Whereas during the past 4 decades, obesity rates have \n     soared among all age groups, increasing more than four-fold \n     among children ages 6 to 11;\n       Whereas 31.8 percent or 23,000,000 children and teenagers \n     ages 2 to 19 are obese or overweight, a statistic that health \n     and medical experts consider an epidemic;\n       Whereas significant disparities exist among the obesity \n     rates of children based on race and poverty;\n       Whereas the financial implications of childhood obesity \n     pose a tremendous financial threat to our economy and health \n     care system, carrying up to $14,000,000,000 per year in \n     direct health care cost, with people in the United States \n     spending about 9 percent of their total medical costs on \n     obesity-related illnesses;\n       Whereas obese young people have an 80 percent chance of \n     being obese adults and are more likely than children of \n     normal weight to become overweight or obese adults, and \n     therefore more at risk for associated adult health problems, \n     including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, \n     stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis;\n       Whereas in part due to the childhood obesity epidemic, 1 in \n     3 children (and nearly 1 in 2 minority children) born in the \n     year 2000 will develop type 2 diabetes at some point in their \n     lifetime if current trends continue;\n       Whereas some consequences of childhood and adolescent \n     obesity are psychosocial and obese children and adolescents \n     are targets of early and systematic social discrimination, \n     leading to low self-esteem which, in turn, can hinder \n     academic and social functioning and persist into adulthood;\n       Whereas participating in physical activity is important for \n     children and teens as it may have beneficial effects not only \n     on body weight, but also on blood pressure and bone strength;\n       Whereas proper nutrition is important for children before \n     birth and through their life-span as nutrition has beneficial \n     effects for health and body weight, and is key in the \n     prevention of various chronic diseases;\n       Whereas childhood obesity is preventable yet does not \n     appear to be declining;\n       Whereas public, community-based, and private sector \n     organizations and individuals throughout the United States, \n     including First Lady Michelle Obama, are working to decrease \n     childhood obesity rates for people in the United States of \n     all races through a range of efforts, including educational \n     presentations, media campaigns, websites, policies, healthier \n     food options, and greater opportunities for physical \n     activity;

Res. 414\n\n       Whereas on January 12, 2010, Haiti suffered an earthquake \n     measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale, the greatest natural \n     disaster in Haiti's history, which--\n       (1) devastated Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas;\n       (2) killed more than 100,000 people;\n       (3) injured hundreds of thousands more people; and\n       (4) left many hundreds of thousands of people homeless;\n       Whereas Haiti, which is the poorest country in the Western \n     Hemisphere--\n       (1) has an estimated 54 percent of its population living on \n     less than $1 per day;\n       (2) has approximately 120,000 people living with HIV;\n       (3) had 29,333 new cases of Tuberculosis in 2007; and\n       (4) has nearly 400,000 children living in orphanages;\n       Whereas despite these challenges, cautious signs of \n     developmental progress and stability were beginning to emerge \n     in Haiti prior to the earthquake;\n       Whereas although initial recovery efforts must continue to \n     assist the people of Haiti struggling to secure basic \n     necessities, including food, water, health care, shelter, and \n     electricity, Haiti cannot afford to only focus on its \n     immediate needs;\n       Whereas various United States and international assessments \n     indicate that the next priority for the Government of Haiti \n     should be to repair the country's basic infrastructure, \n     including its schools, roads, hospitals, telecommunications \n     infrastructure, and government buildings;\n       Whereas Haiti's leaders have advocated that--\n       (1) reconstruction should not follow the inefficient \n     practices of the past; and\n       (2) Haitians should be given the opportunity to accelerate \n     and implement long planned reforms and new ways of doing \n     business in every sector;\n       Whereas Haiti enjoys several advantages that can facilitate \n     its rebuilding, including--\n       (1) people committed to education and hard work;\n       (2) duty-free, quota-free access to United States markets;\n       (3) a large pool of low-cost labor;\n       (4) a large, hardworking North American diaspora sending \n     money back to Haiti; and\n       (5) regional neighbors who are peaceful, prosperous, and \n     supportive of Haiti's success;\n       Whereas international experience from rebuilding other \n     countries recovering from natural disaster confirms that--\n       (1) stability and security are essential preconditions to \n     longer-term development; and\n       (2) economic development and political reform should \n     relieve poverty and foster governance and social justice;\n       Whereas employment is essential to breaking the vicious \n     cycle of poverty, corruption, insecurity, and loss of faith \n     in democracy;\n       Whereas the Haitian people, like all people, deserve the \n     income and dignity that gainful employment provides;\n       Whereas, in addition to providing emergency assistance and \n     relief, the Government of Haiti must grapple with the longer-\n     term issue of how to provide permanent, sustainable shelter \n     to an estimated 1,000,000 Haitians displaced by the \n     earthquake;\n       Whereas, the impact of natural disaster on Haiti is--\n       (1) exacerbated by weak building codes and poor \n     infrastructure; and\n       (2) more fundamentally the result of an impoverished state \n     unable to provide most of its people with minimal public \n     services, including security, clean water, shelter, \n     electricity, health care, and education;\n       Whereas assistance to Haiti should be delivered in a manner \n     that enhances, not diminishes, the ability of the state to \n     provide services to its people;\n       Whereas the Haitian state should be rebuilt with \n     communities in a central role in the national recovery \n     process led by the Government of Haiti, so that foreign \n     assistance upholds and empowers Haitian mayors, local \n     councils, and municipalities in areas outside of Port-au-\n     Prince;\n       Whereas international donors and nongovernmental \n     organizations, which have a responsibility to support the \n     Government of Haiti in its rebuilding efforts, should not \n     supplant the ability of local institutions and the government \n     to manage resources and provide essential services:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the United States Government and the \n     international community to provide resources, manpower, and \n     technical assistance to support the Government of Haiti's \n     leadership of international assistance efforts and to conduct \n     a comprehensive post-disaster needs assessment that will \n     focus on--\n       (A) social sector services, including access to, and \n     delivery of, basic services, including--\n       (i) health care delivery, including reinstating disrupted \n     care and addressing new needs;\n       (ii) all levels of education, including ensuring access to \n     lessons as quickly as possible;\n       (iii) social support for communities;\n       (iv) improving the welfare of children; and\n       (v) recognition of the importance of gender equality and \n     the role of women as economic guardians;\n       (B) population resettlement, including services and \n     sustainable livelihoods to support new communities and \n     settlements;\n       (C) stable and democratic governance, ensuring that the \n     Government of Haiti will appropriately steward state \n     resources through a process embracing transparency, civic \n     participation, political moderation, and institutional \n     accountability;\n       (D) economic sustainability, emphasizing employment \n     generation, macroeconomic stability, and market economy \n     sustainability;\n       (E) security, ensuring legitimate state efforts to prevent \n     and respond to crime, especially violence, and instilling \n     public order and confidence in Haitian security forces; and\n       (F) rule of law, developing a just legal framework that--\n       (i) is accountable;\n       (ii) provides access to justice; and\n       (iii) ensures public order;\n       (2) encourages the United States Government and the \n     international community to support the leadership of the \n     Government of Haiti and key nongovernmental and private \n     sector Haitian stakeholders to create a comprehensive \n     national strategy for recovery and development that will--\n       (A) be led by the Government of Haiti;\n       (B) address the findings from the needs assessment \n     conducted under paragraph (1);\n       (C) coordinate new resources flowing into Haiti;\n       (D) channel such resources in concrete and specific ways \n     towards key sectoral objectives identified by the Government \n     of Haiti and its people;\n       (E) take feasible steps to recognize and rectify the social \n     injustice of poverty, and decrease the vulnerability of the \n     poor, through job creation, the provision of health care, the \n     provision of safe shelter and settlements, food security, and \n     education;\n       (F) place communities at the center of the rebuilding \n     process, by employing local labor and consulting local \n     leaders and communities for their experience and vision;\n       (G) encourage rebuilding and development of programs that \n     are environmentally sustainable and respectful and \n     restorative of Haiti's natural resources;\n       (H) work with the Government of Haiti and the international \n     community to reduce the risk of future disasters, including \n     floods and hurricanes, through the relief and recovery \n     efforts focusing on the most vulnerable communities; and\n       (I) address the difficult issues related to land use, land \n     tenure, the need for land for reconstruction, and land price \n     escalations.\n       (3) applauds the international community's response to the \n     preliminary appeal for assistance made at Montreal, Canada, \n     on January 25, 2010;\n       (4) affirms that--\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\n       (A) the international donors conference for Haiti, which \n     will be held in New York on March 22-23, 2010, is an \n     opportunity for Haiti to accelerate and implement long-\n     planned projects and priorities in key infrastructural, \n     economic, and social sectors outlined in a comprehensive \n     national strategy; and\n       (B) large-scale international assistance provides \n     significant leverage to promote change and reform in Haiti;\n       (C) the international community should be prepared to fully \n     commit to the outcomes of the New York donors conference, \n     including full disbursement and subsequent implementation;\n       (5) encourages international financial institutions and \n     international organizations, including the United Nations and \n     the World Bank, to continue their engagement and leadership \n     in support of critical economic and security priorities, \n     including--\n       (A) economic and social assistance programs;\n       (B) strengthening Haitian national institutions;\n       (C) security sector reform;\n       (D) ensuring fair and legitimate elections; and\n       (E) supporting political and governance reform;\n       (6) encourages the International Monetary Fund, the World \n     Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, which hold the \n     majority of Haiti's existing external debt obligations, to--\n       (A) work together to relieve Haiti of its external debt \n     obligations to the multilateral community and bilateral \n     lenders; and\n       (B) seek considerable new resources for Haiti without \n     adding to Haiti's existing debt obligations, primarily \n     through provision of grants; and\n       (7) urges the United States Government to ensure unity of \n     effort by assigning a single person to--\n       (A) coordinate all aspects of United States assistance to \n     Haiti; and\n       (B) work with Congress to responsibly ensure sufficient \n     appropriations to facilitate the long-term and sustainable \n     recovery, rehabilitation, and development of Haiti.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S540-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous, consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 561, the \nnomination of Clifford L. Stanley to be Under Secretary of Defense for \nPersonnel and Readiness and Calendar No. 614, the nomination of Philip \nGoldberg to be an Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and \nResearch.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Clifford L. Stanley, of \nPennsylvania, to be Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and \nReadiness, and Philip S. Goldberg, of the District of Columbia, to be \nan Assistant Secretary of State.\n\n\n                    nomination of philip s. goldberg\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Ambassador \nPhilip S. Goldberg to be the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and \nResearch at the Department of State and urge my colleagues to support \nthis nomination. The Intelligence Committee unanimously approved \nAmbassador Goldberg's nomination on December 10, 2009.\n  The Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Research leads the \nBureau of Intelligence and Research at the Department of State, a well-\nrespected analytic agency within the Intelligence Community, known as \n``INR.'' INR produces all-source intelligence analysis to advise the \nSecretary of State and other senior policy officials. INR is as an \nactive participant in the Intelligence Community and contributes to \nproducts published by the National Intelligence Council. Its analysts, \nwhile far fewer in number than the analysts at the Central Intelligence \nAgency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, are highly expert in their \nfields and often improve the quality of coordinated intelligence \nassessments by challenging the views of other agencies and, if \nnecessary, dissenting from consensus judgments that they believe to be \nincorrect or unsubstantiated.\n  One important example of INR's independent minded approach occurred \nin 2002, when INR dissented from the official judgment of the \nintelligence community regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \nprogram. INR analysts expressed less certainty regarding the claim that \nIraq was reconstituting nuclear weapons, taking a different view on the \npurpose of Saddam Hussein's pursuit of aluminum tubing. History, of \ncourse, proved the INR analysts to be correct, as Iraq was not \nreconstituting a nuclear weapons program.\n  As an assistant secretary, Ambassador Goldberg will lead a talented, \nexperienced group of analysts, whose work offers invaluable insights to \npolicymakers at the Department of State and throughout the government. \nINR analysts produce open source products as well, including reports \nbased on global public opinion polling and foreign media analysis.\n  INR also serves a critical coordinating function. It is the \nintermediary between intelligence activities and the Intelligence \nCommunity on one hand and foreign policy and U.S. embassies on the \nother. INR represents the Department of State's perspective within the \nintelligence community and ensures that the benefits of intelligence \nactivities outweigh any diplomatic risks. Ambassador Goldberg's \nexperience serving in and managing U.S. embassies abroad will be very \nimportant as he helps to align intelligence and diplomatic priorities.\n  Ambassador Goldberg's distinguished 20-year career in the Foreign \nService prepares him well for his new position. He served as the charge \nd'affairs and deputy chief of mission in Santiago, Chile, the chief of \nmission in Pristina, Kosovo, and in the U.S. embassies in Bogota, \nColombia, and Pretoria, South Africa. Ambassador Goldberg is a graduate \nof Boston University and before joining the Foreign Service he worked \nfor the city of New York.\n  From 2006 to 2008, Ambassador Goldberg served as the Ambassador to \nBolivia during a period of heightened tensions between our two \ncountries. In mid-September 2008, President Evo Morales accused \nAmbassador Goldberg of supporting opposition forces, declared him \npersona non grata, and expelled him from the country. The Intelligence \nCommittee carefully reviewed Ambassador Goldberg's conduct in Bolivia. \nWe have found that Ambassador Goldberg acted appropriately during his \ntenure and followed the policies of the U.S. Government. In fact, an \ninspector general report on the embassy published in September 2008 \ngave Ambassador Goldberg and his deputy high marks, stating that ``The \nAmbassador and the deputy chief of mission (DCM) provide clear policy \nguidance and leadership . . . [They gather] input and advice from their \nstaff, forging an excellent working relationship among all agencies and \nsections at post.''\n  After Ambassador Goldberg's expulsion from Bolivia, the State \nDepartment strongly defended Ambassador Goldberg, both in public press \nremarks and in internal memoranda. In short, the Intelligence Committee \nbelieves that Ambassador Goldberg acted professionally and bears no \nblame for the Bolivian decision to expel him.\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\n  Since June 2009, Ambassador Goldberg has served as the Coordinator \nfor the Implementation of United Nations Resolution 1874, which imposed \neconomic and commercial sanctions on North Korea. In this position, \nAmbassador Goldberg has relied on sensitive intelligence reporting to \nbuild a diplomatic consensus to search North Korean cargo.\n  President Obama nominated Ambassador Goldberg on October 23, 2009. \nAfter completing the pre-hearing procedures, the Intelligence Committee \nheld a confirmation hearing on the nomination on December 1, 2009. As \npart of the confirmation process, Ambassador Goldberg was asked to \ncomplete a Committee questionnaire, pre-hearing questions, and post-\nhearing questions for the record. The answers he provided have all been \nposted to the intelligence committee's website. The Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee also held a hearing on Ambassador Goldberg's \nnomination on November 19, 2009.\n  In sum, Ambassador Goldberg will be an asset to INR and to the \nintelligence community. His management experience leading foreign \nembassies will serve him well as he takes the helm of INR. His \nbackground--particularly his service as a diplomat on four continents--\nprepares him to address the range of global intelligence questions INR \nanalysts address.\n  I look forward to working with Ambassador Goldberg as he leads a \nhighly respected and important agency within the intelligence \ncommunity. I urge the Senate to approve Ambassador Goldberg's \nnomination.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the nominations \nbe confirmed en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action; that any statements relating to the nominations be \nprinted in the Record; and that the Senate resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations were confirmed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is hard to comprehend we have been \nworking for weeks to get a couple people confirmed--actually four. One \nis the No. 3 person in the Pentagon. We just got that done, Clifford \nStanley. The Secretary of Defense has been waiting for this person, as \nI have indicated, for weeks and weeks. This man is responsible for \nmaking sure the right troops go to Afghanistan and come back from Iraq. \nWe finally got that done.\n  The nomination of Philip Goldberg I talked about before. He is \nSecretary Clinton's person to deal with intelligence matters coming \nbefore the Department of State. We finally got that done.\n  The sad part is we have two others on which we have been working. \nThey were held up, we were told, by one Senator, but that is not the \nway it is. We have, for example, a woman, Caryn Wagner to be Under \nSecretary for Intelligence and Analysis with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. That is being held up by the Republicans. No. Again, \nSecretary Napolitano will have to wait to have, in this vast Department \nof Homeland Security, someone in charge of intelligence.\n  What is that about? It is about people trying to destroy our \ncountry--homeland security. The most evil people in the world are \ntrying to do harm to Americans in our homeland, but yet we cannot get a \nperson confirmed who has come out of the committee overwhelmingly. They \nare holding him up because of something no one knows. But we know every \nday that goes by, the security of this Nation is in jeopardy because of \nthis.\n  I might note, this person being held up in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Senator holding this up, it is my understanding, the \njunior Senator from Oklahoma, voted for this nomination out of \ncommittee. But he is holding it up now because of other matters. He was \nnice enough to call me and tell me--I did not talk with him, but he \ncalled my office to indicate he was going to hold this nomination.\n  Laura Kennedy, a career member of the senior Foreign Service--her job \nis going to be to deal with disarmament. It is too bad the United \nStates of America, a nuclear power in the world, does not have a \nrepresentative of ambassadorial rank to represent the United States at \ndisarmament conferences. How is that one? Why it is being held up has \nnothing to do with her qualifications or background. It is some other \nreason.\n  I have told the President enough is enough. He has the right, as \nPresident of the United States, to do recess appointments. It should be \ndone. What is being done to this President is unfair. It has never been \ndone before. We have had to file cloture on many Presidential \nnominations that President Bush never had to do.\n  It is very unfortunate that because of the storms that have hit our \nNation's Capital, it has been very difficult to get things done. We are \nnot going to be able to bring this up now until next week. Well, we \ncan't do it next week because it is a recess, the Presidents Day \nrecess, and we are out for the week. So we can come back in 10 days or \na week and try again. In the meantime, we don't have anyone dealing \nwith disarmament for our country; we don't have someone helping one of \nthe most important offices in the country, which is homeland security, \ndealing with the intelligence office.\n  What is that about? Telephone conversations that are picked up about \nsomeone trying to come and blow up the Capitol or one of the buildings \nin New York or Los Angeles or Salt Lake City or Portland or Denver. We \nhave agents who have infiltrated some of these gangs--I will use that \nterm very loosely--these clandestine operations that are trying to do \nevil to the people in this country, and we don't have anyone heading \nthat department. It is disgraceful.\n  The Republicans are holding up these people for reasons that have \nnothing to do with the background, morality, and competence of these \npeople. They are just holding them up because they want to hold them \nup. We have had them held up for a number of weeks because they do not \nlike a decision that has been made as to where a building is to be \nbuilt. The Republicans have backed up the person who has been doing \nthis because he wanted the building built in his State.\n  I would hope the American people understand what is going on here \nwith this party of no. I have been a person who has gotten along very \nwell in my career, Mr. President, being a very moderate person, trying \nto be someone who gets along with Democrats and Republicans, but I am \nobligated to speak out as to what is going on here, and I have only \npicked two of the numerous people being held up. There are scores of \nthem being held up for reasons that have nothing to do with anything \ndealing with these people or how they will function once in office.\n  Frankly, I think the President should recess all of them--all of \nthem. He has been given very little recognition for the importance of \nthe job that he has been doing in trying to find the best people in \nAmerica to fill these positions. No one can say Democrats did this when \nwe were in the minority. We didn't do this. There were people held up, \nbut this is something that is beyond the pale.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S541-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had the good fortune of serving with John \nMurtha in the House, as the Presiding Officer did.

Mr. President, the Senate will not be in session tomorrow \ndue to the winter storm that has battered our area again, the \nWashington, DC area. Despite the storm, we are going to make progress \non the JOBS bill. I had a good conversation earlier today with the \nRepublican leader, Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and others. We \nwill continue to work with everyone on an agreement to move forward \nwith this matter and Senators will reschedule any votes. I doubt \nseriously there will be any votes this week. It appears, from what I \nhave been able to hear, people now cannot get planes to get here and \nthey are having trouble getting planes to get out of here, so it has \nmade for a very difficult situation. We will keep them informed as to \nwhat our schedule will be Monday next.\n  For the information of Democratic Senators, we are going to have a \ncaucus on Thursday at 12:30, a very important caucus. We must do that. \nI want every member of the caucus to understand the JOBS bill, why we \nare moving forward. My friends, Senator Durbin and Schumer--I was \nengaged with the Speaker and was not able to be on the floor during \nthat vote. A number of Members have raised questions with my \nleadership, including Senator Murray. I want to make sure everyone \nunderstands clearly what is going on.\n  We have had a difficult time, as everyone knows, with the storms \nbeing such as they are. We were unable to have our caucus today, which \nwould normally have given everyone the idea of what was going on, so I \ntell all Senators, I hope you can be here on Thursday. You certainly \ncan't leave if you want to, the storms being such as they are. We are \ngoing to have that caucus at 12:30 on Thursday. The DPC luncheon will \nbe put over until we get back, which is also extremely important. That \nis based on the retreat we had.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/09/senate-section/article/S542-4", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S542-S543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2010\n\n  Mr. REID.
