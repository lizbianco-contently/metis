Mr. President, we are waiting today to see the success of \nthe efforts of BP to plug that well that is spilling into the gulf. \nThis morning, it is reported that there is a 70- to 80-percent chance \nthat they can be successful. I certainly hope the odds that favor the \nstopping the oilspill work.\n  It is very important that the American people understand, and the \nworld\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\nunderstands, that we have to be ready for the damage this has caused. \nBP has indicated they will pay for all damages. The people of \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and other Gulf States are waiting to see when \nthe oil will stop flowing.\n  We have a number of issues that are concerning to the whole country \nas to our security. Of course, we have the cybersecurity issue, which, \nas the Pentagon mentioned, is a very important issue. We are working on \nthat, and committees are doing legislation now to see what can be done \nto make us more secure in that regard.\n  The other thing is we will never be a secure nation as long as we are \ndependent upon foreign oil--or to drop it down a notch, dependent on \noil, period. This is an opportunity for the country to move away from \nfossil fuel and do a better job at looking at the renewable energies \nthat are available to us all over this country, including Sun, wind, \ngeothermal.\n  I am very supportive of what Secretary Salazar did in approving the \nwind farm off the coast of Massachusetts. This is an opportunity for us \nto be independent and not have to depend so much on fossil fuels. It is \nno longer just the environment; it is also the security of this Nation. \nSo as we wait with bated breath to see what is going to happen today in \nthe gulf, I certainly hope it is successful and that we improve as a \nresult of this terrible degradation of our environment, and improve our \nability to use whatever domestic oil supply we have in a safer way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4398-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will say just a word this morning \nabout the still unfinished extenders package that is about to come over \nfrom the House.\n  The first thing to say is that Republicans are ready and willing \nright now to extend necessary benefits and to pay for them. We could \nget this done in literally no time. So any delay in passing this bill \nis coming from the other side of the aisle. I say this not to point \nfingers but because we have seen this Democratic playbook.\n  We know they will try to blame Republicans for their own inability to \ncome to an agreement if we don't go along with their effort to add \nanother $130 billion to the deficit by the end of the week. Let me say \nthat again. We know they will try to blame Republicans for their own \ninability to come to an agreement if we don't go along with their \neffort to add another $130 billion to the deficit by the end of this \nweek.\n  So let's be perfectly clear: There is one reason Democrats are having \ntrouble getting an agreement on this bill, and one reason only. That is \nbecause it is so blatantly reckless.\n  Europe is in the midst of what German Chancellor Angela Merkel \ndescribes as an existential crisis, all brought about by governments \nthat spend money they don't have. Americans are watching this crisis \nplay out, and they see Democrats doing the same thing here day after \nday after day. This extenders package is just the latest example, the \nlatest evidence of a majority that simply is out of control.\n  As early as today, we will reach a dubious milestone in America: a \n$13 trillion national debt--the first time in history we have crossed \nthis frightening threshold.\n  This extenders bill would add another $130 billion on top of that--\nmore debt in one vote than the administration claimed their health care \nbill would save over 10 years. The majority would have us add $130 \nbillion to the $13 trillion debt in 1 week that would eat up all the \nalleged savings from the health care bill over 10 years. This is fiscal \nrecklessness, and that is why even some Democrats are starting to \nrevolt.\n  The time is long since past to reverse this dangerous trend, the way \nEurope has been forced to reverse the trend. But far from doing \nanything about our own looming debt crisis, Democrats only seem \ninterested in making it worse.\n  The true emergency here--if we are looking for one--is our national \ndebt. That is the emergency. A line must be drawn somewhere. Americans \nare simply running out of patience.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4398-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have \ndone each week for over a month now, to give a doctor's second opinion \nabout the health care bill that has now been signed into law. I do this \nas somebody who has practiced medicine, taken care of families in \nWyoming since 1983. During that time, I was medical director of \nsomething called the Wyoming Health Fairs, offering low-cost blood \nscreening for people all around the Cowboy State, giving them an \nopportunity to take more personal responsibility for their own health, \nto learn about their health, to help get their blood pressure under \ncontrol, get their cholesterol down, and get their blood sugar under \ncontrol, and diagnose cancers early. All of this is aimed at early \nprevention, meaning better care, better survivability, which is what we \nneed to do in this country--work on patient-centered health care.\n\n  Today, I bring to the floor of the Senate my second opinion because I \nthink the bill that was passed into law has failed. It has failed and \ngotten the diagnosis and the treatment wrong.\n  The goal of health care reform should be to lower costs, increase \nquality, and increase access. I continue to believe the new health care \nlaw is bad for patients; it is bad for payers, the American taxpayers \nwho are going to be footing the bill, and it is bad for providers, the \nnurses and doctors of this country who take care of those patients.\n  Fundamentally, I believe, unlike what the President said, this whole \nlaw is now going to increase the cost of care. The American people \nbelieve that overwhelmingly, that this is going to increase the cost of \ntheir care and it is also going to decrease the quality and \navailability of the care, to the point that a national poll released \njust this Monday shows 62 percent of Americans would like to repeal and \nreplace the bill that has now been signed into law.\n  As the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said: First you have to \npass the bill to find out what is in it. As more and more Americans are \nfinding out what is in the bill, they are finding there are more and \nmore broken promises.\n  The President gave a speech, and he said: If you like your health \ncare plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period.\n  He then went on to say: No one will take it away, period.\n  He said: No matter what, period.\n  But the Chief Actuary of Medicare and Medicaid says that 14 million \nAmericans will lose their employer-sponsored health coverage under this \nlaw. The President is saying one thing, but the Chief Actuary for \nMedicare and Medicaid is saying something very different. That is why \nthe American people do not feel this bill--now the law--was passed for \nthem. It is for somebody else.\n  Most Americans have health insurance they like and are happy with, \nexcept for the cost. Unfortunately, what this body passed and what the \nPresident signed is going to increase the cost and decrease the \navailability. For people who like what they have, they are not going to \nbe able to keep it.\n  One might say: Where do you come up with that? There was a lengthy \narticle written called ``Documents reveal AT, Verizon, others thought \nabout dropping employer-sponsored benefits.'' Why would that be? \nBecause of a very different regime, it says, a ``radically different \nregime of subsidies, penalties, and taxes.'' That is so much of what is \ninvolved in this health care law--penalties, subsidies, and taxes.\n  ``Many large companies,'' it goes on to say, ``are examining a course \nthat was heretofore unthinkable, dumping the health care coverage they \nprovide to their workers in exchange for just paying penalty fees to \nthe government.''\n  It goes on:\n\n       In the days after President Obama signed the bill on March \n     24, a number of companies announced big write downs due to \n     the fiscal changes it ushered in. The legislation eliminated \n     a company's right to deduct the federal retiree drug-benefit \n     subsidy from their [companies].\n\n  As a result, AT, Verizon, and others ``took well-publicized charges \nof around $1 billion.'' This annoyed Henry Waxman, Democrat from \nCalifornia, ``who accused the companies of using the big numbers to \nexaggerate''--that is what he said, ``exaggerate''--``health care \nreform's burden on employers.'' So he summoned top executives to \nhearings and he requested documents.\n  The bottom line is, taking a look at 1,100 pages of documents from \nfour major employers--AT, Verizon, Caterpillar, and John Deere--``No \nsooner did the Democrats on the Energy Committee read'' the documents \n``than they abruptly cancelled the hearings.'' Why? Because they found \nout that what the companies had said was true, and it was proper in \naccordance with the rules and the laws within which they have to \noperate.\n  All four of these companies are taking a look at the costs and the \nbenefits of dropping health care coverage of people who like the \ncoverage they have. What are the alternatives if you do not want to \nprovide health care? You pay a fine. You pay a fee.\n  AT, a major company, employs up to 300,000 people with health care \ncoverage they like, and they are in a situation where the company is \nsaying: If we drop their coverage and pay the fine, we as a company can \nsave $1.8 billion.\n  Is that what this Congress intended? Is that what this Congress \nimagined? Is that what the people of this country deserve? No.\n  What this shows is a bill that was crammed through and down the \nthroats of the American people by an administration desperate to have \nsomething passed into law, something that many people never even read \nbefore they voted in favor of it. And the people who read the bill \ncarefully could see what was coming down the line, came to the floor, \nand pointed out these things to the American people. The American \npeople heard, but the Members of Congress did not.\n  There is a new study out that was reported today in the Associated \nPress. It talks about what other businesses are doing. It was a poll of \n650 leading corporations talking about, what do you think this is going \nto mean for your business? What is this going to mean for the \nemployees? What is this going to mean in terms of health care for those \nfolks and the cost of doing business?\n  Here it is. What do the employers want? They want to have three \ngoals, and they are the goals all Americans would have. They want to \nbring down the cost of care, whether you are an employer or an \nemployee. No matter who you are, they want to bring down the cost of \ncare. Contain costs--absolutely, at a minimum. They want to contain \ncosts. Good. They want to encourage healthier lifestyles. Good. This \nbill hardly does that at all. There are very few, if any, individual \nincentives. And they want to improve quality of life.\n  A mere 14 percent of all responding--650 companies--think health care \nreform will help contain health care costs. An overwhelming majority--\n90 percent--of employers believe health care reform will increase their \norganization's health care costs. Why should they be any different from \nwhat the government Actuary says? The government Actuary, who took a \nlook at the bill, also said the cost curve is going to go up. The cost \nis going to go up. The amount Congress promised the American people \nthis would cover in terms of the costs--Congress said: Oh, we are going \nto save money. No, that is not what the people who actually added up \nthe figures said. They said this is going to cost money.\n\n  Yesterday, when the President visited with the Republican Members of \nthe Senate, I specifically asked him about this point. He still takes \nthe tact that ultimately the cost curve will go down. The American \npeople, and certainly someone who has practiced medicine now since \n1983, and the Actuary, who takes a look at these issues, who actually \ndoes the addition and puts a line and puts the total numbers at the \nbottom, all say: Sorry, Mr. President, that is not true. The cost is \ngoing to go up. Insurance costs are going to go up. Quality of care and \navailability of care will go down.\n  I come to the floor as a physician offering my second opinion just to \ntell my colleagues and to tell the American people what I have been \nhearing from talking with people all around the country. A majority of \nAmericans are pleased with the health care coverage they get from their \nemployers. But now, because of the President's new\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nlaw, companies are considering canceling employees' coverage because it \nwould be cheaper for them to pay the government's penalty than to \nprovide health care coverage for their employees. This is not the \nchange Americans want. This is not the change Americans can believe in. \nThis is the change that makes Americans lose sleep at night. In this \neconomy, with 9.9 percent unemployment, the last thing Americans need \nis a new law that makes it easier for companies to pay a penalty \ninstead of providing health coverage for their employees.\n  This is not the companies' fault. It is the administration's fault. \nIt is misguided incentives, and that is why the American people are \nsick of Washington. What we have seen now with regard to the \nincentives, if you are a big company, is to drop insurance and pay the \nfine. If you are a small company and you want the tax relief and a tax \ncredit that has been offered, the incentive is to actually fire workers \nand pay those workers who are still working with you less. That is the \nway to get a better tax credit.\n  If you are an individual with a preexisting condition and you have \nbeen living by the rules, paying those higher insurance rates through \nsome of the State-authorized funds that have been set up, programs that \nhave been set up to help people with preexisting conditions, to help \npeople who need extra help, so they get their health care covered and \neven pay more, if you are one of those individuals, the incentive is to \ndrop that coverage, stop paying, and basically go uninsured for 6 \nmonths. And if you take that risk of being without insurance for 6 \nmonths, only then do you qualify for what is included in this new \nhealth care law.\n  We need a health care law that actually lowers the cost of health \ncare and allows Americans to keep the coverage they have. That is why I \ncome to the floor every week to tell the American people it is time to \nrepeal this legislation and replace it with legislation that delivers \nmore personal responsibility and more opportunities for individual \npatients; that is, patient-centered care that allows Americans to buy \ninsurance across State lines; that gives people their own health \ninsurance and the same opportunities and the same tax relief for people \nwho get insurance through their jobs; that provides individual \nincentives for people to stay healthy, exercise more, eat a little \nless, get their blood sugar under control and blood pressure under \ncontrol and deal with health care needs as they come along; that deals \nwith lawsuit abuse and the incredible expense of all the defensive \nmedicine practiced in this country; and that allows small businesses to \njoin together to provide less expensive insurance to their employees. \nThose are the things we need. Those are the things we need to allow us \nas a nation to deliver high-quality care, available care, at a more \naffordable cost.\n  This health care bill that has been crammed through the Senate with a \nlot of gimmicks and things such as the ``Cornhusker kickback'' and the \n``Louisiana purchase'' and ``Gator aid''--those are the things that \nmake the American people look at this city and say: We have had enough. \nThat is why today I come to the Senate floor and offer, again, my \nsecond opinion that it is time to repeal and to replace this health \ncare law with something that will actually work in the best interest of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Department of Interior Ig Reports\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, yesterday, the inspector \ngeneral for the Department of the Interior came out with their report--\nthis investigative report--which followed another inspector general \nreport of just a month ago. These two inspectors general reports talk \nabout what is wrong in the Minerals Management Service. The most recent \nreport is quite disturbing, and it comes on the heels of the one a \nmonth ago where they found a culture where the acceptance of gifts from \noil and gas companies was widespread throughout the Office of the Lake \nCharles District Minerals Management Service in Louisiana.\n  That information, of course, came on the heels of what we discovered \nyears ago in reports about the incestuous, cozy relationship between \nthe oil industry and the regulators who are supposed to see that the \noil industry is doing its job, and doing it safely, and collecting all \nof the revenues from the royalties that the oil industry is supposed to \npay, having drilled on Federal lands, which is the sea bottom of the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  This latest investigative report points out:\n\n       Of greatest concern is the environment in which these \n     inspectors operate--particularly the ease with which they \n     move between the industry and the government.\n\n  That is called the revolving door. That is somebody in the industry \nwho comes into the government as a regulator, and then the revolving \ndoor turns, and they go back into the industry. How in the world can we \nhave a regulator who is coming from the industry into regulation of \nthat industry, and then turn in the revolving door and go right back \ninto that industry? That is the problem, and that is what we have to \nfix.\n  My office is talking with Senator Menendez's office, and it is my \nintention that we will file a bill today that will do a number of \nthings. It will stop this revolving door by requiring the same thing we \nrequire for ourselves in the Senate--that when we leave the Senate, we \ncan't go to an entity that lobbied us as a business and that would then \nlobby the Senate for a period of 2 years. That is the minimum we should \nexpect.\n  This legislation will also insist on things that are common sense: \nthat the regulators can't accept gifts from the industry they are \nregulating, and they have to have a financial disclosure that would \nshow what the regulator owns, if they are in any way compromised with \nthe very industry they are trying to regulate. If they have any outside \ninterest--for example, stock in oil companies they are regulating--they \nwould have to divest from that; and, furthermore, in the egregious case \nthat they would be partially employed by the outside industry they are \nregulating, clearly that could be prohibited.\n  These are just commonsense things. Why isn't this in the law? Senator \nMenendez and I offered this law 2 years ago when all of these \nrevelations came out in that inspector general report back then. But, \nof course, there was enormous push-back on the legislation. Sadly, it \nhas come to this great tragedy of thousands and thousands of barrels of \noil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico to bring us to the point where we \nought to have a willing recipient in this Senate to this legislation we \nare filing that will stop this cozy, incestuous relationship between \nthe oil industry and the regulators.\n  I know Secretary Salazar is trying to clean it up, and he is doing \nwhat he should do. But what we want to do is to etch it into the \nstatutes so there is no question about what is the requirement--not \njust for today but forever.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            kagan nomination\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nomination of \nElena Kagan to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  Ms. Kagan is, without a doubt, an exceptionally well-qualified \nnominee. In every job she has held, including associate White House \ncounsel, dean of the Harvard Law School, and Solicitor General, she has \ndistinguished herself through her work ethic, intelligence, and \nintegrity.\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\n  I was part of 10 confirmation hearings during my time with then-\nSenator Biden, and during that time, I witnessed Ms. Kagan's talents \nfirsthand, when she served as special nominations counsel to the \nJudiciary Committee during the nomination of Justice Ginsburg in 1993.\n  She is also a woman of many ``firsts''--the first woman to serve as \ndean of Harvard Law School as well as the first to serve as Solicitor \nGeneral. She now stands to be the fourth in history to serve on the \nSupreme Court. When she is confirmed, for the first time in history \nthree women would take their seats on the Nation's highest Court.\n  I have consistently called on President Obama to nominate candidates \nto the bench who expand, and not contract, the breadth of experiences \nrepresented on the Supreme Court.\n  Every one of the current Justices came to the Court from the Federal \nappellate bench. While this experience can be valuable, I believe the \nCourt should reflect a broader range of perspectives and experience.\n  Ms. Kagan brings valuable nonjudicial experience and a freshness of \nperspective that is currently lacking.\n  Prior judicial experience has never been, nor should it be, a pre-\nrequisite to be a Supreme Court Justice. In the history of the Supreme \nCourt, more than one-third of the Justices have had no prior judicial \nexperience before nomination.\n  History further shows that a nominee's lack of judicial experience is \nno barrier to success as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  When Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis in 1916, many objected \non the ground that he had never served on the bench.\n  Over his 23-year career, however, Justice Brandeis proved to be one \nof the Court's greatest members. His opinions exemplify judicial \nrestraint and his approach still resonates in our judicial thinking \nmore than 70 years after his retirement.\n  This list of highly regarded Justices without prior judicial \nexperience is not insignificant.\n  Felix Frankfurter, William Douglas, Robert Jackson, Byron White, \nLewis Powell, Hugo Black, Harlan Fiske Stone, Earl Warren and William \nRehnquist--they all became Justices without having previously been \njudges, yet we consider them to have had distinguished careers on the \nSupreme Court.\n  In fact, Justice Frankfurter wrote in 1957 about the irrelevance of \nprior judicial experience. He said:\n\n       One is entitled to say without qualification that the \n     correlation between prior judicial experience and fitness for \n     the functions of the Supreme Court is zero.\n\n  That is a point that some of my Republican colleagues have recognized \nwhen addressing the qualifications of other nominees.\n  Ms. Kagan's lack of prior judicial experience should not be a \ndetermining factor in assessing her qualifications to be a Justice.\n  Indeed, if significant prior experience as a judge were a \nprerequisite, where would that leave Justices like John Roberts and \nClarence Thomas? Thomas had served on the DC Circuit for less than 16 \nmonths before his nomination, and Roberts for just over 2 years.\n  I have an insightful article on this subject by Joel Goldstein, \npublished in the Kansas City Star. I ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From KansasCity.com, May 11, 2010]\n\n            History Says Lack of time on Bench Is No Problem\n\n                         (By Joel K. Goldstein)\n\n       Critics are already attacking President Obama's nomination \n     of Elena Kagan for the Supreme Court on the grounds that she \n     has never been a judge. But if lack of judicial experience \n     disqualifies someone from a spot on the court, many \n     distinguished justices never would have served.\n       Take Louis Brandeis, the person many consider to have been \n     the outstanding justice of the 20th century. Brandeis had \n     never served on the bench when Woodrow Wilson nominated him \n     in January 1916.\n       Critics complained that he lacked judicial temperament. \n     They could not have been more wrong. During 23 years on the \n     court, Brandeis proved himself a model judge. His opinions \n     guide judicial thinking more than 70 years after his \n     retirement. He became a leading apostle of judicial restraint \n     but used his opinions to teach relevant constitutional \n     principles in a way that surpassed every justice other than \n     John Marshall.\n       Many other examples reveal judicial experience to be a \n     false requirement. John Marshall's career had been political, \n     not judicial. Yet, most regard him as the greatest justice to \n     serve on the court. He was learned in the law, yet his \n     political skills proved critical in allowing the court to \n     develop as an equal institution of government during a \n     precarious period.\n       The same was true of Charles Evans Hughes when named an \n     associate justice in 1910. He had been a lawyer and governor \n     of New York. Most regard him as one of the greatest chief \n     justices, a position he assumed when he returned to the court \n     in 1930, after resigning to run for president in 1916.\n       Earl Warren lacked judicial experience, but his political \n     skills helped produce the court's unanimous decision in Brown \n     v. Board of Education, one of the most important decisions in \n     our history.\n       Harlan Fiske Stone had served as a law school dean and \n     attorney general, a resume in some respects similar to \n     Kagan's but never as a judge. Felix Frankfurter, William \n     Douglas, Robert Jackson, Byron ``Whizzer'' White, Lewis \n     Powell and William Rehnquist were thought by many to have \n     been distinguished justices, although each lacked prior \n     judicial experience. Hugo Black had spent about a year on the \n     police court when Franklin Roosevelt nominated him from the \n     U.S. Senate.\n       Even recent experience cautions against overstating the \n     relevance of judicial service. Two conservative judicial \n     heroes, Clarence Thomas and John Roberts, had served very \n     brief stints on the appellate court, roughly two years or \n     less before the two Bush presidents nominated them.\n       There have been distinguished justices who came from the \n     bench, such as Benjamin Cardozo, John Marshall Harlan II and \n     William Brennan. On the other hand, some unsuccessful \n     justices also had judicial experience. John Hessin Clarke, \n     Fred Vinson and Charles Evans Whittaker are among those whose \n     service on the court was not happy despite their experience \n     as judges.\n       Kagan has had a distinguished career as an academic, as a \n     high-level staffer in the Clinton White House, as a \n     successful dean of Harvard Law School and as U.S. solicitor \n     general. It is impossible to know whether she will be a \n     distinguished justice, but her success in her other \n     professional work certainly counts in her favor.\n       History suggests that her lack of judicial experience is \n     simply irrelevant.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Another attack on Elena Kagan, equally unjustifiable, \nfocuses on military recruiting while she was dean at Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  Most of the charges about the Harvard Law recruiting ban are \ndistortions. The university policy reflected a policy preference for \nnondiscrimination against gays, but Dean Kagan never denied military \nrecruiters physical space at the law school or access to the student \nbody.\n  Just as important, military veterans at Harvard have high praise for \nKagan's role as dean.\n  In February 2009, several Iraq War veterans who graduated from \nHarvard Law School when she was dean wrote a letter to the Washington \nTimes describing their ``appreciation for Miss Kagan's embrace of \nveterans on campus. During her time as dean, she has created an \nenvironment that is highly supportive of students who have served in \nthe military.''\n  I was pleased to see this view echoed by our colleague from \nMassachusetts after his meeting with Solicitor General Kagan last week.\n  He said:\n\n       It was very clear to me after we spoke about it at length \n     that she is supportive of the men and women who are fighting \n     to protect us and very supportive of the military as a whole. \n     I do not feel that her judicial philosophy will be hurting \n     men and women who are serving.\n\n  The best answer to these charges comes from the nominee herself.\n  In 2007 while serving as dean of Harvard Law, she addressed cadets at \nWest Point. She said:\n\n       I am in awe of your courage and your dedication, especially \n     in these times of great uncertainty and danger. I know how \n     much my security and freedom and indeed everything else I \n     value depend on all of you.\n\n  Addressing the controversy regarding the military recruiters she \nsaid:\n\n       I have been grieved in recent years to find your world and \n     mine, the U.S. military and U.S. law schools, at odds, \n     indeed, facing each other in court--on one issue. That issue \n     is the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Law \n     schools, including mine, believe that employment \n     opportunities should extend to all their students, regardless \n     of their race or sex or sexual orientation. And I personally \n     believe that the exclusion of gays and lesbians from the \n     military is both unjust and unwise. I wish devoutly that \n     these Americans could join this noblest of all professions \n     and serve their country in this most important of all ways. \n     But I would regret very much if anyone thought that the \n     disagreement between American law schools and the\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\n     U.S. military extended beyond this single issue. It does not. \n     And I would regret still more if that disagreement created \n     any broader chasm between law schools and the military. It \n     must not. It must not because of what we, like all Americans, \n     owe to you.\n\n  In consulting with leadership, as well as with me and my colleagues \non the Judiciary Committee, President Obama honored the Senate's \nadvisory role in the selection process.\n  As the Senate process moves from advice to consent, I look forward to \na confirmation process that is orderly and filled with an honest \nexchange of views, not partisan bickering.\n  The vote for a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is one of the most \nimportant votes a Senator can cast. That is because a Justice serves \nfor a lifetime appointment and will continue to have an impact long \nafter the vote is made.\n  Since her nomination, Solicitor General Kagan has already met with \ndozens of Senators and has many more meetings scheduled.\n  My meeting with her strengthened my belief that President Obama has \nselected a nominee with both impeccable credentials and a superior \nintellect. Her ability to bridge disagreement and find common ground \namong disparate voices, as well as her experience in all three branches \nof government, would be a tremendous asset on the current Court.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the supplemental appropriations \nbill. I understand. I have been chairing a hearing, and I understand I \nhave not missed very much. It appears to me yesterday and today this \nsupplemental appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate has been \nmoving very slowly. In fact, while amendments have been filed and some \ndiscussed, we have had no votes. I know the majority leader would very \nmuch like to move forward to get this done. In fact, it is the case \nthat if the supplemental bill is not done, my understanding is there \nwill be soldiers who will not receive paychecks in June. So there is an \nurgency for us to replenish the funding that is necessary in the \ndefense portion of this bill especially.\n  There are other pieces of it that are equally important. For example, \nthe money for the Federal Emergency Management Agency is provided as a \nresult of disasters that are occurring that require some supplemental \nfunding, and other issues are addressed as well.\n  But what I want to mention on the floor of the Senate is a request \nthat has been made about DOE loan guarantees. I got a call from the \nSecretary of Energy, Secretary Chu, requesting $90 million in this \nlegislation or support in some legislative form to allow them to \nprovide loan guarantees for three nuclear plants that are to be built. \nThey want to begin a process to move down the road on some nuclear \nenergy. I will support these loan guarantees. I think we should do a \nlot of things and do them well in the energy field, and nuclear energy \nwill be one of those areas.\n  But in order to do the loan guarantees for three nuclear energy \nfacilities that would be built, they need another $90 million in \nauthority. My understanding is that request has been made. However, I \nhave a letter from Peter Orszag, the head of the Office of Management \nand Budget, that he sent to the Speaker, and he did request, on behalf \nof the administration, the $90 million for the Energy Department to be \nable to provide those loan guarantees. Again, I indicated I would \nsupport that request.\n  They also have requested an additional $90 million on the renewable \nenergy loan guarantees. Again, there was $2 billion that was removed \nfrom renewable energy and has not been restored. So there needs to be \nsome restoration of that, and I would support these as well. But as I \nindicated, when discussing this with the Energy Secretary and others, \nthere needs to be either an emergency request by the administration or \na pay-for. The letter from Mr. Orszag, the head of the OMB, indicates \nthey would request the $90 million for the loan guarantee for a nuclear \nfacility, a third nuclear facility, and $90 million for renewable \nenergy, and they say a separate request will be transmitted in the \nfuture to Congress to reduce the fiscal year 2011 budget by the amounts \nin the supplemental request. Well, that doesn't quite work. I think \nthey understand that concern of mine. You can't offset spending you are \ngoing to do now with the reduction in a spending request for some \nfuture budget. That is not an appropriate offset.\n\n  I simply wanted to say that my understanding is the House of \nRepresentatives will likely include this request that Secretary Chu \nsays is very important, and I would agree with him that he should be \nable to have that loan authority to proceed. The House of \nRepresentatives will likely include that request, or have included it, \nincluding the appropriate offset in this fiscal year so that it does \nnot increase the budget deficit.\n  I have received some calls in the last day or so wondering why I am \nholding it up here. I am not holding it up here, but it cannot be \nconsidered here unless: A, the President has requested it as an \nemergency, and he has not done that; or B, there is an offset, and the \noffset being proposed in the letter from the head of the OMB is not an \noffset, as I said. A promise to submit a budget request that would \nreduce a future budget is not an offset for something that is done \nhere.\n  In any event, I hope this gets done. I support the Secretary's \nrequest. I believe it would be good for us to be able to proceed to \nhave that loan guarantee for the third nuclear energy facility the \nSecretary wishes to do. If it can't get done here in the Senate with an \noffset, then at least it will come to conference between the Senate and \nthe House. I hope very much that the House, with the provision of the \noffset, will make this possible for the Secretary. I wanted to explain \nthat to the Senate. It is a little bit convoluted, but I wanted to \nexplain it because somebody here thought I was blocking this loan \nguarantee request, and that is not the case. It is not the case that \nthere is opposition to it, in fact. It is just the case that it needs \nto meet the rules in terms of an offset for the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment about energy \nmore generally. I spoke in Dallas, TX, on Monday of this week at the \nNational Wind Energy Conference. I think they said they had 20,000 \npeople there. Wind energy, of course, is a very important part of our \ncountry's energy future. We need to take steps to gather energy from \nthe wind and the Sun, where the Sun shines and the wind blows. We need \nto use these resources for energy, and then put them on a wire and move \nthem to the load centers that need that energy. Such actions will \nprovide more energy here at home, and it makes us less dependent on \nforeign oil. These are all of the things that I commend. I was thinking \ntoday that there has been a lot of discussion in recent weeks on what \nmay or may not happen on the floor of the Senate with respect to energy \nand/or climate change, and I wish to comment on that a bit.\n  First, I believe something is happening to our climate. I believe we \nought to reduce the carbon emissions that are going into the \natmosphere, so I am in support of capping carbon. I have indicated, \nhowever, I don't support what is called cap and trade, which would \neffectively be a process by which we provide probably a $1 trillion \ncarbon trading securities market for Wall Street. I have no interest in \nbeing a part of that and would not support speculation of carbon \nmarkets. However, I think there is something happening to our climate, \nand we would be wise at the very minimum to do a series of no-regrets \nthings that move us down the road to limit carbon and develop \nopportunities to reduce carbon emissions and protect our climate.\n  We have been considering whether we get that done now in some sort of \nclimate bill or focus only on an energy\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nbill. My colleagues Senator Kerry and Senator Lieberman and others have \nworked hard on a comprehensive climate bill. The question of what we \nfocus on now is an important issue. The climate change bill they are \nworking on is something that is very substantial, and I commend them \nfor their work. I think they have put an enormous amount of time into \nthat legislation. However, that legislation has not gone through a \ncommittee process. They need to find a way to do that at some point. If \nthere are not 60 votes in the Senate, then it will be difficult to move \nforward on their bill. That is what would be required to bring a \nclimate change bill to the floor of the Senate. If there are not 60 \nvotes, then the very least we should do is work on the energy bill. \nThis is the piece of legislation that has already passed the Senate \nEnergy Committee in June 2009. That was a long time ago, and it passed \non a bipartisan basis. We should bring it to the floor of the Senate \nand move it so that we actually provide substantial improvement to our \nenergy policy in a way that addresses our national security and reduces \ncarbon emissions. It is one thing to talk about it; it is another thing \nto put a plan together. It is another thing--and more important, in my \njudgment--to actually reduce carbon emissions.\n  What have we done on the Energy Committee under the leadership of \nSenator Bingaman? I played a role, and many others, Republicans and \nDemocrats, worked with him in writing that energy bill. What have we \ndone? We have written a bill that does several things. No. 1, it is \nbipartisan, and No. 2, it would create a new federal national \nelectricity standard. It is a national goal that says here is where we \nare headed and would put in place a pathway to maximize the production \nof electricity from wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. \nThat is exactly the sort of thing we should do.\n  So while we do that, we also include provisions for building \nretrofits and building efficiency provisions which are very important. \nWe would provide the process by which you help construct the interstate \nhighway of transmission capability. By doing that, you can find places \nin the country where you can collect energy from the Sun or the wind \nand put it on a wire and move it to the load centers.\n  My State of North Dakota is one of the windiest States in America. \nDepartment of Energy has called North Dakota the Saudi Arabia of wind. \nOur kids are born leaning to the northwest against that prevailing \nwind. But we don't need more wind energy for ourselves. We can put up \ntowers and turbines. We produce far more energy than we need in North \nDakota. What we need is a modern day interstate highway transmission \ncapability that can produce energy from the wind in North Dakota and \nsolar from the rural areas of Arizona and so on, and put it on the wire \nand move it to the load centers where they need the electricity. That \nis the way you maximize the use of renewable energy for the benefit of \nthe country.\n  It is not hard to get energy from the wind. We have sophisticated, \nnew, better technology in wind turbines. We put up a tower, especially \nin areas where you find these wind chutes, and you produce electricity \nvirtually forever. Those blades turn around and you make electricity. \nIt makes a lot of sense for us to maximize that.\n  I am in favor of using fossil energy as well. I am not suggesting we \nuse wind and solar energy in exchange for shutting down oil and gas and \ncoal. We are going to continue to use fossil energy, but use it in a \ndifferent way. We are going to move towards decarbonizing the use of \ncoal, that requires targets and timetables and the ability and research \nto make that happen. I am convinced we will be able to move in that \ndirection.\n  Every day I have people coming to my office with the new ideas and \nsolutions that is going to make this happen. I have had a guy visit and \ntell me about a new microbe that he discovered. It was a lollipop-\nshaped microbe, that was 30 percent more efficient at breaking down \ncellulose than anything known to mankind. Therefore, this new microbe \nwill be able to break down cellulose and turn it into cellulosic \nethanol, reducing the cost from $3 to $2 a gallon. Big deal? Maybe so. \nI don't know. He has to develop that, and then we will see whether the \nmarket beats a path to his door.\n  There are dozens of examples like that. Last night I saw Craig Venter \non television. I think Craig Venter is extraordinary. He and Francis \nCollins led the human genome project. They created the first owners \nmanual for the human body, and it is changing everything in medicine. \nHe has now turned his attention to energy. Now Craig Venter is trying \nto develop synthetic microbes that could be used to chew away at \ncoalbeds, in layman's term. The microbe will eat its way through the \ncoalbed and turn coal into methane fuel. Is that the solution? Maybe \nso. Maybe that is the way to use coal in the future; I don't know.\n\n  There is a guy in California who testified at a committee I chaired \nwho has patented a process that takes the entire fuel gas from a coal \nplant and, through his patented process, mineralizes it and turns it \ninto something that is harder and more valuable than concrete that \ncontains all of the emitted CO2. This man says the process \ncreates a value-added product that brings the price of carbon down to \nnear zero. Maybe. I don't know.\n  Another guy delivered a presentation to me and insists he has a 100-\nmile-per-gallon diesel engine. Does he? I don't know; maybe. If he \ndoes, I hope the world beats a path to his door. The list of innovators \ngoes on and on.\n  A woman with a Ph.D. from Sandia National Laboratory, testified at a \nhearing I chaired. She said they are working on a heat engine in which \nyou put CO2 in one side and water in the other. The \nmolecules are then fractured and chemically recombine to produce a \nfuel. Produce a fuel out of essentially air, CO2, and water.\n  We also have begun doing a lot of work on the issue of algae, I am \nnow talking about how you would perhaps use coal in the future. Coal \nemits CO2. You capture the CO2 and use it to grow \nalgae, which is a single-cell pond scum, or, the green stuff you see in \nstanding water. CO2, water, and sunlight produce this \nsingle-cell pond scum. After growing the algae, you harvest it and \nproduce diesel fuel. Wouldn't it be interesting if you could get rid of \nthe CO2 by producing a new fuel. These are all just a couple \nof examples of the things I think could be breathtaking in terms of \nwhat kind of energy we use and how we use it in the future.\n  Oil and natural gas. In my State of North Dakota we have more oil \nrigs drilling than anyplace in the country. We have discovered how to \nfind oil 2 miles below the Earth in a shale formation called the Bakken \nshale that is 100 feet thick, I asked the U.S. Geological Survey to do \nan assessment of what is there. 2\\1/2\\ years ago they came back with an \nassessment that said there is up to 4.3 billion barrels of oil \nrecoverable using today's technology. The Bakken shale formation is 2 \nmiles down. They drill down with one rig, 10,000 feet down, searching \nfor the middle third of a 100-foot seam. They find the seam then, drill \nout 2 miles. So, they drill down 2 miles, then out 2 miles to search \nfor a 30-foot seam. Then they use hydraulic fracturing so the oil \ndrips. They then pump the oil, and that oil will pump from that well \nfor 30 or 40 years. By the way, there are right now about 117 drilling \nrigs, drilling wells in North Dakota. They drill a new well every 30 \ndays and they strike oil virtually every time, because with core \nsamples they know exactly where this huge shale formation is. This is \nthe largest assessment of oil the U.S. Geological Survey has ever \nassessed in the history of the lower 48 States; and in the western part \nof North Dakota it is unbelievable the amount of drilling that is \noccurring.\n  So, oil, natural gas and coal, all fossil energy, and we are going to \ncontinue to need them and use them. We want to be less dependent on \nforeign oil so that means producing more here.\n  The terrible disaster that has occurred in the Gulf of Mexico means \nwe are not going to lease new properties in the Gulf until we \nunderstand the consequences of deep well drilling, but we have drilled \ntens of thousands of productive wells. One-third of the domestic oil \nproduction comes from the Gulf, so that is not going to be shut down at \nthe moment. The question is: What happens in deep well drilling, what \nhas happened that has caused this disaster? As Secretary Salazar and \nothers indicated, they are not going to proceed\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nwith new drilling permits or under new circumstances until we \nunderstand what happened with the BP well, because this is an \nunmitigated disaster. There is no question about that.\n  All of these things are important and a part of our energy future. \nThe bill we drafted in the Energy Committee last June, that passed on a \nbipartisan vote, is a bill that does a lot of everything and does it \nwell. The bill includes a renewable electricity standard, and builds \nand creates the opportunities to build new transmission lines.\n  I didn't mention previously, but in the last decade we have built \n11,000 miles of natural gas pipeline and at the same time we have built \nonly 660 miles of high-voltage interstate transmission lines. Why? \nBecause it is very hard to build a transmission interstate. There are \nthree things needed to build a transmission interstate: planning, \npricing, and siting. You have to get them all right. What we have done \nin this energy bill is to create the menu by which we are finally going \nto get an interstate transmission capability built. We give FERC \nbackstop authority, and we are careful on the planning and pricing side \nto try to get all of this right. I think in addition to the things I \nhave described, the renewable electricity standard, the opportunity for \nan interstate highway of transmission capability that modernizes our \ngrid, provides greater reliability, and maximizes the production of \nrenewable energy, and building retrofits and building efficiency, there \nis a whole series of other things. I have so much to support.\n  This piece of energy legislation will actually reduce carbon. I think \nit would be unthinkable to end this year without taking up a bipartisan \npiece of legislation that actually reduces carbon and actually reaches \nthe goal of those who are wishing to have a climate change bill come to \nthe floor this session.\n  Again, let me end by saying that I think what Senator Kerry and \nothers are working on is very important for our country. We have \ndisagreements here and there, but the disagreement is not about whether \nthere is something happening to our climate; I think there is. There is \nno disagreement about whether we ought to restrain carbon; we should. \nThere is no disagreement about those central tenets. So I commend the \nwork they have done.\n  I think it is going to be very hard, frankly, to bring a very large \npiece of legislation to the floor soon that has not been through a \ncommittee process. Plaudits to the people who are working hard on this. \nIt is also the case that even if they got their climate bill through, \nyou would have to have another bill, like the bill the Energy Committee \nhas already developed, to actually reduce carbon. On the one side, you \nset up targets, timetables, and goals; and on the other side, you set \nup policies that result in the reduction of carbon.\n  My hope is the Energy bill that Senator Bingaman and I and others \nhave worked on will be on the floor of the Senate at some point this \nsummer. I think the Energy bill will do a couple things that are very \nimportant. No. 1, substantially reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nDo you worry about our economy? I do as well, but it is not just the \nlarge banking institutions that steered this country into the ditch. I \nworry about how vulnerable we are to foreign governments and countries \nfor our oil. We get up in the morning and flick a switch, turn off the \nalarm and turn on the light, make some hot coffee and take a hot \nshower, get in a car and turn a key. We use energy in so many ways \nwithout ever thinking about it. Oil is so central. Yet, over 60 percent \nof our oil comes from outside of our country, from some very troubling \nparts of the world. We need to be less dependent on foreign oil.\n  This legislation we have written makes us less dependent on foreign \noil. But as important as that is, this legislation begins to address \nthe issue of climate change in a very real and very significant way. By \nmaximizing the development of renewable energy for this country's \nfuture, and doing the things that are necessary to reduce the emission \nof carbon.\n  As I said when I started, when I spoke in Dallas, TX, on Monday, at \nthe National Wind Energy Conference, you could see and feel and hear \nthe excitement of the people who understand that there is now a new \nopportunity to contribute to this country's energy supply, with \nrenewable, clean, green energy.\n  We have given very interesting incentives in this country to try new \nthings. Early in the past century, in the nineteen-teens, our country \nsaid: If you go look for oil and gas, try to find some, produce some, \nexplore for some, we are going to give you long-term, good, and \npermanent tax incentives.\n  That is what we did. Why? Because we wanted people to find oil and \ngas. Those tax incentives still exist. What we did for renewable was \nvery different. In 1992, we said: Here are some tax incentives for \nrenewable energy if you are willing to develop some. But the tax \nincentives were shallow and temporary. They were extended six times and \nallowed to expire three times. It was stutter, stop, start, and nobody \nknew what to think. Invest now, don't invest next. It didn't make \nsense.\n  I think what we ought to do is plan a menu for our energy future and \nsay here is where America is headed for the next decade. Believe in it \nand invest in it. That is where we are going. We have done that with \nother forms of energy, oil and gas, but not with renewable energy, and \nwe should. The ability to gather energy from the Sun that shines on \nthis planet and from the wind. The ability to gather energy from wind \nis a source of energy that will last forever and will make a \nsignificant contribution, in my judgment, to our planet's health.\n  Again, my hope is that in the coming weeks, as some colleagues work \non a very broad piece of climate change legislation--and I think it is \ngood that they are doing that and I commend them--if it is clear that \nthe climate change legislation doesn't have the 60 votes, it is very \nimportant that we bring to the floor the product that came from the \nEnergy Committee. That will advance this country's energy interests, \nwith less dependence on foreign oil and clean, green energy for \nmaximizing renewable energy sources.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Financial Reform\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday, one of my colleagues, Senator \nKaufman, from Delaware, came to the floor and expressed some concern \nabout the issues that will now be followed with respect to financial \nreform. I wanted to simply say I share many of the concerns he \nexpressed.\n  There are some who are worried about financial reform going too far. \nI am worried that financial reform still doesn't go far enough. As we \ngo into a conference, I note the conferees who have been appointed, and \nI note some of the conversations in the media about those who will be \nin the conference. I am worried. I think in order to address the issues \nthat need to be addressed--and as my colleagues know, I have spoken \nabout this many times, I think too big to fail has to be addressed. I \ndon't think it is yet addressed adequately.\n  I think that if we, in the future, have financial firms that are so \nlarge they cause a moral hazard, or unacceptable risks, and whose \nfailure could bring down the entire economy, those firms that are in \nthat situation of too big to fail have to be pared back to a point \nwhere they would no longer bring down the economy should they fail. I \ndon't think that has been yet adequately addressed.\n  I also think we have not addressed the issue of the toxic assets that \nhave been traded and essentially wagered in our economy to the tune of \ntrillions of dollars. Some of that wagering, by the way, has turned \nsome bank lobbies into not noticeable but certainly express casinos \nbecause of the trading of what are called naked credit default swaps, \nwhich are instruments of gaming that have no insurable interest on \neither\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\nside. The growth of these kinds of things and the gaming that is still \ngoing on is far afield from the investing and lending that used to be \nthe central functions of our major financial institutions. Sources of \ncapital for the purpose of buying trillions of dollars of naked credit \ndefault swaps is not a way to address the ills of our country.\n  I attempted here to get an amendment offered that would simply ban \nthe use of naked credit default swaps. I note that some other countries \nhave now done that. I was not able to get a vote on it. We had a vote \non a tabling motion to a second-degree amendment I offered. My hope is \nthat will still remain an opportunity to be corrected in a conference.\n  The issue of proprietary trading is still, I think, a significant \nissue. I have described banks trading derivatives on their own \naccounts. I wrote an article about this in 1994, which was the cover \nstory of the Washington Monthly magazine. My story article was titled \n``Very Risky Business.'' I was describing then the risk of having \nproprietary trading by banks on their own accounts of very risky \nderivatives. That was 16 years ago. On the other hand, the legislation \nthat has just passed this Congress doesn't shut down these issues. They \nhave grown. They have not diminished.\n  I think if we want to give the American people some comfort that \nsomehow, in the end, financial reform will have addressed the issues \nthat caused the near crash of this economy--the deepest recession since \nthe Great Depression--more still needs to be done.\n  I commend my colleagues who worked on this. But we do still have some \ndisagreements and some concerns that this doesn't go far enough. As I \nsaid--and I noticed this in the papers this morning--some think there \nis a danger of this going too far. It does not, in my judgment. Much of \nit has been watered down in a way that doesn't provide the adequate \nprotection that is needed going into the future.\n  I note that today, Secretary Geithner is going to stop in Europe. He \nis making two stops in Europe, because he is concerned about the \ndifferent approaches that are being taken by European countries, and \nsome of the suggestions are that, well, the Europeans aren't doing as \nmuch here and there and, therefore, American financial institutions \nwill move their business offshore. Look, I think most of us want to \nhave a financial system that relates to the ways of doing finance that \nrepresent the safety and soundness of the financial industry. That was \nnot the case in most recent years. We securitized almost everything--\nalmost anything that could be. We got rating agencies who acted as \nthough they were inebriated, to give AAA ratings to securities that \nturned out to be almost nothing. Then they sold the risks up so that \nthose who originally placed loans, for example, didn't have to \nunderwrite the loans, because they weren't going to get stuck with the \nbill. They would sell them to hedge funds and investment banks, and \neverybody was making a massive amount of money--big bonuses.\n  When the collapse came, Wall Street, according to New York \nauthorities, had $35 billion in losses in 1 year and paid $17 billion \nin bonuses. That describes how everybody was awash in money. Everybody \nwas making a lot of cash and big bonuses. What was happening is that \nall of this greed--this cesspool of greed--was steering this country \ninto the ditch, and the American people suffered mightily as a result \nof it. Millions of people lost their jobs, millions more lost their \nhomes, millions have lost hope, and there are millions of kids coming \nout of our colleges last year, the year before, and this year, who \nstill cannot find work. That is the carnage and wreckage that occurred. \nThe question in financial reform is: Will we tighten the laces and get \nit right, and do what is right on too big to fail, proprietary trading, \nand other issues? I wanted to say, when I read Senator Kaufman's \nstatement, that he and I had many of the same concerns, as others do.\n  I hope when the conference is held on financial reform, this bill \ngets tightened, not loosened, and that we make sure we do enough. Don't \nbe too worried about going too far. We are a long way away from that \nfinish line.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Kaufman, and others who have \nexpressed concerns. I wanted to add my concern as well. The American \npeople deserve to know the Congress is going to get this right. We have \nnow had plenty of understanding and experience about what happened, and \nwe should have the knowledge and the ability to decide we are not going \nto let it happen again, ever.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4232 and 4231\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma has proposed \ntwo amendments, both of which are designed to offset the cost of the \nsupplemental bill before us. He argues that the Nation needs to find \nways to use existing funds to meet these needs. He even argues that \nsome of the items were not unforeseen and, therefore, do not qualify as \nemergencies.\n  I would respond, do not tell the people of Rhode Island and Tennessee \nthat the floods in their States are not emergencies. I would say any of \nus watching television are aware of the emergency which is occurring \nnow on the gulf coast. I would even say those in Oklahoma whose forests \nand towns have been damaged by tornadoes are aware of what an emergency \nis.\n  The Senator suggested we should not declare the cost of war as an \nemergency since we have known about the costs of war since September \n11, 2001. I would remind the Senator and my colleagues that the current \nadministration did its best to foresee the costs of war and included \nfunding for those costs as part of its budget request, and the Congress \nacted to meet these needs.\n  But circumstances change. The deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan \nled our military leaders to recommend, and the President to conclude, \nthat we needed to increase our forces in Afghanistan. The funds in this \nbill are that unforeseen portion of the cost of war. For someone to \nargue they do not qualify as an emergency is most unfortunate.\n  The Senator suggests we should cut unobligated balances. Several \nothers have suggested we should cut from the stimulus bill. Nearly \nevery dollar remaining in the stimulus bill has been committed to a \nparticular project if not yet obligated. If we look at what is left, \nthe largest item that is unobligated at the moment is for high-speed \nrail--approximately $7.9 billion--but those funds have been awarded to \nspecific projects. We know where the funds are going, and they will all \nbe awarded on contracts soon.\n  There is some $6 billion in unobligated Pell grant funding. But that \namount is already assumed in the fiscal year 2011 budget. We already \nhave a $5.7 billion shortfall in this great scholarship funding \nprogram. If we rescind this $6 billion, we will need to find nearly $12 \nbillion in fiscal year 2011 to meet the shortfall.\n  More than $6 billion remains available to pay the States for fiscal \nstabilization. Thirty-four States have written budgets assuming these \nfunds would be available to them. States such as Texas are scheduled to \nreceive more than $1 billion of this amount. These funds are \nunobligated, but that does not mean they are not wanted.\n  More than $4 billion remains unobligated for education reform. The \nfunds are ready for award and will be obligated in the next 4 months. \nIs this the program we want to stop?\n  Several Senators have proposed specifically rescinding funds from the \nRecovery Act. Senator Coburn also suggests this is one possible area of \nsavings. Well, unless we want to cut the programs I have listed above, \nthere are no funds to rescind from the stimulus bill.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is indiscriminate in his suggestion we cut \nunexpended balances. Let me say this to my colleagues, in a trillion \ndollar discretionary budget, we better hope we have unobligated \nbalances because if we did not, we would be terminating government \nservices with a third of the year still remaining to be funded. For \nexample, there would be no one to send out Social Security checks, no \none to keep our national parks open, and no funds to maintain a \nterrorist watch list or fight our wars.\n  But unobligated does not mean unneeded. On Monday, I noted we have \n$8.3 billion in unobligated balances in the Joint Strike Fighter \nProgram, but the Senator does not say what programs he would propose \nfor the bulk of the cuts he is mandating.\n  In one amendment, he says, do not cut defense spending. In the other, \nit is, do not cut veterans funding. I share that sentiment, but if we \nare talking about cutting discretionary funding, the large unobligated \nbalances are in the Defense Department.\n  As of last month, the Defense Department had nearly $400 billion in \nunobligated balances. There are plenty of unobligated balances to pay \nfor the supplemental. But what sense does it make to cut defense \nspending so we can increase funds to cover the cost of war? Even the \nSenator seemingly agrees it would make no sense.\n  The $80 billion rescission authority in the Senator's amendment is \nvirtually unworkable. In fiscal year 2010, the Federal funds \nunobligated balances, excluding the Defense Department and the \nVeterans' Administration, are about $597 billion. More than half of \nthat--$330 billion--is unobligated balances for Treasury which are \nmostly financing mechanisms such as credit reform balances. These \ncannot be rescinded. That leaves only about $267 billion for the $80 \nbillion of proposed rescissions.\n  Nearly one-third of the funds available to continue government \noperations for the remainder of the fiscal year would have to be \neliminated. And, under the amendment, the Congress would defer to the \nunelected OMB Director to determine where to make the cuts. Not only is \nthis a terrible concept, it is an abrogation of our responsibility to \nmake spending decisions for the Nation. And, you can be sure, were we \nto adopt this amendment, the first thing to be cut would be \ncongressional priorities.\n  It is always easy to suggest we should cut unobligated balances, or \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, or someone else's earmarks. What is much \nharder to identify is specific programs which should be cut.\n  By way of example, if we cut funding for NOAA, it will mean reducing \nour capabilities to track the devastating oil spill washing up on our \ngulf coast communities at this moment. Slashing unobligated funding \nwould curtail the efforts to restore wetlands and beaches that are \nvital to the environment and the local economy and to our fishermen who \nare banned from fishing, evidenced by the fishing disaster just \ndeclared by Secretary Locke.\n\n  In the case of homeland security, most of the unobligated balances \nwhich remain available are for acquisitions such as the national \nsecurity cutter, aircraft for border security, border station \nconstruction, explosive detection equipment for our airports, radiation \nportal monitors, and border technology such as sensors, cameras, and x-\nray\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nmachines. This amendment would force us to curtail spending on these \nprograms at the same time other Senators are urging the Senate to \nincrease funding for them.\n  The Senator's two amendments fall short in identifying reasonable \noffsets for the cost of these bills. Does this body want to penalize \nall civil servants by not allowing any cost-of-living adjustment for \nthe coming year? Do we want to encourage our most skilled workers to \nleave Federal service because their pay, which already doesn't match \nthe employment cost index when comparing similar jobs in the private \nsector, would be frozen? What sense does it make to encourage our best \nworkers to quit? That is not good management. Few successful private \nenterprises would suggest freezing pay for all their workers.\n  There are items that I believe have merit in the Senator's proposal, \nand I hope the committee can work with him as we move forward into \nfiscal year 2011 to identify them. Cutting overhead and saving funding \nthrough taxpayer compliance are good ideas which I know our \nappropriations subcommittees share. The government should rid itself of \nexcess real property, and it should be encouraged to do so. But to set \nan arbitrary target of cutting $15 billion seems unrealistic, \nunwarranted, and unwise.\n  All my colleagues should be advised that it is very difficult to make \nsignificant reductions in spending 7 months into the fiscal year. At \nthis point, we have made commitments to our agencies, and they, in \nturn, have made commitments to contractors and grant recipients. No, \nthey haven't spent all their funding for the entire fiscal year, but \nnor do they have large unneeded balances that can be reapplied to cover \nthe cost of emergent requirements.\n  If the Senate were to agree to cut $100 billion from the legislative \nbudget at this juncture, the Congress would have two choices: lay off \nour staffs so that we are unable to meet the legislative demands of the \ninstitution or stop work on maintenance.\n  The Architect of the Capitol, Mr. Stephen Ayers, just testified that \nthe Capitol Complex faces a growing backlog of deferred maintenance \nprojects totaling over $1.6 billion which must be funded in the near \nfuture. Many of these projects are fire- and life-safety related. The \nArchitect has received numerous citations about the urgency of the \nneeded repairs to the aging infrastructure in the historical buildings \nwithin our complex. The Russell, Cannon, Capitol, and the Thomas \nJefferson Library of Congress buildings are all in violation of current \nfire safety codes. The longer this work is delayed, the more it will \nultimately cost. Each year, the Appropriations Legislative Branch \nSubcommittee attempts to whittle away at this backlog by funding a \nhandful of these projects in the annual appropriations bill.\n  So we could cut $100 million from the legislative budget, but it \nwould be penny wise and pound foolish, as the old adage says.\n  One suggestion made by the Senator from Oklahoma is to cut the \nadministrative expenses of the Federal agencies by 5 percent. Again, it \nis an idea that sounds good. Surely every bureaucracy can be cut back. \nI would note that on the Appropriations Committee, we look for such \ncuts every year, but setting arbitrary targets would be irresponsible. \nFor example, in the case of the State Department and the USAID, which \nlost large percentages of their professional staff during the 1990s or \nhad them transferred from Washington to other embassies in Iraq or \nAfghanistan after 9/11, it will exacerbate an already unsustainable \nsituation. Some of our embassies are 20 percent short of staff. USAID \nis being asked to do more and more, especially in key countries such as \nPakistan, without nearly half the staff to manage the funds and conduct \nthe necessary oversight.\n  Here are a few examples of what a 5-percent cut means. The Indian \nHealth Service medical services would be cut by $185 million. This \nmeans 10,000 fewer inpatient admissions, 195,000 fewer dental patient \nvisits, 55,000 fewer mental health patient visits, and 85,000 fewer \npublic health nursing visits. The National Park Service base operations \nwould be cut by $115 million and result in a loss of 1,130 park rangers \nnationwide. This would necessitate the closure of most national parks \nwhere security and health and safety maintenance could not be \nmaintained, such as the Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, the \nGrand Canyon, Yosemite, and the Yellowstone National Park. Just think \nof the impact of such an action as we head into the busy summer months. \nThe American people would be incensed by such a recommendation.\n  This amendment would cut the childhood immunization program by $25 \nmillion, preventing more than 30,000 children from being vaccinated \nthis year.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, would the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, I will be glad to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. The reduction is in overhead expense; it is not in labor. \nThe definition the Senator is using is an across-the-board cut. That is \nnot in this amendment at all. Does the chairman realize that the 5-\npercent reduction is in overhead--not direct labor, not actual \nemployees, but the management costs to run the different agencies?\n  Mr. INOUYE. We have looked into that, and I can assure my colleague \nthat all the statements I have made have been verified.\n  Further, it would eliminate childcare subsidies for 35,000 low-income \nchildren and their working families who depend on subsidies in order to \nbe able to work. It would eliminate over 40,000 Head Start slots that \nprovide comprehensive early childhood services to low-income children. \nIt would more than double the number of people waiting on their \ndisability decisions from the Social Security Administration and delay \nbenefits for everyone waiting on a decision. It would eliminate 13 \nmillion meals for older Americans, many of whom are low income, \ndisabled, and depend on these meals for the majority of their daily \nfood intake.\n  On another matter, these amendments would also arbitrarily cap \nvoluntary payments to the United Nations by $1 billion. No matter how \nimportant to U.S. security, no matter how much our allies are \ncontributing, no matter that our influence is often the function of how \nmuch we contribute, the amendment picks a round number out of the air \nand prohibits spending $1 more. Those calculations must be made program \nby program, agency by agency, whether for UNICEF, the World Food \nProgramme, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or some other U.N. \norganization. The decisions should be based on the merits and the \nnational security and foreign policy interests of the United States, \nnot on some arbitrary amount proposed in this amendment.\n  Let's stop trying to legislate by formula. If there are U.N. programs \nthat do not deserve to be funded, I am all for cutting our \ncontributions, but this amendment does not name a single one.\n  Placing a cap on new Federal employees would create problems for \nseveral agencies. If Homeland Security needs to increase the number of \nBorder Patrol agents to secure the border or the number of TSA \noperators to screen passengers for explosives under their clothes, does \nthat mean we must cut the number of Secret Service agents or Coast \nGuard personnel or customs inspectors or FEMA personnel who are now \nhelping to respond to disasters in Tennessee, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and \nMississippi?\n  The same point can be made for the IRS and the HHS because most \nfraud, abuse, and waste is in the Tax Code and in Medicare. We need \nadditional personnel to uncover this waste.\n  For the Veterans' Administration, when the agency is seeing an \nincreasing number of veterans suffering from complex combat-related \ninjuries and mental health problems due to numerous deployments, this \nis exactly the type of government action our veterans do not need or \ndeserve. Congress has consistently, on a bipartisan basis, increased \nfunding for the VA to build its capacity to handle these types of \ndisorders. This type of zero sum amendment would ensure that in order \nto adequately serve veterans suffering from mental health and other \ncombat-related injuries, the VA would have to decrease its capacity to \nhandle other services, including addressing the backlog of claims \nprocessing.\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\n  This is a small point, but since the Senator chose to raise it \nyesterday, I wish to respond. I find it to be a clear example of the \nway the Senator misunderstands the work of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  In his remarks yesterday, the Senator noted that the bill includes \n$1.8 million for the work of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission \nand stated that it was inappropriate to include $1.8 million in \nemergency funding to continue the efforts of this Commission. Several \nMembers of this Chamber disagree with the judgment of the Senator that \nthe Commission is unnecessary, but on one point I agree with the \nSenator. I share his views that the continuation of the Commission does \nnot constitute an emergency, and for that reason, the Financial \nServices Subcommittee has been directed to identify an offset in \ndiscretionary funds to pay for this Commission, and they did. The cost \nof the Commission is fully offset with discretionary rescissions.\n  I will reiterate what I said on Monday. The vice chairman and I \nworked to ensure that only emergencies were funded in this act. In the \nfew cases where nonemergency projects were funded, we insisted that \nthese programs be offset. This may be the first time in decades that \nthe committee has followed such a strict policy. Collectively, it was \nthe judgment of the members of the committee that these are, indeed, \ntough times and we have to be very stingy with our taxpayers' funds. \nBut let me repeat: The fiscal crisis the country faces cannot be \novercome by failing to invest in those programs which are essential to \nour Nation.\n  The amendments offered by the Senator are unworkable. They represent \na classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Should we cut the pay of \nour employees at the same time we are asking them to be more efficient? \nThat makes little sense.\n  Should we cap the number of Federal employees when demands for \nveterans services, border security, and ferreting out waste are on the \nrise?\n  Again, in sound bites, it does sound good. But in implementing the \nconcept, we see it is unworkable.\n  Finally, I think the Senate should thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor drawing attention to the matter that we need to do more with less.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I can see the belt \ntightening that will be required in the coming years as we get our \nfiscal house in order. There are elements of this proposal I intend to \nhave our subcommittees incorporate as we move bills for fiscal year \n2011.\n  I can assure the Senator and all members of the committee that the \ncommittee will continue to stress the requirement to uncover waste and \ncut it. We will scrutinize all aspects of the Federal budget to \nidentify the duplication and unnecessary spending, and we will use \nthese savings to invest in the shortfalls the Nation faces.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject these amendments because, on balance, \nthey are the wrong approach to solving our Nation's emergency needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I am taken aback by the chairman's \nremarks. We now sit at $13 trillion worth of debt, we have 10 percent \nunemployment, we are 4 years away from being Greece, and we are going \nto do what we have always done. The reason we can freeze Federal pay is \nbecause there is absolutely no inflation in this country. So instead of \ngiving the raise, we don't. Every private sector business out there \ntoday is getting extremely more with less--to the tune that the \nproductivity in the private sector was up 6.8 percent. If we had that \nsame productivity in the Federal Government, we could lose 150,000 \nemployees and do the same thing. But we would not accept what is \nnecessary--the necessary pain--to protect this country for its future.\n  The chairman mentioned unobligated balances, but he spoke about \nobligated balances. We are not talking about money that has been \nobligated; we are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars that is \nnot obligated. Last year, at the end of the fiscal year, there was in \nexcess of $700 billion from the previous year that was unobligated, \nsitting there.\n  So it is about managing our money properly. That is like saying if \nyou have $30,000 in a savings account and you want to buy a new home, \nyou are going to leave it there and go borrow $60,000. No, you are \ngoing to use part of that to buy your new home. So we have the same \napproach that is disgusting America: We can't, we can't. What we can do \nis borrow against the future of our children. That is what this bill \ndoes.\n  So the first time we come out here with two good amendments that will \noffer a choice for the Senators of this body to actually make a \ndownpayment on change in this country, to make a true downpayment on \nchange, we get the same thing I have heard for 5\\1/2\\ years: We can't.\n  Let me tell you what we can do. We can cap Federal employees. We have \nadded 180,000 Federal employees in the last 17 months in this country. \nBy the way, their average salary is $30,000 more a year than in the \nprivate sector. Their benefits are $40,000 a year, which is twice what \nit is in the private sector. So capping Federal employees is a great \nway to start slowing down the growth and cost of government.\n  If the bureaucracy isn't responding, then it requires management \nchanges rather than adding more people. The worst managers in the world \nalways give the excuse: I need to have more people, rather than: I need \nto be creative about getting more out of the people I have today.\n  We need to change the standard under which we operate our government. \nWe need to expect more, and we need to pay less. The American people \ncannot afford the government we have. We are unaffordable.\n  The chairman brings to the floor a bill that is more of the same. You \ncan be critical of what we have offered. We don't have the advantages \nof the staff the chairman has. But this is an honest attempt to pay so \nwe don't charge it to our children.\n  Notice he didn't say anything about the savings of $4.6 billion for \nnot printing this paper every day that nobody reads but reads on the \nInternet. Yet we are going to spend $460 million a year printing \ngovernment reports from this body and the White House that nobody looks \nat in hard copy. I would assume you would take by unanimous consent \nthat we would cut $4.6 billion from the American Government. We didn't \nhear about that. That is not one of the bad ideas. We weren't attacked \non that.\n  This Federal Government has to change if our kids are going to have a \nfuture. It isn't going to change until we have the courage and the \nfortitude to start making the hard choices. What the Appropriations \nCommittee has said is that we are not going to make hard choices, we \nare just going to borrow the money. How many of you think the war is an \nemergency? How long have we known, or how long have we been in \nAfghanistan? It is not an emergency. Here on the chart is the \ndefinition of our own rules for emergencies. Nothing in this bill meets \nthat except FEMA--nothing. Yet we have the gall to bring to the floor a \nbill called an ``emergency'' because we don't want to have to pay for \nit. We don't want to make tough votes or make choices between competing \npriorities.\n  We are just kicking the can down the road, and we are kicking the \nsoup that was in the can all over our kids. We lack courage. It is not \npopular, it is not fun to make the hard choices, but we don't have any \nleadership that will bring the hard choices. That is why you have this \namendment. Had we brought this amendment and we made the choices, we \nprobably would not have gotten much kickback. But we decided we are \njust going to charge it to our children.\n  Guess what is coming after this. Another $200 billion that isn't paid \nfor. Since the chairman of this committee voted for pay-go, we have \nborrowed $173 billion outside of pay-go because we voted and said it \ndidn't count, and we had this wonderful celebration that we are not \never going to borrow money again. We are going to live within pay-go. \nBut every time it has been there, we kicked it down the road. Pay-go \nmeans nothing. It means the American people will pay and we will go \nspend it. That is what it means. That is what this bill does. American \npeople--you kids, you grandkids--you are going to pay, and we are going \nto go spend it. How are you going to pay? Your standard of living will \ndecline.\n  This body--Republicans and Democrats alike--is complicit in ruining \nthe\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\nfuture for our children. It is time we change. We have a committee that \nmakes fun of attempts to try to change things; actually, it stretches \nthe truth. This isn't going to cost one TSA person their job or one FBI \nperson. This government is so fat and so overladen with excess that any \nsmart manager can come in and streamline it and we can save 10 percent \nand the American people know that.\n  We have 12 million people on SSI and SSDI. Do you know what we have \ndiscovered? We have discovered that 6 out of 100,000 of them are \noperating commercial vehicles right now, but they are ``disabled.''\n  We have all sorts of fraud going on. We will not address that. We \nwill not fix that. There is waste--at least $350 billion the American \npublic--maybe not this body--would agree we can cut out of the \ndiscretionary in fraud and Medicare tomorrow, and nobody would feel a \nthing. Yet we have a stoic Appropriations Committee that comes to the \nSenate floor and tells us we can't pay for it. It is not that we wanted \nto pay for it, we didn't want to pay for it because the staff on the \nAppropriations Committee knows where the dollars are, but they weren't \ntold to pay for it. They are not going to be told to pay for the \nextenders bill that is coming either. What will have happened since \nFebruary 12 when we passed pay-go? I will tell you what will have \nhappened: $500 billion--$\\1/2\\ trillion--more in spending that is \nunpaid for and charged to our kids, and that will happen before July 1. \nSo in 4\\1/2\\ months, after we say we are going to put in the \ndiscipline, that we are not going to spend money we don't have, we are \ngoing to spend another $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  No wonder the country is sick of Washington. Our behavior causes them \nto wonder about the future of our country. I don't apologize for \noffering this amendment. I hope you vote against it because the voters, \nthis time around, are going to be looking at how you vote and whether \nyou are voting to make the hard choices, willing to eliminate things--\nmaybe some things that are good but not as good as what we need to be \ndoing--and make this a priority.\n  We don't have that courage. My challenge to my colleagues in the \nSenate is, let's buck up. It is OK to take heat from the special \ninterests, the well-connected and well-endowed. Let's do what is the \nbest and right thing for the country, not the easy thing for us, \nbecause this bill, the way it is written now, is easy for us.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4173\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I will speak for a few minutes \nregarding amendment No. 4173, offered by Senators Sessions and \nMcCaskill.\n  While I understand the imperative of balancing the budget, an across-\nthe-board amendment that sets an artificial ceiling for all \ndiscretionary spending is not the solution. If Sessions-McCaskill is \nadopted, the Senate will be forced to slash funding for the Department \nof Veterans Affairs and its related agencies--including Arlington \nNational Cemetery--by $1.1 billion below the requested level.\n  If we take medical care off the table--and I for one am not willing \nto cut medical care for vets--we put every other VA program at risk, \nincluding claims processing, medical and mental health research, and \nhospital and clinic maintenance and renovation. This would translate \ninto an $862 million cut below this year's appropriation for non \nmedical care VA programs. We are talking about a serious funding \nshortfall for essential VA programs.\n  This year, the VA's budget request includes $460 million over fiscal \nyear 2010 to hire more than 4,000 new claims processors. After years of \nbudget requests that ignored the backlog of claims and the unacceptable \nwait times for vets to get disability benefits, we finally have a \nresponsible budget request that doesn't simply expect Congress to fill \nthe holes.\n  The current wait time for a vet to have a disability claim processed \nis 160 days, and because of new benefits coming on line that will \nstress the system even more, the wait time is expected to spike next \nyear. Asking a combat vet to wait 6 to 7 months before receiving \npayments for injuries they suffered while defending this Nation is \nwholly unacceptable. We cannot afford to delay the hiring of more \nclaims processors.\n  Likewise, we cannot afford to defer critical research into combat-\nrelated medical and mental health conditions, such as traumatic brain \ninjury and post-traumatic stress disorder. To do so while this Nation \nis at war would be the height of irresponsibility.\n  For construction, the VA's request already reduces these accounts by \n$293 million from fiscal year 2010. Further reductions in the program \nwill only increase the backlog of construction projects.\n  I hope the authors of this amendment did not intend to reduce funding \nfor veterans, but this amendment does nothing to protect them, and the \nsubcommittee will only be able to fund programs to the level to which \nfunding is available.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and pass a sensible \nbudget resolution that tackles the Federal deficit in a holistic \napproach rather than simply attempting to balance the Federal budget on \nthe discretionary side of the ledger.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I thank and commend my friend for his \npresentation. He is one of the hardest working subcommittee chairmen of \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n  If I may, I wish to be a bit personal. As some of my colleagues are \naware, I did put on the uniform of this land and served in a war that \nwas fought about six decades ago--ancient times. A few things happened \nbetween that time and this war. For example, although the regiment I \nwas privileged to serve in had about the highest casualties per capita \nin the European conflict, it may be hard to believe but there was not a \nsingle double amputee survivor.\n  Today, if one goes to Walter Reed Hospital, one will see dozens of \ndouble amputees. Why? Because of high tech. For example--I am being \npersonal now--in my case, it took 9 hours to evacuate me. Nine hours? \nThat is a long time. But in Italy, they have hills. We had no \nhelicopters in those days. You had to be carried by hand. As a result, \nno brain injuries survived and no double amputees survived. So the \nfamilies did not have the problem then that they are having now.\n  There is another big difference. For example, if I wrote a letter as \na soldier in Italy, that letter was censored by my commanding officer. \nI could not say anything about the war. All I could say is: Italy is a \nbeautiful place. The food is fabulous. Nothing else. You could not say \nthat my buddy Tom was shot. What they received at home were pleasant \nnotes.\n  Today we have what is known as cell phones and other technology. You \ncan communicate with your spouse every day. And these items are not \ncensored.\n  I have had members on my staff with husbands fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They communicate all the time. Imagine if you are \ncommunicating with your husband in Iraq and suddenly you see that \nevening on CNN a program with that outfit in combat and your husband \ndoes not call you the next day. The stress disorder complex is not only \nhitting the GIs, it is hitting families. And now we are trying to cut \nVA, the Veterans' Administration, when the need is much greater? I \ncannot understand that.\n  I concur with the chairman that, if anything, if we are to show \nappreciation and gratitude, we should not be cutting, we should be \nhelping. I commend the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I feel honored that I was on the floor \nand able to hear the chairman of the Appropriations Committee reflect \non his own service and also compare the differences between World War \nII and the experience of our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, and \nmarines in the current conflicts.\n  My own father is a World War II veteran who was wounded twice in the \nBattle of the Bulge. The second time he was wounded was when he was \nwaiting to be evacuated. I can relate slightly, from the experience of \nmy own father, to what we just heard from the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. I cannot imagine being so badly wounded \nand waiting for 9 hours to be evacuated.\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\n  It is a good reminder to all of us, as we engage in the day-to-day \ndebates and arguments and, at times, contentiousness, that we have true \nheroes in our midst. Certainly, the Senator from Hawaii is one of \nthose. I thank him for his service--his lifelong service. It was an \nhonor to be on the floor and to hear him talk about it because, like \nmany of our World War II veterans, he does not talk about it very \noften.\n  I wanted to say that before beginning my remarks.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4253\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and to call up amendment No. 4253, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. \n     Alexander, Mr. Bond, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Snowe, \n     Mr. Begich, Mr. Thune, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Gregg, and Ms. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 4253.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the imposition of fines and liability under \n      certain final rules of the Environmental Protection Agency)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n\n                   prohibition on fines and liability\n\n       Sec. 20__. None of the funds made available by this Act \n     shall be used to levy against any person any fine, or to hold \n     any person liable for construction or renovation work \n     performed by the person, in any State under the final rule \n     entitled ``Lead; Renovation, Repair, and Painting Program; \n     Lead Hazard Information Pamphlet; Notice of Availability; \n     Final Rule'' (73 Fed. Reg. 21692 (April 22, 2008)), and the \n     final rule entitled ``Lead; Amendment to the Opt-out and \n     Recordkeeping Provisions in the Renovation, Repair, and \n     Painting Program'' signed by the Administrator on April 22, \n     2010.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this is a modified version of an \namendment I offered yesterday. I am joined by Senators Alexander, \nInhofe, Bond, Voinovich, Snowe, Begich, Gregg, Brown of Massachusetts, \nMurkowski, Coburn, Thune, and Corker in supporting this amendment.\n  On April 22, the EPA's new lead paint rule went into effect. As I \nexplained to my colleagues yesterday, unfortunately the EPA completely \nbotched the implementation of this important rule. This rule is \nintended to make sure that lead-based paint is removed safely from our \nhomes and, thus, it requires those involved in house renovations to \nparticipate in a training course in the proper removal of lead-based \npaint, and then be certified.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA did not plan well for the implementation of \nthis new rule. Across our country, it did not have in place the \nnecessary trainers and classes so that individuals could be trained to \ncomply with this new rule.\n  What our amendment would do is to delay the fines that would apply in \ncases of violations of this new rule until September 30. Indeed, it \nwould prohibit the EPA from imposing these fines, which are as high as \n$37,500 per day per violation for violating this rule.\n  I want to make clear that I support efforts to rid our homes of toxic \nlead-based paint in a safe manner. But it is simply not fair to impose \nthese burdensome, onerous fines on contractors who have been unable to \nget the EPA-provided training because the EPA did such a lousy job in \nplanning for implementation of this new rule.\n  In my State, for example, as of last week, we have only three EPA \ntrainers to certify contractors for the entire State. As a result, only \nabout 10 percent of the State's contractors have been certified. \nHundreds of home renovators have had their names on waiting lists, some \nfor as long as 2 months, but they simply cannot get the necessary \ntraining, and that is through no fault of their own.\n  I note that my amendment has been endorsed by the National Federation \nof Independent Business, our Nation's leading small business advocacy \norganization. It has been endorsed by the Window & Door Manufacturers \nAssociation and the National Lumber and Building Material Dealers \nAssociation.\n  These groups have endorsed it because they are hearing from their \nmembers of the tremendous burden and the tremendous fines that their \nmembers are potentially at risk of receiving through no fault of their \nown.\n  As the NFIB pointed out in its letter, the new EPA lead rule applies \nto virtually anyone who is involved in home renovations involving lead-\nbased paint. That includes painters, plumbers, window and door \ninstallers, carpenters, electricians, and other specialists. Its reach \nis very broad.\n  What we found throughout the country is the EPA completely \nunderestimated the number of people who would have to be trained. They \nalso seem to be operating under the false assumption that contractors \neither do new construction or renovation. Madam President, I don't know \nabout your State, but that is not true in my State. In my State, the \nhome renovators do all sorts of work, particularly in this economy.\n  This imposes a tremendous burden on those of us who represent large \nrural States. In my State, most of the courses were held in the \nsouthern part of the State, requiring painters and other contractors to \ntravel hundreds of miles to get the training they need. There are three \nStates where EPA does not have any certified trainers available.\n  This is a commonsense amendment attempting to put some sense in the \ndecisionmaking at the EPA by extending, until the end of this fiscal \nyear, the time for compliance.\n  I want to make clear that I believe we should try to proceed with the \nremoval of lead-based paint and that we need strict safety standards. \nBut it does not make sense to impose huge fines on contractors who are \nunable to get the required training, the mandatory classes because the \nEPA did not have the trainers in place before putting the rule into \neffect.\n  In my State, the building industry is still struggling, and for a lot \nof individuals who are involved in the building industry, their only \nwork is to do home renovations.\n  My State also has an old housing stock, one of the oldest in the \nNation. Ironically, this new rule may result in not having anyone who \nis qualified to remove lead-based paint from homes because of the way \nthis rule has been implemented.\n  I talked at some length about this issue yesterday. I am not going to \nrepeat what I said yesterday. But let me point out that a lot of the \ncontractors in my State who are struggling already financially do not \nearn in a whole year the $37,500 they can be fined for one violation by \nthe EPA. It is simply unfair that these heavy fines can be imposed when \nit is the EPA's fault that the classes have not been made more readily \navailable.\n  All I am attempting to do is to provide the EPA with more time to \nincrease the number of certified trainers. This is a matter of \nfairness.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the endorsement letters from the NFIB, from the National Lumber \nand Building Material Dealers Association, and from the Window & Door \nManufacturers Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Federation of \n     Independent Business, the nation's leading small business \n     advocacy organization, I am writing in strong support of the \n     Collins Amendment to H.R. 4899, the Supplemental \n     Appropriations bill, to delay the enforcement of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) lead rule until \n     September 30, 2010. The NFIB will consider a vote in support \n     of this amendment as an NFIB Key Vote for the 116th Congress.\n       On April 22, 2010, the EPA's lead rule went into effect \n     requiring home renovation contractors to complete a mandatory \n     training class at an accredited facility. The new EPA lead \n     rule applies to virtually any industry affecting home \n     renovation including: painters, plumbers, window and door \n     installers, carpenters, electricians, and similar \n     specialists. The penalty for non-compliance can be up to \n     $37,500 per violation per day. NFIB appreciates the intent of \n     the law to ensure lead-free painting, home renovation, and \n     repairs. However, we continue to be concerned that the tight \n     enforcement deadline unfairly punishes contractors who have \n     not been able to become accredited through no fault of their \n     own.\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n       NFIB has recently heard from several of our members in the \n     home renovation industry who were unaware of their \n     responsibilities under the new law. EPA did little to plan \n     for the implementation of the rules until it was too late, \n     and many home renovators had little information about how to \n     comply, where to comply, and the resources needed to comply. \n     Those that became aware of the rules have had difficulty \n     signing up for classes due to limited or no availability in \n     their area. In addition, several members have mentioned that \n     scheduling conflicts made it almost impossible to find time \n     to become accredited before the April 22 deadline.\n       We are concerned that the high penalty for non-compliance \n     should be enforced without first taking every step possible \n     to make sure the small business community is fully aware of \n     its responsibilities. The Collins Amendment extends the \n     deadline until September 30, allowing the EPA to get more \n     information to home renovators about how to comply with the \n     new rule. This time period will allow the home renovation \n     industry to schedule an appointment with an accreditor in \n     their area and make sure they have the necessary resources \n     together to be in compliance.\n       NFIB supports the Collins Amendment to help small \n     businesses comply with the new lead rule. I look forward to \n     working with you to reduce regulatory burdens on the small \n     business community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Eckerly,\n     Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     window & door\n\n\n                                    manufacturers association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2010.\n     Re Collins LRRP Amendment to Supplemental Appropriations \n         Bill.\n\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye and Ranking Member Cochran: On behalf \n     of the Window and Door Manufacturers Association (WDMA), we \n     are writing to urge your support of Senator Collins' Lead: \n     Renovation, Repair and Painting (LRRP) amendment to the \n     emergency supplemental. As you know, EPA's new LRRP rule, \n     which took effect April 22, 2010, requires all renovation \n     work that disturbs more than six square feet and all window \n     replacements in housing built before 1978 must be supervised \n     by a certified renovator and performed by a certified \n     renovation firm.\n       WDMA has consistently supported measures to protect those \n     most vulnerable to potential lead poisoning if lead-based \n     paint is disturbed during renovation and repair of existing \n     homes and buildings. Our members have made a concerted effort \n     independently and in cooperation with other organizations to \n     ensure that window replacements and other remodeling \n     activities they engage in are performed in compliance with \n     the certification requirements, work practice standards, and \n     all other requirements of the final LRRP rule.\n       However, we continue to remain concerned that there are an \n     inadequate number of certified renovators to implement the \n     LRRP rule. This is having a serious impact on the remodeling \n     construction industry at a critical time in our economic \n     recovery, and when consumers are attempting to respond to the \n     call for reducing their carbon footprint and green house gas \n     emissions by renovating their homes to make them more energy \n     efficient. Window replacement is essential to that effort. \n     The targeted housing stock (pre-1978 homes) is estimated to \n     be 80 million homes nationwide. Currently. there are only 204 \n     trainers and 140,000 EPA-certified lead rule renovators \n     across the country, with some states having no trainers at \n     all. EPA estimates that 300,000 renovators will be needed for \n     targeted housing. The availability of EPA trainers is \n     insufficient to meet contractor demand.\n       We believe the new lead rule cannot be effectively \n     implemented until there are enough certified renovators to \n     meet the rule's compliance goals. We therefore strongly urge \n     you to allow Senator Collins' LRRP amendment for \n     consideration to the emergency supplemental, which would \n     delay enforcement of the LRRP rule until September 30, 2010. \n     This delay in implementation will allow the EPA to devote \n     more resources to compliance assistance, increasing public \n     awareness and accelerating the approval of trainers.\n       WDMA will continue its efforts to ensure compliance but we \n     strongly urge that Senator Collins' LRRP amendment to include \n     this needed delay in enforcement of the LRRP rule until \n     September 30 is allowed for consideration. Once the amendment \n     is under consideration, we urge your support for its passage.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jeremy Stine,\n     Manager of Government & Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      National Lumber and Building\n\n\n                                 Material Dealers Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2010.\n     Re Sen. Collins EPA Lead Rule Amendment to Emergency \n         Supplemental.\n\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye and Ranking Member Cochran: On behalf \n     of the National Lumber and Building Material Dealers \n     Association (NLBMDA), we are writing to urge your support of \n     Senator Collins' Lead: Renovation, Repair and Painting (LRRP) \n     amendment to the emergency supplemental. As you know, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new LRRP rule, which \n     took effect April 22, 2010, requires all renovation work that \n     disturbs more than six square feet in housing built before \n     1978 must be supervised by a certified renovator and \n     performed by a certified renovation firm, as outlined in 40 \n     CFR Sec. 745.85.\n       NLBMDA represents over 6,000 members operating single or \n     multiple lumber yards, building material supply companies and \n     component plants serving homebuilders, subcontractors, \n     general contractors, and consumers in the new construction, \n     repair and remodeling of residential and light commercial \n     structures. Many of our members engage in installed sales \n     operations, such as window and door replacement and \n     insulation installation, that are covered by the LRRP rule.\n       NLBMDA supports reasonable measures to protect those most \n     vulnerable to potential lead poisoning if lead-based paint is \n     disturbed during renovation and repair of existing homes and \n     buildings. Our members have made a concerted effort \n     independently and in cooperation with other organizations to \n     ensure that remodeling activities performed in target housing \n     will be done in compliance with the certification \n     requirements, work practice standards, and all other \n     requirements of the final LRRP rule.\n       However, NLBMDA also believes that despite the progress \n     that has been made, the numbers of certified trainers, firms, \n     and renovators is still too limited, and that when coupled \n     with the current lack of accurate test kits and public \n     awareness, EPA is not fully prepared to effectively implement \n     and administer the program established by the final rule. Our \n     members are reporting that it is taking up to four months for \n     EPA to process their applications to have their firm \n     certified by EPA as required under the rule. We therefore \n     wholly agree with Senator Collins and her amendment, which \n     would delay enforcement of the LRRP rule by EPA until \n     September 30, 2010. We believe this new date of enforcement \n     will provide enough time for our members to become registered \n     with the EPA for lead certification.\n       NLBMDA will continue its efforts to ensure compliance but \n     we strongly urge you to delay enforcement of the LRRP rule \n     until September 30 by allowing Senator Collins' LRRP \n     amendment for consideration to the emergency supplemental. \n     Once the amendment is under consideration, we urge your \n     support for its passage.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Michael P. O'Brien, CAE,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There does not appear to be a sufficient second.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I understand that the chairman has \ntemporarily stepped off the Senate floor, so I will withhold that \nrequest.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I was not on the floor when the Senator \nfrom Maine made her remarks about the EPA's lead paint rule, but she \nand I have discussed it numerous times, and I wanted to congratulate \nher for her leadership and persistence on seeing the impracticality of \nwhat the Environmental Protection Agency is trying to do.\n  She discussed this in the Appropriations Committee, she has discussed \nthis with Senator Feinstein, the Chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and with me--I am the ranking member on \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior--and as more of us paid \nattention to what Senator Collins was saying, we found a significant \nproblem in our own States.\n  Of course, the lead paint rule is a good idea. The idea is that for \nstructures that were built before 1978--they mostly have lead paint--\nany work done by a repairman or contractor or painter that disturbs 6 \nsquare feet of lead paint must be done by someone who knows how to do \nit safely. This is especially important to children under 6\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\nand to pregnant women. So we want to do that.\n  But in the State of Tennessee, it is a special problem to impose and \nenforce this new rule requiring contractors to be certified where we \nhave just had severe flooding in our State that affects 52 counties, \nfrom Nashville to Memphis. This is the single largest natural disaster \nsince President Obama took office.\n  People who hear me say that, say: Well, Senator Alexander, haven't \nyou heard about the gulf oilspill? Yes, I have heard about that, but \nthat wasn't a natural disaster. The biggest natural disaster we have \nhad since President Obama took office is the flood in Tennessee, \naffecting 52 counties.\n  One of the reasons you haven't heard as much about it is because a \nlot of other things have been going on in the world, including the gulf \noilspill, but another reason you have isn't because Tennesseans are \nbusy cleaning up and helping each other and not complaining and \nlooting, so it doesn't make a lot of news. But the mayor of Nashville \nsays there is $2 billion of damage just in that city alone. There was \nwater 10 feet high in the huge Opryland Hotel, where 1,500 people had \nto be rescued and taken to a high school gym. There was 2 feet of water \non the Opryland stage.\n  There are 11,000 structures in Nashville alone which have to be \nrepaired as a result of the flood. So I think you can see where I am \ngoing, Mr. President. This isn't just a problem in certifying these EPA \ninspectors in ordinary times. We have 11,000 structures in Nashville, \n900 in Millington, 300 in Dyersburg--maybe it is the reverse, but those \nare 2 other small towns and counties. People are going into their \nbasements, they are taking down drywall, they are repairing their air-\nconditioning, they are repainting, they are cleaning up and getting \nback on their feet. This is a special problem because we only have 3 \nEPA trainers to certify up to 50,000 contractors who might have to be \nworking on these homes.\n  In fact, we have over three-quarters of a million structures in \nTennessee--that is, 750,000--which are homes or childcare centers or \nschools or other buildings that were built before 1978 that would be \ncovered by this rule. So having a good rule is one thing; having a \nthoroughly impractical application and implementation period is \nanother. And then to do it in the middle of a flood which is the \nlargest natural disaster since President Obama took office is tone-deaf \nto reality.\n  So I have asked the EPA to delay the implementation and enforcement \nof its rule until September if a contractor registers for a training \nclass. I am a cosponsor of Senator Collins' amendment, and I think it \nis very important that the Environmental Protection Agency hear what \nSenators from all around the country are saying, especially in our \nState of Tennessee where we have thousands of repairmen, painters, and \nworkmen who need to go to work on tens of thousands of homes, and we \ndon't want to have a risk where they may have to pay a fine of $37,500 \nfor each violation. There are a lot of them who don't make $37,500 in a \nyear. We are not talking about Wall Street financiers here; we are \ntalking about workmen, repairmen, and painters who are helping people \ndig out after a huge natural disaster.\n  So Senator Collins has not only done the State of Maine a service by \nher persistence, intelligence, and leadership on this issue, but she \nhas done a service for every citizen in the State of Tennessee in 52 \ncounties who have been damaged by the severe flooding of the year 2010. \nSo I thank her for her leadership and say to her that I am proud to be \na cosponsor of her amendment, and I pledge to her--insofar as I am able \nas the ranking member of the Appropriations Interior Subcommittee--to \nwork with other Senators on both sides of the aisle to try to get some \ncommonsense implementation plan for this lead paint rule--a good rule, \na bad plan.\n  Thousands of people are going to find that they can't repair their \nhomes or that if they do, it will cost them thousands of dollars more \nbecause the repairmen they need to work on their homes can't get \ncertified by the EPA because there are only three trainers in the whole \nState of Tennessee to do the job.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague and friend \nfrom Tennessee for his comments and his support. We have been working \non this since we first began discussing it during the appropriations \nmarkup, and he has illustrated what truly can be a devastating impact \nof this rule. It could prevent the renovations, the cleanup, the \nreconstruction work from going forward in his State. In his State even \nmore than most States, the impact could truly be devastating. It is \nserious everywhere but truly devastating in Tennessee.\n  I have also commented to my colleague from Tennessee how proud he \nmust be of the residents of his State. You hardly have heard of any \ncomplaints from Tennessee even though this has truly been a devastating \nflood. I sometimes worry that perhaps because they are trying to help \none another, they are not getting enough attention in the press or from \nCongress. Fortunately, they have a very fine advocate in Senator \nAlexander and Senator Corker, and they are continuing to look out for \nthem by cosponsoring this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for his support.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine, and I \nsee the Senator from Mississippi here. I would be remiss if I did not \nthank him and the chairman of the committee for including within the \nsupplemental appropriations bill several provisions that will make it \neasier for the people of Tennessee, the important one being $5.1 \nbillion in money for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That \nhelps everybody who has had a disaster. FEMA is out of money. That \naccount is dry. Whether it is a flood in Iowa, a drought in Oregon, a \nriver in Georgia, a flood in Tennessee, or what is happening in the \ngulf coast today in Mississippi, that account needs to be furnished.\n  But there are other provisions in the supplemental appropriations \nbill. The President didn't ask for these, but he mentioned that in his \nvisit with us yesterday in the Republican caucus. He mentioned the \nflooding in Tennessee, which I appreciate.\n  I should also say that the FEMA representatives who have come to \nTennessee since the flood have done a first-class job. As of last week, \nabout $100 million had already been delivered to more than 30,000 \nTennesseans who have been damaged by the flood. This has happened in \njust 10 days. The very experienced director of FEMA for Tennessee, \nGracia Szczech, said she had her breath taken away by the amount of \ndamage and the number of individuals affected and how rapidly it has \ngone out.\n  Tennesseans understand that Federal money is not going to make \nanybody whole. We are going to have to rebuild our own homes and our \nown buildings. But the actions of the supplemental appropriations bill \nwill help.\n  Most impressive, though, as I have mentioned--and I appreciate the \nSenator from Maine saying something about it--is the spirit and \nattitude of Tennesseans. In Clarksville, where Fort Campbell is--the \nmost deployed troops in America--they got a day off. They do not have \nmany days off. Five hundred of them went out and cleaned up three \nneighborhoods in Clarksville, Montgomery County.\n  I visited the Bellevue Community Center in Nashville, and it was \nterrific to see so many volunteers walking in and asking to help. Whole \ncongregations in Tennessee--a 1,500-person congregation--went en masse \nto help other counties and other neighborhoods.\n  I would say to the Senator from Mississippi, during the Katrina \nepisode a few years ago, our church, the Westminster Presbyterian \nChurch, sent dozens and dozens of Tennesseans down to help out at the \ngulf coast. Well, now our church is the headquarters for many \nMississippians and others who are returning to Tennessee to return the \nfavor and help Tennesseans get back on their feet.\n  This is going to be a long, several-year recovery for us, but this \nsupplemental appropriations bill will help, just as it will help \ndisasters all over the country.\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\n  It would be another big help if the EPA did not make it worse. That \nmeans stepping back to take a look and realizing that we have maybe \n50,000 contractors who would need to be certified to work on up to \n750,000 buildings in Tennessee. Many of them are flooded; many of them \nare not flooded. But we cannot get all that done in the next few days, \nand people cannot afford $37,500 fines for a violation. Most \nTennesseans do not want to pay a few thousand more dollars to fix their \nflooded basement or their flooded house.\n  The repairmen and contractors and painters need the work. The \nconstruction industry that has about a 22-percent unemployment rate \nright now--that is more than twice what the overall unemployment rate \nis nationwide. So the EPA rule needs to adjust the implementation or \nexecution in some sensible way so we can endorse the lead paint rule, \nbut we can do it in a way that does not seriously disadvantage \nTennesseans damaged by the flood.\n  The Collins amendment deserves the support of the Senate, and I am \nglad to have the opportunity to add my support to her efforts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee for his kind comments about yielding time. I congratulate him \nand the Senator from Maine on their aggressive move to make sure the \nFederal rules and laws do not get in the way of humanitarian efforts \nthat are extremely important in a time of natural disaster.\n  The flooding in Tennessee is a horrible mess. It has been overlooked \nin the wake of the gulf oil spill and other things that have probably \nclaimed center stage in terms of its national publicity and television \ncoverage that has been occasioned by these disasters. But my assurances \nare that we will continue to try to be active in a way that will be a \nconstructive influence in the interpretation and application of Federal \nrules in these situations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have five amendments I would like to \nspeak briefly about that I will not call up at this point. I was \nadvised they are still trying to see if there is any objection to these \nbeing called up. I would still like to discuss them and explain to \npeople why I would like to see these amendments adopted.\n  The first amendment I want to discuss is amendment No. 4279 related \nto bark beetles. This is a serious problem all of us in the West have \nobserved. This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Murkowski, who is \nthe ranking member on our Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Udall of Colorado, and Senator Bennet of Colorado. We are, of \ncourse, looking for additional cosponsors.\n  This amendment addresses an important issue we have in our forests in \nthe West. Bark beetles have affected some 6.5 million acres of these \nforests. The epidemic has resulted in a dangerous situation where dead \ntrees are falling onto roads, trails, campgrounds, utility lines, and \nother infrastructure, posing a substantial risk of personal injury or \ndeath and property damage.\n  The Forest Service and National Park Service already have had to \nredirect tens of millions of dollars of funds that were appropriated \nfor other projects and priorities in order to remove trees killed by \nbark beetles.\n  This amendment provides $50 million to help address the unbudgeted \nneeds of the Forest Service and the National Park Service to remove \nbark-beetle-killed trees around roads, trails, campgrounds, and utility \nlines to protect public health and safety.\n  While the bark beetle epidemic has most significantly affected the \nforests and agency budgets in the central and northern Rockies, the \nneed to redirect funds to address these needs has an adverse affect on \nother projects around the country.\n  The amendment is fully paid for. As I mentioned before, I appreciate \nthat Senator Udall of Colorado--who has been a strong advocate for \ndoing this work--has cosponsored the amendment, along with Senators \nMurkowski and Bennet of Colorado. Senators Johnson and Baucus also have \nadvocated for emergency funding for this work.\n  I hope we can quickly get approval to go ahead and call up this \namendment so it can be considered as part of this legislation.\n  The next amendment I wanted to discuss briefly is No. 4266, regarding \nCoast Guard funding.\n  This amendment looks around the corner, or beyond the horizon a \nlittle bit, at a problem that is likely to hit us in the future. Under \nthe Oil Pollution Act, if BP denies the claim for damages associated \nwith the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the rejected claimant has the \nright to file a claim with the Federal Government through the National \nPollution Funds Center. I can see a virtual inevitability that this \nwill occur and perhaps occur reasonably soon. Then the National \nPollution Funds Center could find itself swamped with claims. They do \nnot have adequate funds in their annual appropriation to deal with it.\n  The amendment simply allows them, for this one incident, to access \nfurther appropriations for these administrative costs. I think it is \nprudent for us to do this in light of what may well transpire in the \nreasonably near future.\n  The third amendment I want to talk about deals with the abandoned \nmine lands legislation we have on the books. I added Senator Bunning as \na cosponsor. It is amendment No. 4187.\n  This amendment would clarify that certain funds provided to the \nStates under the Abandoned Mine Lands Program, administered by the \nDepartment of the Interior, could be used for two purposes: No. 1, for \nhigh-priority noncoal reclamation as well as coal reclamation; and, \nsecond, for State set-aside programs for the remediation of acid line \ndrainage. The funds involved are those that have accrued to the States \nunder the formula in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act but \nhad not been previously appropriated. Use of these funds for noncoal \nreclamation and acid mine drainage had been allowed prior to amendments \nmade by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. There was no intent \nat that time to change that result.\n  However, in 2007, the Solicitor in the Department of the Interior \ninterpreted the amendments that we adopted in 2006 as limiting the \nability of States to use these funds under the Abandoned Mine Lands \nProgram for these purposes.\n  With respect to the use of funds for noncoal reclamation, while \nactivities on noncoal sites have consumed a relatively insignificant \nportion of the funding provided for the overall AML Program, use of \ntargeted funds for high-priority noncoal abandoned mines in the West is \nessential in terms of public health and safety.\n  With respect to the use of funds for acid mine drainage, allowing the \nfunds to again be used for State set-aside programs for remediation of \nacid mine drainage has considerable benefits in terms of the \nenvironment and water quality, particularly in Appalachian States such \nas Kentucky and Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\n  This amendment does not score. It does not increase any funding to \nthe States or to the tribes. It simply clarifies that States have the \nflexibility to use AML funds for these two uses, as was the case prior \nto the 2006 amendments, and at the appropriate time I will offer that \namendment as well.\n  Let me discuss one other amendment. I have two other amendments I \nwant to discuss. The first is amendment No. 4267.\n  The amendment I have mentioned contains a number of process \nimprovements to help the DOE Loan Guarantee Program to operate more \nefficiently and effectively. I am pleased to have Senators Murkowski \nand Shaheen as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The amendment does six important things:\n  No. 1, it provides the flexibility to allow applicants to pay a \nportion of the credit subsidy cost, in concert with the use of \nappropriations for other parts of the cost. This feature will allow us \nto make more effective use of the appropriations provided to the \nprogram.\n  No. 2, it drops the requirement for expensive third-party credit \nreports in cases where the projects are small and are being proposed by \nstart-up firms, which generally do not have a credit rating. The \nDepartment would treat these firms as having the lowest credit rating, \nwhich is what start-up firms\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\nwithout a balance sheet generally have in any case.\n  No. 3, it provides enhanced hiring authorities for the DOE loan \nguarantee office and for professional advisors to help analyze projects \nbeing proposed for support through the program and the related advanced \nvehicle technology loan guarantee program.\n  No. 4, it fixes a glitch in DOE's rules for the loan guarantee \nprogram that prevents a project being guaranteed from being located on \nmore than one site.\n  No. 5, the amendment also removes a requirement that keeps an \napplicant from submitting more than one application to the program.\n  No. 6, finally, the amendment allows the loan guarantee appropriation \nmade as part of the Recovery Act to be used for energy efficiency \nprojects, in addition to renewable energy and electricity transmission \nprojects.\n  These proposed changes have substantial bipartisan and bicameral \nsupport. They do not add to the score of this bill, but will greatly \nhelp move the loan guarantee program forward.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The final amendment I want to speak briefly about is amendment No. \n4268.\n  Amendment No. 4268 contains an important process improvement to help \nthe Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program to operate more \nefficiently and effectively. It sets a 30-day limit for dealing with or \nreviewing loan guarantee applications by the Office of Management and \nBudget once they are approved for conditional commitments by the \nDepartment of Energy. The time consumed by OMB reviews and the delays \nthis has engendered in the program have been a substantial impediment \nto the effective functioning of the program.\n  This amendment would provide for a much greater degree of certainty \nand clarity in the operation of the program.\n  Again, I am pleased to have Senator Murkowski as a cosponsor of the \namendment. I hope we can adopt it as part of this legislation.\n  I will wait until I am advised by the floor managers that it is \nappropriate to call up these amendments, and at that time I will hope \nto be able to do so. I hope we can get the necessary support to adopt \nthe amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to speak today on an amendment \nI filed, amendment No. 4222, which I hope at the appropriate time will \nbe called up on my behalf. Actually, I suggest and hope this will \nbecome a part of the managers' package.\n  It is a relatively simple amendment, but I think it is very important \nin terms of clarifying the role of the Congress versus the role of the \nexecutive branch in a lot of decisionmaking.\n  Last October, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs announced his \nintention to establish a presumption of service connection for three \nmedical conditions, including ischemic heart disease, for veterans who \nwere exposed to Agent Orange. He stated this rulemaking was necessary \nas a result of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, which requires the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to promulgate regulations establishing a \npresumption of service connection once he finds a positive association \nof exposure to herbicides in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent \ndevelopment of any particular disease.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs made a request on the basis of \nthis rulemaking. It is contained in this supplemental. It is an amount \nof about $13.6 billion for the service connection, principally of \ncoronary heart disease, to Agent Orange in Vietnam.\n  I think we need to proceed very carefully in terms of our role in the \nCongress in examining this presumption. It is not yet official policy \nin the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is still in the review \nprocess. The Congress is going to have 60 days beginning at some point \nthis summer to examine this decision that General Shinseki made.\n  My amendment basically says: We should fence this money. And I think \nit is appropriate that, no pun intended, the Appropriations Committee \nhonor the request of the DVA in this issue. But we should fence this \nmoney until the review process is complete.\n  This is the difficulty here. When the Agent Orange legislation was \npassed in 1991, it created two different sorts of presumptions. The \nfirst was that everyone who had been in Vietnam, everyone who had \nserved in Vietnam, was presumed to have been exposed to Agent Orange. I \nwould say, as a committee counsel in the House of Representatives more \nthan 30 years ago, I counseled the Agent Orange hearings. There were \nfour Agent Orange hearings. That was a very generous assumption that \nwas made in this law, to say that everyone who was in Vietnam was, in \nfact, exposed to Agent Orange.\n  We do want to take care of those who were. We do want to take care of \nour veterans who served and who incurred disabilities or diseases as a \nresult of that service.\n  The second presumption in this legislation was that, as a matter of \nexecutive discretion, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs could then look \nat information and decide which diseases or medical conditions should \nbe also presumed to have resulted from exposure to Agent Orange.\n  So, first, everyone who served in Vietnam is assumed to have been \nexposed to Agent Orange, and then certain medical conditions are \ndetermined so that the presumption is they were the result of Agent \nOrange exposure.\n  In 2001, it was decided that type 2 diabetes was the result of Agent \nOrange exposure. It was decided by the then-Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs. By 2009, more than 263,000 Vietnam veterans were receiving \ndisability compensation related to this decision. That is 10 percent of \neveryone who went to Vietnam, has been service connected, through this \nAgent Orange bill, with respect to type 2 diabetes.\n  The estimates we would have on coronary heart disease are much \nhigher. We are talking about the potential, at a minimum, of spending \n$31 billion in the next 10 years as a result of this presumptive \nservice connection, and I must say I have not had the opportunity, as a \nmember of the Veterans' Committee, to hear from the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs as to how he made this connection.\n  Looking at the review chart, there was a category called ``level of \nconnection.'' In other words, when you take the scientific information \nand you apply it to this condition, what is the level of connection? \nFor instance, when they looked at B-cell leukemia, there was sufficient \nevidence. That was a category.\n  When we are looking at coronary heart disease, it is ``limited or \nsuggestive evidence.'' I do not know what that means. But what I wish \nto say is that we have an obligation in the Congress, A, to make sure \nwe take care of our veterans but, B, that we also hold the executive \nbranch to some sort of accountable standard.\n  That accountable standard will be occurring over the next couple of \nmonths. I think it is appropriate in this particular supplemental that \nwe mark this--it is either $13.4 billion or $13.6 billion for this \nincrease in the service connection, that we mark this as ``not to be \nspent'' until we can clarify this issue.\n  This is not in any way an issue as to whether we support our \nveterans. I take a back seat to no one in my concern for our veterans. \nI have spent my entire adult life one way or the other involved in \nveterans law. But I do think we need to have practical, proper \nprocedures, and I do believe that the executive branch, whether it is \nthe EPA or the State Department or the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nneeds to be held to an accountable standard.\n  With that, I hope very much that we can get this amendment as a part \nof the managers' package. As the issue resolves itself, we can decide \nthe appropriate level of funding that will go to the connection between \nmedical conditions and exposure to Agent Orange.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Senate Daily Digest proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about important \nfunding in the supplemental appropriations act that will help my State \nof Rhode Island recover and rebuild from the recent devastating flood \nwhich left homes destroyed, businesses closed, and thousands and \nthousands out of work. The help in this bill is very important to us. \nResidents of our Ocean State were in a tough spot long before the rain \nstarted to fall. Our economy had been in severe recession for 28 \nmonths. Unemployment has remained over 12 percent, putting us in the \ntop 5 States for unemployment for 12 months. Homelessness is on the \nrise. We are in the top 10 States for foreclosures, and our State \nbudget is simply a disaster. The historic back-to-back floods in March \nhit an already hard-hit State. Rhode Island saw more rain during this \ndisaster than any month on record ever, over 16 inches, with over 5 \ninches of rain falling on March 30 alone.\n  The devastation wrought by these storms exceeds anything in living \nmemory. Meteorologists who have reviewed it are calling this the most \ndamaging storm to hit the Ocean State since 1815. It is too soon to \nestimate the full economic impact of the March flooding, but it is \nclear that the economic damage to Rhode Island will be prolonged and \nsevere. The peak storms of March 30 and 31 brought commerce not only in \nRhode Island but in the region to a halt. Route I-95, the main artery \nthat connects the major cities of New England and the middle Atlantic \nStates, was closed for 2 full days. It flooded out following a surge of \nthe Pawtuxet River. The river, which has a flood level of 9 feet, \ncrested at its all-time high, almost 21 feet, on March 31.\n  It is hard to overstate the importance of I-95 to Rhode Island's \neconomy because not only is it a regional artery, it is probably the \nsingle most heavily traveled local commuter and commercial artery for \nour State. Similarly, even Amtrak service through Rhode Island was \nsuspended for 5 days due to the flooding out of the Amtrak rails.\n  At the height of the rains, Providence Street, a main road in West \nWarwick, looked more like a river than a road. This picture shows local \nemergency workers rescuing people who have been flooded into their \nhomes and apartments, driving them through the flood in a boat with jet \nskis. It is not often that one sees local emergency workers driving \ndown the roads of Rhode Island towns on boats and jet skis. But that is \nwhat it took to get residents out who had been trapped by rising flood \nwaters.\n  A few days later, this was the scene at Angelo Padula & Sons auto \nsalvage yard in West Warwick. The waters have receded, but we can \nclearly see the damage left behind. All of these cars were covered and \nfilled with water. We can see the mud from the river heaped all over \nthem. I don't know whether it can be seen on television, but hanging in \nthe fencing is leaves and grass and other bits of trash, because the \nriver was over all of this. This fence was a strainer, picking leaves, \ntrash, and other debris out of the flow. This was completely under \nwater when the river was at its height. When it came back, it left the \ndevastation of this auto and salvage yard. According to local news \nreports, the floods destroyed 1,200 cars in this salvage yard as well \nas 16 cars in a sales lot and thousands of dollars worth of car parts. \nThe damage to the surrounding neighborhood and the other businesses \nnear Councilman Padula's yard was equally severe and devastating.\n  This legislation will enable the Army Corps of Engineers to examine \nthe factors that led to the severe flooding in our State. It will help \nRhode Island apply effective mitigation measures to forecast the risk \nof and prevent future flooding. Our communities are now hesitant to \nrebuild for fear of another flood. We must take steps to prevent a \ndisaster such as this from happening again. People have to know where \nthe danger area is. When you get two back-to-back floods in a matter of \nweeks that both blow through the 100-year flood line, one of which \nblows through the 500-year flood line in places, something is wrong \nwith the measurement of the flood risk. The people who have been \nsubjected to these floods know that. As one local business owner said \nin a recent report on WRNI, our local NPR station: What happens if it \nfloods again in 2 months?\n  We need this knowledge. We need the support from the Army Corps to \nget in there and tell us what the real present flood risk is. Clearly, \nthe previous estimates were badly wrong.\n  This bill also contains funding for community development block \ngrants and economic development assistance grants for long-term \nrecovery efforts that will help restore and rebuild Rhode Island \ncommunities. As I traveled around the State for days following the \nflood, the sheer magnitude of the damage was unprecedented. The Federal \nresponse came quickly. The President issued a disaster declaration \nalmost immediately. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano was on the \nground within days. FEMA quickly came in to set up emergency assistance \ncenters and begin processing disaster assistance applications. They set \nup offices all across the State. They did a phenomenal job of getting \npeople into the State, of reaching out across the State and making sure \nthey were widely spread and available to victims of the flood. So far \nFEMA has processed more than 25,000 claims and, in a State of a million \npeople, that is a big number. I thank them for their hard work. Of \ncourse, FEMA delivers a particular specified product that is defined by \nlaw and regulation. They haven't been able to help everyone. People \nhave fallen through the cracks, and so many Rhode Islanders remain \nfrustrated.\n  I recently held one of my community dinners in Cranston for people to \ncome and ask questions about flood aid. I heard from a number of people \nwho feel as though they have fallen through the cracks in the wake of \nthis disaster or feel that the help they have received is not enough.\n  Small business owners, for instance, have been limited to receiving \nlow-interest loans from the SBA to recover from their flood damage. But \nfor many of the small businesses which were already struggling through \nthe terrible economy I described before the floods even came, the \nprospect of taking on more debt in order to repair flood damage is not \nfeasible. They need grant support.\n  What is important about this legislation is that CDBG and EDA will \nallow the local municipalities to design appropriate programs to catch \nthe people who were not those 25,000 satisfied customers of FEMA but \nare the people who, because of the nature of the program and the nature \nof their flood damage somehow managed to fall through the cracks.\n  For our towns and cities in Rhode Island, again, this could not have \ncome at a worse time. I have already shown you some of the damage that \nwas sustained in West Warwick. That is a town that was already \nexperiencing hard economic times. Now the town's already stretched \nbudget has been pushed to the limit by the overtime shifts and the \nemergency repairs and all of the extra effort required to deal with the \nflood and its aftermath. By lowering the State and municipal cost share \nfrom 25 percent to 10 percent, this appropriations package will be a \nbig relief to the people of West Warwick. Frankly, the city of West \nWarwick and others will have the ability now to design packages to help \ntheir residents and their small businesses that were not adequately \ncompensated by FEMA to try to get them back on their feet. So it is two \ngood things for the municipalities: It is a reduction from 25 percent \nto 10 percent in their share, and it is an opportunity to create a plan \nthat will help serve their constituents.\n  In Cumberland, RI, Hope Global, one of the town's largest employers, \nwas completely washed out by the flood. This is a picture of Hope \nGlobal I have in the Chamber. This is their loading dock. Normally, \nthere would be no water there at all. There would only be a parking lot \nthere, and a truck would back up to this level. This would be several \nfeet off the ground. As it was, I floated through those loading docks \nin an inflatable boat at Hope Global.\n  They are an enterprising company. Cheryl Merchant, who is their CEO, \nis an astonishing woman. She had all of the equipment in that factory \njacked up on temporary pallets of one kind or another, so when the \nflood came in, it did not damage the machinery because it had been \njacked up. When the floodwater went back down, they put the machinery \nback down on the ground. They got their electricity going again. They \nplugged back in, and they were\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nrunning in no time. Before their executive offices were cleaned up, \nwhile everything was still a wreck, the machinery was already spinning \nand the Rhode Islanders at Hope Global were already back at work. That \nwas a great thing. But now they face the problem of, do we stay? Should \nwe go on? Should we find a location where we do not face this kind of a \nrisk?\n  One of the important decisions Hope Global needs us to make is to \nreduce the threat of future flood damage. Can there be a berm that \nprotects them from the river overflowing, as it did here? They would \nlike to see that berm constructed along the riverbank for their \nprotection, and we are hopeful the funding in this appropriations \npackage will help Cumberland to assist the Army Corps in getting that \ndone quickly.\n  I will close by pointing out that the motto on the Rhode Island State \nflag is ``hope.'' That is our symbol. That is the phrase, the word that \nhas seen us through tough times in the past. The flooding has destroyed \nhomes. It has closed businesses. It has put careers on hold. But the \npeople of Rhode Island have stood up remarkably well. However, the job \nof rebuilding roads, rebuilding bridges, rebuilding sewage treatment \nplants, rebuilding public facilities, homes, and businesses is a \ncolossal and daunting task for a State already 28 months into severe \nrecession. Rhode Islanders are a resilient bunch. We will recover and \nrebuild. But this will certainly help us to get there.\n  Since this appropriations package was passed unanimously in \ncommittee, I hope for quick passage on the floor.\n  I see the very distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Cochran of Mississippi, who represents a State that \nhas seen its own share of flooding and difficulty recently. I know how \nsympathetic he is to our concerns and how effectively and helpfully he \nhas worked with Jack Reed, my senior Senator, who is also on the \nAppropriations Committee, who has worked to see that this gets done. So \nI want to take this moment, as I conclude my remarks, to pass on my \ngratitude to the chairman, Senator Inouye; the ranking member, the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran; and my senior \nSenator, Jack Reed, for all of their work in pushing this funding \nthrough the Appropriations Committee to where it is now on the floor. \nOur State is lucky to have had their support, and I look forward to \ncontinuing my work with Senator Reed to make sure Rhode Island \nrebuilds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4174\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask for regular order with regard to \nthe Reid amendment No. 4174.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4289 to Amendment No. 4174\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I offer a second-degree amendment which \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself, \n     Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Kaufman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4289 to amendment No. 4174.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require oil polluters to pay the full cost of oil spills)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n                      TITLE V--OIL SPILL LIABILITY\n\n     SEC. 5001. REMOVAL OF LIMITS ON LIABILITY FOR OFFSHORE \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1004(a)(3) of the Oil Pollution \n     Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2704(a)(3)) is amended by striking \n     ``plus $75,000,000'' and inserting ``and the liability of the \n     responsible party under section 1002''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     takes effect on April 15, 2010.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the amendment I rise to offer today as a \nsecond-degree will do something several of my colleagues and I have \nbeen seeking to do on the floor for the last 2 weeks or so; that is, to \nmake absolutely certain that big oil polluters pay for oilspills and \nnot the taxpayers--not fishermen, not small business owners, not \ncoastal communities, not States, not municipalities.\n  This amendment would eliminate the artificially low liability cap \nthat is currently in place--a cap that is currently set at $75 \nmillion--which means companies such as BP are only on the hook legally \nfor less than 1 day's profits. BP made nearly $6 billion in 3 months of \nthis year in profits--not proceeds, profits. That comes out to about \n$94 million a day. So the present liability cap--the cap that says, \nyes, you have to be responsible for all the cleanup, all of the \nefforts, but to the extent you have damaged shrimp fishermen, \ncommercial fishermen, to the extent you have damaged coastal \ncommunities--to all of that extent--there is a $75 million limit. Well, \nif we let that stand, that would be less than 1 day's profit for BP. So \nwe want to make sure they are legally on the hook and their spill, \nwhich wreaks complete economic devastation on small business and local \ncommunities and our environment that could very well last for years to \ncome, does not allow them to get away with not being fully responsible.\n\n  I believe yesterday we had a big day in the Senate in this debate \nabout liability caps for oil companies that spill. First, the \nadministration finally clarified. It had originally said we believe the \ncap should be lifted, but it had not quantified as to what that should \nbe. Yesterday the administration clarified its position to say it will \nsupport unlimited liability for damages caused by future spills in deep \nwaters. Then several of my Republican colleagues came to the floor of \nthe Senate to support unlimited liability for damages caused by this \nparticular spill, not a broader range. I think that is progress.\n  We certainly embrace the fact that for this and any potential future \nspill there should be unlimited damages. So from when I started this \neffort with several of my colleagues, including Senator Nelson, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Murray, and others, we have come from opposition to \nlifting the cap, to a determined amount, to now having an understanding \nthat unlimited liability certainly in a spill of this nature should, in \nfact, take place.\n  However, we cannot depend on BP's good word or BP's statements. There \nis no consent judgment. There is no written guarantee. We need to make \nsure those communities within the gulf and that we as a nation and as \ntaxpayers do not have to pay for BP or any other responsible party.\n  So it is encouraging to see colleagues coming around to see it the \nway I and 20 Senate cosponsors of my bill are supporting, but we still \nhave a bit of a ways to go. We all should agree all oil companies \nshould pay for all damages caused by spills from offshore facilities, \ncertainly if they are doing deepwater drilling, certainly if they \ncreate the risk; and if that risk ultimately ends in damage, we should \nbe able to universally agree they should be responsible for the \nliability. But we should not depend upon doing that just when an oil \ncompany makes statements they promise to pay; not just when the company \nis so big it can pay with a few weeks' worth of profits. We need to \nmake sure people whose livelihoods are ruined by an oilspill are \nprotected no matter what. We need to ensure big oil companies are held \naccountable no matter what.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment to remove the cap on \nliability completely so we can truly hold oil companies accountable for \nall of their potential damages.\n  I have heard some people referring to keeping the oil companies \nresponsible, such as BP, as un-American--un-American--to hold a \nmultibillion-dollar corporation accountable for the very disaster it \ncreated. I think it is un-American not to be able to pursue such a \ncorporation for the purposes of holding them accountable for the \ndisaster they have created to the economic well-\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\nbeing of commercial fishermen, shrimp fishermen, seafood processing \nplants, coastal communities, wetlands, and a whole host of other \nconsequences that we have.\n  This is a chance to show if we are going to stand up with big oil or \nwith small businesses, including fisheries and coastal communities, \nwhether we are going to stand up with multibillion-dollar corporations \nor with the taxpayers of this country so they have no liability \nwhatsoever. I think the choice is pretty clear.\n  I hope everyone in our Chamber will do the right thing, to hold big \noil accountable for the damages they have caused. I hope our colleagues \nwill join us in this effort. I am truly pleased to see there is a \nmovement in this direction. I hope we can make it a bipartisan \nmovement. I think the American people are seeing that regardless of \nwhat BP ends up committing to pay or what they don't commit to pay, \nwhen they came before the Energy Committee and the executives were \nthere and they were asked what are all the legitimate claims, they \nequivocated on a series of answers: Well, is this a legitimate claim? \nIs this a legitimate claim? Is this a legitimate claim? They \nequivocated on all of that.\n  When the three different entities--BP, Transocean, and Halliburton, \nall of whom may be responsible parties--had the opportunity, they all \ndid the finger-pointing at the other one. That does not give me a sense \nof security or a guarantee that this enormous consequence to our \nenvironment and to our economy is going to be taken care of by the \nwords of those who both shift blame and equivocate on their \nresponsibility. I think we have clearly learned there obviously is no \nsuch thing as a rig that is too safe to spill, and there should be no \nlegal wiggle room for oil companies that devastate coastal businesses \nand communities now or in the future.\n  This spill, if nothing else, tragedy that it is, should serve as a \nrallying cry for holding big oil responsible for the damage it has \ncaused. That is our choice. That is our opportunity. I urge that is the \nfierce urgency of now, as we look at that live feed of that oil gushing \nevery day for now well over a month. It is our fiduciary duty to the \ntaxpayers of this country. It is our duty to the next generation of \nAmericans in this country to make sure the company and companies that \ncreated this set of circumstances and these enormous damages are fully \nliable for it. That is the opportunity we have by virtue of this \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will embrace the opportunity and live up to \nthose responsibilities.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to talk about both the \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator McCain, to provide funding \nfor members of the National Guard to be deployed to the border, our \nsouthern border with Mexico, for the purpose of better border security, \nas well as the amendment which I have offered as a second-degree \namendment to the Cornyn amendment which provides funding for Operation \nStreamline, which is the process by which people who are apprehended \ncrossing the border illegally are sent to jail for a couple of weeks as \na deterrent so that they then don't want to cross in the future because \nthey know they are going to be in jail rather than working someplace \nfor the money they came to work for.\n  Just to explain one thing: when there is a member of the majority on \nthe Senate floor, I will ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment \nwith a technical modification. But the amendment is the same. What it \ndoes is to provide the sum of $200 million for additional funding for \nmultiagency law enforcement initiatives--that is the way they are \ndescribed--for the Tucson sector of the border, and that is roughly the \neastern half of the Arizona border with Mexico.\n  Mr. President, $155 million of that would be available for the \nDepartment of Justice for the purpose of hiring additional deputy \nmarshals, constructing permanent detention space, and other related \nneeds of the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, \nthen $45 million available to the judiciary for courthouse renovation \nand administrative support, including judges and court clerks.\n  This is offset, and the emergency designation would be appended to it \nas the modification I will submit. The purpose of this is to enable the \nBorder Patrol and the Department of Justice, when illegal immigrants \nare apprehended crossing the border, to present them to court. They are \nrepresented, and they can enter a plea or they can waive further \nproceedings. For those who, in fact, are found to have crossed the \nborder illegally, they can be sent to jail. Ordinarily, if it is the \nfirst time, it is a 2-week sentence. If they have done it repeated \ntimes, it can be 30 days or it may be that some will serve 60 days. I \nam not sure.\n  The point is, where this has been done, for everybody who crosses the \nborder--with some exceptions--for almost everybody who cross illegally, \nit has created a very effective deterrent to crossing. It becomes \napparent to people who are trying to cross in that particular vicinity \nthat if they do, and they are apprehended, they are going to jail.\n  About 17 percent of the people who come across illegally are \ncriminals, wanted for crimes in this country, and obviously they don't \nwant to go to jail. For the other 83 percent, roughly, those are people \ncoming here to work. They cannot work and make money if they are in \njail. They cannot send money back to family in Mexico or El Salvador or \nwherever it might be, so they, too, want to avoid this result.\n  The effect of this in the Yuma sector of the border--which is one of \nthe two sectors, Del Rio, TX, being the other--where it is fully \nimplemented, is that there is virtually no illegal immigration \nattempted in that sector of the border anymore. There are effective \nfences--about 11 miles of double fencing--and they have sufficient \nBorder Patrol agents in the area.\n  There are some other factors for the reduction of illegal immigration \nin that sector. In the last 5 years, the apprehension has declined from \n18,500 down to about 5,000-some--a 94-percent decrease. The head of the \nBorder Patrol and others tell me one of the primary reasons for that \nreduction is this operation streamlining--the sure knowledge if they \ncross into that sector, they are going to jail. If we can provide that \nsame kind of deterrence in the Tucson sector, where about 50 percent of \nall illegal immigrants are crossing into the United States from Mexico, \nthen we would have gone a long way toward securing the border. \nCertainly, in Arizona we would have substantially eliminated illegal \nimmigration in the State.\n  If we add to that the amendment of Senator McCain, which would \nprovide the funding for deploying National Guard on the border, I think \nwe can go a long way toward securing the border in a relatively short \nperiod of time. So when the President has said he agrees with us that \nwe need to secure the border, and he even proposed some funding or some \nNational Guard troops on the border, I think this is a recognition that \nit is the right way to go.\n  I will make two quick points about Senator McCain's amendment. First, \nthe President has proposed far fewer numbers than Senator McCain has \nproposed, which is a total of 6,000 National Guard, or 3,000 on the \nArizona border. We believe it will take that many in order to \naccomplish the goal. The President's numbers are far fewer. It is \nunclear from the lack of detail in this proposal, but it appears those \nwill not be literal boots on the ground but, rather, these National \nGuard troops will be there for the purpose of training and for \nadministrative work, investigative work, and will, for the most part, \nbe back from the border and not actually engaged in the work at the \nborder itself.\n  The importance of that is we are told--at least anecdotally--the one \nthing the people who are coming across the border illegally fear more \nthan anything else is National Guard troops. Border Patrol, they don't \nlike them.\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\nThey don't like a county sheriff or anybody else, but when it comes to \nthe National Guard, they want to avoid them. So this represents a real \ndeterrent.\n  The second thing I want to say is, there is a letter from the \nNational Security Adviser and John Brennan, the President's \nintelligence adviser, contending that the McCain amendment is an \ninterference in the Commander in Chief's responsibilities because it \npurports to order National Guard troops to the border.\n  I want to make it clear that is not true. This appears to be another \ncase of somebody in the administration spouting off about a law they \nhave not read. In this case, it is the McCain amendment. It is all on \none page. It is very easy. It says--by the way, remember, this is an \nappropriations bill we have, a supplemental appropriations bill. We are \nappropriating money. That is all the McCain-Kyl-Hutchison-Cornyn \namendment does.\n  It says:\n\n       Additional Amount [that refers to money]--For an additional \n     amount under this chapter for the deployment of not fewer \n     than 6,000 National Guard personnel to perform operations and \n     missions under section 502(f) of title 32 United States Code, \n     in the States along the southern land border of the United \n     States for the purposes of assisting U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection in securing such border, $250 million.\n\n  Then there is the offsetting rescission. It doesn't order National \nGuard troops to the border at all. It simply provides $250 million of \nadditional funding for the purpose of the Guard, to the extent, \nobviously, or up to or fewer than 6,000 troops on the border. So it \ndoesn't order anybody, doesn't interfere with the Commander in Chief's \nresponsibilities.\n  For that reason, I hope when we have an opportunity to vote on this \namendment--and I think one of the questions I want to ask my colleagues \nwith regard to this vote is, when we vote and support the McCain \namendment for funding for the National Guard, the Kyl amendment, which \nsupports Operation Streamline, and the Cornyn amendment, which he will \nsoon describe--the key is to get a vote.\n  It is now 20 minutes until 4. Cloture has been filed on this bill. It \nwill ripen tomorrow morning and, presumably, we will have a vote. The \nquestion is, Will we have a vote on these amendments? Are we being \nslow-rolled?\n  I hope a member of the majority can come to the floor so we can ask, \nAre we going to get votes on our amendments? They are in order. They \nare not going to be out of order, from the Parliamentarian. They will \nprovide funding for something all of us agree we need to do, and the \nPresident also agreed we need some funding, in any event.\n  The bottom line is, if we don't vote today on these and cloture \nripens, this body will never have had an opportunity to express itself \non this issue. What I want to do is, when the majority arrives, ask \nunanimous consent that we set these amendments for a vote so we can \nvote.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator--and we now have both \ndistinguished Senators from Arizona on the Senate floor--is he aware of \na new poll that came out today--CNN, I believe--that said nearly 9 out \nof every 10 Americans in this poll support putting more Border Patrol \nand Federal law enforcement agents on the border because of border \nsecurity?\n  This isn't just something we thought was a good idea. It looks as \nthough the American people recognize not only the incipient violence in \nMexico and the spillover effect here but our inability to protect \nourselves from the organized criminal activity of smuggling drugs, \nweapons, and people. Is that the Senator's experience, that this is the \nsort of thing that has broad public acceptance?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yes, I do think it has broad acceptance. I \nwasn't aware of this particular poll. I will ask my colleague from \nArizona about this because he is very much aware of the public \nsentiment on this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be included in \nthe colloquy with the other Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will respond to the Senator from Texas, and I thank \nhim. We who are from border States have perhaps a better understanding \nof the violence--the dramatically increased violence over the last \nseveral years. In the last 3 years, 22,000 Mexican citizens have been \nmurdered in this struggle between the drug cartels and the Mexican \nGovernment. It is the worst kind of brutality: people being beheaded, \nbodies hanged from the overpasses. I think it was on the Mexican side \nof the Texas border the other day. There was a wedding--if the Senator \nrecalls--and the drug cartel people went in and took the groom, the \nbrother, and nephew out and murdered them. That brutality and violence, \nwe all know, is spilling over the border. I believe three American \ncitizens were murdered in Juarez--who were coming back from Juarez.\n  So the violence and the connection between human smuggling and drug \ncartels now is incredibly intertwined. They use the same routes, the \nsame intelligence, the same sophisticated communications equipment. It \nis a threat to our security. That is why we Senators have asked for the \nGuard to be sent to the border.\n  What happened yesterday in what was clearly a PR stunt, the President \nannounced 1,200 National Guard to the border. Now we find out they are \ngoing to do desk jobs. One of the things we have found out is that the \npresence of the uniformed Americans on the border has a significant \neffect on the drug cartels because the only threat they feel from \nMexico is from the Mexican Army because of the terrible corruption that \nexists.\n  These people who have come across the Nogales border into Tucson and \nPhoenix have been distributed nationwide. People all over America are \nbeginning to appreciate--according to the polling number the Senator \nfrom Texas pointed out--the American people are beginning to understand \nthat our broken borders affect all of America. This violence is \nincreasing, certainly, on that side of the border. The drug cartels \nmake--the number I hear is as high as $65 billion a year. When I tell \npeople we intercepted, in the Tucson sector alone, over 1.2 million \npounds of marijuana, people don't believe it. When we tell them we \nintercepted 241,000 illegal immigrants--and we figure that 4 to 5 to 1 \ncrossed our border to Tucson illegally--over 1 million people--what \ndoes the President do? He said he is going to send 1,200 troops to the \nborder. We need 6,000. We need 3,000 for the border and 3,000 for the \nArizona border. That is what we hear from the people who are enforcing \nthe law.\n  This is a national security issue. It is something that all Americans \nare now more and more aware of and are supporting. I hope the \nadministration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nalso are being affected by this will understand we need to secure the \nborders first. Then we can work out an orderly system to address the \nresults of our failure to secure the border.\n  I ask my friend and colleague from Arizona, what would happen if we \nenacted comprehensive reform and didn't secure the border?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I might respond by noting that my colleague \nfrom Arizona likes to talk about exactly what would happen. When \nPresident Reagan did exactly that, and the promise was to secure the \nborder with amnesty for 3 million illegal immigrants, the amnesty was \ngranted, but the border was not secure. I know there is an argument on \nthe other side that, well, if we secure the border, then some people \nwill not want to do comprehensive reform because they would not have \nany incentive to do so anymore.\n  I don't think that is right. I think there would be more of an \nincentive once we do secure the border. In any event, we certainly \nshould not hold securing the border hostage to passing some law in the \nfuture. That is our obligation and the President's obligation \nirrespective of what other laws we pass.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Texas this: There is another \nimportant point. There is the belief that we can't secure our borders, \nthat there is just going to be an unending flow of illegal immigrants \ninto this country. I ask my friend from Texas, isn't it true that in at \nleast parts of Texas, with the combination of surveillance, fencing, \nand proper staffing, there has been basically a secure border?\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator is absolutely right. Where there is a \ncombination or layered approach to dealing\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\nwith illegal immigration, there have been great successes, including an \neffort to use prosecution of people for crossing and incarcerating them \nfor a short period of time, which acts as a further deterrent.\n  The Senator raises another important point. While I certainly support \nhis effort to try to get sufficient National Guard on the border, 1,200 \nwon't cut it, not with a 2,000-mile border. We need more boots on the \nground. We need to also make sure we support our local and State law \nenforcement people who are standing in the gap in the short term. That \nis why I appreciate the Senators' support on the other amendment we \nhope to vote on. We need the Southwest border task force to deal with \nthese high-intensity drug trafficking programs. We also need to make \nsure we use the latest technology.\n  The distinguished Senator is the ranking member on the Armed Services \nCommittee. He is well aware of the use of the military unmanned aerial \nvehicles and, I believe--and I think he would agree with me--they could \nbe used as a good effect, as a multiplier effect for the Border Patrol \nand National Guard there, something that could be used for training \npurposes for the National Guard, who have had experience using those in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  Finally, we need not only Border Patrol and National Guard, we need \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. These are the people who actually catch \nthe guns that are bought in bulk through straw purchasers and brought \nacross the border that are used by the cartels. All of these Federal \nagencies--from ICE, CBP, DEA, ATF--all of them represent additional \nboots on the ground that could be used to help secure our border.\n  I appreciate the support both Arizona Senators have given, as well as \nSenator Hutchison, who is a cosponsor. But we need a permanent \nsolution, not a temporary Band-Aid which I believe the President's \nproposal represents.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, bringing the issue back to my home State \nof Arizona, I ask my friend, Senator Kyl, who has, along with me, \ntraveled extensively to the southern part of our State, many of the \nresidents of the southern part of our State, particularly those who are \nranchers who live near the border, basically do not have a secure \nexistence. They have people crossing their property illegally. They \nhave home invasions. They have wildlife refuges on the border being \ntrashed because of the overwhelming human traffic and the garbage and \nthe items that are left behind. I have talked with ranchers' wives who \nsaid they could not leave their children at the bus stop.\n  I want to be very clear. Many of these illegal immigrants are just \npeople who want to come and get a job. But the change over the last few \nyears is that they are escorted by these coyotes who are also \nassociated with the drug cartels who are amongst the most cruel and \ninhuman people in the world.\n  When people criticize the law in Arizona as being discriminatory, \nwhere is their concern for the individuals who are being escorted by \nthese coyotes who inflict on them the worst abuses, terrible abuses? \nThey bring them to Phoenix. Phoenix is the No. 2 kidnaping capital in \nthe world. No. 1, Mexico City. No. 2, Phoenix, AZ. Can my colleagues \nunderstand why the people of Phoenix are upset?\n  They bring them to these drop houses, they jam them into these homes, \nand they hold them for ransom. Then once they get the money, sometimes \nthey let them go, sometimes they ask for more money. In the meantime, \nthey are suffering under the most inhumane conditions.\n  When the advocates for ``legal immigration'' are up, I say: Where is \nyour compassion for the people who are being so terribly abused that \nthe coyotes are bringing in the most inhumane fashion across our border \nand kept in the most inhumane fashions? Isn't that an argument to \nsecure the border? Isn't that an argument to stop this human \ntrafficking? They are unspeakable things. I will not on the floor of \nthe Senate talk about some of the stories I have heard.\n  We have a situation in the southern part of our State where the \nresidents are living in a state of, if not fear, certainly deep concern \nand insecurity. Then we have this terrible human trafficking tied to \nthe drug traffickers who are committing the most terrible human rights \nabuses.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will respond to my colleague by noting, \nthese are the crime statistics that are never reported. Let's face it, \nthe people who are accused of these crimes cannot go to the police and \nreport what has happened.\n  Again, there is an argument made that crime statistics have actually \ngone down in the last 2 or 3 years. In the cities--the cities of Tucson \nand Phoenix, for example--that may well be true. I don't know. What I \ndo know is this: In the rural ranch areas that my colleague, Senator \nMcCain, speaks of, families who used to have no worries at all, left \nhomes unlocked at night, windows open, and if an occasional illegal \nimmigrant or two came by and needed a sandwich or water, frankly, they \ngot it, now fear for their lives.\n  One of our constituents was killed a couple months ago, a rancher who \nwas beloved in the area. Others have been robbed. There have been \nphysical assaults. They are no longer safe in their homes and in those \nmore rural areas.\n  In the urban areas, I, too, will not describe on the Senate floor \nwhat goes on. If you can imagine large numbers of women and children \nwho are brought across the border by people who have absolutely no \nscruples about committing any crimes whatsoever. They commit rapes and \nleave articles of clothing hanging from trees as a warning to anyone \nwho dares to report it or as a way of bragging about what they have \ndone. The things they do to these people cooped up in the safe houses \nfor weeks on end, as my colleague said, are unspeakable.\n  There are so many reasons to secure the border. But this is one that \nis never spoken of. It bothers me as much as it does my colleague \nbecause we have people who speak of the human rights issues that might \nrelate to an Arizona law enforced by sworn police officers in the city \nof Phoenix and the city of Tucson who, I am quite sure, will do their \njob as professional police officers, and not a word is spoken about the \nkind of situation my colleague and I have described. That bothers us \nsignificantly. It is just one more reason we do need to secure the \nborder, as my colleague said.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4228, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to wait until a member of the majority was \nhere. I ask unanimous consent to modify the second-degree amendment \nthat was offered yesterday, No. 4228.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To appropriate $200,000,000 to increase resources for the \nDepartment of Justice and the Judiciary to address illegal crossings of \n                 the Southwest border, with an offset)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       (k) Operation Streamline.--For an additional amount to \n     fully fund multi-agency law enforcement initiatives that \n     address illegal crossings of the Southwest border, including \n     those in the Tucson Sector, as authorized under title II of \n     division B and title III of division C of Public Law 111-117, \n     $200,000,000, of which--\n       (1) $155,000,000 shall be available for the Department of \n     Justice for--\n       (A) hiring additional Deputy United States Marshals;\n       (B) constructing additional permanent and temporary \n     detention space; and\n       (C) other established and related needs of the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security and the Attorney General; and\n       (2) $45,000,000 shall be available for the Judiciary for--\n       (A) courthouse renovation;\n       (B) administrative support, including hiring additional \n     clerks for each District to process additional criminal \n     cases; and\n       (C) hiring additional judges.\n       (3) The amounts in this subsection are designated as an \n     emergency requirement and are designated to meet emergency \n     needs pursuant to sections 403(a) and 423(b) of S. Con. Res. \n     13 (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for FY 2010.\n       (l) Offsetting Rescission.--On the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the unobligated balance of each amount appropriated \n     or made available under division A of the American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), other than \n     under title X of such division, is hereby rescinded pro rata \n     such that the aggregate amount of such rescissions equals \n     $200,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I may react briefly to the comments of \nthe two Senators from Arizona, whether their concern translates into \nsomething like this: that the people who suffer the most from the \ncurrent illegality and broken immigration system are, for example, a \nyoung woman who is a victim of domestic violence who has nowhere to \nreport that crime because she is afraid of being deported, or the \nworker who earns money believing they have earned their pay but only to \nbe jilted and not paid because the employer realizes they have nowhere \nelse to turn or, as Senator McCain mentioned, the coyotes, as they are \nknown, the human smugglers who care nothing for these individuals as \nhuman beings but they are a commodity they trade in, just like drugs, \nweapons, and people.\n  This is a very real problem. It is true that most of it is not \nreported in the newspaper because people are afraid of being exposed \nbecause of what the consequences might be. But because we live in \nborder States, because we interact with our constituents and see the \nconsequences of the spillover effect of this kind of violence and \nlawlessness, that is why we feel so strongly that these amendments need \na vote, as the Senator said earlier.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will point out another aspect of this \nissue. We are proud in my home State of our Spanish heritage. Spanish \nwas spoken before English was in the State of Arizona. We believe our \nculture and our life and our State have been enriched by the influx of \nHispanic citizens. We want that to continue, but we want it to continue \nlegally. In a broader sense, we want everyone in the world to have an \nopportunity to come to our country legally. If we did secure our \nborder, then everybody has an equal opportunity, rather than it be by \ngeography.\n  Let me point out something, of which I am not sure my colleagues are \ntotally aware. The sophistication of these human smuggling rings and \ndrug cartels is beyond description. They have the latest equipment. \nThey have the latest communications. They have the latest weapons. They \nhave a network of informers and a network, unfortunately, of corruption \nthat is of the highest sophistication. Their operations are extremely \nsophisticated operations which are quite successful. But there are \nareas and measures that have been taken in certain parts of our border \nthat show we can secure our border. What we need is the manpower, the \ntechnology, the assets, and the funding to get our borders secured.\n  The State of Arizona, unfortunately, has become a funnel for this \nillegal human trafficking and drug cartels to the point where it has \nthreatened the security of its average citizens.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand this is a humanitarian issue. \nThis is an issue that cries out for the compassion of all of us so that \nwe can give everyone in the world an opportunity to come to this \ncountry, but also to give our citizens a chance to live lives of \nsecurity that makes them able to enjoy the rights and privileges that \nAmerican citizens everywhere should enjoy, even if they live on our \nsouthern border.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me ask my colleague a question. The \nnumber of National Guard troops that would be funded under his \namendment is 6,000 total. The idea would be that it would fund 3,000 on \nthe Arizona portion of the border and 3,000 wherever they would be \ndeployed in other places on the border. Senator McCain has argued that \nis a number closer to what is needed to do the job the National Guard \ncan do than a number that would be less than one-fourth that much.\n  Would the Senator describe a little bit more the historic levels that \nexisted, for example, during the time our now national Homeland \nSecurity Secretary was the Governor of Arizona, when she was very \nsupportive of the Guard as well, compared to what Senator McCain has \nasked to be funded in his amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, the \nsituation of Secretary Napolitano, former Governor, whom I respect and \nadmire enormously, is a classic example of it is not where you stand, \nit is where you sit because when Secretary Napalitano was Governor of \nArizona, she made fervent pleas for reimbursement for the State of \nArizona for our law enforcement problems dealing with immigration and \nfor 3,000 additional Guard troops to be sent to the border.\n  Senator Kyl and I wrote a letter back on April 9 asking for a \ndecision concerning troops to the border. We still have not received an \nanswer. Perhaps what the President announced yesterday a half hour \nafter discussing the issue with Senator Kyl and me and yet not \nmentioning that decision might be made to send 1,200 troops to the \nborder--you have to laugh. It is in the spirit of bipartisanship. I \nhope in the case of our Secretary of Homeland Security that we could \nsee some restoration of the same zeal she held as Governor of the State \nof Arizona to secure our borders and advocate for the necessary assets \nto achieve that goal.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I recall--and I could be wrong on this--\nthe number that had been deployed to Arizona roughly in 2005 or 2006--I \ndo not recall the exact year--was about 2,600. It was not quite 3,000. \nObviously, we needed everyone we could get.\n  Eventually, a lot of those troops were then deployed to Iraq, I \nbelieve. In any event, we all--the Governor and the rest of us--were \ndistressed when they were finally pulled out. I think 2,600 or \nsomething pretty close to that was the number and that Senator McCain \nbelieves 3,000 would be the appropriate number under the circumstances \nthat exist today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think 3,000. I know we are taking a lot of my \ncolleagues' time. I ask my colleagues and the American people to \nunderstand what we are facing in Arizona. I ask the American people and \nmy colleagues to understand the frustration that the Governor and the \nlegislature of Arizona felt about the conditions we have tried to \ndescribe on the floor of the Senate that exist, that cry out for \nFederal intervention, that they did not receive that assistance from \nthe Federal Government so, therefore, they acted.\n  That law, by the way, upon examination certainly does not call for \nracial profiling. In fact, it expressly prohibits it. I would urge my \ncolleagues to read the law. I have a copy and would be glad to provide \nthem a copy of it.\n  But I hope my colleagues and the American people understand the \nreason why the legislature acted, the reason why we are here on the \nfloor today asking for additional assistance is because of the plight \nof human beings, both the residents of my State who are there legally, \nwhose security is being threatened, in some cases on a daily basis--\nthose who live in the southern part of our State--and also for those \nindividuals who are being transported across our border by these cruel \ncoyotes and who are being terribly mistreated. There are human rights \nviolations of the most terrible kind.\n  I hope we can all come together, recognizing this is a serious \nproblem. It is not just a problem for Arizona, it is a problem for the \nNation. We have a requirement to secure our borders. That is the \nobligation of every Nation. We happen to be, unfortunately, the State \nthat suffers the most because of these insecure borders, but this \nspreads throughout the country. The drugs don't stop in Arizona; they \ngo all over the country. The individuals who are smuggled in, all of \nthem don't stop in Arizona; they go all over the country.\n  We need to help the Government of Mexico in their struggle against \nthese drug cartels, but we also have to take the measure--which can \nprobably help the Mexican Government as much as anything else--of \ngetting our border secured. I want to assure my colleagues that those \nof us from border States, once we get our border secured, stand ready \nto address these other issues that need to be addressed. But if we \ndon't get our border secured, a year, 2 years, 10 years from now we are \ngoing to be faced with the same problem over and over with a population \nof people who have come to our country illegally.\n  I ask not only for the votes of my colleagues on these amendments, \nbut I ask for their compassion and understanding about a human rights \nsituation that cries out for us to address as Christians and as \nindividuals who are motivated by Judeo-Christian principles.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\n                    Amendment No. 4230, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment. The clerk has the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish limitations on the transfer of C-130H aircraft \n  from the National Guard to a unit of the Air Force in another State)\n\n       At the end of chapter 3 of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. 309. (a) Limitations on Transfer of C-130H Aircraft \n     From National Guard to Air Force Units in Another State.--No \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act or \n     any other act may be obligated or expended to transfer a C-\n     130H aircraft from a unit of the National Guard in a State to \n     a unit of the Air Force, whether a regular unit or a unit of \n     a reserve component, in another State unless each of the \n     following is met:\n       (1) The aircraft shall be returned to the transferring unit \n     at a date, not later than 18 months after the date of \n     transfer, specified by the Secretary of the Air Force at the \n     time of transfer.\n       (2) Not later than 180 days before the date of transfer, \n     the Secretary of the Air Force shall submits to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, the members of Congress of the State \n     concerned, and the Chief Executive Officer and adjutant \n     general of the National Guard of the State concerned the \n     following:\n       (A) A written justification of the transfer.\n       (B) A description of the alternatives to transfer \n     considered by the Air Force and, for each alternative \n     considered, a justification for the decision not to utilize \n     such alternative.\n       (3) If a C-130H aircraft has previously been transferred \n     from any National Guard unit in the same State as the unit \n     proposed to provide the C-130H aircraft for transfer, the \n     transfer may not occur until the earlier of--\n       (A) the date following such previous transfer on which each \n     other State with National Guard units with C-130H aircraft \n     has transferred a C-130H aircraft to a unit of the Air Force \n     in another State; or\n       (B) the date that is 18 months after the date of such \n     previous transfer.\n       (b) Return of Aircraft.--Any C-130H aircraft transferred \n     from the National Guard to a unit of the Air Force under \n     subsection (a) shall be returned to the National Guard of the \n     State concerned upon a written request by the Chief Executive \n     Officer of such State for the return of such aircraft to \n     assist the National Guard of such State in responding to a \n     disaster or other emergency.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have an amendment, No. 4282, that I will \nspeak on. I will not call it up at this moment. However, my intent is \nto call it up at the soonest appropriate time.\n  I rise today to speak on this amendment and to also ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Cochran be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. First, I wish to commend the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their work on the supplemental spending bill. This has been \na well-crafted and pragmatic piece of legislation, but it has sometimes \nbeen difficult in putting this together and moving it to the floor. So \nI want to thank the leaders on the Appropriations Committee and the \nvarious subcommittees who worked to get this done.\n  This bill will greatly benefit our Nation's men and women in uniform. \nThis bill also ensures that disaster victims have the services and \nassistance needed to help them recover from both natural and manmade \ndisasters. I greatly appreciate the work of the chairman and the \nranking member along with all of my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Secondly, I wish to discuss amendment No. 4282 regarding FEMA's flood \nmap modernization program. I wish to thank Senator Cochran and his \nstaff for their hard work and diligence in preparing this amendment \nwith me, as well as Senators Lincoln, Vitter, and Brownback, who are \nall cosponsors. I greatly appreciate their contributions as well.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to address concerns regarding \neconomic development and the ability of communities to provide input in \nthe development of new flood insurance rate maps. The amendment will do \nthree simple things.\n  First, it would allow an extension of the flood elevation and Special \nFlood Hazard Area determination appeal period, upon request from an \naffected community.\n  Second, it would prevent FEMA from using technicalities to circumvent \nrequirements to study the economic impact of map modifications.\n  Third, it would establish an arbitration panel for communities to \nappeal FEMA's proposed map modifications before a neutral third party. \nThis sort of appeal from an independent third party is already allowed \nby statute, but it is rarely used. The amendment would set up an \narbitration panel and highlight the ability of communities to use this \nas a manner of appeal.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I have been talking about FEMA's flood \nmaps for the last several years. At first, I was working with a few \nother Senators to address the implementation of the program. Senator \nLincoln also has been a very determined advocate in this area. But now \nthere are Senators representing 13 different States who have expressed \nan interest in addressing some common problems with the map \nmodernization program.\n  Let me emphasize that I support modernizing our maps. I think that is \ngood to do. I think it is something we should do. I think it is a good \nuse of time and effort and resources to do that. However, what I am \nconcerned about is that FEMA seems to be determined to use this as a \nrevenue raiser for FEMA and the flood insurance program.\n  The way they have it set up is they will make determinations and \nbasically greatly expand existing flood plains into areas that--because \nof levees and other flood control management efforts, costing billions \nof dollars, by the way--are not currently at risk for any flooding--or \nhardly any risk at all. But the FEMA flood maps, I guess on a \ntechnicality--as the maps are completed--would say they would be in a \nflood plain.\n  The bottom line effect of this is it creates a huge revenue source \nfor FEMA. What happens, once they greatly expand the map of the flood \nplain, is that suddenly many of the people and businesses in that area \nhave to purchase flood insurance. In our State, we have looked at the \nnumbers, and that flood insurance could be as little as $100 a year, or \nit could be well over $2,500 a year. This has a significant impact on \npeople's mortgage payments and their various loans for their \nbusinesses.\n  But here is what we have to keep in mind. From our perspective--and \nagain, we are not the only State that does this; many States have river \nsystems that flood--these people are already paying for flood \ninsurance. What they are doing is they are paying for their local \nlevees to protect their communities. As long as those levees are in \ncompliance, and as long as there is not any real-life risk of a flood \nin a particular area, I think it is unjust that these people would be \ncharged for flood insurance.\n  Some of the common problems with FEMA's approach are the lack of \ncommunication and outreach to local stakeholders; a lack of \ncoordination between FEMA and the corps--that is the Corps of \nEngineers--in answering questions about flood mapping, flood insurance, \nand flood control infrastructure repairs; a lack of recognition of \nlocally funded flood control projects; a lack of recognition of \nhistorical flood data; inadequate time and resources to complete the \nrepairs to flood control structures before the maps are finalized--in \nother words, they may find a problem, and on day one, when they say you \nhave a problem, even though the problem can be fixed very quickly, or \nwithin a year, let's say, they still are going to try to tag people \nwith flood insurance in those affected areas. The other thing they have \nnot considered is the potential impacts these new flood maps might have \non economic development, particularly in small and rural communities.\n  Let me give an example of what we are talking about here on the \nground in Arkansas. And again, if Senators think they do not have this \nproblem, they may not today, but it is coming. Because as they redraw \nall these flood maps, this is going to be coming. I don't know about \nall 50 States, but in well over half the States it will, as they go \nthrough this flood map redrawing. So let me give an example.\n  In our State, of course the boot heel of Missouri is the very \nnortheastern corner of our State. There is a levee\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\nthat is actually in Missouri, and when the Corps of Engineers inspected \nit, it has a sand boil. Now a sand boil is a problem for a levee, no \ndoubt about it. There are varying degrees, and this particular one \napparently wasn't that bad, but nonetheless there is a sand boil there, \nwhich means the water is starting to seep under the levee. It is \ntotally repairable. They need a little time to fix it, but it is \ntotally repairable. The concern we have--and when we talk to FEMA and \nthe Corps of Engineers, we are not getting any comfort that our fears \nare not completely and 100 percent justified--is once they find that \nsand boil up in the very northern part of the St. Francis River Basin, \nthey are going to say the whole basin is out of compliance.\n  In other words, in the real world, they could have a leak there. I \nhope they never do, and I hope they can repair it, but they could have \na leak there. They could have a 100-year flood, and it could actually \ncause a problem to that levee. But think about it. The flooding would \nbe local to that levee. It wouldn't be 50 miles away in a totally \ndifferent part of the river basin area.\n  So FEMA, in my view, is doing things here that are very heavyhanded, \nvery bureaucratic. I do believe they are searching for revenue based on \nthe huge amount of money that FEMA had to spend on Katrina and some \nother disasters. FEMA's books are way out of balance as a result of \nthat, and I see this as a revenue raiser for them.\n  The problem is, as I said, they are going to go into areas that have \nvery strong levees that will never flood. Some of these levees are \nbuilt to well over the 100-year standard. In many places in Arkansas \nthey built them well over that, because in 1927--and there have been a \nfew years since--we had very serious flooding problems in our State. So \nin the eastern part of our State, people believe in levees because they \nhave needed them before. The levees have saved them before. The levees \nhave breached before, so they have been on both sides of that equation. \nThey believe in levees and they understand the value of them.\n  But that is not just true in Arkansas. You can go to Mississippi, \nLouisiana, Tennessee, Missouri, and Illinois, not just up and down the \nMississippi, but up and down lots of other river systems in this \ncountry and this problem is coming to your State. If you haven't seen \nit yet, you will. This problem is coming to your State.\n\n  What we are trying to do with this amendment is to at least--and, \npersonally, I think we ought to have various remedies available in this \nFEMA remapping project--at a minimum set up the ability to have an \narbitration panel, so if the Corps of Engineers and FEMA make a \nfinding, the community at least has a chance to appeal and, hopefully, \neffect a remedy before they get hit with the flood insurance \nrequirement.\n  There is a lot more to this story, but I am not going to bore my \ncolleagues and talk too much about it today because it is not the \npending amendment. But I would very much appreciate my colleagues' \nconsideration. I hope we will be able to be successful in attaching \nthis. It basically doesn't cost any money. There is no grant program. \nAt one point we were talking about a grant program, but we don't have \nthat in here.\n  We set up an arbitration panel, and the membership of the arbitration \npanel would have expertise in hydrology, administrative law, and/or \neconomic development. We would let the Corps of Engineers provide the \ntechnical guidance, which I think would be very valuable. Also, we \nallow communities an appeal period, where they can appeal within 120 \ndays, and it also clarifies under some circumstances that communities \ncould be at least partially reimbursed for the cost of the appeal. That \nis already in existing law. That provision is already in there, but we \nare making it clear that the rule would apply to this process.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your patience in listening to me. I \nknow we have other Senators who, if they are not on the floor at the \nmoment, are waiting to speak, so I wish to mention that my amendment, \nNo. 4282--I am not calling it up at the moment, but I wish to at the \nearliest possible moment.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment Nos. 4214 and 4202\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in favor of the \nMcCain amendment and the Cornyn amendment. I am cosponsor of both of \nthese amendments. I understand we will be voting very shortly on these \namendments as we move forward on the supplemental appropriations.\n  I am cosponsoring these amendments. The border State Senators have \nworked together, particularly in light of the escalating violence that \nis happening on the other side of the border with Mexico. It has \nparticularly hit Texas and Arizona. So Senator McCain and Senator Kyl \nand Senator Cornyn and I have repeatedly asked for reinforcements to \nsupport controlling our border.\n  I offered versions of both of these amendments in the committee that \nproduced this bill. I certainly hope we will be able to agree to these \namendments--which are fully paid for, I might add. They will not add to \nthe deficit. But it is so important that we have as a priority in this \ncountry the control of the borders of our sovereign Nation.\n  We cannot allow the illegal activity and the unspeakable violence to \ncontinue along our shared border. Ten thousand people have been killed \nin Mexico in drug cartel-related violence, many of them police officers \nand law enforcement officials, just this year; 2,000 over the last 3 or \n4 years. It is escalating. We are seeing effects of the illegal \nactivity spill over on our side of the border for sure.\n  We have an increase in the activity in our judicial system, in our \nlaw enforcement, our local law enforcement. American taxpayers are \npaying for local law enforcement for us to be able to try to stop this \nactivity from coming across. But there is evidence that it is coming \nacross as we see drug cartels setting up operations in cities on our \nside of the border.\n  I have invited the President to tour the border with me. That offer \nstill stands. I welcome the opportunity to show the President exactly \nwhat the security challenges are and to see what the Border Patrol and \nDEA agents are going through on a daily basis, not to mention our \nborder sheriffs and policemen.\n  After deemphasizing border security and even proposing to cut the \nborder patrol on the southwest border in the President's own budget, I \nwas pleased to finally hear a better set of words and proposals from \nthe President--that he will agree to increase border funding. But it is \na little late coming since so many of us have been asking for months, \nand even over a year, for this extra border security. Border Senators \nand Congressmen have repeatedly called on the President to focus on \nthis issue. Then we find that his original budget actually decreased \nthe number of border patrol.\n  What we know is that the President is now calling for an additional \n1,200 National Guard to be deployed to the border. Texas alone has \nrequested 1,000 National Guard. Spreading 1,200 National Guard over \nfour States is really an insufficient response to a national security \npriority.\n  The McCain amendment specifies title 32 authority for the National \nGuard. It is fully offset, and it deploys 6,000 National Guard to the \nsouthwest border. This is much more aggressive than the President's \nproposal of 1,200. Although I am pleased the President is making a \nstart, 1,200 is barely going to cover Texas, much less Arizona and \nCalifornia. It would certainly be an addition, if we can agree to the \nMcCain amendment, to really show we are serious about beefing up the \nborder security for our country.\n  Under the McCain amendment, the National Guard would help the CBP, \nthe Border Patrol, get operational control of the southwest border. It \nwill augment our security forces until a continued scale-up and \ntraining of Border Patrol agents can take place.\n  Basically, what the McCain amendment does is say this is a temporary \nfix. We are not asking that Border Patrol be a permanent fixture on our \nborder. We don't want that. I was even\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nhesitant to ask for Border Patrol. But the situation has gotten so \nserious that we now have to take stepped-up measures as a stop-gap \nwhile we train the Border Patrol to do their job.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has 17,000 personnel assigned to \nthe southwest border. Well under half the agents--about 7,700--are \ncurrently assigned to Texas even though 63 percent of the border runs \nthrough our State. Arizona has only 4,000 agents. We all need more \nsupport.\n  Adequate National Guard support is critical to help patrol spillover \nviolence and address all of our security challenges until we have more \nof the Border Patrol agents ready to go.\n  Another amendment offered by Senator Cornyn, which I also cosponsor, \nwill drastically increase support for law enforcement at every level, \nFederal, State, and local. I wish to speak particularly to the portion \nof Senator Cornyn's amendment that funds the unmanned aerial vehicle, \nthe UAVs as we call them, which I introduced in committee and on the \nfloor as stand-alone amendments.\n  I have worked with the FAA and Customs and Border Patrol so we can \nquickly increase the presence of unmanned drones, or UAVs, to help \nprotect the Southwest border. These unmanned drones are able to monitor \nthe progress across the border, and also monitor crossings that might \nbe illegal across the border, places where you cannot put a Border \nPatrol agent. There are many miles that have to be covered. You cannot \nhave a Border Patrol agent every 12 or 15 feet on the border.\n  But these unmanned aerial vehicles do provide so much of our \nintelligence gathering and information gathering that it would \nsupplement the Border Patrol, and what I hope are additional National \nGuard.\n  Last week, I, along with members of the Texas delegation, met with \nFAA Administrator Babbitt. We urged him to allow the UAVs to operate \nalong the Texas border. He committed to working closely with the Border \nPatrol to approve the use of UAVs in my State, as well as to streamline \nthe approval process across the Nation.\n  We have no UAVs in Texas, none. The FAA and the Border Patrol have \ngone back and forth about who is responsible for this. But the bottom \nline is we have 1,200 miles of border with Mexico and no UAVs to help \nbridge the gap between Border Patrol stations and cameras.\n  The UAV amendment will allow the Border Patrol to obtain and operate \nat least six new drone systems and hire pilots, with the goal of \ncovering the United States-Mexico border in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, \nand California every day of the week, including nights. We now have a \nsystem that only operates in the daytime--not in Texas, but in other \nareas. That is not good enough, because so much of the activity takes \nplace at night.\n  The amendment provides funding and direction to quickly implement the \ndrone procurement and maintenance. It provides funding for 60 pilots \nand crew. All of the costs are fully offset. Border Patrol currently \noperates six unmanned drones in the United States, but only three in \nthe Southwest border. The six additional UAVs will provide full \nSouthwest border surveillance 7 days a week without diminishing drone \nsurveillance along the Northern border and off our Nation's coast.\n  More UAVs will help the Border Patrol gain consistent control of our \nborders. Using the drone systems is a force multiplier, and it allows \nborder enforcement officials to more efficiently and consistently \nmonitor the border and respond to illicit activity.\n  I am a cosponsor of the two amendments. This is very important to the \nwhole Southwest border. But I do feel that my home State of Texas has \nbeen particularly challenged because we have had no UAVs. We have had \nonly 7,700 Border Patrol personnel across the 1,200 miles, and you \ncannot be serious about border security. This has escalated because of \nthe violence in Mexico. The heinous crimes that are being committed in \nMexico, many against law enforcement officers, are something we read \nabout in the papers. We have even had our own U.S. State Department \npeople killed in Mexico. We have evidence that the cartels are setting \nup shop in cities in my home State of Texas, and I imagine they are \nsetting up in Arizona as well, maybe California. I do not know about \nthat. But I do I know in Texas they are. I know that when you are \nfacing people who have automatic weapons, they have very sophisticated \nintelligence gathering--these are the cartels, not the government. They \nare killing police officers. They are putting signs on the burial \nplaces of these police officers saying: These are next. Then they will \ncome back and they will cross off on the sign the people they have just \nkilled, leaving the ones who are still alive to know they are being \nwatched every moment and they are targets.\n  We cannot sit here and let this happen without aggressive action. \nThat is why we have to act, and why his original budget that was \nsubmitted to Congress is laughable in this context.\n  Now he is saying he will do 1,200 National Guard. Texas is asking for \n1,000, Arizona is asking for 600--Arizona is asking for--I don't know. \nThey only have 4,000 Border Patrol agents and they are asking for 3,000 \nNational Guard. I did find my place. They are asking for 3,000. Texas \nis asking for 1,000.\n  We need to pass this amendment. It is fully offset. We would like for \nthe whole stimulus bill that is going through, the supplemental \nappropriations, to be offset. We should have not more debt. We have \nenough money in our system if we prioritize border security. It is a \nnational security issue and it should be in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will ask for \namendments Nos. 4242 and 4287 to be called up for consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Landrieu be added as a cosponsor \non amendment No. 4242, and Senator LeMieux be added as a cosponsor on \namendment No. 4287.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, it is now day 37 of the oil spill. We are \nno closer to finding a solution to this crisis then we were on day one.\n  Oil continues to pour into the gulf at an unprecedented rate, \nsignificantly more than the estimate of 5,000 barrels a day.\n  Oil has reached deep into the Louisiana marshes. Tar balls have \nwashed up on the shores of Alabama and Mississippi.\n  As long as this oil continues to flow into the gulf we have a real \nand unprecedented disaster.\n  On May 18, I requested that the Secretary of Commerce declare a \nfisheries disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Alabama's fishing industry \nrepresents one of the largest economic engines in the State, accounting \nfor more than $800 matron in annual sales and nearly 18,000 jobs.\n  On Monday, the Secretary declared a fisheries disaster in Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana.\n  Now, it is up to Congress to ensure that our fishermen who will be \nadversely impacted by this oil spill for years to come receive adequate \nassistance.\n  Today, I offer an amendment to help our gulf coast communities \nmitigate the disastrous effects of the oil spill. This amendment is not \nmore spending but offset from the oil spill liability trust fund. It \nfurther requires ``responsible parties'' to reimburse the trust fund \nfor funding the Federal Government puts towards this amendment.\n  First, this amendment provides $20 million to fund the Secretary of \nCommerce's disaster declaration. NOAA has closed 22.4 percent of the \ncommercial and recreational fisheries in the gulf because of the spill.\n  This declaration will allow the Federal Government to put additional, \nimmediate Federal resources towards this disaster to alleviate and \nrecover from the devastating impacts to the gulf's fisheries.\n  However, this declaration has no teeth if it is not funded. While I \nhoped the administration would realize this by requesting an amendment \nto the supplemental, they have not. My amendment will provide the \nresources necessary to help our gulf coast region.\n  Second, it provides NOAA with the resources necessary to begin an \nexpanded stock assessment in the gulf.\n  A comprehensive stock assessment is critical to the gulf, where there \nare\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\nhundreds of species managed under fisheries management plans or \ninternational conventions. NOAA recently identified the needed steps to \nimprove and expand stock assessments in the gulf and to do so, they \nwill need the best and most timely data on the health and abundance of \nthe stocks. This amendment will provide $15 million to NOAA to begin an \nexpanded stock assessment. We must know what the fisheries stocks in \nthe gulf are now, so we will have a better idea how the oil has \naffected them.\n  Finally, this amendment will provide funding to the National Academy \nof Sciences to study the long-term ecosystem impacts of the spill on \nthe gulf.\n  It is critical to proactively work to adequately deal with this man-\nmade crisis. If the oil continues to spill in the gulf unabated, it \nwill not only destroy the fisheries this year, but will adversely \nimpact the gulf's ecosystem for decades.\n  We cannot simply sit by and wait for this problem to solve itself. \nClearly, we all know that BP has not yet come up with a solution.\n  We must continue to ensure that BP, as the responsible party, pays \nfor all damage related to this oil spill, but that does not mean BP can \nmake all the decisions as to what to do and how to handle the disaster \nthat continues to unfold.\n  We have been dealing with this crisis for 37 days and are no closer \nto stopping the oilspill than we were on day 1. Since the spill, BP has \nfailed in every attempt to stop the oil flow.\n  We need to begin putting resources in the gulf to help mitigate the \nlong-term effects of what could be the largest and most devastating \noilspill in American history.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the people of the gulf coast by \nsupporting my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4231 and 4232\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to the distinguished chairman, if there is a \nunanimous consent agreement concluded, I would be more than happy to be \ninterrupted. I know that business in the Senate needs to proceed. I am \nproud to be joining forces with my colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, \nto insist that we stop burdening our children and our grandchildren \nwith massive debt.\n  We have before us today a supplemental appropriations bill totaling \nnearly $60 billion, most of it not paid for, simply being added to the \never growing debt, to be paid for by future generations of Americans.\n  If we are serious about our commitment to reduce our debt and \neliminate our deficit, then Congress needs to start making some tough \ndecisions about our national priorities and we need to start now.\n  Dr. Coburn is seeking a vote on one of two reasonable amendments, \nboth of which would fully offset the cost of this bill. Yesterday, Dr. \nCoburn very eloquently laid out his reasons for offering those two \namendments. Essentially our fiscal situation is extremely perilous and \nwe can no longer afford to approve any new Federal funding without \neliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending in other areas.\n  Mr. President, a kind of bizarre thing happened yesterday. In the \nmiddle of his speech and his argument before the Senate, Dr. Coburn \nyielded the floor to the majority leader who proceeded to file cloture \non this bill after only 1 day of floor consideration and not a single \nvote on any amendment. So on a $60 billion bill, most of it not paid \nfor, we are now going to, without a single amendment having been voted \non, be voting on a bill, in fact, that will not be paid for. As my \ncolleagues know quite well, the editorial page of the Washington Post \nis by no means a conservative, right-leaning, penny-pinching bunch, but \neven they are perplexed about what we are doing here. Yesterday, in an \neditorial entitled ``Congress as Usual: There's an election coming. \nTime to spend,'' the Post wrote:\n\n       All across the Western world, fiscal stimulus is starting \n     to give way to fiscal consolidation. In London, the new \n     British government has announced $8.6 billion in immediate \n     budget cuts. In Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy is \n     negotiating to raise that country's retirement age. In \n     Madrid, Spanish civil servants are facing a 5 percent pay \n     cut, followed by a wage freeze. Even Italy is talking about \n     tightening spending. And don't get us started on Greece.\n       Only in Washington, it seems, is the long awaited ``pivot'' \n     to fiscal restraint nowhere to be seen. As the mid-term \n     elections draw near, Congress is considering a passel of new \n     spending, necessary and otherwise, most of which won't be \n     paid for.\n\n  Sadly, the Washington Post hit the nail on the head and the bill \nbefore us is the perfect example of Congress's inability to deal with \nthe very serious fiscal realities that are facing this Nation.\n  Under this supplemental, DOD receives $33.7 billion for operations in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. The bulk of this money, $24.6 billion, is \nfor operations and maintenance, and much needed other funding. The \nremainder of the DOD funding is for military personnel costs and other \nequipment.\n  Some say the fiscally responsible way to pay for our war costs is to \nincreases taxes. We disagree. The American people, particularly our \nsoldiers and their families, are sacrificing enough already. It is time \nfor Congress to start making some sacrifices and forgo the earmarks and \nother special deals to help provide our troops with the support and \nequipment they need.\n  The first amendment of Dr. Coburn saves taxpayers $59.6 billion by \ndoing the following: freezing raises, bonuses, and salary increases for \nFederal employees for 1 year; collecting unpaid taxes from Federal \nemployees, $3 billion; reducing printing and publishing costs of \ngovernment documents, $4.4 billion over 10 years; reducing excessive \nduplication, overhead, and spending within the Federal Government, $20 \nbillion; eliminating nonessential government travel, $10 billion over \n10 years; eliminating bonuses for poor performance by government \ncontractors, $8 billion over 10 years; repealing the Energy Star \nProgram, $627 million over 10 years; eliminating an increase in foreign \naid for international organizations, $68 million; limiting voluntary \npayments to the United Nations, $10 billion over 10 years; striking \nunnecessary appropriations for salaries and expenses of a government \ncommission Congress ignored, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, \n1.8 million; rescinding a State Department training facility that was \nnot requested by the community where it is to be constructed, $500 \nmillion.\n  On the second amendment we can save taxpayers $60 billion by cutting \nbudgets of Members of Congress, by disposing of unneeded, unused \ngovernment property, auctioning and selling unused and unneeded \nequipment, rescinding unspent and uncommitted Federal funds, $45 \nbillion.\n  We have ways we can cut spending. We have ways we can reduce the \ngovernment, in the first amendment, by nearly $60 billion, and in the \nother one by $60 billion.\n  In a letter to Speaker Pelosi in April of last year, President Obama \nwrote:\n\n       As I noted when I first introduced my budget in February, \n     this is the last planned war supplemental. Since September \n     2001, the Congress has passed 17 separate emergency funding \n     bills totaling $822.1 billion for the wars in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. After 7 years of war, the American people \n     deserve an honest accounting of the cost of our involvement \n     in our ongoing military operations.\n\n  Quoting from the President's letter of April of last year:\n\n       We must break that recent tradition and include future \n     military costs in the regular budget so that we have an \n     honest, more accurate, and fiscally responsible estimate of \n     Federal spending. And we should not label military costs as \n     emergency funds so as to avoid our responsibility to abide by \n     the spending limits set forth by the Congress.\n\n  The President emphasized, again quoting from his letter to the \nSpeaker of the House:\n\n       After years of budget gimmicks and wasteful spending, it is \n     time to end the era of irresponsibility in Washington.\n\n  I could not agree more. That is why I am disappointed to see yet \nanother supplemental spending bill designated as an emergency without \noffsets. Dr. Coburn and I agree with what the President said last year. \n``After years of budget gimmicks and wasteful spending, it is time to \nend the era of irresponsibility in Washington.'' That is precisely what \nwe are seeking to do with these two amendments.\n  In the past 2 years, America has faced her greatest fiscal challenges \nsince the Great Depression. When the financial markets collapsed, it \nwas the American taxpayer who came to the rescue of the banks and the \nbig Wall Street firms. But who has come to the\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nrescue of the American taxpayer? Certainly not Congress.\n  So what has Congress done? By enacting inexplicable policies that can \nonly be described as generational theft, we have saddled future \ngenerations with literally trillions of dollars of debt. Since January \nof 2009, we have been on a spending binge the likes of which this \nNation has never seen. In that time, our debt has grown by over $2 \ntrillion. We passed a $1.1 trillion stimulus bill.\n  Remember the assurance that unemployment would be at a maximum of 8 \npercent? Now it is 9.9. We passed a $2.5 trillion health care bill. The \nAmerican people are still angry about that. The President submitted a \nbudget for next year totaling $3.8 trillion. We now have a deficit of \nover $1.4 trillion, and we just passed, a week or so ago, the $13 \ntrillion debt mark which amounts to more than $42,000 owed by every \nman, woman, and child in America.\n  This year the government will spend more than $3.6 trillion and will \nborrow 41 cents for every $1 it spends. Unemployment remains at 9.9 \npercent and, according to forbes.com, a record 2.8 million American \nhouseholds were threatened with foreclosure last year. That number is \nexpected to rise to well over 3 million homes this year. With this \nbill, we are poised to tack another $60 billion onto the tab.\n  I travel a lot around my State. I know all of my colleagues do. Every \nplace I go I meet county supervisors, city councilmen, mayors, elected \nofficials from all over the State. I talk to the Governor, the \nlegislature. They make tough decisions. The city of Phoenix had to cut \nits budget by some 30 percent last year, a very tough decision. \nMeanwhile, we increased domestic spending by 20 percent. What is the \ndifference between the city of Phoenix and us in the Capitol? We print \nmoney. A debt of $1.4 trillion this year, estimated to be $1.5 trillion \nthis year, how can we continue this?\n  These two amendments by Dr. Coburn can achieve a significant savings, \n$60 billion in each. That is $120 billion that both of these amendments \ncould save the taxpayers. Wouldn't it be wonderful to show the \ntaxpayers that maybe we are going to do something like cutting the \nbudget, cutting our budgets? Wouldn't it be nice to tell the American \npeople we are going to eliminate nonessential government travel? \nCouldn't we at least freeze bonuses?\n  We have an opportunity to show the American people we are going to \ntighten our belts a little bit, too; that we care about generational \ntheft; that we care about future generations of Americans. I know some \nof these measures will not be popular, but Dr. Coburn has never been \none who has tried to win a popularity contest. What Dr. Coburn has \ntried to do is steer the American people on a path to some kind of \nfiscal solvency so we can stop this terrible generational theft we are \ncommitting.\n  The greatness of America, certainly one of her greatest attributes, \nis we have handed on to every generation a better one than the one they \nhad before them. That has been the great wonder and beauty of America. \nWith these kinds of debts and deficits, what can we pass on to our \nchildren and grandchildren?\n  I applaud Senator Coburn not only for this effort but many of the \nother efforts he has made. I am pleased to join him. I hope my \ncolleagues will understand that the American people are angry and \nfrustrated. Look at the latest polling numbers--we do read polls. Do \nyou want to reelect your Member of Congress? What is our approval \nrating? It is 14, 13, 12 percent. We are down to blood relatives and \npaid staffers. The point is, let's send a message to the American \npeople we are serious.\n  Yes, there are tough decisions and tough things that are embodied in \nthis legislation. I urge my colleagues to at least take a look at them \nand consider putting this Congress and this Nation on a different path.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for H.R. \n4899, the Fiscal Year 2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act. This bill \nis critical to our future success in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan \nand also delivers much needed humanitarian aid to Haiti. Today, I wish \nto highlight how some of the provisions in this legislation support \nU.S. foreign policy goals, strengthen our military and civilian \nefforts, and defend against security threats around the world.\n  This bill does a great deal to support our ongoing counterinsurgency \neffort in Afghanistan. As General McChrystal has said, \ncounterinsurgency is not an ``event,'' but rather, a ``process,'' and \nthis supplemental provides the essential resources needed at each stage \nof the process.\n  First, the military must ``shape and clear'' in a military operation. \nThe President made the bold decision in December that an additional \n30,000 troops were needed in Afghanistan, and this bill fully funds the \nadditional deployment. As we saw earlier this year in Marjah and will \nwitness this summer in Kandahar, the U.S. military is partnering with \nthe Afghan security forces for the ``clear and hold'' portion of \ncounterinsurgency, and I am pleased this bill provides $2.6 billion to \ntrain and equip the Afghan security forces.\n  Next we must ``build,'' which requires a unity of effort between the \nmilitary and civilian agencies and which is why this bill provides \n$1.48 billion to the State Department for continued reconstruction and \nlaw enforcement programs. As I have stated before, our goal is to \ntransfer authority to the Afghans. For this, we must continue to train \nand mentor the Afghan Army, police, and civil servants, so they may \nassume greater responsibility to provide security and effective \ngovernance themselves.\n  On a recent trip to Afghanistan in March, I saw firsthand the \nimprovements that have been made with the Afghan National Army, ANA, \ntraining program. Thanks to a recent pay raise for ANA recruits and \nintensified partnering with U.S. forces, we are on track to exceed the \nstated goal of 134,000 trained ANA by October. The additional resources \nin this bill will help ensure we stay on this positive trajectory for \nANA training and mobilization.\n  Unfortunately, the same progress has not been realized in training \nthe Afghan National Police, ANP. A lack of oversight, coupled with high \nrates of attrition, drug use, illiteracy, and widespread corruption \nhave severely undermined our efforts to establish a credible police \nforce.\n  I was appalled--appalled does not describe it--I was appalled to \nlearn we have spent $6 billion on training the ANP in the past 9 years, \nwith little to show for it. I have been in literally 60 to 100 \nmeetings--before my three trips to Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, and my \ntrips back. I have yet to hear anyone say anything good about the \nAfghan national police. It was not until I got on the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee that I found out we were spending $6 billion to train \nthem. I would have been shocked if I had heard we were spending $100 \nmillion to train them. However, this is key to our success in \nAfghanistan, and I believe the administration is now fully aware of the \nproblems that have become endemic to this program and is focused on \neliminating them in the months ahead.\n  Funding in this bill will support efforts to get police training back \non track, which is one of the most critical elements of our strategy in \nAfghanistan.\n  This bill also does a great deal to reinforce our partnership with \nPakistan. After traveling three times in the past year to Pakistan, I \ncannot underscore enough the importance and strategic value of this \npartnership to our shared fight against violent extremism. This \nresonates at home today in the wake of the failed Times Square bombing \nand Faisal Shahzad's alleged ties to Pakistani extremists in \nWaziristan. In light of mutual security interests, we must continue to \nnurture our relationship with the Pakistani people and military, \ndemonstrating our enduring long-term interest in the region.\n  Last year, Congress validated that commitment in the form of a 5-\nyear, $7.5 billion economic aid package, otherwise known as the Kerry-\nLugar bill, and in the past 2 years, we have invested over $1 billion \nin military aid in the Pakistan counterinsurgency capability fund. This \nbill reaffirms these commitments with $259 million to support ongoing \nprograms to strengthen democratic governance, rule of law,\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\nand social and economic services to improve the lives of the people of \nPakistan. Of the total, $10 million would be provided for the Pakistani \nCivilian Assistance Program, $5 million for human rights programs, and \n$1.5 million to facilitate the implementation and oversight of USAID \nand Department of State programs.\n  This bill also provides $50 million for the purchase of helicopters \nfor Pakistan which will be used to combat terrorist groups and other \nextremist organizations. I am hopeful that this level of commitment \nwill help persuade the Pakistanis to redouble their efforts to address \nsecurity concerns along the border with Afghanistan. I cannot emphasize \nenough the importance of Pakistan's contribution to the security \nsituation in the tribal areas, especially as it pertains to targeting \nthe Afghan Taliban--not just the Pakistani Taliban--including the \nHaqqani Network and Quetta Shura.\n  This bill also helps ensure a stable and secure Iraq in preparation \nfor the drawdown of United States forces and complete withdrawal of \ncombat troops by September. During my recent visit to the region, I was \nstruck by the helicopter view of Baghdad at night. The glimmering \nlights of the city and the traffic looked similar to any city in the \nU.S. That sight illustrated the progress that has been made in Iraq and \nthe enduring mutual commitment and partnership that has been created in \nrecent years. As a means of reinforcing this commitment and continued \nprogress, this bill provides an additional $1 billion for the Iraqi \nsecurity forces fund. It also provides $650 million in additional \neconomic and security assistance for Iraq which includes $450 million \nfor the Iraqi police program.\n  These measures support the security framework in Iraq, which will \nprovide Iraq's leaders with the stability they need to form a new \ngovernment. With the election recount recently completed, the \ngroundwork has been laid for Iraqi elected officials to work toward a \ncommon goal of establishing a government representative of the people \nof Iraq. While a functioning government should not just be cobbled \ntogether in the interest of time, it is important to note that a \nprolonged delay could create a power vacuum that may exacerbate ongoing \nsecurity concerns. This bill reinforces and continues to build upon the \nsecurity infrastructure that the Iraqis have created, and the goal of \nbuilding and sustaining past success.\n  Finally, I am grateful this bill includes $3 million for the Voice of \nAmerica's Creole language broadcasting in Haiti. The VOA Creole \nbroadcasts include public service announcements from U.S. Government \nagencies, which have been so valuable in previous crises around the \nworld, and have helped Haitians find loved ones, shelter, medical \nassistance, and aid, in the aftermath of the earthquake.\n  Since then, it has provided a vital service in helping them to find \nessential resources and assistance. VOA runs public safety and relief \nsupply updates, as well as a call-in line to broadcast messages from \nfamilies and friends of the injured and missing. The additional \nresources in this bill will help to sustain these critical public \nservices, and I commend the VOA for its commitment and its great \ncontribution to disaster relief globally, and especially in Haiti.\n  This bill reinforces our foreign policy goals and secures our \ninterests at home and abroad. It also funds our Armed Forces which are \ndeployed in harm's way, and supports the civilian diplomatic and \ndevelopment initiatives that are necessary to our efforts in \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. I thank the leadership for moving this \nbill forward, and I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nsupplemental.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4231, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n4231 be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN.

I thank the Chair.\n  I want to say I enjoyed very much Senator Kaufman's words, and I \nagree with him. I think what he talked about and what we are doing for \nour military in this bill is appropriate. It is something that has to \nbe done. The only difference I would have with him is it is not an \nemergency. We all know it is not an emergency. The reason it is being \nclassified as an emergency is because we do not want to make the hard \nchoices of getting rid of something else to pay for it, and we do not \nwant to have another violation of pay-go, so what we do is we classify \nit as an emergency.\n  The only thing in this bill that is an emergency is the FEMA money. \nThat is the only thing that meets the definition of our own rules for \nan emergency: unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated. Everything \nelse in this bill is predictable, foreseen, and anticipated. So we are \nactually violating our own integrity when we bring a bill to the floor \nand call it an emergency when everybody knows it is not.\n  Why are we doing that? We are doing that because we do not want to \nhave to live with the rule we set for ourselves called pay-go. I did \nnot vote for pay-go. I do not believe in pay-go because pay-go is \nexactly what I said it would be when we had the vote. The American \ntaxpayer, you go pay, and we will go spend, and we will not diminish \nany of our spending, our profligate spending, because of this rule.\n  Since we have passed the bill on pay-go on February 12 of 2010--that \nis when it was signed into law--we have borrowed $46 billion and waived \npay-go;\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\nborrowed $10 billion and waived pay-go; borrowed $99 billion and waived \npay-go--that was all in March. We borrowed $18 billion.\n  This one is not going to count against pay-go because we put a false \nemergency designation on it, and we have another $190 billion coming to \nus from the House for extenders, and we are going to waive pay-go on \nthat. So we will have spent $530 billion since February 12 that we do \nnot have, and we refuse to make choices about lower priority programs \nand eliminating them. That is the truth. Nobody is going to dispute it. \nYou cannot even get anybody to debate you on these things. They will \nnot debate you because they know it is the fact. They will not stand \nand even counter it because they know it is the fact.\n  Well, what are the other facts? Here are the other facts: FEMA is \nbroke. Medicare is broke. Medicaid is broke. Fannie and Freddie are \nbroke. Social Security is broke. It is running a negative balance. The \nU.S. Post Office is broke. The highway trust fund is broke. And guess \nwhat. So is the Federal Government. If we are not careful, we are going \nto add our kids to the list and say they are broke. That is where we \nare headed: broke. That means our liabilities are greater than our \nassets. That means the money we have is not sufficient to cover the \ndebts we have.\n  We have seen this tremendous volatility in the markets over the last \n2 weeks. They are upset because they are not sure there is a stable \nEuro right now. The Euro has dropped from $1.43 in the last 4 months to \n$1.22. That is a significant decline in that currency. Why is that? \nBecause there is no confidence they are going to be able to solve their \nproblems of being broke, because they are not making the hard choices \namong priorities that are necessary for them to get out of the problems \nthey face. And we are just starting to see a backstop and IMF demands \nof Greece--and you are going to see it of many others--that they are \ngoing to have to make certain cuts in spending.\n  We have a couple of choices. We can wait 2 or 3 years, when we are in \nthe same shape, to where the world currency and the world bankers are \ndemanding of us that we make those hard choices or we can start making \nthem now when they are a lot less expensive and a lot less costly.\n  I know the amendments we have offered have been sent to CBO, and CBO \nis saying--which tells us another entire problem we have--they cannot \nscore a freeze in Federal salaries. Well, we know it is going to go up \n$3.1 billion next year if we do not score it, but CBO will not score \nit. We know regardless of the significant increase we had in our own \nbudgets--4.6 percent--I have averaged turning back more than 400,000 a \nyear. Everybody in this Congress, everybody in this Senate, could do \nthat easily if they wanted to. We have offered $100 million in cuts to \nour own budgets. That is where we ought to start. If we are going to \nset an example, we ought to start with our own budget. CBO will not \nscore that either.\n  Why won't they score it? We are clueless to what the real world is \nabout in terms of spending and budgets. We cannot get a score even \nthough the direction in the amendment is to sell off $15 billion in \nunused properties and physical plants that we know we do not use that \ncost us $8 billion a year to maintain. CBO is not going to score that \neither--so that is not going to be scored as savings--and rescinding \nunspent and uncommitted Federal funds, of which there is over $350 \nbillion sitting in the bank right now that is unobligated. I am not \ntalking about obligated funds. I am talking about unobligated funds, \nwhich says we are going to manage our money better. We are going to \nmake it stream. We are not going to let it sit there for so long. We \nare not going to borrow the money. We are going to borrow it more on a \ntime-as-needed basis, and we are not going to have as much money \nsitting in unobligated funds.\n  We are going to have criticism against our first amendment because \nCBO does not score it. Do you know what. CBO's accuracy is about as \ngood as mine at throwing a baseball: not very good. I cannot hit the \nstrike zone, and neither do they. That does not mean anything against \nthem because we are giving them lots of unknowns. But we have also set \nup a set of rules that are designed to not give us what we need to \nhave: the real information. No business, no family operates their \nbudgets with such loose rules.\n  Where are we going? Here is where we are going right now. This chart \nshows discretionary spending in the United States since 1999. In 2010--\nand this is in real dollars; this is not inflation-adjusted dollars; it \nwould not look quite as bad if it were in inflation-adjusted dollars--\nbut we are going from $572 billion to $1.408 trillion. And do you know \nwhat. That does not count any of the spending--any of the spending--the \n$500 billion we are going to pass outside of pay-go. It does not count \nany of it.\n  So in a time when our country owes $13 trillion--it is going to over \n$26 trillion in 9 years; that is the path we are on--we are increasing \nspending, and we are not paying for any of it. We are not making one \nhard choice. One of the few things that is paid for in this bill \ncontinues to fund a commission we do not even need because we just \npassed the financial reform bill, and yet we are going to spend $1.8 \nmillion on the Financial Inquiry Commission. Why would we do that? You \ntalk about throwing money down a rat hole. Why has the commission \ncontinued to meet? We have already decided in all our knowledge and all \nour wisdom we knew how to fix it, even though we did not even fix the \nunderlying causes for the real collapse: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We \ndid not address it at all. We did not address leverage ratios.\n  That is where we are going: $1.4 trillion this year, not counting \neverything we are passing out of here that is not paid for. What does \nit mean? We heard Senator McCain talk about generational theft. Here is \nthe face of it. Here is little Miss Madeline. When I first put this \npicture up in the Chamber less than 7 months ago, it was $38,000. It is \nnow $42,000 per man, woman, and child in this country. That is what \nthey owe individually on our net debt. That is not our gross debt; that \nis our net debt. The $13 trillion does not represent our real debt. \nThat only represents what we owe outside. It does not represent what we \nowe ourselves.\n  So she is at $42,000. Extrapolate the increase from $38,000 to \n$42,000 every 6 months and see what you get. What you get 20 years from \nnow--if you include unfunded liabilities--Madeline, when she is 24, \nwill owe $1,113,000. That is what she is going to be responsible for. \nSo when we hear somebody talk about generational theft, what they are \ntalking about is robbing opportunity.\n  If you had a 6-percent interest rate on $1,113,000, it is not hard to \nfigure out that is $66,000 a year in interest that Madeline is going to \nhave to pay before she pays any taxes to run the government, defend the \ncountry, pay for Medicare for me and the rest of the people in this \nroom, before she owns a home, before she educates her kids. It is \nthievery.\n  How hard is it? How hard is it in a $3 trillion budget for us to find \nthe money--find the money--to pay for this war? How hard is it? It is \nonly as hard as we make it. We are risk averse. We do not want to be \ncriticized because some program that had somebody who was for it is not \ngoing to be there anymore. We are going to do it. We are going to \neliminate those programs. I can promise you we are. The question is \nwhen we are going to do it, and how drastic it is going to be, and who \nis going to make us do it. If we do not do it ourselves, then the \npriorities are not going to be the priorities of the body. They are \ngoing to be the priorities of the world bankers. That is who is going \nto do it. We are going to do this. We are going to cut spending. The \nquestion is, Do we do it now and make it less painful or do we wait \nuntil we are forced into it like the Greeks?\n  I think our history, I think our culture, and I think our children \nare worth us starting to make those kinds of difficult decisions. It is \nmy hope we will give consideration--I do not care what combination of \ncuts we make. I just offered some. I am willing for the appropriators \nto make the cuts. But we no longer live in a time when we can borrow \nfrom the future of our children to pay for now. It has to start. I \nwould ask my colleagues to support that start.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a huge challenge in the \nState of Oregon--specifically, a\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\ndrought that is affecting the southern Klamath Basin. This is an area \nthat had a terrible drought in 1992. This drought set everyone in this \nbasin against each other. How do you allocate those few precious drops \nof water between the river and the lake and the irrigation, the fish, \nthe farmers?\n  It is terribly tough when it doesn't rain. It so happens that this \nyear, the water that has come into the lake is lower than at any time \nthe water levels have been recorded and lower by very significant \namounts. So this isn't just a shortfall of rain below the average or a \nmodest few weeks without precipitation; this is the worst drought in \nthe Klamath Basin in recorded history. That is why it has received \nstatus as a Federal disaster. The Governor of Oregon wrote on March 16 \nand on April 5 requesting a disaster designation for Klamath County, \nOR, due to the losses caused by the ongoing drought and related \ndisasters, and the Department of Agriculture assessed that and issued \nthat disaster declaration. There are well over 1,000 families--about \n1,400 families--who farm the Klamath Basin and about 200,000 acres of \nland in that very productive region.\n  As we have immersed ourselves in discussions with the Secretary of \nAgriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, there are a couple key \nstrategies that can be pursued to prevent what is a terrible situation \nright now from being an utter and total disaster by August and \nSeptember. Those strategies are pumping ground water, which is quite \nexpensive due to the power needs, and idling land--asking some farmers \nwho have water rights to set aside their rights for modest payments, \nand by modest, meaning less than $200 an acre for highly fertile \nground. But that greatly reduces the size of this disaster to the \ncommunity.\n  I applaud the hard work the Secretary of Agriculture and the \nSecretary of the Interior have done. They have worked to reprogram, to \nmake those modest changes so they are allowed to free up a small amount \nof funds, a modest amount of funds. But to really address this \nsituation, to idle basically what amounts to a fourth of that land, \nwould take $10 million.\n  I have an amendment filed, amendment No. 4251, that I hope will have \na chance to be brought up and considered later on because we are \naddressing some major disasters around the country in this \nappropriations legislation, and it is certainly appropriate, when you \nhave a declared Federal disaster in my State, to have this modest \namount of money, in comparison to the other requests, receive \nconsideration for the community.\n  I note that Senator Wyden from Oregon and Senator Boxer and Senator \nFeinstein are very supportive and cosponsors because this Klamath Basin \nis on the boundary between Oregon and California, so there is territory \nwithin both States that is affected by this disaster and would be \nassisted by this revenue.\n  So I will wrap up my remarks to give an opportunity for others to \ntake the floor, but I do ask my colleagues: We have a federally \ndeclared disaster in Oregon that needs a modest amount of help, and I \nask for the opportunity to have this request duly considered by this \nbody as this debate progresses.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on some of the \namendments before the Senate that I understand will be considered and \ncoming up for some votes. To me, they are misguided efforts as it \nrelates to how we ultimately deal with our immigration policy in this \ncountry; how we deal with the questions of national security, of our \neconomy, of our well-being.\n  I have joined in supporting and take a backseat to no one in our \nefforts to secure the borders of the United States. However, the \nmilitarizing of the border is something I clearly do not believe is in \nour collective interests.\n  Now, Senators Cornyn, Kyl, and McCain seek to offer border \nenforcement amendments to the supplemental we are debating, but these \namendments are, in my mind, merely an opportunity to grandstand instead \nof solving the country's real immigration problems.\n  These amendments would deplete critical stimulus funds that are \ngreatly needed to support a recovering economy. It is an economy that \nrecovers that ultimately generates the revenues to fund some of the \nvery initiatives we would like to see. It is important to realize that \nmany of the remaining stimulus funds--much of the funding is for \nmandatory programs. These are programs we must pay for under current \nlaw, such as unemployment insurance, food stamps, FMAP, to mention a \nfew.\n  Furthermore, there seems to be a sense of amnesia here. We have \nalready poured billions of dollars into border enforcement this year, \nmore than under the last Republican-controlled Congress. Over the last \n3 years alone, the Democratic Congress has increased U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection funding by over 23 percent, from $8 billion to about \n$10 billion. We have added an extra $1 billion for border \ninfrastructure and security activities as part of the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n  Funding for border security in the last 10 years has increased \nsubstantially, with a 127-percent increase for Customs and Border \nPatrol inspections, a 160-percent increase for border control, and a \nmonstrous 1,737-percent increase for construction and technology \npurposes--1,737 percent for construction and technology purposes.\n  These investments have fully funded over 20,000 Border Patrol \nagents--an increase of 6,000 agents or more than 50 percent since 2006. \nThis increase was at a total cost of over $3.5 billion this year. We \nhave doubled the number of Border Patrol agents in a 5-year period, and \nthe Border Patrol is better staffed and funded than at any time in its \n85-year history.\n  We completed the southwest border fence, with over 645 miles now \nunder effective control compared to 241 miles in fiscal year 2005. Over \nthe last 3 years, the Democratic-controlled Congress has invested $1.2 \nbillion to complete the fence--20 percent more than the Republican \nCongress provided for that effort.\n  We have financed advanced new border control technologies including \ncameras, radars, sensors, and command and control systems to help the \nBorder Patrol continuously monitor the border. Democrats in Congress \nprovided $421 million--more than four times what the Republican \nCongress provided--for these tools and required a high standard of \noversight and accountability to ensure these advanced technologies \nwould prove to be robust, reliable, and true force multipliers. We have \nfunded three new Predator-B unmanned aerial vehicles for long-duration \naerial surveillance of the areas between official ports of entry.\n  Customs and Border Patrol air and marine division manages the largest \nlaw enforcement air force in the world with 284 aircraft, including six \nPredator aircraft patrolling the Nation's land and sea borders to stop \nterrorists and drug smugglers before they enter the United States.\n  Since 2008, a Democratic-controlled Congress has provided $323 \nmillion--more than five times the amount previously provided by \nRepublicans--for the Unique Identity Initiative under the US-VISIT \nProgram. Democrats have also doubled funding--from $15 million in 2008 \nto $31 million in 2010--for the US-VISIT effort to review biographic, \ntravel, and biometric information of foreign visitors to the United \nStates.\n  The Border Patrol is not the only Federal agency at the border. In \nArizona alone, there are more than 6,000 Federal law enforcement \nagents--the majority employed by the Border Patrol--representing nearly \n10 agents for every mile of international line between Arizona and \nSonora, Mexico.\n  The legions of Border Patrol agents are supported by thousands of \nFederal agents from a wide spectrum of agencies, including several \nthousand Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents; 1,180 DEA agents; \n1,212 air and marine officers; 6,235 Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms \nagents; 1,419 canine enforcement teams; 280 horse patrols; 208\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nnarcotics detection teams; 32 currency detection teams; 212 narcotics-\nhuman smuggling detection teams; and 4 DEA mobile enforcement teams.\n  The number of Border Patrol agents has increased so rapidly there \naren't even enough supervisors to effectively train new agents. The GAO \nfound that the agency's ratio of agents to supervisors went from the \nnormal 5 to 1 to 11 to 1.\n  In addition to these border enforcement increases, the democratically \ncontrolled Congress has increased ICE's budget 37 percent since 2007, \nthe last year of a Republican majority in the Congress, and \nrestructured the agency's budget to target aliens with dangerous \ncriminal convictions and those who pose the greatest threat to America \nand Americans.\n  In the last 10 years, funding for immigration, customs, detention, \nand removal has increased by 170 percent. Over the last 16 months, the \nadministration's comprehensive plan to secure the southwest border has \nresulted in record seizures of illegal weapons and bulk cash transiting \nfrom the United States to Mexico, significant seizures of illegal drugs \nheading into the United States, lower violent crime rates in southwest \nborder States, and reduced illegal immigration.\n  Republicans now say we must pour more money into border security \nbefore we can address this issue comprehensively--more than everything \nI have already stated--but that has not always been their position. Let \nme read you a quote regarding border enforcement:\n\n       Despite an increase in border patrol agents from 3,600 to \n     10,000, despite quintupling the border patrol budget, despite \n     the employment of new technologies and tactics, all to \n     enforce current immigration laws, illegal immigration \n     drastically increased during the 1990s. While strengthening \n     border security is an essential component of national \n     security, it must also be accompanied by immigration reforms. \n     As long as there are jobs available in this country for \n     people who live in poverty and hopelessness in other \n     countries, these people will risk their lives to cross our \n     borders, no matter how formidable the barriers, and most will \n     be successful.\n\n  I ask you, who made the statement against border security policies \nand in favor of comprehensive immigration reform? It was our colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, on March 30, 2006.\n  Here is another quote:\n\n       For those who say let's just enforce our laws, I remind \n     them that some of our laws are unenforceable. My conservative \n     friends are the first ones to point out that the 1986 law is \n     not an effective law. It is unenforceable. And until we \n     change it, we are not going to be able to just enforce the \n     laws.\n\n  That was our colleague from Arizona, John Kyl, in 2007.\n  I could go on and on about the comments made in the past. I agree in \nthose respects with Senator McCain's and Senator Kyl's past statements \nthat we certainly need comprehensive immigration reform to achieve the \ngoal of reestablishing the rule of law and fixing our broken \nimmigration system.\n  Even former Bush administration Secretary of Homeland Security Tom \nRidge wrote in a 2006 op-ed that gaining ``operational control of the \nborders is impossible, unless our efforts are coupled with a robust \ntemporary guest worker program and a means to entice those now working \nillegally out of the shadows into some type of legal status.''\n  Now, ``border security first'' has been the strategy used by the \nCongress and the Federal Government for the past 17 years. My \nunderstanding of the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same \nthing, do more of it, and get the same result. That is a recipe for \nfailure.\n  Several of my colleagues and I have put forward an immigration \nframework as an invitation to our Republican colleagues to join us in \nsomething that is critical to the national security of the United \nStates, critical to the economy of the United States, and critical so \nthat American citizens and legal permanent residents do not face what \nthey are facing. I have over 200 cases of U.S. citizens and legal \npermanent residents of the United States--people who obey the law, \nfollow the rules and the process, are here legally--who have been \nunlawfully detained in violation of their constitutional rights. In \nsome cases, American citizens have been detained for months before \ntheir citizenship was established.\n  Who among us in this Chamber is willing to accept second-class \ncitizenship simply because of the happenstance of who they are, what \nthey look like, what their accent may be, or the happenstance of where \nthey happen to reside? But that has happened to U.S. citizens and legal \npermanent residents. Then we have laws that exacerbate those \npossibilities of expanding. I do not accept that any citizen of the \nUnited States is a second-class citizen of this country.\n  Our national security, our framework, incorporates many of our \nRepublican colleagues' ideas. It makes for an even more robust border \nenforcement process, in a way that deals with national security. The \nframework includes increases in Border Patrol and technology.\n  At the same time, we can never have national security if we don't \nknow who is here to pursue the American dream versus who might be here \nto do it damage. Unless we bring millions of people out of the darkness \ninto the light and find out why they are here, what is their purpose, \nand do a criminal background check on them and make them law-abiding \ninsofar as they will be able to contribute to the national good, pay \ntaxes, go through the background check, and learn English, and after a \nlong set of years have an opportunity to adjust their status in this \ncountry, millions will be in the shadows, and we have no idea if they \nare here to pursue the American dream or to do it harm.\n  By having people come forth as the law, as we suggest, becomes \nreality and being able to register in a temporary status, we bring \npeople out of the darkness into the light. We create an opportunity to \ndo criminal background checks to make sure they have been in other \nrespects law-abiding and that they are here to pursue the dreams that \nmillions of immigrants who came to this country and contributed to the \nvitality of this Nation have enormously.\n  But we will never know who is here to pursue that dream versus who is \nhere to do it harm if they stay in the shadows. That is not in the \ninterest of the national security of the United States.\n  The reaction to the Arizona law illustrates that Latinos, Asians, and \nothers do not believe they are second-class citizens in this country. I \nhave nothing in my possession that presents that I am a U.S. citizen, \neven though I was born in the great city of New York. I have nothing \nthat ultimately says that I am such. I don't carry my birth certificate \nor my passport around with me. In essence, I was born here, but if I \nwant to travel to another State that says that simple lawful contact \nwith a citizen--well, lawful contact with a citizen is a police officer \non foot patrol who comes up to a group of citizens; lawful contact with \na citizen is a patrol car that comes up to a group of day laborers on a \ncorner; lawful contact is anywhere a police officer might well be in \ncontact with any citizen. Now the idea that, well, this person gives me \nreason to suspect that somehow they are here in an undocumented \nfashion--and that process, even before the Arizona law, has led to U.S. \ncitizens and legal permanent residents being unlawfully detained in the \nUnited States. I guess until it happens to one of us, we don't quite \nfeel the same way. But I believe any citizen in this country is not a \nsecond-class citizen.\n  I am also worried when one group of people in our country becomes a \nsuspect class--when one group of people is blamed for all the ills of \nthe Nation. History teaches us when that happens, it has a very sad \nending. It has a very sad and dangerous ending. We cannot let that \nhappen in the United States of America. It is not who we are as a \npeople. It is not who we are as a nation.\n  I believe there is much that hopefully will be in common. We believe \njointly that the national security of the United States is about \ncontrolling and protecting our borders, but how we do it is going to be \nvery important. It is about the national economy of this country \nbecause, I just have to be honest with you, we have to be honest with \nwhat elements of our economy--even in this challenging economy, \nelements of our economy that are done by immigrant workers.\n  If you had breakfast this morning and you had fruit, it was probably \npicked by the bent back of an immigrant worker. If you had chicken for\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\ndinner last night, it was probably plucked by the cut-up hands of an \nimmigrant worker. If you slept in one of the hotels or motels of the \nbyways of our cities, it was probably cleaned by the hands of an \nimmigrant worker. If you have a loved one who is infirm, probably their \ndaily needs are being taken care of by the steady hand and warm heart \nof an immigrant worker.\n  I could go on and on. I believe this is also about our national \neconomy. For so long as we permit a subclass to be exploited in an \neconomy it hurts the wages of all others in an economy, and only \nbringing them out of the darkness and into the light will create a \nbetter circumstance in which we will not have such exploitation.\n  I do this all by way of background that says if the amendments that \nare now going to be proceeded on--the Cornyn amendment and the Kyl \nsecond degree--pour billions into perpetuating an inadequate strategy \nthat would not solve the problem, dumping $1.9 billion in additional \npersonnel, technology, and resources along the border, when in fact we \nhave a set of circumstances where that has shown itself time and time \nagain not to have been the successful strategy.\n  It is interesting that some of the State and local grant programs for \nborder security have led to a misuse of funds and costly litigation. \nThe Arizona Daily Star investigation found that funding for State and \nlocal grant programs was used to compensate officer time for issuing \ntraffic citations, crowd control at parades and soccer games, attending \na funeral, monitoring gun shows, and responding to calls about loud \nmusic. That isn't about border enforcement.\n  The McCain amendment appropriates $250 million, offset with Recovery \nAct funds. Deployments would be required to start within 72 hours of \npassage and last until the Department of Defense and Department of \nHomeland Security certify they have operational control of the border. \nThis amendment would place a significant burden on National Guard \ntroops who are already overburdened and interfere with the President's \nauthority to deploy troops. We are already using the National Guard in \nunprecedented ways in deployments abroad. The President's authority is \naffected. I know the administration strongly opposes it.\n  General Jones, the National Security Adviser; John Brennan, Assistant \nto the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism said in an \nattached letter to Senator Levin:\n\n       There is no modern precedent for Congress to direct the \n     President to deploy troops in the manner sought by the \n     amendment. It represents an unwarranted interference with the \n     Commander-in-Chief's responsibilities to direct the \n     employment of our Armed Forces.\n\n  It would also interfere with the administration's comprehensive \nborder security plan.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. For all of these reasons, I am in strong opposition to \nthese amendments. I certainly urge their defeat. We are going to send \nbillions more after billions that have already been sent to accomplish \nthe same negative result, and your own words speak to the very essence \nof how we get to a solution, which is to pursue a comprehensive nature \nto this reality.\n  If you want to ensure a continuing set of circumstances in which law \nenforcement turns U.S. citizens into second-class citizens, then vote \nfor the amendments. But otherwise, you should oppose them.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask through the Chair, both the McCain amendment and \nthe Cornyn amendment appear to be paid for out of funds that have \nalready been allocated for creating new jobs in America--the stimulus \nfunds we have voted for. If they are successful in these amendments, \nthey would be reducing the funds that are being used to hire people in \nNew Jersey, Illinois, Minnesota, and other places to go to work. Is \nthat the way the Senator from New Jersey sees it?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes. The Senator is correct. In addition, some of the \nfunding they take is from already mandated programs, programs that are \ncritical to citizens and communities and States, and they would, in \nessence, detract from those mandated programs for which there is a \nFederal obligation to move it in this direction, at the same time \ndecreasing the job opportunities at a time in which we are trying to \ngrow this economy, not contract it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask through the Chair, if the Senator will yield \nfurther, do I understand the statement that was sent by the \nadministration, the National Security Adviser, that the McCain \namendment would circumvent the power of the President to deploy troops \nin the United States in the manner sought by this amendment, an \nunwarranted interference with the Commander in Chief's responsibility \nfor the direct deployment of our Armed Forces? And this McCain \namendment by Senator John McCain--I kind of recall speeches from the \nother side of the aisle about the right of the Commander in Chief, the \npower of the President--this McCain amendment would spend $250 million \nand allocate 6,000 National Guard troops to start within 72 hours, a \nmobilization within 72 hours of troops to the border. Is that the way \nthe Senator from New Jersey reads this amendment?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The Senator from Illinois is correct. As a matter of \nfact, the same letter he read from General Jones, the National Security \nAdviser, and John Brennan, the Assistant to the President for Homeland \nSecurity and Counterterrorism, said:\n\n       There is no modern precedent for Congress to direct the \n     President to deploy troops in the manner sought by that \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question, it \nwould seem, since two of these three amendments are emanating from the \nState of Arizona, there is a free-for-all in Arizona to think of more \nextreme ways to respond to what they consider to be a political \nsituation there, from the passage of the legislation--and I concur with \nthe analysis of the Senator from New Jersey of it--and now $2\\1/4\\ \nbillion dollars to be sent down for other--I am sorry, that includes \nthe Cornyn amendment, the Senator from Texas. It is $200 million for \nSenator Kyl--let's say $450 million between Senators McCain and Kyl, \nmoney to be sent into this Arizona situation.\n  I wonder if we shouldn't declare a time out in Arizona for at least \nsome thoughtful reflection about what works and what doesn't. It seems \nthere is no end to ideas that are being propounded down there to \nrespond to situations real and imagined. These amendments are clear \nevidence.\n  I don't know if the Senator from New Jersey sees it the same way.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the question and view of the Senator from \nIllinois. Yes, that is why I said I respect the previous positions \nSenator McCain had. He understood that you cannot solve this problem by \nthrowing more money, more troops at it. At the end of the day, that has \nnot achieved all the goals, despite enormous increases. And yet there \nare still challenges.\n  In view of the fact the President himself--something I personally \ndon't support but nonetheless has gone ahead and made a deployment on \nhis own, it seems to me we should see what works before we advance \nbillions for efforts and directing troops by an amendment when those \ntroops could be needed for a whole host of things.\n  I have to be honest with you. If we are going to start directing \ntroops, then I wish to see them directed to the gulf so, in fact, we \ncan help out with the oilspill not getting into critical wetlands and \nestuaries. I think that is a national emergency.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask through the Chair one last question. I don't know \nwhat the situation is with the New Jersey Guard, but many of the \nIllinois Guard have been deployed and redeployed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan at great inconvenience and hardship to their families. The \nMcCain amendment calls for deployment within 72 hours. People will \nliterally be removed from their families and on the road headed down to \nArizona within 72 hours under the McCain amendment.\n  I ask the Senator if he has dealt with these Guard families and has \nany idea what impact this might have on their lives.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the Senator's question. The fact is, as I \nmentioned earlier in my comments, we have used the National Guard in an \nunprecedented way. They have been called for deployment abroad, both in \nIraq and Afghanistan, and elsewhere in unprecedented numbers. The \nstress we\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\nhave created on the force by virtue of these two continuing \nengagements, as well as any other national emergency that might occur, \nis incredibly challenging. It is real challenging to those forces. My \nview is the Senator is right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I engage in a colloquy with my friend \nfrom Wyoming for 1 minute?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand the Senator from Illinois was talking about \nArizona and the border. I wonder if the Senator from Illinois has ever \nbeen to the Arizona border. He has?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is that a question to me?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know if it is proper. But, yes, I have been to \nNogales and both sides of the border.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is pronounced Nogales.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I have been there, on both sides of the border. You \nare always welcome to come to Illinois, too.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And I have been there many times. It is obvious the \nSenator from Illinois, even though he has been there, has no conception \nof what the people who live in southern Arizona are suffering under \nwith hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and human smugglers \nand drug smuggling going through our State.\n  I am glad he is such an expert--he and the Senator from New Jersey--\non the issue of the terrible problems that afflict our State and our \nneed to try to get our borders secure, which every citizen has the \nright to expect.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Shawn Whitman\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is with great pride as well as regret \nthat I rise today in the Senate to recognize a great son of the State \nof Wyoming. He is my chief of staff, Shawn Whitman. He joins me today \non the Senate floor. Shawn is leaving the Senate this month after a \nconsummate career working for our State and for our country.\n  Many in the Senate know Shawn. To know him is to like him. He was the \nchief of staff for our late Senator Craig Thomas. For nearly 3 years, \nhe has continued in that role serving me. In all of that time, he has \ndemonstrated what it means to be a loyal and trusted adviser, a \nsuperior manager, and a terrific friend.\n  I know that all in the Senate will want to join me in wishing Shawn \nwell and to thank his wife Kristen and his two daughters, Lauren and \nKatherine, for sharing their dad with us. All of us are sorry to see \nhim go, and we will miss him.\n  Shawn has actually served three different Wyoming Senators. He began \nin 1994 right after he graduated from the University of Wyoming. He \ncame to work as an intern for Senator Al Simpson. Later he joined \nSenator Thomas's staff and filled just about every role, every position \nthat a congressional office can have. He was actually a receptionist. \nHe was a press intern. He was a staff assistant. He was legislative \ncorrespondent, legislative assistant, senior legislative assistant, \nlegislative director, and finally chief of staff.\n  It is the example of Shawn's career path that defines the character \nof who he is. He completed every task, whatever was asked of him, \nequally well. He brought enthusiasm, smarts, and good humor to every \njob from the front desk to the corner office.\n  It is his willingness to do whatever is needed and to take on any \ntask. That is what makes him so valuable and such a great friend.\n  Shawn was truly tested. In June of 2007, Wyoming lost a great friend \nwhen we lost Senator Craig Thomas. As some of my colleagues know, after \nSenator Thomas's passing, Shawn led the staff alone. He kept them \ntogether in serving the people of Wyoming, even while the Senate seat \nremained empty.\n  In the face of this extraordinary challenge, at a time of great \nsorrow for our State, Shawn continued to lead. Despite his own sorrow \nand his own grieving, he led others. Shawn showed grace and confidence \nthrough it all.\n  Perhaps it was his early years working the family ranch outside \nLaramie, WY, that made him so tough. It is his sense of duty, once \nagain doing the job that needed to be done and completing the task, any \ntask that was required.\n  It was my good fortune to inherit Shawn Whitman. We hardly knew each \nother when I was sworn into the Senate. It did not take me long to \nunderstand his value and to appreciate--fully appreciate--his \nindispensable leadership.\n  President Eisenhower once talked about the many jobs he had \nthroughout his private career, his military career, and finally as \nPresident. He said his goal was, whenever he was leaving a job, the \npeople there were sorry to see him go. Shawn Whitman personifies that. \nEveryone in our office--everyone--is sorry to see him go. All who have \nhad the pleasure and the privilege to know Shawn Whitman in the Senate \nwill miss him as he starts a new chapter in his life.\n  Shawn leaves the Senate with a wonderful reputation--a reputation for \nintegrity and a reputation for leadership, and not just for Wyoming but \nfor the entire Senate, as Shawn led not just my office, but he also led \nthe organization of the Senate chiefs of staff. He was the chief of all \nthe chiefs.\n  Shawn has been a trusted adviser, manager, a confidante, and a friend \nto me and to my wife Bobbi. His service has been invaluable.\n  While I am losing a very important member of my staff, I know I will \nnot be losing his friendship, his advice, and his counsel for the \nfuture.\n  It is here today on the Senate floor that I say: Thank you, Shawn. \nThank you for your service to the Senate, to the country and, most \nimportantly, to the people of Wyoming. I wish you well in all you do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nan issue that is of great concern to my State of Florida, as well as to \nall the Gulf States--in fact, to the entire United States of America--\nand that is this ongoing spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  It has been a month since the time this spill started, and the oil \ncontinues to flow out of the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico at a rate \nthat has not yet been determined but appears to be thousands of gallons \na day. We see those pictures on television now of the flow, and despite \nthe efforts to siphon off some of that oil, more and more enters the \nGulf of Mexico. It does so despite attempts by British Petroleum and \nothers in the unified command to stop this flow of oil.\n  We are now on the fourth or fifth possible solution to cap the well. \nIn fact, they are going to try to cap the well tonight. I believe, as \nwe get on to each of these solutions, they are less and less likely to \nsucceed. So as ADM Thad Allen, who is the incident commander, the \nadmiral in charge of the Coast Guard, told us at his briefing just 2 \ndays ago, we are unlikely to see this oil stop spilling into the gulf \nuntil the relief wells are drilled, and fully drilled, which could be \nas late as August. It could be later. What does that mean? That means \nthis oilspill, which is now stretching over miles and miles in the \ngulf, is only going to get bigger. What we see on the surface may not \nbe the extent of the spill. The plume of oil underneath may be far \nworse.\n  In the wake of this tragedy, I sent a letter to British Petroleum's \nCEO, Tony Hayward, and I requested that BP set aside $1 billion so that \nthe five Gulf States would have that money available today to help stop \nthe oil from reaching our shores and to mitigate the damage once it \ndid. The response I received in a letter yesterday, although it wasn't \nthis emphatic, was no.\n  They have given some money to the Gulf States. My home State of \nFlorida\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nhas received about $50 million, which is appreciated, but it is not \ngoing to be near enough if and when this oil comes ashore in Florida. \nWhere will the oil come ashore? Will it be in the panhandle or western \nFlorida? Will it be in Tampa Bay? Naples? Will it get into the Loop \nCurrent and go into the Florida Keys, the Florida Bay, Ten Thousand \nIslands, and run up the eastern side of the United States, up past \nMiami, Fort Lauderdale, or Palm Beach? We just don't know. But if and \nwhen this oil does come ashore in Florida, it will be a disaster. Right \nnow, it is not there, as far as we know. Right now, those beaches are \nstill pristine. Right now, we continue to welcome people to Florida to \ncome and visit, to come and fish and do all the things they would \nnormally do on vacation. Florida is open for business. But we cannot \nsit around and wait for the oil to come.\n  I am very concerned not only about the failure of British Petroleum \nto stop this oil from leaking, but I am concerned at the efforts that \nhave been taken by this administration. I don't mean to say this in a \npartisan way because it could have been another administration that was \non watch when this happened, and certainly the problems we have go back \nbeyond the time of this administration. But I think it is fair to say, \nhaving looked at this now for a month's time, that where we are today \nis not acceptable. It is not acceptable that oil is washing up on the \nshore, on the beaches of Louisiana and into their marshes. That is not \nacceptable. That is a failure--a failure of the administration, a \nfailure of our government, a failure of British Petroleum. And I don't \nwant to be there when the oil washes up on the shore in Mississippi, \nAlabama, in Florida, or Texas, for that matter.\n  The question I have is, What is the plan? What is the plan of our \ngovernment, since British Petroleum can't solve this problem on its \nown? What is the plan to stop the oil from coming ashore? What are we \ndoing now besides relying upon British Petroleum to drill these relief \nwells?\n  There have been proposals that have come to the floor offered by my \ncolleague from New Jersey and my colleague from Florida and others on \nthe Democratic side to set up $10 billion--to raise the cap on \ncompensation claims from the current law, which only allows for $75 \nmillion. Senators Vitter, myself, Murkowski, and others have a similar \nbut different bill that would have an expedited compensation process \nwhich would not go to a $10 billion cap but, instead, look to the \nprofits of the company, which in this case would move the cap up to \nabout $20 billion.\n  A lot of times partisanship rules the day in the Senate. This should \nnot be one of them. Our differences are not so great that we should not \nbe able to bridge them and come to a resolution.\n  Senator Menendez has offered his amendment and asked unanimous \nconsent that it be brought up. It has been objected to, and I \nunderstand the reasons why. Senator Vitter has offered up his and my \nproposal. It has been objected to by Democrats.\n  We should be able to get past this and figure out a solution. We \nbelieve our proposal is better. We believe it is better because if you \nset it at $10 billion, you are only going to allow two or three oil \ncompanies in the world to exist. You will potentially put all the rest \nout of business. Under our proposal, more than $10 billion will be \nrecovered from BP for this incident and still let other companies \nparticipate. Plus, by having the claims process go forward now, we \ncould get relief to people who need it.\n  I think it is a better proposal. But that is a question worthy of \ndebate, and we should be able to come to consensus on that and not have \na partisan play on it.\n  I want to talk a minute about the Minerals Management Service. These \nare the folks within the Department of the Interior who are charged \nwith overseeing drilling. By anybody's account, what they have done is \na failure. We see the administration is now breaking them up into two \nseparate units under the Department of the Interior. That may be fine \ngoing forward, but let's look back.\n  A report recently released by the inspector general of the Department \nof the Interior suggests a culture of corruption littered with several \nshocking conflicts of interest and professional malfeasance at the \nMinerals Management Service.\n  Among the findings, the report suggests the employees regularly \naccepted gifts from those they were charged to oversee; that there was \na revolving door of employment in which regulators took jobs in the oil \nindustry over which they had previously held regulatory authority; and \nit even suggests the oil industry officials were allowed to fill out \nsafety oversight forms in pencil only to have the MMS employees trace \nover them in pen. This is not acceptable, to say the least. There is an \napparent and obvious lack of oversight.\n  It would seem that the response to the spill itself certainly should \nhave been more effective. I want to point this Chamber to an April 29, \n2010, story by the Mobile Press-Register where it says that Federal \nofficials, including former NOAA oil response coordinators, had a 1994 \nplan to respond to oilspills in the Gulf of Mexico, such as the one we \nare experiencing today. The former NOAA oilspill response coordinator, \nRon Gouget, has said a plan was in place to immediately begin--in situ, \nwhich is a fancy word for in place or on location--oil burning. Yet it \ntook more than 1 week for officials to conduct a test burn.\n  Why is that important? If there were a plan that was in place to burn \nthe oil as soon as it came out of the wellhead, we might have been able \nto stop this vast plume and expansion of oil over the Gulf of Mexico. \nWe might have been able to stop the oil from washing ashore in \nLouisiana and potentially washing ashore in Texas, Mississippi, and \nFlorida.\n  Why do you have to burn early? You have to burn early, as was \nexplained to me by the Coast Guard when, about 2 weeks ago, I flew over \nthe wellhead and saw the oil and the tar floating on the top of the \nGulf of Mexico, you have to burn early because if the oil mixes with \nthe water it loses its ability to be flammable. So the plan, if this \nreport from the Mobile Register is right, was correct that you have to \nburn immediately in order to have the largest effect.\n  The plan called for multiple fire booms. This is the booming, the \nmaterial that you see that, hopefully, keeps the oil from spilling onto \nour shores. There is also something called fire booming or fire booms, \nwhich is what you put around the area you are burning in order to \ncontain the fire. The plan called for multiple fire booms to be \navailable and deployed to deal with a spill of this magnitude. But \nFederal officials instead had no booms on hand and had to go out and \nlocate fire booms in the private sector, purchase it, and then \ntransport it to the gulf region.\n  Mr. Gouget, who is the former oil response coordinator, believes that \n95 percent of the oil could have been captured through the timely \nexecuted burning.\n  I know there were weather conditions, but if that problem had been \njumped on right away perhaps we would not see oil in the marshes of \nLouisiana. Perhaps we would not see oil on the beaches of Louisiana. \nPerhaps we would not see what may eventually come, which is oil on the \nbeaches of other States in the gulf, including Florida.\n  Being from Florida, I have had the opportunity to be around some very \ngood leaders in times of emergencies--Governor Jeb Bush, Governor \nCharlie Crist, people I worked with when we had hurricanes and \ntornadoes and other natural disasters. We know something about this in \nFlorida. The lesson of these disasters is this: You have to respond to \nthem immediately with overwhelming resources. You may over-respond, as \nhindsight will show you, because the disaster may not turn out to be \nmuch of a disaster. But that is a cost worth incurring.\n  What you should not do is fail to respond quickly and let the \ndisaster get out of control. Small problems become big problems. That \ncertainly seems to be the case here. We are going to learn more over \ntime about what happened with MMS and the Department of the Interior \nand what happened with British Petroleum and Transocean. But right now \nit seems pretty apparent this Federal Government and British Petroleum \nwere not properly prepared because there is an outcome we have to \nevaluate. If the oil is washing ashore,\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\nwe have failed. The government has failed and BP has failed.\n  Frankly, I am concerned that we are not reacting to this disaster in \na way that we should. We are not giving it the proper response it \ndeserves.\n  I have heard this disaster called a slow-moving Katrina, and I think \nthat is right. But just because it moves slowly doesn't mean the \nFederal Government should. Everything must be done now. I know there \nare good people working on this. I have tremendous respect for Admiral \nAllen of the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard does exceptional work. But \nthis is a results-oriented issue. If the oil is washing ashore, then \nthe Federal Government and BP have failed. Before the oil washes ashore \nin Texas or Mississippi or Alabama or Florida, everything should be \ndone that can be done to stop it. I don't have the feeling that is what \nis being done.\n  I will continue to come to the Senate floor to talk about this issue \nas time goes on. I am urging the President of the United States to give \nthis the focus and attention it deserves. There is no more important \nproblem facing us in the short term than this oilspill.\n  My home State of Florida right now is suffering through the worst \nrecession we have had in anybody's memory. Unemployment is 12 percent. \nWe are either No. 1 or No. 2 in terms of the most mortgage foreclosures \nin the country. Our business has come to a grinding halt. While there \nare signs of optimism, while we see things getting better in some \nsectors, and we have to remain hopeful--and Florida, we know, will \nsucceed--this is a very difficult time.\n  If this oil comes ashore--and, thank God, it has not so far--but if \nand when it does, it is not only going to have a disastrous impact on \nour environment and potentially impact 1,000 miles of coastline in \nFlorida, but it is going to impact our economy. Florida welcomes more \nthan 80 million tourists a year. They come to Florida for a lot of \nreasons, but one of the reasons they come is for our beautiful beaches, \nsome of the most beautiful beaches in the world, especially in the \nFlorida Panhandle. If that oil comes ashore, it is going to be \ndevastating to our economy.\n  That is not good for Florida. It is not good for America. This crisis \ndemands a sense of urgency that it has not received, in my humble \nopinion, up until now. I call upon this administration to put forth \nevery effort and to tell us what the plan is to stop this oil from \ncoming ashore in States such as Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, H.R. 4899, the fiscal year 2010 \nsupplemental appropriations bill, provides the funds requested by the \nPresident for emergency assistance for Haiti related to the January 12 \nearthquake. In fact it provides approximately $25 million more than the \nrequest.\n  Although the bulk of those funds are to address the immediate needs \nof shelter, health care, agriculture and food security, and governance, \nseveral Senators, particularly Senator Landrieu and Senator Gillibrand, \nhave rightly pointed out that half of Haiti's children are not in \nschool and the country suffers from an extremely high rate of \nilliteracy and a tiny fraction of the trained professionals it needs. \nThere is a dire need for school construction and equipment, teacher \ntraining, and other education assistance for Haiti's children as well \nas high school, vocational, college and graduate students. Haiti's \nfuture depends on an educated workforce, and the earthquake has focused \nattention on this need as the country struggles to recover from this \nlatest catastrophe.\n  For this reason, the bill includes up to $10 million for education \nprograms which the Appropriations Committee included even though it was \nnot in the President's request. This is admittedly only a small amount \nto begin to address Haiti's education needs. Fortunately other donors, \nincluding the Inter-American Development Bank and Canada, are expected \nto provide significantly more funds.\n  Haiti will require international assistance for years to come. I hope \nthat in future budget requests the administration will include \nsubstantially more resources to combat illiteracy and train Haiti's \nfuture workforce, because over the long term it would be hard to think \nof a better investment in that country.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I wish today to speak about my grave \nconcern for the children of Haiti. Last month, Senator Landrieu and I \ntraveled to Haiti, where we met with President Preval and First Lady \nElisabeth Delatour Preval. We heard firsthand from the President and \nFirst Lady that if they are ever going to rebuild their nation, their \nchildren need better access to publicly funded quality education.\n  As everyone knows, Haiti faced incredible challenges even before the \ndevastating earthquake. As a result, children who were already facing \nalmost insurmountable odds are now all the more desperate.\n  I believe we have a duty to answer the call of Haiti's children \ntoday, deliver the relief they need, and help put them on a path toward \nthe quality education they deserve.\n  Even before the earthquake, only half of Haiti's children attended \nschool at all. The country has almost no public school system. In fact, \nnearly 90 percent of the schools in Haiti's education system were \nfunded and run by nonpublic operators.\n  No other country in the world faces the kinds of challenges faced \ntoday by Haiti's education system:\n  An overwhelming majority of Haiti's school-age children live in the \ncountry's rural areas, but less than a quarter of children in rural \nHaiti are actually enrolled in school.\n  The poorest of Haiti's poor are the hardest hit. Just over a third of \nHaiti's poorest 20 percent were enrolled in primary schools, compared \nto 80 percent of the country's wealthiest.\n  Of those enrolled, many graduate late or never at all because they \ncan't afford school fees, uniforms, or books or because of late \nenrollment or poor quality education.\n  Around 80 percent of children were still enrolled in primary school \nat the age of 13, beyond the age they should have started secondary \nschool.\n  Of the schools that were standing, the earthquakes caused an \nastounding $\\1/2\\ billion worth of damage.\n  We know that good opportunities in education lead to a strong \nnational economy. But these alarming statistics show just how bleak the \nstate of education is in Haiti.\n  If Haiti is ever going to rebuild and if these children are ever \ngoing to have a chance at success, Haiti needs a strong public school \nsystem to help lead the way. A strong public school system can be the \nfoundation of each community, providing a broad range of resources for \nchildren and families--from health clinics and immunizations, to \nliteracy education, job training, and nutrition.\n  It has been truly humbling and inspiring to watch the outpouring of \nsupport from America and across the globe coming to Haiti's relief. I \nsupport President Obama's request for the emergency supplemental this \nyear to fund relief and redevelopment in Haiti. I applaud Chairman \nLeahy and my dear friend Senator Landrieu's work to include funding for \nHaiti's education in this bill. These have all been lifesaving first \nsteps. But we can't stop now. It is time now to direct our efforts to \nHaiti's education system.\n  The Inter-American Development Bank, together with the Government of \nHaiti, has estimated that it would take $2 billion over 5 years to set \nup Haiti's education sector.\n  I strongly encourage President Obama and Secretary Clinton to make a \nhigh-quality public school system a top priority in our relief efforts \nfor Haiti--and begin building schools that can save lives, create real \nopportunities for the children of Haiti to succeed, and lay the \nfoundation for a Haiti rebuilt.\n\n\n                           Vetting Procedures\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that on page 16 of the supplemental \nappropriations bill, H.R. 4899, under the heading ``Afghanistan \nSecurity Forces Fund'' and on page 17 under the heading ``Iraq Security \nForces Fund,'' which appropriate funds for training, equipment, and \nother assistance for these foreign security forces, there is language \nthat makes these funds available ``notwithstanding any other provision \nof law.'' I would ask my friend, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, whether I am \ncorrect that this ``notwithstanding'' language is not intended to apply \nto the\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\n``Leahy'' vetting procedures which are designed to ensure that foreign \nsecurity forces that receive U.S. assistance have not been credibly \nalleged to have committed violations of human rights.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would say to my friend from Vermont that is correct, we \nintend those vetting procedures to apply to these funds.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, there will be no more votes today if \nwe get this agreement worked out. I appreciate everyone's patience. We \nhave worked long and hard to arrive at this point. It is never easy, as \nwe have explained on a number of occasions, but we are fortunate with \nthis bill to have two veterans of the Senate, two of the best Senators \nwho would possibly work a bill. We are fortunate that Senator Inouye \nand Senator Cochran are managing this bill. They are both gentlemen, \nand they have the best interests of the country at heart in everything \nwe do here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, May 27, after any leader \ntime, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4899 and resume \nconsideration of the following amendments in the order listed: McCain \nNo. 4214; Kyl No. 4288, second degree, as modified; Cornyn No. 4202, as \nmodified and amended, if amended; and that the Cornyn amendment be \nfurther modified with the changes at the desk; that there be a total of \n20 minutes for debate, with the time divided 5 minutes each for \nSenators McCain, Kyl, Cornyn, and Schumer or their designees, with \nrespect to the border security-related amendments; that after the first \nvote in the sequence, the succeeding votes be limited to 10 minutes \neach; that after the first vote, there be 2 minutes equally divided in \nthe usual form prior to the succeeding votes; that no amendment be in \norder to the amendments covered in this agreement other than as \nidentified in this agreement; that if a budget point of order is raised \nagainst the border security amendments, then a motion to waive a budget \npoint of order be considered made and the Senate then proceed to vote \non the motion to waive the applicable budget point of order; that if \nthe waivers are successful, then the amendments be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table; that if the waivers fail, \nthen the amendments be withdrawn; that upon disposition of the above-\nreferenced amendments, the Senate then consider the Feingold amendment \nNo. 4204 and the Coburn amendments Nos. 4231, as modified, and 4232, \nand that they be debated concurrently for a total of 15 minutes prior \nto a vote in relation thereto, with 5 minutes each under the control of \nSenators Feingold, Coburn, and Inouye or their designees; that no \namendments be in order to these amendments prior to the votes; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate then proceed to vote \nin relation to the amendments in the order listed; provided further \nthat the pending committee-reported substitute amendment not be subject \nto any rule XVI point of order; and that upon disposition of these \namendments, the Senate then proceed to vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the committee-reported substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, I would like to ask the \nleader if he would be willing to modify his request this evening to \ninclude the bipartisan amendment No. 4183 that would once and for all \neliminate secret holds here in the Senate.\n  Senator Grassley and I, as part of a large, bipartisan group, have \ncome to the floor of the Senate again and again simply seeking to \nabolish secrecy, not holds, in the way business is done in the Senate. \nThese secret holds are an indefensible violation of the public's right \nto know.\n  I ask the leader at this time if he would be willing to modify his \nrequest to include this bipartisan amendment No. 4183 to finally \neliminate secret holds in the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the exemplary work of my friend from Oregon. \nI, of course, would accept the modification, but my accepting the \nmodification would take the concurrence of the Republicans.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, I am constrained to \nadvise the leader and the Senator from Oregon that on behalf of the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, I would be forced to object to \nthat.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Further reserving the right to object, I would inquire at \nthis point of the majority leader--and I appreciate the graciousness of \nthe leader and Senator Cochran as well--if he would agree to a consent \nagreement this evening that would provide for the consideration of a \nbipartisan resolution eliminating secret holds at a later point but \nprior to the July 4 recess and that that debate be limited to 2 hours, \nwith no amendments in order to the resolution, and that upon the use or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate would then proceed to vote \nadoption of the resolution?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, he knows how much I support his \nefforts. But I haven't had the opportunity to speak to Senator \nMcConnell. It wouldn't be appropriate for me to agree to something \nwithout consulting with him. I can't consult with him now. I will do \neverything within my abilities here to work this out so that prior to \nthe end of our next work period, we will get this done.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Further reserving the right to object--and I will be \nbrief--I thank the leader, the distinguished Senator from Nevada. His \ndesire to finally end secret holds is clear. All Americans should \nunderstand that the Senator from Nevada has worked very closely with \nSenator Grassley and me on this. I appreciate the Senator's statement \ntonight that he will try to get an up-or-down vote on this matter \nbefore the end of the next work period.\n  With that, I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, can I ask \nfor a clarification if this would prevent a pathway through which my \namendment No. 4251 might be considered?\n  Mr. REID. It would prevent a pathway, yes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Reserving the right to object, this is an amendment that \naddresses the terrible drought we have in southern Oregon. Of course, \nwe are addressing many natural disasters, and we have a natural \ndisaster, a federally declared natural disaster in Oregon, in which we \nhave been seeking to have a conversation about spending $10 million on \nthe front end of what is a terrible situation: the worst drought in \nrecorded history of the Klamath Basin, with 1,400 farming families and \n200,000 acres affected.\n  I was seeking the opportunity to have a discussion and a vote on this \nwhich, in consultation with the committee, the esteemed Chair and his \nteam had suggested a pathway. It would mean a tremendous amount to the \nfamilies in trouble to have their disaster considered while we are \naddressing other national disasters. This is the moment. This is the \nmoment when we can still have an impact, through land idling and the \npumping of water, to save families' financial foundations and, for a \nfew families, through the pumping of water, to save their farming \nseason.\n  If my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would be amenable, I \nwould certainly ask this request be amended to allow a debate and a \nvote on amendment No. 4251.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the good will of my friend from \nOregon. I would be happy to work with my friend. But at this stage, as \nthe Senator understands, this is two pieces of legislation we got from \nthe President--one dealing with emergencies. FEMA is out of money, \ntotally out of money. This will replenish the money. And there will be \nopportunities for FEMA, when we do this, to have the ability to do some \nthings such as helping the State of Oregon and other problems.\n  As we all know, there is going to have to be some work done with the \ngulf. So I will be happy to work with my friend in any way I can, but I \nthink at this stage this bill has been through a lot already. Not only \ndo we have the\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\nemergencies dealing with the normal emergencies that come about as a \nresult of floods, fires, and all this, we also have the troops who have \nto be taken care of. We must get this done. We are running out of money \nthere.\n  If the Senator wishes to modify the amendment, I, of course, have no \nobjection there. I will work with the Senator to try to find some \npathway to do this. A modification is fine. But I want to make sure the \nSenator understands that at this stage we will have to try to figure \nout something separate and apart from this consent request.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Reserving the right to object--I thank the leader--it is \nvery hard for me to go and explain to folks in Oregon we have \ncalamities in other parts of the country being addressed and this one \nis not. I would greatly appreciate the unanimous consent to modify my \namendment. I do understand from what the Senator has said there is \nprobably not a pathway to have it considered. But I would appreciate \nthe Senator's support and my colleagues' support from Mississippi to \ntry to--there should be no party line when it comes to addressing a \nfederally declared disaster.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, most of the things that are \nlisted here emergencywise--they are not coming to Democratic States. We \nhave had these acts of God in most instances that happen where they \nhappen. We have two Senators from Tennessee, and this has nothing to do \nwith partisanship. But I am committed to help my friend from Oregon. We \nhave other problems similar to that in Oregon, and I would be happy to \nwork with the distinguished Senator from Oregon, who is always very \nreasonable. I will do what I can to work with the Senator and Senator \nWyden to make sure we take care of Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I very much, thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request of \nthe majority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment, amendment No. 4251.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the submitted \namendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak for 10 minutes as in morning business. I will be speaking on the \nsupplemental bill, however.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nfiscal year 2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act. It represents what is \nreprehensible about the conduct of the Federal Government: unchecked, \nunpaid for, deficit spending. After a trillion dollar ``stimulus,'' a \ntrillion dollar health care bill, and huge increases in the budgets of \nthe bureaucracy, Americans are fed up with Congress's out-of-control \nspending. Our constituents have had enough, and they have asked us to \nrein in spending. Unfortunately, rather than listen to their cries, we \nhave another appropriations bill that represents the same old, same \nold.\n  Of the nearly $59 billion of spending in this bill, all but $103 \nmillion is designated ``emergency'' spending. What does ``emergency'' \nspending actually mean, and what are these emergencies the Nation is \nfacing?\n  Emergency spending means deficit spending. It means we are spending \nmoney that we as a nation do not have. An emergency designation \nrelieves Congress of the burden and the responsibility of coming up \nwith ways to pay for the spending. We are continuing to make purchases \non the taxpayer's credit card, knowing full well we have no plans to \npay back the loan. We have already maxed out the credit card. The \ncompany just has not found out yet.\n  Some programs under this bill may be considered true emergencies. \nThere are unforeseen disasters, such as flooding and oilspills. But \nthere are also disasters that occurred years ago that would receive \nfunding under this legislation. Funding may be needed for those \nprograms, but the lack of funding was certainly not unexpected and \nshould have been in last year's and this year's regular budget and \nappropriations process. But appropriations and budgeting have been so \ndisfigured, contorted, abused, and ignored by lawmakers in recent years \nthat the system is broken, and you have a series of omnibus and \n``emergency'' or supplemental bills. It is not the way to do it.\n  Even in the writeup of this legislation, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee noted that the $5.1 billion for the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund \nis necessary to pay for known costs for past disasters, such as \nHurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike, and Gustav, the Midwest floods of 2008, \nand the California wildfires, as well as needs that emerge with new \ndisasters.\n  The bill also provides $13.4 billion in mandatory funding for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for disability compensation to Vietnam \nveterans to implement a recent decision by the VA to expand the number \nof illnesses presumed to be related to exposure to Agent Orange. There \nis no doubt Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange should be properly \ncompensated, but Congress and the administration must find a way to pay \nfor these programs without spending money we do not have and do not \nintend to pay back. There is no plan to pay back.\n\n  I want to make very clear my strong support for our Nation's veterans \nand the current members of our Armed Forces and the vital work they are \ndoing in the world every day. I have the greatest admiration for \ntoday's service members and veterans for their commitment to preserving \nour freedoms and maintaining our national security. I must question, \nhowever, using their sacrifices to justify irresponsible spending by \nthis Congress.\n  Congress must pass this bill to keep the necessary resources going to \nour military. America has deployed our young men and women to defend \nour Nation's interests, and they deserve no less than having the \nfunding and equipment necessary to carry out their missions. But some \nin Congress do not see this as just about the military. They see it as \nan opportunity to add their pet programs to the shoulders of our Armed \nForces. No one wants to leave our military operations unfunded, so our \nmilitary needs are being used to leverage support for nonemergency, \ndeficit spending.\n  To be fair, the Appropriations Committee found some offsets for the \nspending in this bill. Unfortunately, the offsets only account for .17 \nof 1 percent of the total cost of the bill--not even a quarter of a \npercent of the cost of the bill: .17 of 1 percent of the bill. You \nwould think we could at least hit the 1-percent mark. Mr. President, \n.17 percent is all that is offset in this bill. That is wrong.\n  Senator Coburn and Senator McCain have offered amendments that would \noffset or pay for the larger costs of this legislation. Tomorrow \nmorning we will get to vote on those, and I hope we will take them into \nconsideration and make sure this is paid for. I hope all my colleagues \nwill take a look at those amendments.\n  The funding cut proposals are reasonable. They are well thought out. \nThey are ideas that will help us responsibly address the serious \nspending problems this Congress has. It is time for Congress to step up \nand start making the hard decisions of prioritizing Federal spending.\n  The American people have made it clear that Congress needs to be \nfiscally responsible. They have made it clear they do not support our \nspending billions of taxpayer dollars with little or no debate. We have \nbeen asking Americans to tighten their spending belts and take \nresponsibility for their personal debt. It is about time the \nrepresentatives of the people do the same.\n  In April 2009, when making an emergency supplemental appropriations \nrequest, President Obama said:\n\n       We should not label military costs as emergency funds so as \n     to avoid our responsibility to abide by the spending \n     limitations set forth by the Congress. After years of budget \n     gimmicks and wasteful spending, it is time\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\n     to end the era of irresponsibility in Washington.\n\n  End of quote by the President.\n  I could not agree more. Congress and the administration need to find \na better way to fund current military operations. Most of these funds \nare expected and should be addressed in the regular budget process.\n  Again, I want to provide our troops with the funding and the \nresources they need to be successful as they work to protect America. I \ndo not, however, want the brave men and women of the Armed Forces nor \nthe families of America who have been truly impacted by unforeseen \ndisasters to be used as justification for unchecked and, in some cases, \nunrelated spending.\n  The men and women of our armed services deserve better than this \nspending bill. The people of the United States deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this month, the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on the \nthreat posed by the ability of terrorists to purchase firearms in \nAmerica and legislative proposals to address that threat. Before \npurchasing a firearm, an individual currently must undergo a background \ncheck to search for disqualifying characteristics such as a felony \nconviction or a history of domestic violence. However, if the \nbackground check reveals that the prospective buyer is on the terrorist \nwatch list, law enforcement legally cannot block the sale unless the \nindividual falls into another disqualifying category. In other words, \nbeing on a terrorist watch list does not prevent someone from buying a \ngun.\n  To close this dangerous loophole, I support S. 1317, the Denying \nFirearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, which was \nintroduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg. I am a cosponsor of this \nlegislation because it would authorize the Attorney General to deny the \ntransfer of a firearm when an FBI background check reveals that the \nprospective purchaser is a known or suspected terrorist and the \nAttorney General has a reasonable belief that the purchaser may use the \nfirearm in connection with terrorism.\n  Law enforcement should have the authority to block the purchase of a \nfirearm by a known or suspected terrorist. Giving them that authority \nis simply common sense and has support across the political spectrum. \nAt the May 5 hearing, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg expressed \nhis support, and that of the other 500 American mayors who are members \nof the bipartisan coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns, for passing S. \n1317. Mayor Bloomberg focused on data recently released by the U.S. \nGovernment Accountability Office showing that between 2004 and 2010, \nindividuals on the terrorist watch list were able to purchase firearms \nand explosives from licensed dealers 1,119 times. I agree with Mayor \nBloomberg's testimony that this data represents a serious threat to our \nnational security and that Congress needs to act to address it.\n  Representative Peter King, ranking member of the House Homeland \nSecurity Committee, also appeared at the hearing and spoke about \nlegislation similar to S. 1317 that he introduced in the House. \nCongressman King mentioned that his bill has Republican and Democratic \ncosponsors and would have a positive impact on law enforcement agencies \nacross the country, highlighting the support of the International \nAssociations of Chiefs of Police.\n  Closing the ``terror gap'' also is supported by an overwhelming \nmajority of American gun owners. In December 2009, pollster Frank Luntz \nconducted a poll showing that 82 percent of NRA members and 86 percent \nof non-NRA gun owners favored a proposal to prevent individuals listed \non a terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms.\n  Closing the loophole in Federal law that prevents law enforcement \nfrom blocking the sale of firearms to terrorists is not a controversial \nproposal. To the contrary, legislative efforts to close the ``terror \ngap'' enjoy widespread, bipartisan support. In order to keep Americans \nsafe, it is essential that law enforcement is provided with every legal \ntool to keep guns out of the hands of known or suspected terrorists. I \nurge my colleagues to take up and pass S. 1317, the Denying Firearms \nand Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4437-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nMental Health Awareness Month to fight the stigma associated with \nmental illness that discourages people from seeking help and raise \nawareness of disparities in access to mental health services.\n  The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that while only 6 \npercent of Americans suffer from a serious mental illness, over a \nquarter of adults suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given \nyear. These illnesses--depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, phobias, \npersonality and body image disorders, and substance addictions--are \nreal diseases with proven treatments.\n  Mental health determines how we make decisions, handle stress, and \nrelate to others, consequently affecting our relationships with our \nfamilies, our colleagues, and our communities. Normally defined as how \none thinks, feels, behaves, and copes, mental health is as integral to \nour well-being as our physical health. However, mental health disorders \nare chronically underdiagnosed and undertreated.\n  While public education and awareness campaigns can go a long way in \naddressing the stigma associated with mental health disorders, improved \naccess to high-quality mental health care should be a national \npriority. Unfortunately, access to mental health services is often more \ndisparate than access to medical care, particularly in rural areas. \nRural States like South Dakota have long struggled to recruit and \nretain an adequate mental health workforce to meet the needs of their \ncitizens. I am pleased the new health reform law will increase \ninvestments in the health care workforce, including mental health \nproviders. Increased access to adequate and meaningful health insurance \ncoverage has also been addressed with health reform, ensuring more \nAmericans can obtain the care they need. All too often, insurance \ncompanies have failed to cover mental health services or impose \nrestrictive measures on the scope and duration of the treatment. Last \nCongress, I was proud to cosponsor and support passage of the Paul \nWellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity \nAct, which ensures health insurance coverage for mental health services \nis comparable to coverage of physical ailments.\n  In the short term, however, I remain deeply concerned about our \nNation's mental health safety net. I recently joined several colleagues \nin support of increased funding for comprehensive community services \nfor low income and uninsured people living with mental illnesses. While \nthe economic downturn has placed an additional financial strain on \nFederal, State, and family budgets, community mental health centers and \nother safety net providers are simultaneously reporting a significant \nincrease in demand for mental\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nhealth and addiction services. We must continue our investment in these \ncritical mental health programs for those most in need.\n  I recognize that mental illness affects many South Dakotans. It is my \nhope that awareness efforts throughout the month of May will help \nrecognize the need for improved access to services, promote overall \nhealth and well-being, reduce the stigma associated with mental \ndisorders, and encourage Americans to seek help when they need it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4438-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR OLEH SHAMSHUR\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I wish today to mention the outstanding work of an \nambassador who is leaving Washington after 4 years of distinguished \nachievement--Ambassador Oleh Shamshur of Ukraine.\n  There is little doubt that he has made a major contribution to \nstrengthening bilateral relations between our countries. Ambassador \nShamshur was one of the senior negotiators of the United States-Ukraine \nCharter on Strategic Partnership signed on December 19, 2008, which \nelevated relations between the United States and Ukraine to a new \nlevel. The charter is a living document and continues to guide \ncooperation between the two countries. On April 12, 2010, President \nObama and President Yanukovych reaffirmed their commitment to the \ncharter and expressed their intention to realize its full potential.\n  Ambassador Shamshur also played an important role in the \nestablishment of the United States-Ukrainian Strategic Partnership \nCommission and participated in its first inaugural session in December \n2009. The commission has reinvigorated relations between the United \nStates and Ukraine with an ongoing dialog and program of cooperation on \nissues of democracy, economic freedom and prosperity, security and \nterritorial integrity, energy security, defense-related cooperation, \nthe rule of law, and people-to-people contacts.\n  During Ambassador Shamshur's tenure in Washington, Ukraine once more \ndemonstrated its important leadership on the question of \nnonproliferation and arms control issues. Cooperation on these issues \nbetween Washington and Kyiv has been significantly enhanced. These \nefforts were conspicuous in the positive outcome of the Nuclear \nSecurity Summit in Washington.\n  While in Washington, Ambassador Shamshur's accomplishments were not \nlimited to issues of international security or geopolitics. Early on in \nhis service here, the United States reinstated tariff preferences for \nUkraine under the Generalized System of Preferences and granted Ukraine \nmarket economy status. The Ambassador was instrumental in the efforts \nthat led to Ukraine's graduation from the Jackson-Vanick Amendment on \n23 March 2006. The United States and Ukraine were also able to sign a \nbilateral agreement on market access issues, which became a key step in \nUkraine's eventual joining the World Trade Organization. The \nestablishment of the United States-Ukraine Council on Trade and \nInvestment in March 2008 was also a result of Ambassador Shamshur's \ntireless efforts. This year, Ambassador Shamshur can also claim credit \nfor the resolution of difficulties surrounding the operation of the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation in Ukraine and its return to \nthe Ukrainian market.\n  Many of us on Capitol Hill and in the administration share an \nappreciation for Ambassador Oleh Shamshur's achievements. He leaves \nrelations between Ukraine and the United States immeasurably stronger \nfor having served here these 4 years. We wish him and the Ukrainian \npeople well on the occasion of his departure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4438-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4438-S4439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA COMPETES ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, about a year ago, the United Arab \nEmirates decided to secure its energy future. The Emirates is a small \nPersian Gulf state that is awash in oil and annually rakes in about $80 \nbillion in oil revenues. For its own domestic energy needs, however, it \nopted to go with another technology--nuclear power. Its reasoning was \nthat the oil in the ground will eventually run out and that it would be \nbest to conserve and prepare for that day.\n  The Emirates specified they wanted to build four nuclear reactors and \nestimated the costs at around $40 billion. Sure enough, the bids soon \nstarted coming in from the world's leading nuclear vendors. There was \nAreva, the company born out of France's nuclear effort--they now get 80 \npercent of their electricity from nuclear and are building one of their \nnew Evolutionary Power Reactors in Finland. There was Westinghouse, \nwhich is building its new AP1000 reactors in Japan and China. You may \nrecognize the name. They were once, along with General Electric, \nAmerica's leading electrical manufacturer. Now they are a Japanese \ncompany, bought by Toshiba in 2006.\n  While these two giants dueled, a third competitor entered the field. \nSouth Korea only started building its own nuclear reactors in 1996. \nBefore that they bought from the U.S. and the Japanese. But then they \ntook an old design from Combustion Engineering, another American \ncompany, and fashioned the APR-1400. After building a few for \nthemselves they entered the world market. Meanwhile, in the Persian \nGulf oil business, the Koreans had established a reputation for getting \nthings done on budget and on time.\n  Still, it was a complete shock last October when the United Arab \nEmirates passed over bids from the world's two leading companies, Areva \nand Westinghouse, and awarded the contract to South Korea for $20 \nbillion--half the original estimated price. The French and the Japanese \nhave gone back to the drawing boards to figure out what went wrong so \nthey will be better able to compete next time.\n  How did the Koreans come so far so fast? People will talk about \n``cheap labor,'' ``government enterprise'' and ``copycat technology.'' \nBut I have another hypothesis. Year after year, Korean students are at \nthe top of world performance in math and science while the United \nStates doesn't even rank in the top 10. In the Program for \nInternational Student Assessment's math test for 15-year-old students, \nfor instance, South Korea ranks third, behind Finland and Taiwan, while \nthe United States ranks 21st. They are 75 points ahead of us on a scale \nof 1,000.\n  We have been hearing about these statistics for decades--maybe we \nhave even grown used to them--but now we are starting to see the \nconsequences. We are a country that is falling behind the rest of the \nworld in science literacy. In terms of energy, the rest of the world is \ncurrently going through a nuclear renaissance while we are barely able \nto construct new reactors in our own country. Part of our population \nstill thinks a nuclear reactor is an atomic bomb that can go up in a \nmushroom cloud any minute. A larger number believes that if we cover \nthe Great Smoky Mountains with windmills we could generate all the \nelectricity we need without having to build either nuclear reactors or \ncoal plants. I call this ``Going to War in Sailboats.'' That is the \ntitle of a book I have just written. If we were to go to war tomorrow, \nwould we put our fleet of nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers in \nmothballs and commission a fleet of sailing vessels?\n  Four years ago Senator Jeff Bingaman and I asked the National \nAcademies:\n\n       What are the top 10 actions, in priority order, that \n     federal policymakers could take to enhance the science and \n     technology enterprise so that the United States can \n     successfully compete, prosper, and be secure in the global \n     community of the 21st century? What strategy, with several \n     concrete steps, could be used to implement each of those \n     actions?\n\n  The Academies responded quickly to that request by assembling a \ndistinguished panel, headed by Norman R. Augustine that quickly \nproduced a list of 20 recommendations along with strategies in the \nreport, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' That report was issued 3 \nyears ago. I think its message is even more immediate today.\n  In response to the Gathering Storm report, Congress enacted and the \nPresident signed the America COMPETES Act in 2007, incorporating many \nof the Academies' recommendations and establishing a blueprint for \nmaintaining America's competitive position. In the COMPETES Act we \nauthorized funding to improve education in science, technology, \nengineering and mathematics.\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\nWe increased funding for scientific and technological research. And we \nestablished ARPA-E--modeled on the Defense Department's Advanced \nResearch Project Agency, the one that started the Internet--but aimed \nthis time specifically at advanced research projects on energy.\n  Just 2 months ago I attended ARPA-E's Inaugural Energy Innovation \nSummit, at which more than 50 innovators from around the country \npresented the prototypes of what we hope will be the next generation of \nenergy innovation.\n  Some of these ideas are truly exciting. We saw designs for a ``Metal-\nAir'' battery that could have a 1000-mile range that would be 10 times \nwhat our best car batteries can get today. We saw plans for converting \nwaste gas from refineries to gasoline that could save us 46 million \nbarrels of oil each year. We saw projects for using sunlight and \nelectricity to convert carbon dioxide back to gasoline and a ``self-\ndigesting'' biofuels plant that uses enzymes to convert cellulose plant \nmaterial to a gasoline substitute.\n  But there are still other areas where we must forge ahead. What about \nthese new small modular reactors? Companies like Toshiba, Babcock & \nWilcox, and Hyperion all have plans for reactors that are so small they \ncan serve as ``nuclear batteries.'' They are assembled at the factory \nand shipped to the site, where they are fitted together like Lego \nblocks. They have a lower cost of entry which is important for smaller \nutilities. We already have reactors like this aboard our submarines and \naircraft carriers. We have done this for more than 50 years. Why not \nput a 125-megawatt reactor back in Oak Ridge, TN, where it would power \nthe entire site and meet one-half of the Department of Energy's carbon \nfootprint reduction goal? The people of East Tennessee are not afraid \nof nuclear power.\n  With Senator James Webb of Virginia I have introduced a clean energy \nbill that calls for building 100 new nuclear reactors in the next 20 \nyears to secure our energy future while cutting our carbon emissions \nand keeping energy prices low. With Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and \nByron Dorgan of North Dakota I have introduced a bill that would set up \n10 model communities around the country to develop the infrastructure \nneeded to support electric cars. Forty Republican Senators support the \nproposition of electrifying half our cars and trucks as a way to reduce \nour carbon footprint even further and reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. The recent tragedy of the oilspill in the gulf has only \nhighlighted the need to begin this effort.\n  Still, we have a formidable task ahead of us. In 2008, 1 year after \npassage of the America COMPETES Act, Norman Augustine wrote an article \nin Science Magazine. Since The Gathering Storm had been published, he \nnoted, many new developments had occurred in science and education. A \nnew research university was established in Saudi Arabia, with an \nopening endowment equal to what the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology had amassed after 142 years. 200,000 Chinese students were \nstudying abroad, mostly pursing science or engineering degrees, often \nunder government scholarships. Government investment in R increased \nby 25 percent--in the United Kingdom. An initiative was under way to \ncreate a global nanotechnology hub--in India. An additional $10 billion \nwas being devoted to K-12 education, with emphasis on math and \nscience--in Brazil. Another $3 billion was added to the nation's \nresearch budget--in Russia.\n  So it is still a competitive world out there. A study done far back \nin the 1950s determined that 85 percent of the per capita income growth \nin American history has occurred, not because of increasing capital \nstock or other measurable inputs, but because of technological \ninnovation.\n  As educators and scientists, I know you are aware of how important \nyour work is to America's economic future. And I am sure you are ready \nto join us in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4439-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KATY LESSER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Katy Lesser of \nUnderhill, VT, for being named Vermont's 2010 Small Business Person of \nthe Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n  Lesser is the owner of Healthy Living, a natural and organic food \nstore in South Burlington, VT. In its 23 years of business, Healthy \nLiving has grown from humble beginnings into a new 33,000-square-foot \nmarket with a staff of 130 employees. Healthy Living also is a leader \nin Vermont's sustainability movement by promoting a diverse and vibrant \nselection of locally grown foods and locally made products.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Katy and her adult children, Eli and \nNina, when they were in Washington this week for the national awards \nceremony. Working at the store is a family affair, and they all put in \nlong hours to make it go. I wish them well when they take a much needed \nvacation to Ireland.\n  Once again, I commend Katy Lesser on this well-deserved honor. I ask \nunanimous consent that a March 29 article from The Burlington Free \nPress on Katy's accomplishments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Mar. 29, 2010]\n\n  Healthy Living Owner Katy Lesser Named Vermont's SBA Person of Year\n\n                         (By Myra Mathis Flynn)\n\n       It's your neighborhood grocery store that packs a healthy \n     punch. Located at 222 Dorset St., Healthy Living is the \n     natural and organic food store with a well-known community \n     outreach program, cooking classes and fully stocked bulk \n     section.\n       Starting at 1,200 square feet with only one employee and \n     average earnings of $300 a day, Healthy Living has grown over \n     a period of 23 years into a 33,000-square-foot market with a \n     staff of 130 employees, and average daily sales of $50,000. \n     Leading the market to success has been owner Katy Lesser. \n     Now, she is being recognized for it.\n       Lesser has been named the U.S. Small Business \n     Administration's 2010 Vermont Small Business Person of the \n     Year. Nominated by David Blow Jr., vice president of Granite \n     State Development Corp. in Burlington, Lesser was selected \n     for outstanding leadership related to her company's staying \n     power, employee growth, increase in sales, innovative \n     ingenuity and contributions to the community, the SBA said. \n     Recession aside, Lesser's sales for 2009 were more than $17 \n     million.\n       Lesser was quick to share the credit.\n       ``I attribute my passion for food and people, tenacity, \n     patience, being part of a terrific industry, willingness to \n     learn, being a risk-taker, and a fabulous, amazing staff to \n     my success,'' Lesser said. ``Bottom line, you have to want to \n     get up and do it all over again every day.''\n       Healthy Living was also at the forefront of the localvore \n     movement as Lesser's long-term relationships with local \n     farmers has stocked the market with local fruits, vegetables, \n     meats, poultry, dairy products and more. The market also acts \n     as an incubator for small, local culinary producers and \n     carries products from more than 1,000 Vermont producers.\n       In 2008, Healthy Living uprooted and moved to its current \n     location. The move and expansion was a risk, but one that \n     Lesser was not shy to take.\n       ``I believe it's just as risky to be too small as it is to \n     be too big. So when I decided to expand, I did a lot of \n     research all over the country to see what other natural foods \n     markets were up to,'' Lesser said. ``I traveled all over the \n     country and got a good sense of what was working and what was \n     not. I wanted space for more product, of course, but I also \n     wanted space for customers to meet, eat, hang out, learn and \n     have a sense of community meeting place. I think I did \n     that.''\n       Lesser is gradually turning the business over to her two \n     children, both of whom returned to Vermont following college \n     and jobs elsewhere. Lesser's 32-year-old son, Eli, a graduate \n     of Brandeis University, is Healthy Living's chief operating \n     officer. Her 26-year-old daughter, Nina, a graduate of George \n     Washington University and the French Culinary Institute in \n     New York, is the store's education coordinator and director \n     of the market's newest venture, the Healthy Living Learning \n     Center.\n       As Vermont's Small Business Person of the Year, Lesser will \n     compete for the national title at National Small Business \n     Week ceremonies May 23-25 in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Small \n     Business Administration will honor her locally June 17 at a \n     ceremony sponsored by the SBA and Vermont Business Magazine \n     at the Shelburne Farms Coach Barn.\n       ``More than ever, I believe a good leader serves--serves \n     her customers, her staff, her vendors and her truck drivers. \n     Love of true service makes every day a joy because there is a \n     never-ending list of people to help in many, many ways,'' \n     Lesser said. ``It's an honor to serve a community like ours. \n     I've experienced more loyalty and energy from our community \n     than I ever dreamed possible.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4439-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4439-S4440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BAYVIEW CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 100th \nAnniversary of Bayview, Idaho, a beautiful\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nlittle hamlet on the shores of Lake Pend Oreille in north Idaho. On May \n29, 2010, the residents of Bayview will gather to dedicate the \nCentennial Gift to Bayview, a beautiful entrance sign funded by local \ndonations and designed by local artists. In addition to this ceremony, \nseveral other events are scheduled throughout the year to celebrate \nthis great milestone.\n  In 1910, the Prairie Development Company was formed by five \nbusinessmen from Spokane, WA. They platted the town on the shores of \nLake Pend Oreille, with visions of a bustling resort where Spokane's \nwell-to-do could step right off the train and enjoy a weekend retreat \nor summer residence. A shortline railroad was completed in 1911, and \nthe crowds soon followed.\n  Bayview is a place full of well-kept secrets. You could say Bayview \nbuilt Spokane. The limestone deposits above the town and in nearby \nLakeview supplied the processed lime that was used to construct many of \nthe buildings in Spokane from the turn of the 20th century, well into \nthe 1930s.\n  Another little-known fact is that nearby Farragut State Park stands \non the site of what was once Idaho's largest city. In 1942, the U.S. \nNavy built Farragut Naval Training Station to train sailors for the \nfight against the Axis powers. Nearly 300,000 sailors were trained \nthere, and at any given time from 1942 to 1946, the population exceeded \n50,000 people.\n  More recently, few people know Bayview's role in helping the U.S. \nNavy build the quietest submarines in the world. After World War II \nended, the Navy began to dismantle the training station, selling off \nthe buildings and turning the land over to the State of Idaho. The \nNavy, however, did retain 20 acres on the shores of Lake Pend Oreille, \nwhere they built research facilities as well as an underwater acoustic \ntesting range. At a depth of nearly 1,200 feet, the cold, calm waters \nof the lake provide an ideal range to test various hull designs, hull \ncoatings and propulsion systems at a fraction of the cost of full-scale \nocean-based testing.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the fantastic \nIndependence Day celebration in Bayview, where the fireworks echo off \nthe surrounding cliffs and mountains, adding a thrilling dimension to \nthe show.\n  Despite the stunning beauty of its setting, Bayview remains a well-\nkept secret. I suspect its faithful residents prefer it that way. And \neven though it is a small town, it has made an outsized impact on the \nInland Northwest and the security of the entire Nation. \nCongratulations, Bayview, on 100 years of proud, colorful history, and \nhere's wishing you 100 more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4440-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING THE SOUTH DAKOTA CAPITOL CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the South Dakota State Capitol. This \ncentennial is especially meaningful to me, as I spent 8 years in this \nbuilding, serving the people of South Dakota in the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives from Clay and Union Counties.\n  South Dakota achieved statehood in 1889, and campaigns were soon \nwaged over which town would become the capital. At least 13 towns \ncompeted in an intense race, with Pierre winning the title in 1904, \npartially due to its central location. Funding was secured in 1905, \nconstruction began in 1907, the cornerstone laid on June 25, 1908, and \nthe official dedication of South Dakota's State Capitol was on June 30, \n1910. Government agencies moved into the capitol from a small wooden \nbuilding which was located at the southwest corner of the capitol \ngrounds near the corners of Capitol Avenue and Nicollet. Robert S. \nVessey of Wessington Springs was the first Governor to serve in the \ncapitol building.\n  Modeled after the Montana State Capitol Building, architects from \nMinneapolis designed and constructed the building for just under $1 \nmillion. The beautiful structure includes native field stone, Indiana \nlimestone, and Vermont and Italian marble. With hand-carved woodwork, \nmarble, special cast brass, and hand laid stone, the capitol itself is \na work of art.\n  During the ``Dirty 30's,'' the settling of blowing soil caused severe \ndamage to the building. Subsequently, in 1977, a major restoration of \nthe State capitol commenced with a goal of returning the majestic \nbuilding to its original state in time for the South Dakota Centennial \nCelebration in 1989. Fifteen years and roughly $3 million later, the \nbuilding has been restored very close to its original grandeur. The \nceilings, wall designs, color schemes, window treatments, and carpeted \nareas were brought back to its original colors and luster.\n  On Saturday, June 19, 2010, South Dakotans from across the State will \ngather at the capitol to celebrate 100 years of our State's history. \nWith live entertainment, tours of the capitol, historical lectures, a \nrededication ceremony, and many other activities, there is something \nfor everyone. I hope this celebration gives our citizens a chance to \nreflect on our shared history, as well as our promising future.\n  At the laying of the cornerstone, Governor Coe Crawford said in his \naddress, ``The new capitol will do more than comfortably accommodate \nthe officers who are to labor within its walls for the people whom they \nwill serve. It will stand throughout the coming years as an expression \nof beauty and art and as the people come and go and linger within its \nwalls, they will see in it an expression of the soul of the state.'' \nAlthough currently valued at $58 million, this piece of history is \npriceless. I am honored to have served in this historical building and \nam proud to recognize it today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4440-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE SOUTH DAKOTA STATE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALLIANCE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the South Dakota State Medical Association Alliance. \nThis organization was founded to promote educational and charitable \nendeavors related to healthy living, and it has made remarkable \nprogress over the last century.\n  Originally called the South Dakota Auxiliary, this organization was \nfounded in 1910 when 18 wives of physicians saw a need for their own \norganization during the annual meeting of the South Dakota Medical \nAssociation. The original group of women took 15 minutes to write the \nconstitution and by-laws, with dues set at $1 a year. Now known as the \nSouth Dakota State Medical Association Alliance, the group holds an \nannual fundraiser to raise money for medical student scholarships. This \ndevoted organization supports the development of leadership skills \nthrough national training as well as involvement with projects at the \nState and local level.\n  The South Dakota State Medical Association Alliance has long been \ndevoted to the general health of South Dakotans through education and \nfinancial support. The oldest continuous medical alliance in the United \nStates, SDSMA Alliance fills an important role in our State with all \nthey do. I appreciate their hard work and again congratulate them on \ntheir 100th anniversary.

Hugh's father, Wally, died at a young age. His \nmother Cleo raised her 11 children on her own with the attitude that an \nabundance of love, faith, and laughter mattered much more than an \nabundance of money. Always taking pride in their Irish heritage, St. \nPatrick's Day never passes without a Grogan family reunion and a float \nin the Sioux Falls parade.\n  Hugh began working for Minnehaha County in 1981 as the assistant \ndirector of welfare. He was promoted to director 2 years later. Hugh's \nsense of social justice has been a centerpiece of his career. Hugh's \ncompassion for those without a home led him to develop the partnerships \nand relationships among social agencies necessary to establish the \nHomeless Coalition in Sioux Falls. He recently created and advocated \nfor the Safe Home pilot program, which is helping to improve care for \nthe chronically homeless, while also delivering\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nthat care in a more cost effective way. Hugh has even opened his own \nhome to provide a measure of stability to a young person in need of \nencouragement and opportunity. Countless disadvantaged individuals have \nbenefitted from his dedicated work, much of which was done behind the \nscenes but always with the best interest of the people he served in \nmind.\n  Hugh has been the recipient of many awards over the span of his \ncareer, including the United Way Social Worker of the Year and the \nSioux Falls Catholic Schools' Hall of Fame. The State of South Dakota \nhas also benefitted from Hugh's expertise in the field of social \nservices. He has served on many State committees and task forces \ncreated to best serve the poorest of our State.\n  Hugh and I share a commitment to providing access to affordable \nhousing, recognizing that it is a critical ingredient for future \nsuccess. His honorable service has been marked by a true sense of \ndedication to providing consistent guidance and stewardship. His warm \nsense of humor puts everyone around him at ease, and he treats each \nperson with respect and dignity. My wife Barbara and I are proud to \ncount Hugh as a friend, as well as an ally in the pursuit of social \njustice.\n  I commend Hugh for his passionate and tireless commitment to serving \nthose in need. He has worked for affordable housing for 30 years, and \nwill take his tireless work ethic to the Department of Veterans Affairs \nas an outreach worker for homeless veterans. I wish Hugh and his wife \nJan all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4441-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF AGAR, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of Agar, SD. This rural community in Sully \nCounty is small, but its size is its strength. Agar is a warm, caring \ncommunity full of people who are always willing to lend a helping hand.\n  When Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company decided to connect two \nof its lines, Agar was formed on the land of Charles Agar. Within the \nfirst year, several buildings had been constructed. The little town \ncontinued to flourish as an agricultural hub. A post office, newspaper, \nice cream shop, and a bank were all started in 1910. In May of 1910, \nthe town constructed an artesian well that flowed at 78 gallons per \nminute.\n  Agar's centennial celebration promises to be a great time, with bull \nriding, dances, and a softball tournament. The town will also be having \na 2-day wagon train, covering beautiful farmland as well as the famous \nSutton Bay Golf Resort. This weekend centennial celebration will gather \ntogether ``Agarians'' of all generations to celebrate all that this \nvery proud community has accomplished.\n  One hundred years ago, this small town was founded on hard work and \nperseverance. Today, those values continue to permeate everything this \ntown does. Small towns like Agar are the backbone of South Dakota, and \nI am proud to congratulate them on reaching this historic \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4441-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4441-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4441-4", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:08 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 5139.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 3428. A bill to designate the Memorial of Perpetual Tears, which \nhonors victims of driving while impaired, as the official National DWI \nVictims Memorial; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, today I introduce the \nNational DWI Victims Memorial Designation Act of 2010, which is \ncosponsored by my colleague Senator Jeff Bingaman. This legislation \nwould designate the DWI Victims Memorial of Perpetual Tears in \nMoriarty, New Mexico, as the National DWI Victims Memorial.\n  Opened in 2008, the DWI Victims Memorial of Perpetual Tears is the \nNation's first and only memorial of its kind. The Memorial Perpetual \nTears helps raise awareness of the devastation caused by driving while \nimpaired, DWI, crashes by recognizing their victims, educating the \npublic, and encouraging preventive measures. The memorial aims to give \ncomfort to the innocent victims of drunk driving and raise awareness of \nthe devastating toll of DWI deaths on our nation's roadways. Located on \na four-acre site next to Interstate 40, the Memorial of Perpetual Tears \nattracts passersby in addition to those who travel specifically to \nvisit the memorial.\n  The National DWI Victims Memorial Designation Act of 2010 would \nrequire that any reference to this memorial in a law, map, regulation, \ndocument, record, or other official paper of the United States \ngovernment refer to the site as the National DWI Victims Memorial. As a \nSenator from New Mexico, I am proud to seek such an official \ndesignation for the DWI Victims Memorial of Perpetual Tears. It is \nfitting that such a national memorial should be located in the State \nthat once led the Nation in DWI fatalities and now leads the way in \ndrunk driving prevention.\n  Compared to 20 years ago, our roads are much safer today. Yet even as \nthe overall number of people killed on our roadways has declined, drunk \ndriving still accounts for one third of all traffic fatalities \nnationwide. In 2008, drunk driving killed about 12,000 Americans, \nincluding 143 people in my home State of New Mexico. That is an average \nof 32 people killed every day by drunk driving. This unacceptable death \ntoll is all the more shocking when you consider that each one of those \ndeaths was preventable.\n  Although other communities have established remembrance gardens and \nmonuments honoring drunk driving victims, the DWI Victims Memorial of \nPerpetual Tears is unique. The memorial resembles a veterans cemetery \nwith markers representing the most recent 5-year period of deaths in \nNew Mexico attributed to DWI. The memorial includes a site dedicated to \nvictims of DWI nationwide. The Memorial of Perpetual Tears gives \nfurther recognition to innocent victims of DWI nationwide by displaying \nVictim Tribute books in the memorial visitor center. The Victim Tribute \nbooks include stories and pictures submitted by injured victims and \nfamily members of those killed in DWI crashes.\n  The Memorial of Perpetual Tears is a testament to the hard work and \ndedication of local volunteers who have made this memorial possible. \nSonja Britton, the mother of a DWI victim, saw the need for a memorial \nto those killed by drunk driving on our Nation's roadways. For years, \nshe rallied support and found many local residents and others \nnationwide who were willing to help. Mike, Mary, and Ralph Anaya and \ntheir family provided key support by donating prime real estate next to \nInterstate 40 to give the memorial a fitting location. Thanks to the \nefforts of so many, the Memorial of Perpetual Tears today provides a \nfocal point where families can gather to mourn the loss of loved ones \nas well as join with others to promote DWI awareness and prevention.\n  Having a National DWI Victims Memorial gives us another resource in \nthe fight to end drunk driving. I share Sonja's vision that one day we \nwill have no more senseless deaths caused by DWI crashes. As she says \nmost eloquently, ``My dream will be realized when this mission is \nachieved and when our loved ones will no longer be injured or killed by \nalcohol-related traffic crashes. We must stop this carnage.''\n  Working together, we can make Sonja's dream a reality.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation and to join \nSenator Bingaman and me in celebrating the work of the volunteers who \nhave made the DWI Victims Memorial of Perpetual Tears possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 3430. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe tip tax credit to employers of cosmetologists and to promote tax \ncompliance in the cosmetology sector; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, I am delighted to rise today, during National Small \nBusiness Week, with Senator Landrieu, who is Chair of the Committee, to \nintroduce the Small Business Tax Equalization and Compliance Act.\n  Our bipartisan measure is a pro-small business bill and would allow \nthe salon\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\nindustry to have the same tax rules on tips paid to employees as is \npermitted in the restaurant industry. The legislation would increase \ncompliance with payroll tax obligations and will make sure that the \nwomen who work in the salon industry earn all the Social Security \nretirement and disability benefits they should be entitled to. It would \nalso help to prevent salons that do not follow the tax law from gaining \na competitive disadvantage against those that do follow the law. The \ncompanion bill in the House is H.R. 3724, which was introduced \nRepresentative Shelley Berkley and Representative Kevin Brady.\n  Clearly this legislation will help all parts of the salon industry, \nbig and small, men and women. But the reality is that because 84 \npercent of the workforce in the salon industry is female, this issue \nhas special relevance for women. When women work as independent \ncontractors at hair salons, they are less likely to disclose all of \ntheir tips for purposes of paying Social Security taxes. As a result, \nthey reduce their future right to earn retirement and disability \nbenefits in the Social Security system and reduce the size of any \nbenefit they do ultimately earn. Making sure that working women are \ncorrectly paying into Social Security is critical to their future \nretirement security because many of these women will have had no other \nretirement benefits available to them.\n  We know that women are disproportionately dependent on Social \nSecurity for their retirement benefits, a March 2010 study by the Women \nfor Women's Policy Research showed that women's Social Security \nbenefits in 2008 were only about 75 percent of the benefits earned by \nmen and it comprised about half of their total retirement income. By \ncontrast, Social Security benefits comprised roughly one third of men's \nretirement income. Earning the right to collect a decent Social \nSecurity benefit is vital to women.\n\n  As a small business issue, salons are a quintessential small business \non Main Streets across America. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 98 \npercent of salon industry firms have only one establishment; 92 percent \nof salon establishments have sales of less than $500,000; and 82 \npercent of salon establishments have fewer than 10 employees. Extending \nthe tip tax credit to salon owners would allow them to reinvest in \ntheir businesses and employees, create new jobs, granting new economic \nand employment opportunities in their local communities.\n  I specifically want to explain what this legislation would do. First, \nit would provide the salon industry with the same type of tax credit \ncurrently available in the restaurant industry. The credit is for \nemployers to offset the matching Social Security and Medicare taxes \nthat the salon pays on the tips that employees receive from customers. \nNext, the bill would help to make more even-handed IRS enforcement of \nlaws on payroll and income taxes. Without this legislation it is often \nthe lopsided practice of the IRS to seek back taxes from the employer \nbut rarely from the employee or independent contractor despite the \nrequirement that taxes be paid in equal measure.\n  The legislation will protect both legitimate independent contractors \nand employees who pay their taxes but frees up IRS resources to focus \non those bad actors who are not complying with the law. Although non-\nemployer salons comprise 87 percent of establishments, their reported \nsales represent only 36 percent of total salon industry revenues, \nimplying a significant underreporting of income in the non-employer \nsegment. This legislation includes education and reporting requirements \nwhich will help address the ``tax gap'' and reveal a valuable new \nsource of tax revenues for the federal Government. This is a win-win-\nwin for the salons, for employees, and for the government.\n  This bill is supported by the Professional Beauty Association, the \nlargest association in the professional beauty industry, which is \ncomprised of salon and spa owners, manufacturers and distributors of \nsalon and spa products, and individual licensed cosmetologists.\n  Finally, I want to thank two salon owners who brought this issue to \nmy attention, Alan Labos of Akari Salon in Portland, Maine and Tiffany \nConway of bei capelli salon in Scarborough, Maine.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport our bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 508\n\n       Whereas, according to the HHT Foundation International, \n     Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT), also referred \n     to as Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome, is a long-neglected \n     national health problem that affects approximately 70,000 (1 \n     in 5,000) people in the United States and 1,200,000 people \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas HHT is an autosomal dominant, uncommon complex \n     genetic blood vessel disorder, characterized by \n     telangiectases and artery-vein malformations that occurs in \n     major organs including the lungs, brain, and liver, as well \n     as the nasal mucosa, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and skin \n     of the face and hands;\n       Whereas left untreated, HHT can result in considerable \n     morbidity and mortality and lead to acute and chronic health \n     problems or sudden death;\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, 20 \n     percent of those with HHT, regardless of age, suffer death \n     and disability;\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, due \n     to widespread lack of knowledge of the disorder among medical \n     professionals, approximately 90 percent of the HHT population \n     has not yet been diagnosed and is at risk for death or \n     disability due to sudden rupture of the blood vessels in \n     major organs in the body;\n       Whereas the HHT Foundation International estimates that 20 \n     to 40 percent of complications and sudden death due to these \n     ``vascular time bombs'' are preventable;\n       Whereas patients with HHT frequently receive fragmented \n     care from practitioners who focus on 1 organ of the body, \n     having little knowledge about involvement in other organs or \n     the interrelation of the syndrome systemically;\n       Whereas HHT is associated with serious consequences if not \n     treated early, yet the condition is amenable to early \n     identification and diagnosis with suitable tests, and there \n     are acceptable treatments available in already-established \n     facilities such as the 8 HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence \n     in the United States; and\n       Whereas adequate Federal funding is needed for education, \n     outreach, and research to prevent death and disability, \n     improve outcomes, reduce costs, and increase the quality of \n     life for people living with HHT: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the need to pursue research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for HHT;\n       (2) recognizes and supports the HHT Foundation \n     International as the only advocacy organization in the United \n     States working to find a cure for HHT while saving the lives \n     and improving the well-being of individuals and families \n     affected by HHT through research, outreach, education, and \n     support;\n       (3) supports the designation of June 2010 as National \n     Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT) month, to \n     increase awareness of HHT;\n       (4) acknowledges the need to identify the approximately 90 \n     percent of the HHT population that has not yet been diagnosed \n     and is at risk for death or disability due to sudden rupture \n     of the blood vessels in major organs in the body;\n       (5) recognizes the importance of comprehensive care centers \n     in providing complete care and treatment for each patient \n     with HHT;\n       (6) recognizes that stroke, lung, and brain hemorrhages can \n     be prevented through early diagnosis, screening, and \n     treatment of HHT;\n       (7) recognizes severe hemorrhages in the nose and \n     gastrointestinal tract can be controlled through \n     intervention, and that heart failure can be managed through \n     proper diagnosis of HHT and treatments;\n       (8) recognizes that a leading medical and academic \n     institution estimated that $6,600,000,000 of 1-time health \n     care costs can be saved through aggressive management of HHT \n     in the at-risk population; and\n       (9) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe and support the month through \n     appropriate programs and activities that promote public \n     awareness of HHT and potential treatments for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4470-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL BRAIN TUMOR AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I wish to send an amendment to the desk for \nthe purpose of filing at a later time, if it is appropriate. Can they \nsimply hold it at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment can be received at the desk.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk is an \namendment that is very important. It is important to us in \nMassachusetts, but it is also important to a certain number of \ncompanies in this country that may find themselves in a similar \nsituation.\n  I wish to express my strong support on the Senate floor tonight for \nthe inclusion of this amendment in the upcoming House tax extenders \nbill. The purpose of this amendment is to fix a complete anomaly in the \npatent law that is vital to our State. Let me explain.\n  The House provision that is being contemplated will allow for a \npatent application to be filed up to 30 days late, with a penalty to be \npaid by the filer to the Patent and Trademark Office. This provision \nhas been drafted so that it can be included in the tax extenders bill. \nLet me explain why this is important and what it does.\n  The Medicines Company, which is a New Jersey startup company, \nlicensed Angiomax. That is the name of the product. It is a synthetic \nblood thinner. That company invested $200 million in R, and it gained \nFDA approval for this product.\n  In 2001, the Angiomax's patent term restoration application was \nunintentionally filed after the close of business on the day of the \nfiling deadline. It was filed electronically. Because it was filed \nelectronically on the day of the deadline beyond the close of business \nin the office, in terms of daytime presence, it was deemed to be filed \n1 day late. It was ruled as being filed 1 day late by the Patent and \nTrademark Office subsequently.\n  I remember when I was in law school, people taught me often that \nsometimes\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\nthe law can have a rigidity that has no common sense and no application \nto day-to-day life. We had a more pejorative term for what we called \nthe law under those circumstances.\n  The fact is, as a result, the Medicines Company lost almost 5 years \nof earned patent protection with a value of roughly $1 billion.\n  As former Surgeon General Dr. Louis Sullivan said:\n\n       The fate of this corrective provision could be a matter of \n     life and death for tens of thousands of patients. The reality \n     is that stark. As drug innovators develop pioneering \n     medicines, the benefits available to patients are increasing. \n     These medical innovators' ability to conduct lifesaving \n     research should not be thwarted by a confusing filing \n     deadline.\n\n  That was the Surgeon General of the United States speaking.\n  The provision I submitted in an amendment will simply allow for a \npatent application to be filed up to 30 days late, not just for this \ncompany but for any company in a similar situation, with a penalty to \nbe paid by them to the Patent and Trademark Office.\n  Is this something out of the ordinary? No, it is not. Existing patent \nlaw provides grace periods in up to 30 similar situations. But it \nprovides no grace period for a late patent term restoration \napplication, just one aberration within the framework of patent \nfilings. This provision is consistent with the Hatch-Waxman patent \nrestoration filing process and over 30 other provisions of patent law \nwhich provide for deadline adjustments in order to avoid precisely the \nkind of drastic and disproportionate result we see in this \nsituation. The provision provides a modest 3-day grace period if the \nfiling delay is unintentional. It also requires successful applicants \nto pay the U.S. Treasury a late filing fee to offset any cost to the \nFederal Government.\n\n  Twice during the 110th Congress, the House passed legislation \nunanimously to correct this anomaly. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nreported a similar provision offered by Senator Kennedy on a bipartisan \nvote of 14 to 2. Unfortunately, these provisions were not enacted into \nlaw during the 110th Congress. During this Congress, despite the \nefforts of Senate Judiciary Chairman Leahy, the Senate has not found \nthe moment to consider this critically needed patent reform \nlegislation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that the provision will \nproduce approximately $30 million in new revenues to our government \nover the next 10 years. Two recent independent economic studies confirm \nthat the provision will save up to $1.3 billion in costs for the \nprivate hospital system over the course of the next 10 years.\n  Nearly 50 of the Nation's leading doctors have written to Congress \nurging the enactment of this provision because it will allow lifesaving \nmedical research in the treatment and prevention of heart disease and \nstroke--the first and third leading causes of death and disability in \nthe United States--to move forward. Without this critical legislation, \nmany thousands of patients will be consigned to continued medical \ntreatment with antiquated drugs rather than safer, modern synthetic \ninnovations.\n  Unless the provision is enacted promptly, up to 3,500 jobs in 6 \nStates may be lost, including up to 2,500 in the State of \nMassachusetts. These jobs include irreplaceable high-skilled jobs \ndeveloped by small business medical innovators. At this moment in our \neconomy, the last thing we want to do is strip ourselves of revenues, \nstrip ourselves of income, strip ourselves of jobs, and leave our \npatients in a less cared for and potentially lifesaving environment \nthan they would be with this. Mr. President, we can't afford to allow \nthat to happen, and I don't think Congress should allow a bureaucratic \nmisinterpretation of the law to hurt our Nation's public health and to \ncause severe job losses. The provision's enactment will prevent these \njob losses, and it will create new highly skilled jobs.\n  The amendment provides a 3-day grace period for the filing of Hatch-\nWaxman patent term restoration applications. This provision of a grace \nperiod, as I said, is consistent with more than 30 other provisions of \npatent law.\n  The bill corrects a harmful and confusing procedural anomaly that has \ncaused 78 percent of medical innovators--78 percent--to miscalculate \nthe deadline to regain the patent life they earned during the costly \nand rigorous FDA review process.\n  So I reiterate: The current filing period is so confusing that only \n22 out of 100 medical innovators have been able to calculate the law's \n60-day filing period accurately. The current filing period is a trap \nfor the unaware, and penalties are vastly out of proportion to the \nimpact of having accidentally missed by a few hours, when you actually \nfile correctly on the same day, the application that is due.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment will be in the tax extenders \nbill, and I intend to fight to see that it is. I think it is an \nappropriate public policy decision in the best interests of our country \nand of the American citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/26/senate-section/article/S4472-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
