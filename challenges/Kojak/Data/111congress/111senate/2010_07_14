Mr. President, my friend the majority leader mentioned \nthe small business jobs bill. I recently had an opportunity to talk to \nSenator Snowe, who is the author of that legislation. I assured her we \nare anxious to move forward. I appreciate his bringing up the \ndiscussion we have been having about reaching a consent agreement that \nwould allow us to expedite the bill. I know my friend from Nevada \nshares my view that small business is an area that needs attention. We \nare going to continue to try to come to agreement to move forward with \nthat very important piece of legislation which I support and I believe \nmost Members of my conference do as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I have said before, this legislation is \nbipartisan. Most of the bill has been crafted in the past when Senator \nSnowe was chairman of the Small Business Committee. I am glad to hear \nmy friend Senator Snowe has had a conversation with the Republican \nleader. That is good news. We will see what we can do to move on. I \nhope everyone realizes that jobs in America are not created in large \nnumbers by big companies; it is small businesses.\n  In the past few months, we passed a relatively small piece of \nlegislation, but it has been extremely helpful to\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\nsmall business. We extended the highway bill for a year. That saved 1 \nmillion jobs in America, hundreds of jobs in Nevada. We also had a \nprovision that was unique and has created some jobs that has been \nextremely helpful. If somebody is out of work for 60 days, they can be \nhired for 30 hours. We don't set what price they can be hired, the \nminimum wage or whatever. At the end of their report period for \nwithholding, they don't have to pay the withholding tax. At the end of \na year, we give them a $1,000 tax credit for every employee. We also \ndid something that was totally bipartisan, a bill developed by Senators \nSchumer and Hatch. That is what I just talked about. That was totally \nbipartisan. We had another provision in that bill that said that a \nsmall business, if they wanted to buy a piece of equipment, whether it \nwas an automobile, furniture, whatever it might be, no longer had to \ndepreciate that. Up to $250,000, they could simply write it off. We \nalso added to that bill some money for Build America Bonds which local \ngovernments loved. That has created some jobs, but it is relatively \nsmall compared to the other things we have in this bill before the \nSenate now. I am glad to hear what the distinguished Republican leader \nhad to say about that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The majority leader is entirely correct about the \nimportance of small business. We know it creates the vast majority of \njobs. There is no question that small business at this particular point \nis kind of frozen with concern about the economy, about increased \nregulation, the potential for increased taxation as well. Senator Snowe \nhas certainly been the leader on our side on focusing on small business \nand small business job development. I am hoping we can work out a way \nto go forward on a bipartisan basis. It sounds to me as though both \nsides agree on the premise. Now if we can get a procedure for moving \nforward, hopefully we can address this most important subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5798-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud, really, to share \nwith our colleagues an important step by Congress to curb waste and, I \nthink, fraud within the Federal Government. Later today our colleagues \nover in the House, where both the Acting President pro tempore and I \nonce served, are expected to approve a piece of legislation--not a sexy \ntitle, but it is called Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery \nAct--and then they are going to send that bill to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Every year, for about the last 6 or 7 years, Federal agencies have \nbeen required by law--important payments law signed by George W. Bush--\nto review their payments and to figure out which ones were appropriate \nand which ones were inappropriate. Initially, back in the middle of the \nlast decade not very many agencies complied with the new law. But \nthanks to the perseverance of OMB and the commitment of a number of \nagency and department heads, over time more and more Federal agencies \nhave begun reporting improper payments, mostly overpayments.\n  As we gather here today, there is still a number of very large \nagencies that do not comply with the law. The Department of Defense is \na huge expender of taxpayer money. The Department of Defense does not \ncomply with the law. The Department of Homeland Security complies in \npart with the law. If you look at Medicare, for Medicare Parts A and B, \nI believe they actually do a fairly decent job of complying with the \nlaw but for Parts C and D they do not.\n  But even without the full compliance of all Federal agencies \nreporting their improper payments, last year close to $100 billion of \nimproper payments were reported by the agencies that are already \nreporting them. That does not include the Department of Defense. It \ndoes not include all of Homeland Security. Frankly, it does not include \nsome other major programs of the Federal Government.\n  But the good news here is that, one, agencies are beginning to report \ntheir improper payments. That is good. The second thing we want them to \ndo is stop making the improper payments. The third thing we want them \nto do is to figure out where the improper payments have gone, \nespecially the overpayments, and go out and recover the money. That is \nwhat we are about here: identify the improper payments and once they \nhave been identified, stop making them. And the third thing is to go \nout and recover as much of the money as we can.\n  Why is this important? Well, I think we all know our Nation has a \nlarge and growing debt. I am not so sure when the Acting President pro \ntempore joined the House of Representatives, but I believe he may have \nbeen there by the end of the Clinton administration and may recall when \nwe actually had balanced budgets. We went from 1968--I want to say to \n2000--maybe 2001--when we actually balanced our budget.\n  I remember being in a hearing here in the Senate where one of our \nwitnesses--I am not sure; I think somebody from the Federal Reserve \nmaybe, maybe somebody from Treasury--actually expressed concerns at the \ntime that we were in danger of paying down our debt too quickly and \nthat we had some threat of destabilizing our financial system or our \neconomy. Imagine that: a decade ago concerns about paying down our debt \ntoo quickly.\n  Well, we did not do that. We did not pay down our debt at all. \nBetween 2001 and 2008, we doubled our Nation's debt. In those 8 years \nwe ran up as much new debt as we did in the previous 208 years of our \nNation's history. We are on course now--even though we are starting to \nsee deficits that begin to trend down--to double our Nation's debt \nagain over the next decade, unless we do some things dramatically \ndifferent.\n  Our President, to his credit, has suggested among the things we do \nare these: No. 1, to put an overall freeze on domestic discretionary \nspending, starting with this October 1, for the next 3 years. Certain \nprograms within the overall discretionary spending budget can go up, \nsome can go down, but overall, for 3 years, a freeze, and not a freeze \nthat is just adjusted with the cost of living but an actual freeze on \nnominal dollars.\n  The second thing he suggested we do--when we tried to do this on the \nfloor, seven of our Members who cosponsored the legislation, the Acting \nPresident pro tempore may recall, ended up voting against it. But the \nidea was to create a commission, much as we have had earlier \ncommissions, and especially back in 1982 we created a commission--\nPresident Reagan was the President, Tip O'Neill was the Speaker--to \nactually examine Social Security, which was about to run out of money. \nThey came up with a bunch of ideas that were adopted and implemented in \n1983.\n  But anyway, when we failed to adopt by law and create a statutory \ncommission on deficit reduction to look at entitlements, to look at \nrevenues, our President, by executive order, created the commission. \nErskine Bowles is one of the cochairs, former Chief of Staff to \nPresident Clinton. Alan Simpson, a Republican Senator, retired, from \nWyoming is the other cochair. The people, for the most part, on the \ncommission are very serious, very smart people. They have been meeting \nquite a bit.\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\nTheir job is to come back to us and tell us, later this year, some ways \nthey think we could actually reduce the deficits further, through \nentitlement spending and looking at revenues and the way we collect \nmoney.\n  There are still some other things we need to do. I want to mention a \nfew of those. One of those deals is what I call the tax gap. The IRS \nreported that in the last decade some $300 billion of taxes that have \nbeen owed are going uncollected, and in many cases we know who owes the \nmoney. We have some idea how much they owe. Despite efforts in the past \nto close that tax gap, it is still too large, and we need to further \ncontinue to concentrate on that. My hope is, in part, this deficit \nreduction commission can help us with that. In the meanwhile, I know \nthe Finance Committee and others in the House are endeavoring to reduce \nthe tax gap.\n  A second thing we want to do is to change the way we manage and \ndispose of surplus property. The Federal Government is a huge owner of \nsurplus properties. We do not use them all. A lot of them are vacant. \nWe pay security costs to secure them. We pay utility costs. We pay \nmaintenance costs in many cases. But we, for the most part, and too \noften, do not sell them. We do not dispose of them.\n  There is legislation that has been introduced again in this Congress, \nworking with OMB, working with some of the homeless groups, to try to \nmake sure their concerns are addressed, but that at the end of the day \nwe should not be continuing to own and maintain and secure and provide \nutilities for thousands of pieces of property, buildings we do not need \nand we do not use.\n  Another area deals with weapons systems. It was reported back in 2001 \nthat we spent $45 billion in cost overruns for major weapons systems. \nThink about that: $45 billion in 2001 on cost overruns for major \nweapons systems. We got an update on that about a year or two ago, and \nit was no longer $45 billion. That is the good news. The bad news is, \nit is about $295 billion.\n  We had a big debate here last fall, some will recall, on whether we \nought to continue to buy F-22 aircraft that cost roughly $300 million a \ncopy at about a 55-percent mission capable rate, which means on any \ngiven day only about 55 percent of them can fly. It costs about $45,000 \na flight hour. They have never flown a single mission in Iraq, a single \nmission in Afghanistan. The question is, are we going to continue to \nbuy them? That is the kind of thing we do not need to do.\n  We had a hearing yesterday in our Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee on whether we ought to continue buying C-17 aircraft. \nIt is a cargo aircraft, a great aircraft. We have about 200, almost 230 \nof them. The Pentagon says we do not need them, we do not need any \nmore. They say they only need about 190 or 200, no mas, no more. They \ncost about a quarter billion dollars apiece, plus we have to operate \nthem and provide hangars for them and maintenance, and so forth, and \ncrew them. They said there is a more cost effective way to meet our \nairlift needs, suggesting what that might be, in part to modernize some \nolder C-5As and Bs, and help make them more efficient and more \ndependable. We are already starting to do that, and it is actually very \nencouraging.\n  What else can we do? We can do little things. I read in the news, \nmaybe 2 weeks ago, we decided to go almost entirely to direct deposits \nand to move away from paper check. It does not save a huge amount of \nmoney, maybe $5 million a year, $50 million over 10 years, but it is \nthe kind of thing we ought to do.\n  Another idea that has been kicked around for years is whether we \nought to give the President something like statutory line-item veto \npower. Most Governors have line-item veto power, mostly through their \nState's constitution. Is that a good idea? We tried to do it in the \nHouse in 1992, to give like a 2-year test drive, to enhance the \nPresident's rescission power. That died in the Senate.\n  Senators Feingold, McCain, and I have come up, working with the \nadministration, on a 4-year test drive that we think will meet \nconstitutional muster, and to not give forever the President strength \nin rescission powers, but to make his powers real and to require us to \nvote on them. It requires us to vote on the President's proposed \nrescissions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in closing, I want to come back later \ntoday and talk about the Improper Payments Act, which is going to be \npassed by the House today and I hope signed by the President, to speak \nabout why that is another important step to get our fiscal house in \norder. I appreciate the opportunity to begin that discussion this \nmorning.\n  I thank you chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5799-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5799-S5800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, next week, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwill be voting on the nomination of Elena Kagan to be the next \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. This vote \nin the Judiciary Committee follows 4 days of hearings on her \nnomination. As the Acting President pro tempore knows, she is currently \nthe Solicitor General of the United States. We not only had 4 days of \nhearings, every member of the Judiciary Committee had ample opportunity \nto ask questions and get responses from Ms. Kagan. We heard from \noutside witnesses, some who were directly affected by decisions of the \nSupreme Court of the United States. We reviewed tens of thousands of \npages of documents.\n  I pointed out during these hearings why Americans should be so \nconcerned about who the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court \nwill be because the decisions of the Supreme Court affect your life. If \nyou work, if you are a woman, if you vote, if you care about the air \nyou breathe or the water you drink, if you are a consumer, you need to \nbe concerned about the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The Constitution protects us from the abuses of power, whether those \npowers are generated by government or powerful special interests. The \nSupreme Court was designed to be the protector of our constitutional \nrights.\n\n       We the people of the United States--\n\n  ``We the people''--\n\n     in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, \n     insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, \n     promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of \n     Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and \n     establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  The authors of the Constitution understood the timeless idea that \njustice was paramount. After questioning Solicitor General Kagan and \nlistening to her testimony for a week, I am convinced she has a clear \nunderstanding of how profound an impact her future decisions may have \non the lives of everyday Americans.\n  Based on the hearing and the conversations I have had with her, I am \nconfident she will put the interests of the American people and justice \nfor the American people first, above popular opinion or politics.\n  As Solicitor General Kagan said in her opening statement to the \ncommittee, equal justice under law ``means that everyone who comes \nbefore the Court--regardless of wealth or power or station--receives \nthe same process and protections. . . . What it promises is nothing \nless than a fair shake for every American.''\n  During the confirmation hearings, I asked Solicitor General Kagan \nabout civil rights, campaign financing, and our environment. I used \nthose three areas to demonstrate how important the decisions of the \nSupreme Court can be in the lives of everyday Americans. My concerns \nabout recent Supreme Court decisions were an activist court that, by \nthe narrowest margins--usually 5-to-4 decisions--reversed precedent, \nlegislated from the bench, and ruled on the side of businesses over \nindividual rights.\n  In civil rights, I think the importance of the Supreme Court was \nunderscored by the decision of Brown v. Board of Education which opened \neducational opportunity for the people of this Nation. I pointed out \nduring the hearings before the Judiciary Committee that it was Thurgood \nMarshall, a young attorney from Baltimore, who argued that case before \nthe Supreme Court and then became, as the Presiding Officer knows, the \nfirst African-American Justice on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, and one of his law clerks was Elena Kagan.\n  Recent decisions of the Supreme Court underscore my concern as to\n\n[[Page S5800]]\n\nwhether the Supreme Court is following legal precedent to protect the \ncivil rights of the people of our Nation. The Ledbetter decision dealt \nwith gender equity. Here the Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 decision, \nreversed precedent and the clear intent of Congress to deny women the \nopportunity to effectively enforce their rights for equal pay by saying \nto Ms. Ledbetter that she had to bring her case on pay discrimination \nwithin 180 days of the discrimination, although it was impossible for \nher to discover she was being discriminated against during that period \nof time. Now we have taken action in the Senate to reverse that, and \nPresident Obama signed legislation to reverse it, but the Supreme Court \nnever should have ruled against American workers and women in the \nLedbetter decision.\n  I also mentioned the Gross decision which deals with age \ndiscrimination where the Supreme Court reversed its own precedent and \nclear congressional intent to deny an effective remedy on age \ndiscrimination, changing the standards in order for a person to be able \nto bring a case.\n  I talked about campaign finance and the Citizens United case where \nthe Supreme Court, again by a 5-to-4 decision, reversed precedent, \nreversed congressional action, and allowed more corporate money into \nour election system. Corporations don't have enough power already? The \nSupreme Court gave corporations even more influence in our Federal \nelection process.\n  I was impressed, and I think the members of the Judiciary Committee \nwere impressed, that the first case Solicitor General Kagan decided to \nargue before the Supreme Court was to try to uphold our action in \nCongress regarding campaign finance reform. I think Justice Stevens got \nit right when he said:\n\n       Essentially, five Justices were unhappy with the limited \n     nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to \n     give themselves an opportunity to change the law . . . there \n     were principled, narrower paths that a Court that was serious \n     about judicial restraint could have taken.\n\n  Then, in the environmental arena, I mentioned the Rapanos case where \nthe Supreme Court, once again by a 5-to-4 decision, reversed the clear \nintent of Congress and legal precedent to restrict the Environmental \nProtection Agency's ability to protect the clean waters of our Nation \nunder the Clean Water Act. Then, once again, in Exxon v. Baker, the \nSupreme Court just very recently restricted the amount of claims that \ncan be brought in regards to polluters in the Exxon Valdez issue. That \nis of particular concern to all of us who are trying to make sure those \nwho have been victimized by the BP oilspill have an effective remedy \nand that taxpayers don't have to provide bailout for the damages caused \nby BP Oil.\n  Solicitor General Kagan stated, in answer to questions before us:\n\n       Congress certainly has broad authority under the \n     Constitution to enact legislation involving the protection of \n     our environment. When Congress enacts such legislation, the \n     job of the courts is to construe it consistent with \n     Congressional intent.\n\n  Well, that is the type of person I would like to see, and I hope all \nof us would like to see, on the Supreme Court of the United States, \ngiving due deference to Congress as the legislative body under the \nConstitution. She said: The job of the courts is to construe the laws \nconsistent with congressional intent.\n  I am puzzled by those who have defended these Supreme Court decisions \nthat have taken away our citizens' rights for civil liberties and civil \nrights and who say that corporations don't have enough power in this \ncountry so they need more power; who have jeopardized our environment \nand have supported those decisions, even though it reverses previous \nprecedent and even though it is legislating from the courts, reversing \ncongressional action. Those who profess to be against judicial activism \nhave supported those decisions by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  I am confident Elena Kagan will follow legal precedent. She will \nrespect the rights of the Congress of the United States to legislate. \nShe will protect our rights against the abuses of power, whether it is \nfrom the government or from powerful corporate special interests. She \nwill respect the rights of the people of this Nation that the \nConstitution was so well designed to deal with.\n  Lastly, let me say she is well qualified to serve on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. She was the dean at Harvard Law School, \nSolicitor General of the United States, commonly referred to as the \n10th justice because of how closely she has worked with the Supreme \nCourt. She has received bipartisan support from those who know her \nbest. Former Solicitors General of the United States, appointed by both \nDemocrats and Republicans, support her nomination to be the next \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. When we \nconfirm her appointment, she will be one of three women to serve on the \nSupreme Court of the United States, the first time in the history of \nAmerica and a proud moment for this body to confirm her nomination.\n  Next Tuesday, I will vote to confirm Elena Kagan to be the next \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. I look \nforward to when each Member of the Senate will have an opportunity to \nvote on her confirmation, and I hope it will be an overwhelming \nconfirmation for her to serve the American people on the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Wood\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and to pay \ntribute to a fallen hero, U.S. Army SPC Edwin C.L. Wood of Omaha, NE.\n  Edwin was a proud member of B Troop, 1st Squadron, 71st Armored \nRegiment of the 10th Mountain Division operating in Kandahar. As many \nhave heard, this area is a Taliban stronghold and one of the most \ndangerous areas in Afghanistan.\n  On July 5, only a few weeks after arriving there, Specialist Wood was \nkilled when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. \nHis death is a great loss to our Nation and to Nebraska, his home \nState. People in his home community of Omaha recall Eddie's big heart, \nhis willingness to jump right in to help out, and his longstanding love \nfor the military. He was a leader of the North High School Junior ROTC \nProgram. He served as a counselor and a mentor at the YMCA Camp in \nCrescent, IA, and from an early age participated in military \nreenactments with his father. Also from an early age he loved wearing \nuniforms. His nickname was ``Freckles,'' which also fit his cheerful, \nhelpful personality.\n  After graduating from North High School in 2009, it did not take long \nto decide that the U.S. Army was the place for him. Specialist Wood's \nArmy career was short yet very intense. After entering the Army in \nOctober 2009, he breezed through basic and advanced training before \narriving at Fort Drum. Fort Drum is the home of the elite 10th Mountain \nDivision which specializes in fighting under harsh terrain and weather \nconditions.\n  Specialist Wood wanted to serve with the best, and his wish came \ntrue. Within a month, he deployed to the Kandahar region of \nAfghanistan. Shortly thereafter he first encountered the enemy that \nattacked with an improvised explosive device. Despite lingering effects \nfrom his injuries, he chose to stay in the fight with his B Troop \nbuddies.\n  The decorations and badges earned during a far too brief Army career \nspeak to his dedication and they speak to his bravery: the Army Service \nMedal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, \nthe Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, the Overseas Service Ribbon, NATO Medal, \nBronze Star Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n  He proudly wore the Combat Action Badge, the Expert Marksmanship \nBadge with Rifle Bar, and the Overseas Service Bar.\n  Today, I join Specialist Wood's mother and father, siblings and \nfriends in mourning the death of their beloved son, their brother, \ntheir friend.\n  Specialist Wood made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our great \nNation, and we owe him and his family an immeasurable debt of \ngratitude. May God\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\nbe with the Wood family and all those who mourn his death and celebrate \nhis life and his accomplishments. We will remember Specialist Wood when \nrecalling the Nation's warriors who gave their lives so we might live \nin peace. Their names are etched on the conscience of this Nation.\n  I offer my prayers to all those serving in uniform today and \nespecially those serving in peril overseas. May God bless them and \ntheir families and see them through these difficult times.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business, and I ask I be given as much time as needed.

Mr. President, probably tomorrow morning, we will \nconsider this conference report, which is historic in its impact on \nAmerica. It is the conference report of the Banking Committees of the \nHouse and Senate, which were charged with the responsibility to reform \nthe financial laws in America, to make certain that our country never \nfaces again what we faced a short time ago under President Bush.\n  We can remember that at the end of the President's term, when the \neconomy started to go into a tailspin. I remember it very well because \nthere was a special meeting called in October of 2008 of the leaders of \nthe House and Senate--Democratic and Republican--to meet with the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, and the Treasury \nSecretary, Mr. Paulson, to discuss a matter of great urgency. Those \ntypes of meetings are rare around here, and everyone was a little \nnervous as we entered the room that is a few feet away from the Senate \nChamber.\n  These two leaders of our economy came forward and told us that we \nwere facing the collapse of major businesses in America. Specifically, \nthey pointed to the collapse of AIG. It was an insurance company--the \nlargest in our country. Unfortunately, they had engaged in some \npractices where it had promised as an insurance policy that it would \nback up commercial transactions. If they fail, AIG, the insurance \ncompany, would come in and make the parties whole.\n\n  They overextended themselves. In so doing, as these commercial \ntransactions started to fail, AIG did not have sufficient reserves to \nmeet their promises. There was a fear that if they started this \ncascading effect of failures and the inability of AIG to keep its \npromise, it would result in a panic in our economy and a decline, which \nwould have been even more precipitous than what we had imagined.\n  It was at this meeting that Ben Bernanke of the Federal Reserve said \nthey were going to provide significant resources to AIG to help them \nweather this crisis. It came as a surprise to many of us in the room, \nunaware of the fact that the Federal Reserve had both the resources and \nthe legal authority to do that. It is an authority that had not been \nexercised, to my knowledge, since it was first created almost 80 years \nago.\n  That was the first meeting. It was an indication of a terrible, \nrocky, rough road ahead for America and ultimately for the world. \nSubsequent meetings were even more alarming, as we were told by \nSecretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson that unless we came up with $800 \nbillion in what was known as the TARP fund, which would be used to \nbasically bail out the largest financial institutions in America, \nAmerica's economy and the global economy could collapse. I have been \ninvolved in public life for a number of years. That is the type of \nconversation you never forget. Many of us were at a loss to argue the \nother side of the case that the problem was not that large or that the \nresponse did not have to be that significant or that the strategy and \ntactics were not the right ones. This was really uncharted water. We \nrelied on our economic leaders from the Federal Reserve and from the \nDepartment of the Treasury to suggest what we needed to do to go \nforward.\n  This rescue operation had some real value, I believe, in slowing down \nthe decline in our economy. But just a few weeks after that, the \nelection of the new President, Barack Obama, really gave to him and the \nnew administration economic challenges which no previous administration \nhad ever faced. When the President came to office, in the month he was \nsworn in, almost 750,000 were losing their jobs. In the span of the \nnext 60 and 90 days, the numbers grew. The President walked into a \nterrible situation, with the economy still in decline, with the TARP \nprogram President Bush had started in process but not completed, with \nunemployment reaching modern-day record levels, and with no end in \nsight. He inherited the biggest deficit in the history of the United \nStates from President Bush. What a contrast to what President Bush \ninherited 8 years before.\n  Yesterday, when President Obama named Jack Lew as the new head of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, he said Jack, who is an \nextraordinarily talented public servant, is fit for the Hall of Fame. I \nam sure Jack Lew, a modest man, would dispute that. The record speaks \nfor itself.\n  In his former capacity as Budget Director under President Clinton, \nJack Lew, in January of 2001, left President George W. Bush a surplus \nin the Federal Treasury of $236 billion. That is an amazing legacy, to \nend 8 years of President Clinton's administration with a surplus in the \nFederal Treasury, the deficit coming down, Social Security getting \nstronger, and to hand it off to President Bush. At that moment in time, \nthe accumulated debt of the United States of America from the time of \nGeorge Washington until the end of the Clinton Presidency was \napproximately $5 trillion. Eight years later when President George W. \nBush left office, the accumulated debt of America had grown from $5 \ntrillion to $12 trillion--more than doubled in an 8-year period of \ntime. Instead of leaving to President Obama a surplus, as President \nBush had inherited from President Clinton, he left him a $1.3 trillion \ndeficit. President Bush's administration, which was dedicated to \nbalancing the budget and conservative fiscal policy, more than doubled \nthe national debt that had been accumulated by America in its entire \nhistory, and instead of leaving a surplus for incoming President Obama, \nleft him a gaping hole in the budget.\n  In that context, we have many challenges, but one of the challenges \nis to make sure we never, ever again experience what happened with \nthese terrible decisions being made on Wall Street and the virtual \ncollapse or decline of the American economy, which led us into our \ndeficit situation, to the business losses across America, and record \nlevels of unemployment.\n  President Obama challenged us to come forward with Wall Street \nreform, change the way we do business on Wall Street so we never have \nto go through this again. Let's not have a repeat of this economic \ndisaster. I commend Chairman Chris Dodd and Chairman Barney Frank for \nthe extraordinary effort they put into this conference report.\n  More than 2 years after Bear Stearns failed, more than 18 months \nsince Wall Street brought America to the brink of another depression, \nmore than a year after President Obama provided his outline for strong \nfinancial reform, finally Wall Street reform is coming. After 8 million \nAmericans--actually, more than 8 million Americans--have lost their \njobs; after more than 1.2 million Americans have lost their homes; \nafter the American average household has lost 20 percent of its \naccumulated wealth and savings, finally Wall Street reform will help \nprevent such a crisis from ever occurring again.\n  As we began this debate in the Senate several months ago, we were \nfaced with a series of challenges and questions:\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\n  Should we give America's consumers the strongest consumer protections \nin our history or should we allow Wall Street to continue to do \nbusiness as usual, complete with the fine print, the tricks and the \ntraps, and the shadowy markets we have today in America?\n  Should we empower consumers to make informed choices for themselves \nand their own economic future when it comes to mortgages, credit cards, \nand student loans by forcing banks and credit card companies to offer \nclear terms in plain English or should we allow Wall Street and the \npredatory lenders to continue to skirt the law, knowing there is no cop \non the beat to enforce it?\n  Should we force the Wall Street banks to make their big gambling bets \non commodities and everything else they can dream up out in the open, \non fully transparent exchanges, or should we allow Wall Street to \ncontinue running a multitrillion-dollar shadow casino, one nobody can \nmonitor, one that allowed AIG to nearly cripple the entire financial \nsystem?\n  Should we protect the taxpayers so they never again are faced with \nbailing out the biggest banks in America? And--let me add insult to \ninjury--after we put all our hard-earned tax dollars into bailing out \nthe big banks, they showed their gratitude by giving bonuses, \nmultimillion-dollar bonuses, to one another. Should we change that? \nThat was one of the questions facing us when we debated this \nlegislation.\n  This conference report has the right answers to those questions. The \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act accomplishes \ntwo basic goals: It substantially reduces the risk that financial \nmarkets will cause the economy to implode again, and it empowers \nconsumers and small businesses to make better financial choices.\n  To reduce the risk of another financial crisis, this bill strengthens \nthree traditional layers of oversight of financial institutions:\n  First, the bill improves basic bank governance so institutions are \nrun more carefully and more prudently. Executive pay and banking is \ngoing to be tied more closely to long-term gains rather than massive \nrisk-taking, short-term thinking, and mortgages and other loans will \nhave to be underwritten much more carefully.\n  Second, the bill helps creditors and investors spot problems more \neasily at banks that continue to be run poorly. That imposes an extra \nlayer of discipline when bank boards fall asleep at the wheel. Credit \nrating agencies and the SEC will provide much better information to \ninvestors in both the debt and equity markets than investors have \ntoday. I might add, as chairman of the subcommittee which funds both \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, we are dramatically increasing the resources for \neach of those watchdog agencies to make sure they can implement the new \npowers given them by this law.\n  Third, the bill strengthens the regulatory structure that oversees \nthe financial industries. That will help us identify and address \nfailures at these institutions that are not properly managed either by \nbank leadership or by pressure from the debt and equity markets. A new \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council will require regulators to work \ntogether more closely to minimize systemic risks. A new resolution \nauthority will give regulators tools they lacked when Lehman Brothers \nwas in meltdown. And risky derivatives will be brought out of the \nshadows and into transparent clearinghouses and exchanges so that the \ntransactions can be seen rather than hidden from public scrutiny.\n\n  That is all very important, but outside Washington and New York, many \nAmerican families and small businesses are basically going to ask: That \nis all well and good, Senator. What is in it for us?\n  The Dodd-Frank conference report will bring basic accountability and \nfairness to consumers and small businesses across the Nation.\n  First, a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection will protect \nconsumers of financial products from the worst forms of abusive \nlending.\n  One of the benefits of this job is we get to meet some of the most \nimpressive people in America. One of those persons is a woman named \nElizabeth Warren. She is a law school professor at Harvard. Several \nyears ago, Professor Warren came and spoke to us at one of these \nweekend getaways we have to try to think beyond the pressing business \nof today in longer terms. She said what we need in this country is an \nagency that helps consumers have enough information so they can make \nthe right choices for themselves when they are making financial \ndecisions.\n  I went up to her after her remarks, and I said: Professor Warren, I \nwant to introduce that bill. Will you help me write it?\n  And she did. I introduced the earliest legislation on this issue. My \nversion of it has been included in this bill but changed. I think they \nhave improved substantially on the original bill I offered, but credit \nshould be given where it is due. Professor Warren inspired me to write \nmy bill and I know inspired many on the conference committee to follow \nthrough and pass this legislation.\n  Lenders will have to compete for business based on good loans rather \nthan competing to dream up clever tricks in order to drain as many \ndollars as possible out of borrowers' pockets.\n  Finally, there is going to be a cop on the beat with this consumer \nfinancial protection agency to ensure that mortgage brokers, private \nstudent lenders, payday lenders, banks, and credit unions provide \nconsumers with complete information so families can make good financial \nchoices. I cannot tell you how much the banking lobbyists hate this \nprovision. They came to my office and said: This is the worst idea \npossible, to have an agency that is going to watch the documents we put \nin front of our borrowers to make sure they do not include deceptive \nlanguage, tricks, and traps that could literally cost a person, a \nfamily, the money they have saved. Fortunately, we overcame that lobby \nand included this consumer financial protection agency as part of the \nact. Finally, there is going to be a single voice in Washington, DC, \nwith the mission of helping consumers make the right decisions for \nthemselves.\n  Second, small businesses and merchants will receive relief from one \nof their largest expenses over which they currently have no control--\ndebit card interchange fees. For most people, they never heard of it. \nBut ask a restaurant, a business, a grocery store in Iowa, in Illinois, \nor in New Mexico what is the biggest pain in the neck they are running \ninto, and they will tell you that on the short list is the money they \nhave to pay to Visa and MasterCard and other credit card and debit card \ncompanies every time a customer uses a card. You don't think about it, \ndo you, that when you hand over that credit or debit card to pay for \nyour restaurant bill, not only do you have an obligation to pay what \nyou have just charged but the restaurant is going to end up paying a \npercentage of your bill to the card company.\n  It turns out that small businesses and merchants across America have \nliterally no strength, no power, no voice in determining these \ninterchange fees. We are becoming more and more a plastic culture. Our \nyoung pages here in the Senate--and I think of my own children--many of \nthem don't carry much cash around any more. They have little plastic \ndebit cards and credit cards which they use when they become of age and \nare eligible for them. More than half the transactions in America now \nare done in plastic. As more of these transactions take place, the \nmerchants and businesses which honor the cards find that the \ninterchange fees charged by the credit card companies are virtually \nuncontrollable, until this bill.\n  For years, Visa and MasterCard, and their big bank backers, have \nunilaterally fixed prices on the fees small businesses pay every time \nthey accept a debit card from a customer. The two giant card networks \ncontrol 80 percent of the debit card market--that is Visa and \nMasterCard. And it is no surprise that debit interchange fees have \nrisen, even as the price of processing the transaction has fallen. They \ncan impose these prices and say to the local businessperson: Take it or \nleave it. Small businesses in Illinois and throughout the country have \npleaded over and over again with these card network giants: Give us \nsome way to reduce these costs so that we can reach profitability, hire \nmore people, and prosper as a business and pass on savings to \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n  The conference report that we have before us will require the Federal \nReserve to ensure that Visa, MasterCard, and their big bank allies can \nonly charge debit interchange fees that are reasonable and proportional \nto the cost of processing each transaction. It also prevents Visa and \nMasterCard from engaging in certain specific anticompetitive practices. \nI might add, the Department of Justice's antitrust section has \nconfirmed publicly, at a meeting before the Senate Judiciary Committee \na little over a month ago, that Visa and MasterCard are currently under \ninvestigation. Finally, Visa, MasterCard, and the Wall Street banks \nwill face some check against their unbridled market power in the credit \nand debit industries.\n  Finally, small businesses and merchants are going to have relief that \nwill lead to real savings, profitability, and reduced cost for \nconsumers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct is a landmark bill, including the most sweeping reforms to Wall \nStreet since the New Deal.\n  Let me tell you the political reality. In the Senate, there are 41 \nRepublican Senators. The bill I have described should be a bill \nsupported by both sides of the aisle. We will be fortunate to have four \nor five Republicans step up and join us to pass this bill. The \noverwhelming majority of Republicans will oppose this bill and side \nwith the banking industry.\n  One of the Republican leaders in the House, John Boehner of Ohio, \nsaid we were using with this bill a nuclear weapon to kill an ant. I \ndon't think anybody in America believes the recession we are facing \ntoday, with 8 million unemployed and 1.2 million losing their homes, is \nan ant. It is devastating to the millions of Americans who are \nunemployed and those who are losing their homes. I think this response \nis a measured, thoughtful, good response to deal with it.\n  Why don't we have the support of more Republicans? Why won't they \nstep up with us and make this bipartisan? Four or five of them will \nhave the courage to do it, and I tip my hat to them. I am glad they are \njoining us. This should be a bipartisan effort. But the others need to \nexplain why they do not want us to move forward with financial \nregulatory reform. They have to explain why they wanted to stand for \nthe status quo, leave the laws as written, and run the risk of another \nrecession in another day, leading to millions of people losing their \njobs and businesses failing. They do not have an answer for that. Their \nvote against this will be good news to the banking industry, the \nspecial interest groups, such as credit card companies, but it \ncertainly doesn't face the responsibility we all have to deal with the \neconomic crisis facing this Nation.\n  On behalf of the taxpayers in Illinois and throughout the country, \nwho never again want to bail out big banks, I wholeheartedly support \nthis bill's passage. On behalf of consumers and small businesses in \nIllinois and throughout the country, who want the power to make wise \nfinancial choices, I wholeheartedly support this bill. I am going to \nurge my colleagues to vote yes on this conference report so that \nPresident Obama can sign this bill into law.\n  Finally, reform will have to come to Wall Street.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and our majority \nwhip, Senator Durbin, for laying out, I think in very stark and honest \nand open terms, what we are facing in this country today. I wish to \npick up on that and to carry it a little further in talking about the \nnumber of people who are unemployed, what is happening to people across \nAmerica today who can't find work, while the Congress sits here \nimmobilized, unable to pass an extension of unemployment insurance \nbenefits.\n  It is unconscionable what is happening to so many people in America, \nthrough no fault of their own--people who are at the end of the line. \nThey are looking to us, asking us to do something. Yet the Congress \nsits here immobilized, unable to act. We are unable to act because a \nsmall minority here in the Senate on the Republican side refuses to let \nus move ahead with an extension of unemployment insurance benefits. If \nwe could ever have a vote--if we could get a vote on it--we would get \nover 50 votes. A majority would vote for the extension. But once again, \nunder the rules of the Senate, a minority of the Senate gets to decide \nwhat we vote on.\n  I wonder how many students in government classes that are being \ntaught in high school today, even in college, are being taught that the \nmajority does not govern in the Senate. I wonder how many understand \nthat in our democratic form of government, 41 Senators decide what we \nvote on--41. Not 51 but 41 Senators decide what legislation comes \nbefore this body.\n  You can go back to the Framers of our Constitution and read all they \nwrote in our Federalist Papers--what Madison said and others--and they \nall warned against the tyranny of the minority. That is why they set up \na system of majority rule. I think it was Madison who referred to the \naspect as perhaps a small junta being able to control legislation if we \ndid not have a majority vote. Well, we have turned that on its head. \nBecause today, a minority--41 Senators--decides what we vote on. Please \nexplain that in terms of our democratic principles to kids who are \ntaking government classes throughout America today.\n  Go to other countries, where we are trying to get them to establish \ndemocratic forms of government, and tell them: Oh, it is okay to have a \nminority decide what you vote on. They have to scratch their heads and \nsay: What are you talking about? We need a majority. Yet here in our \nown country, a minority rules in the Senate.\n  I know a lot of polls show that people are angry and they are mad at \nCongress. I can understand that. If I had been out of work for 99 weeks \nand I had a family to feed and house payments to make and all of a \nsudden my unemployment insurance benefits ended, I would be pretty mad \nat Congress too. I think what the Republicans are counting on is that \nthis fall they will be so mad they will vote against whoever is running \nCongress, and that is the Democrats, obviously. That is what they are \ncounting on; that people will vote because they are mad, they are \nangry, and they will vote the Democrats out. Yet it is the Republicans, \na minority, who are keeping us from voting on extending unemployment \ninsurance benefits.\n  I don't care what my friends on the other side of the aisle think. \nThe American people will know. People are not stupid. The voters of \nthis country are pretty smart. Oh, you might fool them for a little \nbit. As Abraham Lincoln said: You can fool them for a little bit, but \nnot all the time. And pretty soon they will catch on. They will catch \non that the Congress is not acting because a small minority of the \nSenate will not let us act.\n\n  A group of business economists recently released their economic \noutlook and they said that we are on track for recovery. They gave a \nlarge share of the credit to the Recovery Act that we passed last year, \nof course without one single Republican vote. I think the recovery bill \nprevented a catastrophe. But, quite frankly, the economy is still in \nthe doldrums. Sales of new homes plummeted last month to 33 percent, \nthe lowest level in 40 years.\n  According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. companies--get this--private \nU.S. companies are now hoarding an all-time high sum of $1.84 trillion \nin cash. Companies in America are holding $1.84 trillion in cash. They \nare unwilling to invest, to hire, or to expand. So again, it is a very \nfragile recovery that could dip back into even another big recession.\n  We had the Great Depression in the 1930s. In the 1990s, as a result \nof the profligate spending and the huge tax cuts for the wealthy under \nthe Bush administration and the Republicans who controlled Congress--as \nthe Senator from Illinois pointed out--President Obama was left with a \ndeficit of $1.3 trillion. When President Clinton left office, there was \na budget surplus of about close to $300 billion. Because of all that, \nwe have had the great recession of the 2000s--2007, 2008, 2009, and now \n2010.\n  A lot of figures are thrown around about how many are unemployed. The \nofficial unemployment is 9.5 percent\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\nwith nearly 15 million workers. But the real unemployment, including \nthose discouraged workers, those who are working part time because they \ncan't find a full-time job, is close to 26 million Americans. Twenty-\nsix million Americans can't find a full-time job. They are desperate \nand they need help. Right now, there are five job seekers for every new \njob opening. Actually, more accurately, there are more than eight. This \n26 million who are right now unemployed, officially, they say, there \nare about 5 to 6 unemployed workers for every job. But actually, it is \ncloser to about eight job seekers for every opening.\n  I was reading an article in the Post yesterday. Michael D. Tanner, a \nsenior fellow at the Cato Institute--a libertarian think tank--said:\n\n       Workers are less likely to look for work or accept less \n     than ideal jobs as long as they are protected from the full \n     consequences of being unemployed. That is not to say that \n     anyone is getting rich off of unemployment or that unemployed \n     people are lazy, but it is simple human nature that people \n     are a little less motivated as long as the check is coming \n     in.\n\n  Boy, that almost takes your breath away, that we have people such as \nthis in high places who are setting economic policy, or trying to set \neconomic policy. He says: As long as people are protected from the full \nconsequences of being unemployed. What does he mean: They have to \nstarve; they have to go out on the street corner with hat in hand, give \nup their homes, put their furniture out on the street, send their kids \nto the orphanage? Is that what Mr. Tanner means by the full \nconsequences of being unemployed? Maybe starving; can't get enough to \neven eat? What is he talking about--the full consequences--when there \nare eight people looking for every job?\n  He says that by extending unemployment benefits, it makes people less \ninclined to look for work. You wonder where people like this come from. \nWhere did they ever go to school? What did they learn in their \nlifetimes? Or are they just so uncaring about their fellow human beings \nthat they just say: Let it happen. Whatever happens, let it happen and \nthe government can't do anything to help.\n\n  We had that attitude prior to the 1930s, prior to the Great \nDepression. But I thought we turned the corner. I thought we recognized \nthat government could be an instrument to make sure that people's lives \nwere not miserable, that they did not have to suffer the ``full \nconsequences of being unemployed,'' being thrown out on the street or \nstarving or putting their kids in orphanages because they couldn't take \ncare of them any longer. I thought we turned the corner on that. But, \nobviously, there are some who would like to turn the clock back.\n  There are eight job seekers for every one unemployed. They are \nhanging by a thread. Their savings are exhausted. They have no safety \nnet whatsoever. Every day we get stories in our office, heartbreaking \nstories, of families back home struggling to survive, but there just \nare not any jobs. I heard from a woman in Waukon, IA. She worked in the \nsame job for 33 years, the plant closed, she and 300 other workers lost \ntheir jobs. This is in a town of 3,500 people. She is a diabetic \nwithout health insurance. She has applied for more than 200 jobs. She \nis crying out for a job. She wants to work, but she comes up \nemptyhanded because there are no jobs.\n  I heard from a worker in the Des Moines area who had been in the \ninsurance industry for many years and was laid off a year ago. Her \nbenefits were cut off last week. Here is what she said:\n\n       My concern is that my family cannot survive without the \n     unemployment benefits. We have depleted our savings just to \n     save the house and not get behind on the bills. I know there \n     are others far worse off. Please help pass the emergency \n     unemployment insurance extension.\n\n  These are hard-working people. They have tried their best. They have \nnot shirked their duties and responsibilities. They are being good \ncitizens, hard-working citizens. What we are talking about is just a \nmatter of fundamental fairness and decency and using the power of the \ngovernment to make sure people do not--what did Mr. Tanner say?--\n``suffer the full consequences of being unemployed,'' whatever that may \nmean.\n  Yet in the face of these families in this crisis, the extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits is stalled, it is stuck. I would say it \nis cruelly obstructed in the Senate. We have tried time and time again \nto pass an extension. Every time it is blocked by our Republican \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. As a result of this, more \nthan 2 million Americans have now exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Actually, when I took this floor before the Fourth of July recess, I \ntalked about the number of people who would be out, and I said it would \nbe about 2 million. It is now 2.5 million. Last week, 2.1 million; this \nweek, 2.5 million. These are people out of work. They have been out of \nwork so long, although they have looked for work, that now their \nunemployment benefits are gone.\n  I ask people to think about it. Around this place we all have jobs, \ndon't we? We all have jobs. Everybody who works on the Senate floor has \na job. I have a job. You, Mr. President, have a job. We get paid pretty \ndarned well too. We are not facing unemployment. No one who works here \nis facing unemployment. Just think how you would feel. Just think how \nyou would feel if you got a pink slip yesterday, and it said don't come \nto work next week. You have house payments to make, you have kids in \nschool, maybe one in college or two. You might even have car payments \nto make. All of a sudden you are out of work and you cannot find a job. \nThey say: I am sorry, you can't get unemployment benefits either. What \ndo you do? What do you do?\n  Put yourself in the shoes of these people. What would you do? How mad \nwould you be at the U.S. Congress and the government if you had worked \nall your life, like this woman from Waukon, 33 years--out of work, \ndiabetic, no health insurance, has applied for over 200 jobs, can't \nfind a job, and we cut off your unemployment benefits? How mad would \nyou be?\n  We keep hearing this, and I have heard it from the other side of the \naisle, I have heard it from Sarah Palin and others, that people are \nlazy. They just rely on those benefits instead of looking for work. \nEven the distinguished minority whip, Senator Kyl, put it recently--\nhere is the quote:\n\n       Continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a \n     disincentive for them to seek new work.\n\n  There are eight people looking for every job. How low do we have to \ndrive people down? I suppose if we paid people 50 cents an hour we \nmight get people to work, to do things. Is that what we have come to as \na country, that people have to be pushed that far down before we \nrespond?\n  I think those who say people are just lazy are out of touch with \nreality. Let's look at the facts. Numbers vary from State to State. \nUnemployment insurance benefits vary from State to State. Right now it \nis about $300 a week average nationwide--$300 a week. For a family of \nfour, get this, if you get unemployment benefits--if you are lucky \nenough to still be on them--you are getting $300 a week average. That \nis about $15,000 a year. Can you keep your family going on $15,600 a \nyear, a family of four? The poverty line is $22,000. I suppose, \naccording to my friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, if you are getting \n$15,600 a year, that is a disincentive for you to try to find a job \nthat pays more than $22,000.\n  I don't understand the logic of that reasoning. The truth is, the \nlong-term unemployed would like nothing more than to pull themselves up \nby their bootstraps. But the problem is, in the economy right now we \nare kind of short of bootstraps.\n  Another argument I hear from our Republican colleagues is that \nextending the unemployment benefits will add to the deficit. Their \nargument is that we should cut off some of the most desperate people in \nour economy, take away their last meager lifeline, because we are \nconcerned about the deficit. Yet those very same Senators are demanding \nthat we extend hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the \nwealthiest Americans in our society. My friend, the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Sanders, who was here yesterday morning, gave a great \nspeech on what is happening in our society in terms of the few \ncontrolling more and more and the rest getting less and less. As he \npointed out, the top 1 percent, the richest people in America, control \n90 percent of the wealth. They control 90 percent. The rest can get all \nthe rest. Yet\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\nmy Republican colleague said we have to keep giving them more tax \nbreaks, but we cannot help people who are unemployed; it will add to \nthe deficit.\n  Extending these tax breaks for the wealthiest in our society also \nadds to the deficit, but I guess in their way of thinking that is all \nright.\n  Again, when we talk about extending these tax breaks, my friends on \nthe Republican side, they don't say we have to find an offset for it. \nThey say, no, add that to the deficit; we don't have to pay for that. \nBut if we want to extend unemployment benefits, we have to somehow pay \nfor that.\n  Again, I am sorry, I am lost in the logic of that. According to our \nRepublican colleagues, adding massively to the deficit to finance tax \nbreaks for the wealthy is fine, but adding to the deficit to extend \nbenefits for the long-term unemployed is unacceptable. I just happen to \nthink those are misplaced priorities.\n  Let me speak a little bit about deficits because they are a concern \nand they are something we do have to pay attention to and we are going \nto have to fix for the long term. We are in a fiscal mess. But it was \nnot so long ago then-Vice President Dick Cheney dismissed the need for \nfiscal responsibility when they were cutting tax breaks for the \nwealthy, spending more and more. Here is what he said: ``Deficits don't \nmatter.''\n  Vice President Dick Cheney said: ``Deficits don't matter.'' Again, \nunder his administration, with President Bush, they didn't matter. Boy, \nthe deficits just spiraled out of control. I do not remember any \nsignificant Republican dissent from Mr. Cheney's view during that \nperiod of time, that deficits don't matter because they were off going \nafter weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and that misplaced war has \ncost us pretty close to $1 trillion, not counting untold lives lost, \npeople injured for life. And the tax breaks for the wealthy spiraled \nus, again, into a deficit. But Mr. Cheney said deficits don't matter.\n  I tend to disagree with Mr. Cheney. Deficits do matter. They matter \nbecause when Mr. Clinton was President, we got out of the deficit hole. \nThey said deficits don't matter when Republicans were in control. Now \nthey say deficits do matter. They blame the Federal Government's fiscal \nmess on President Obama and actions taken by this Congress. That takes \na wholesale rewriting and air brushing of recent history.\n  As we all know, it was the administrations of President Reagan and \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush in the 1980s that launched America into a \nnew era of large budget deficits. President Clinton then spent the \nfollowing 8 years cleaning up the fiscal mess he inherited.\n  In 1993, President Clinton, along with the Democrats, the Democratic \nCongress, passed a painful but a courageous deficit reduction plan \nwithout one single Republican ``yes'' vote in the Senate. That plan not \nonly produced record budget surpluses, it expanded our economy. People \nwere employed. It put us on a path, by the year 2000, to completely \neliminate the national debt within a decade. We could have wiped out \nthe national debt.\n  I remember that debate. I was here. In 1993, I remember the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mr. Gramm, getting up, wailing about how this plan was \ngoing to destroy America. It was going to plunge us into fiscal crisis. \nIt was going to create unemployment. It was going to create a disaster.\n  We passed it without one Republican vote. Look what happened: the \neconomy grew, unemployment went down, we paid down the national debt, \nand we left in 2000 with a huge budget surplus.\n  Yet in 1994, the year after we passed this without one single \nRepublican vote, Republicans were all over the country taking the \nDemocrats to task for raising taxes. You know what happened in 1994. \nThe Democrats lost the Senate and lost the House and Republicans took \nover. But we were able to keep that program intact. They couldn't \nrepeal it and we kept it intact during the 1990s, resulting in a good \nstrong economy, more employment, less unemployment and, as I said, \nputting us on a plan to pay off the national debt.\n  Then in 2001 George Bush came to office, Republicans gained control, \nand again we moved into deficits once more in our country--huge \ndeficits. As my friend from Illinois said, according to CBO, when \nPresident Obama took office we had a $1.3 trillion deficit. When \nPresident Bush took office in 2001 we had about a $300 billion surplus. \nWhat a difference. What a difference.\n  Now, because of the profligate spending and the deficits of those 8 \nyears of Bush, because of the huge hole we were in when President Obama \ntook over, our economy is in a tailspin.\n  Now we are trying to work our way out of it. That is why we had the \nRecovery Act. The Recovery Act helped us gain more jobs in this \ncountry. As I said, it kept us from having a catastrophe. Now we know \nwe can bring the deficit back under control. We did it during the \nClinton administration, and we can do that again.\n  As my friend from Illinois said yesterday, President Obama nominated \nJack Lew to serve as Director of the White House Office of Management \nand Budget. He held that same position in the Clinton administration, \nin the latter years of the Clinton administration. So again we are \nlooking to Mr. Lew to help us work our way out of this mess we are in.\n  So I can say that we Democrats are proud of our record of fiscal \nresponsibility. But forgive us for asking: Why is it that again and \nagain we Democrats are cast in the role of the shovel brigade in the \ncircus cleaning up after the elephants? Why are we always doing that? \nAnd then people get mad because we have to clean up the mess. Well, I \nam tired of being the shovel brigade after those elephants. We all \nunderstand that deficits are unaffordable and unsustainable. However, \namong economists, a broad array of economists in this country; among \nmany Senators--I am one of them--I believe there is a more immediate \nand urgent concern; that is, getting a recovery from the deepest \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression. Do unemployment benefits \ncost money? Of course they do. Are they in our long-term interest? \nAbsolutely.\n  The single most effective way to reduce the deficit is to keep the \nrecovery on track. If we can do that, we can reduce the deficit, \naccording to CBO, from 10 percent of GDP this year to 4 percent by \n2014. I will be the first to say we cannot do it overnight. We did not \ndo it overnight in the 1990s. It took us literally 8 years, but it \nbuilt up slowly, and toward the end we were really rolling by the year \n2000: low unemployment, the economy was booming, we had budget \nsurpluses. But it took a long time to get there, and it is going to \ntake us some time to get back there again. But extending unemployment \nbenefits is an essential way to keep us on that path to recovery.\n  Economists calculate that for every dollar invested, the unemployment \ninsurance safety net generates about $1.63 in economic activity. Again, \nthey tell us: If you are going to spend government money, if you are \ngoing to do that, you get the most bang for the buck by putting it in \nfood stamps. Because when poor people get food stamps, they go out and \nthey buy food. The next is unemployment benefits. When you give it to \npeople who are unemployed, they go out and they spend that money. They \nbuy food, they pay their rent, they pay their food bills, they pay \ntheir clothing bills, they pay for car payments, house payments, all of \nthose things just to keep afloat. So that spurs economic activity. Yet \nlook down here--extending the Bush tax cuts. For every dollar we extend \nthe Bush tax cuts, we only get back 49 cents. Compare that to \nunemployment benefits. Yet the Republicans want us to do this, spend \nevery dollar we have to extend the Bush tax cuts, for which we will get \nback about 49 cents. They do not want to do unemployment benefits that \nfor every dollar we spend we get back $1.63 in economic activity. They \nsay unemployed households spend these dollars on immediate needs.\n  From the Recovery Act alone in Iowa, more than 3,700 jobs were \ncreated in 2009 thanks to the economic activity of the Recovery Act. \nDid that get us all of the way out of the recession? No. But it sure as \nheck helped a lot of families and kept us from sinking even further. So \nthat is why we had the Recovery Act, which has at least helped us out \nof a depression.\n  David Walker is the former Comptroller General under the Bush \nadministration, the George W. Bush administration. Now he is president \nof the\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\nPeter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization that is single-mindedly \nfocused on cutting long-term deficits. Last week, he testified before \nthe bipartisan deficit reduction panel. He said it is a ``myth that we \ncannot address our current economic crisis and our long-term fiscal \ncrisis at the same time.'' Yet that is what we are hearing from \nRepublicans: We can't do both of those; we have to focus on the \ndeficit, and don't worry about the crisis we have right now.\n  David Walker continued:\n\n       In our view, the answer is to continue to pursue selected \n     short-term initiatives designed to stimulate the economy and \n     address unemployment, but to couple these actions with \n     specific meaningful actions designed to resolve our long-term \n     structural deficits.\n\n  Well, I agree. We have to address the short term and then think about \nthe things we have to do here to address the long-term problems of the \ndeficit.\n  So, again, for the sake of all of the families who have written in to \nmy office, for all of the families who are at the end of the line, I \nurge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop this cruel \nobstructionism and do the right thing right now for people who \ndesperately need our help. Stop the filibuster. Let us vote. There are \nmore than 50 votes. There is a majority here to extend unemployment \nbenefits. I ask the minority to allow us to vote on it, to help these \nfamilies in desperate need all over the country.\n  It is my intention, as often as I can, to get to the floor to \ncontinue to speak about the desperate needs of those families we cannot \ncontinue to ignore.\n  To those who think they can gain politically at the polls in \nNovember, who think they can gain politically by having people suffer \nmore, by having them more desperate and more destitute, I say that is \nan aberration, that is a total abdication of our responsibility as \nofficers, as people who are sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution \nof the United States. It is unworthy. It is unworthy of a great country \nfor their leaders, for their elected leaders, to show they can get \npolitical gain by making people more desperate than they are today.\n  So I hope we can have the vote, we can extend the unemployment \nbenefits, and we can help people who really need a lifeline right now. \nAnything short of that is not worthy of our great country. I urge the \nminority to let the bill come up for a vote so we can vote it through. \nIt should be done this week.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5806-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5806-S5808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONGRESSIONAL TO-DO LIST\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the to-do list in the Congress, and \nespecially in the Senate, is long and difficult. We have witnessed all \nof this year a determined minority to act as a set of human brake pads. \nThe minority has tried to stop almost everything in the Senate, \nincluding providing extended unemployment benefits for those who are \nout of work during the country's deepest recession since the Great \nDepression. It is unbelievable to me.\n  It seems to me everyone should understand that when we are in a deep \nrecession, as we have been--and we are coming out of it--that is the \ntime to extend unemployment benefits because it is necessary to do. Yet \nit, too, has gotten caught in this trap of saying no to everything.\n  I wish to go over just a bit of the to-do list in the Senate. First \nand foremost, there is no question that one of the most significant \nchallenges facing this country is debt and deficits. Everybody \nunderstands that. The question is, How do we deal with it?\n  The President is criticized for describing what he took over, but it \nis pretty important. You go to a rental car dealership and they want \nyou to look around and see what the car is like before you rent it, \nright? This President ran for President, but when he took over this \neconomy, had he done nothing, not lifted a finger, the Federal budget \ndeficit was going to be $1.3 trillion. On the first month of his \nPresidency, the economy he was left with had 680,000 people losing \ntheir jobs in that month.\n  This economy was in steep decline. That is what he inherited. It is \nnot my taking a half hour to describe what was wrong in the previous 8 \nyears, it is stating the obvious. What do we try to do about that?\n  Well, the President has created this commission to try to address the \ndeficits and debt that have come from this steep economic decline. When \na country is experiencing a very deep recession, there is less revenue \ncoming in. We were losing about $400 billion in revenue that we used to \nget. And then we have higher expenditures going out because we have the \neconomic stabilizers that we pay for in order to help people during \ntimes of economic distress. So we had these unbelievable Federal budget \ndeficits. That is not surprising. That will happen when there is a very \nsteep economic downturn.\n  But we can't, it seems to me, go into this with a structural \nimbalance, as we had, and then have a deep recession and have deficits \nexplode and then not have a plan to deal with them. So the question is \nfor all of us--the President and the Congress--what do we do?\n  The President has created a high-level bipartisan commission to say: \nAll right, come up with a set of recommendations by the end of this \nyear of what we can do. What are the range of issues with everything on \nthe table? Yes, discretionary spending, military spending, \nentitlements, all of it. What is the menu necessary to put this country \nback on track?\n  In 2001, President Bush proposed very large tax cuts. I voted no on \nthe floor of the Senate, and I said the reason I am voting no is that I \ndon't think we should provide 10 years of very large tax cuts just \nbecause we had a surplus the last year of Bill Clinton's Presidency. We \nhad a budget surplus--the first budget surplus we had in 30 years. They \nestimated that not only would we have a budget surplus that year, but \nwe would have surpluses for the next 10 years.\n  I said: Let's be a little conservative. What if something happens? \nWhat if we don't have the surpluses?\n  They said: Don't worry about that; let's give large tax cuts--and the \nbulk of it, by the way, went to the wealthiest Americans. Without my \nvote, that passed. It did a lot of strange things.\n  Among the tax cuts was a cut in the estate tax that took the estate \ntax over these 9 years down, down, down, and down so that this year we \nhave a zero estate tax. Think of that. The estate tax in this country \nthis year is zero. We have about 400 billionaires in America. I believe \nfour of them have died in this year. This is the ``Throw Mama From the \nTrain'' year, as the title of the movie goes. This is the year when, if \nyou have a lot of money and you are going to go, this is the year, I \nsuppose, and those who are related to you might think there is divine \nprovidence here.\n  Let me put up this chart. In today's newspaper, it says George \nSteinbrenner, the colorful owner of the New York Yankees, died. I \ndidn't know George Steinbrenner, but he was quite an extraordinary man, \nI am sure--a successful businessman and a controversial owner of the \nNew York Yankees. But he was also a billionaire. Today, the Washington \nPost talks about the fact that this year the estate tax is at zero, so \nhis estate will have no tax obligation at all.\n  Let me just observe that for the largest estates, most of the wealth \ncomes from the appreciation of assets over the years and has never been \ntaxed. So it has never had to bear a tax to send kids to school or \nbuild roads or provide for police or provide for our defense needs--\nnone of it. We have had four billionaires die this year. And we have \nthis goofy process, which the previous administration created, to go to \na zero estate tax this year and then spring back to an estate tax next \nyear. It is just nutty.\n  Do you want to know how to reduce the Federal budget deficit? How \nabout fixing a few of these things. That ought to be on the to-do list. \nIt is embarrassing, it seems to me, for those who\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\nunderstand fiscal policy and understand there is a responsibility for \nall Americans not just to be glad they are Americans, but also to \nparticipate in the things Americans have to participate in together, \nthat that includes paying some taxes, yes, and some estate taxes. It is \nembarrassing that we have a zero estate tax for the wealthiest \nAmericans at this point. That makes no sense to me.\n  We have a proposed extension of the tax cuts for middle-income \nworkers that comes from the 2001 tax bill that President Bush pushed \nthrough this Congress. One of my colleagues was on a show this Sunday \nand said: Well, we want to also give a tax cut to the top 2 percent of \nthe American income earners. The moderator of the show said: That is \ngoing to cost 680-some billion dollars in lost revenue. How do you pay \nfor that?\n  My colleague, who talks about the Federal budget deficits a lot and \nthe need to deal with them, said: We don't have to pay for tax cuts.\n  It seems to me basic arithmetic books allow us to add 1 and 1 and get \n2--from time to time, at least. So we are going to deal with the \nFederal budget deficits by extending income tax cuts to the wealthiest \nAmericans? We are going to deal with the Federal budget deficits by \nhaving a zero estate tax obligation for somebody who dies and has a \nbillion or billions of dollars?\n  What about the notion of going to war twice, in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand not paying a penny for it? We have all of these gatherings to say \ngoodbye--particularly in the National Guard--to a National Guard unit \nthat will be sent to Iraq or Afghanistan. We say Godspeed and be safe. \nWhen they come home, we say welcome home. We do everything except pay \nthe bill. We send them to war, have them strap on ceramic body armor in \nthe morning, walk in harm's way and get shot at. But this Congress \ndoesn't have the courage to decide that we ought to pay for wars we are \nfighting. All of it has been piled on the debt.\n  Some of us stood in this well and said let's pay for it, and we were \ntold if we do that and try to pay for it, the President will veto it \nbecause we are trying to raise revenue. That is right, raising revenue \nto pay for the cost of sending America's men and women in uniform to \nfight for this country. It used to be essential, not optional. It was \nthe moral and responsible thing to do. All of this has been charged and \nadded to the debt. So the soldiers go fight and come home, and they \nwill pay the bill as well. That makes no sense to me.\n  I have described at great length the tax avoidance going on in this \ncountry. I described that some of the highest income earners get to pay \n15 percent carried interest. They get to pay some of the lowest tax \nrates, and that is not enough. Some of them are running them through \ntax haven countries and are playing deferred compensation games in \norder to avoid paying anything. They want all that America has to offer \nexcept responsibility to pay their taxes.\n  That is true with some very large American corporations as well. The \ncompany that was drilling out in the gulf--the licensed company \ndrilling for BP--Transocean had, I believe, 1,200 employees in Houston, \nTX, and 12 employees in Switzerland. What was the deal there? Well, \nthey moved their home office to Switzerland, despite the fact that they \njust had a dozen employees there and they had 1,200 in Houston. Why did \nthey do that? To avoid paying taxes, I assume.\n  There is a to-do list. Maybe we can shut down some of these schemes. \nHow about an estate tax for estates worth billions of dollars, or \npaying for the cost of war as our soldiers are asked to go fight it? \nCutting spending--some come out here and talk about cutting spending. I \nsupport that--in the right way. We have a lot of areas where Federal \nagencies can tighten their belts. By the way, it is one thing to talk \nabout it, it is another thing to do it.\n  Some years ago, when I came to the Congress, there was $46 million \nallocated to build a new Federal courthouse in Fargo, ND. I said I \nthought that was outrageous. Yes, it is in my State, but I thought it \nwas outrageous. I cut it to $23 million--from $46 million to $23 \nmillion--in half--and the courthouse got built for $19 billion. That \nwas in my State. I was critical of spending in my own State.\n  I have come to the floor recently critical of what is being proposed \nto be spent on the small northern border ports of entry, which I think \nis an excessive amount of money. Yes, those are in my State as well. I \nthink we all ought to take a hard look at Federal spending and look at \nwhere we can and should begin to make some cuts.\n  Finally, when we talk about deficits--we talk a lot about budget \ndeficits. But nobody talks much about the trade deficit. This morning \nthere was a story: Trade deficit jumps to $42 billion, economists \ndowngrade growth forecasts. I wrote a book about this several years \nago. I described in that book, in great detail, what is happening: \nshipping jobs overseas, going in search of low-wage countries where \nthey can move their production in order to produce and sell the product \nback in our country. All of that ratchets up this unbelievable deficit. \nWe have had trade deficits in recent years, with $700 billion and $800 \nbillion in merchandise trade deficits. The budget deficit is money that \nwe are going to owe to ourselves. We cannot make that case with the \ntrade deficit. We owe that to other countries, and we are going to \nrepay that with a lower standard of living in our country someday.\n\n  This is not just about deficits, it is about jobs. When we run these \nkinds of deficits and see plants and factories closing in this \ncountry--5 million factory workers have lost their jobs because we see \nthis unbelievable drain of jobs leaving our country in search of lower \nwages elsewhere. We have to address this, and we have to address it in \nthe right way. I will talk about that at some point, on another day. It \nis not rocket science to understand that debt is debt and deficits are \ndeficits. We have to address these issues.\n  Now, one other point on this economy. I was on a program the other \nday on CNBC. They said: What about this notion that because of what you \nare doing on promoting additional regulations on Wall Street and other \nissues, you are antibusiness--you Democrats in Congress and the \nDemocratic administration are antibusiness?\n  I have heard a couple of CEOs say that. I said: You know, it is \nbyzantine to me. If you want to run a big company in this country and \ndo business here and look at something that is antibusiness, look at \nWall Street and see what they did. See the cesspool of greed they \ncreated with a bubble of speculation that was unprecedented in the \nhistory of this country--selling and buying things that had no value, \nwagering rather than investing, using exotic instruments such as credit \ndefault swaps and much more, and planting loans out there for \nhomeowners who could not repay them--giving a $780,000 home loan to \nsomebody making $18,000 a year, creating liars loans, saying: Come and \nget a loan from us, and you don't have to disclose your income. It is \ncalled a no-doc loan. Come and get a loan from us, and you don't have \nto disclose your income or pay any principal the first year--or come \nand get a loan from us, but don't tell us your income, don't pay any \nprincipal the first year, or any interest, and we will make the first \n12 payments for you.\n  Then what would they do, Countrywide mortgage? They would take these \nloans, pay big bonuses to the people who put the loans out there--the \nbrokers--and wrap them into securities and sell the securities up to \nhedge funds, investment banks, and they were all making massive \nprofits. Then we had others who would look at these securities and make \ncredit default swaps--wagers on whether these bonds would be good.\n  What was going on in this country is unbelievable. The whole thing \nwas a house of cards, and it came collapsing down. Now we decide we are \ngoing to put regulations in place to say: You cannot do that anymore. \nYou damn near ruined this country's economy, and we won't let you do it \nanymore.\n  One of the top manufacturing CEOs in this country said it is \nantibusiness--the administration is antibusiness. It is not \nantibusiness to put into place effective, tough regulations to say: Do \nbusiness the right way. If you do what you have been doing, we are \ngoing to put handcuffs on you because it almost ruined this country's \neconomy.\n  It is not antibusiness to insist that business be done in the right \nway, when in the basement of the SEC four companies came in to get the \nSEC, in\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\nthe last decade, to change the rules so they could go from 12 times \nleverage to 30 times leverage, and they did it with almost no notice \nfrom everybody, with all these handshakes that go on.\n  When that goes on and regulators say: You know what. Don't worry. It \nis going to be a new business-friendly place. We won't look. Do what \nyou want. We don't care--when that all happened and it caused the near \ncollapse of the American economy and our way of life, we have a right, \nit seems to me, without being called antibusiness, to say there needs \nto be effective regulators and regulations to make sure this doesn't \nhappen again.\n  Fifteen years ago, I wrote the lead story for the Washington Monthly \nmagazine, and the title was ``Very Risky Business.'' That was the lead \nstory in the Washington Monthly magazine that I wrote 16 years ago.\n  What was it about? It was about banks in America trading derivatives \non their own proprietary accounts. I said then that we just as well put \na blackjack table in their lobby. That is just gambling. We ought not \nallow it. We know who is going to pick up the bill--the American \ntaxpayer.\n  It was 11 years ago on the floor of this Senate that I stood up and \nopposed repealing the laws from the Great Depression--Glass-Steagall \nand others--that were put in place to protect our country, that \nseparated banking from securities and prohibited certain practices that \nled to the Great Depression. Then, all of a sudden, it is time to \nmodernize; that is old-fashioned. The proposal to repeal those laws \nwent through here like a hot knife through butter. Eight of us voted \nno--eight of us. I stood on the floor of the Senate and said: I think \nwithin a decade we are going to see massive taxpayer bailouts. I did \nnot have a crystal ball; I just felt this was an unbelievable mistake.\n  The fact is, we have a right and a responsibility to put together \neffective regulatory mechanisms that will prevent this from happening \nagain. I understand there are interests out there that will howl so \nloud, you will hear them coast to coast. It does not matter. This is \nabout what is best for the American people, what is best for this \ncountry's economy to expand and create jobs once again.\n  The to-do list, as I indicated, is fairly lengthy. I have not touched \na number of issues. The most important point, obviously, is to find a \nway to create new jobs.\n  As I indicated, it is like a bathtub where you have a faucet and a \ndrain. The faucet is, we need to try to create conditions in which new \njobs will be created. How do we do that? We give people confidence \nabout the future. It is hard to have confidence when you take a look at \nthe economic circumstances of this country right now. If people are \nconfident, they do things that manifest that confidence and the economy \nexpands. That is our responsibility to do.\n  Even as we try to provide more confidence, that means tackling tough \nissues that will give people a feeling that they can expect a better \nfuture, can make investments, can hire people. That is part of the \nfaucet--to put new jobs into this economy. We also need to plug the \ndrain. Every single day, we have jobs leaving for China and elsewhere \nin search of cheap labor. I have spoken about that many times as well. \nAs I said, I have written a book about that.\n  We need to work on all of those issues, and jobs has to be issue No. \n1. It is the most important issue. It makes everything else possible \nfor the American people. Right now, as I speak, there are millions and \nmillions of people who are out of work. Million Americans have lost \ntheir jobs just in the manufacturing area in the last 8 years. We are \nshort somewhere perhaps in the neighborhood of 18 to 20 million jobs in \nthis country. We have to get the engine moving again. We have to get \nopportunities to expand jobs all across this country. There is a lot to \ndo to make that happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5808-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5808-S5809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TRAVEL TO CUBA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, while I am on the floor, I wish to make \na point about another piece of public policy I have worked on for some \nwhile.\n  The House of Representatives last week passed legislation through the \nAgriculture Committee that would lift the travel ban that is now \nimposed on American citizens to Cuba. I have been to Cuba and have met \nwith the Cuban Government, dissidents, people who have been in prison. \nIt is 90 miles off our shore.\n  There is an embargo on Cuba and a travel ban to Cuba. This chart \nshows the ten U.S. Presidents under which this embargo has existed. As \none can see, a fair number of Presidents have come and gone while this \nembargo and travel ban to Cuba has been in place.\n  The problem with it that I see is this: This embargo is and has \nalways been Fidel Castro's biggest excuse.\n  Your cities are falling down, your economy is in trouble, things are \nawful in Cuba.\n  His response: Yes. That is because this 500-pound gorilla has had its \nfist around our neck with an embargo for 50 years. You try to run this \ncountry.\n  It is his biggest excuse.\n  Cuba is a Communist country. I have no interest in doing anything \nthat is helpful to the government at all. I do have an interest in \ntrying to help the Cuban people.\n  Deciding to tell the American people: We will restrict your right to \ntravel; we are going to infringe on your freedom; our government says \nyou cannot travel, American citizen, to Cuba--I think that is \nunbelievable. By what right does our government say you cannot travel \nto Cuba?\n  Let me show where Americans can travel. It is perfectly appropriate, \nif you can get a visa, to travel to Iran, according to the Office of \nForeign Assets Control in the Treasury Department.\n  OFAC, by the way, in the basement, the deep bowels of the Treasury \nDepartment, are supposed to be tracking money to terrorists. But about \na fourth of their resources are devoted to tracking American citizens \nwho are suspected of vacationing in Cuba. Think of that. In a world \nbeset by terrorist threats, we have folks who are trying to figure out: \nAre there American citizens who have gone to Cuba whom we can track \ndown and against whom we can levy a $10,000 fine?\n  You can go to Iran, OFAC says. That is not a problem. You are an \nAmerican citizen and you want to go to Iran, that is OK.\n  If you are an American citizen and you would like to see Kim Jong Il \nwhile he is still in office, you can go to North Korea. That is not a \nbig deal for OFAC. If you want to go to Communist North Korea, no \nproblem at all.\n  You want to go to China, a Communist country? Not a problem. You want \nto go to Vietnam, a Communist country? That is no problem. I have been \nto both, by the way. Why have we said that about Vietnam and China? \nBecause we have a very specific policy with respect to that issue. We \nhave said we believe that engagement through trade and travel is the \nmost effective way to move both China and Vietnam toward greater human \nrights. Let me say that again. Our official policy--Republicans and \nDemocrats--has been that we believe the most effective way to move \nChina and Vietnam--Communist countries--toward greater human rights is \nthrough trade and travel through engagement. Engagement. The only \noutlier to that is Cuba, which is 90 miles off our shore. And Fidel \nCastro pokes his finger in our eye every chance he gets.\n  We decided some while ago--many Presidents ago, actually--to put \ntogether an embargo, which has not worked at all, which includes \nrestricting the American people's right to travel. Then in 2003, \nleading up to the elections in 2004, President Bush made this even \ntighter. He eliminated people-to-people visits in 2003; eliminated \nsecondary school education travel; restricted family travel to once \nevery 3 years; restricted amateur athletic travel. Essentially, he tied \nit very tight. The upshot of that was, I guess they all felt good that \nthey were going to tighten restrictions around Cuba and tell those \nCuban Americans who felt that is the right thing to do that this was \nsomething the administration was going to do to be helpful to them.\n\n  Here is what the Office of Foreign Assets Control says about travel \nto Cuba. I just described that North Korea is fine and travel to Iran \nis fine, China and Vietnam are fine. They say:\n\n       Unless otherwise authorized, any person subject to U.S. \n     jurisdiction who engages in any travel-related transaction in \n     Cuba violates the regulations.\n\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\n\n  Let me describe some of these notorious violators our government has \ntracked down and tried to levy a $10,000 fine against. This is Joni \nScott. I have met Joni Scott. She is holding a Bible in this picture. \nThe reason Joni Scott is holding a Bible is this young woman went to \nHavana to pass out free Bibles. An American woman went to Havana to \npass out free Bibles. What happened to her? Did the Cuban Government \nget ahold of her somehow and give her a bad time? No, no. The American \nGovernment did. The American Government tracked her down and tried to \nlevy a fine because she was suspected of traveling to Cuba. Isn't that \nsomething? It is unbelievable.\n  Here is another woman I have met. This is Joan Slote. She is a \nbicyclist. She is a grandma in her midseventies. She joined a Canadian \ngroup to bicycle in Cuba. Her government then tracked her down and not \nonly tried to fine her $10,000 but tried to attach her Social Security \npayments and take them away--this from her government. It is \nunbelievable.\n  Then, finally, SGT Carlos Lazo, whom I have described before. He fled \nCuba and then went to Iraq and fought for America and was awarded a \nBronze Star. He then came back to America after having fought for his \ncountry. He had two sons in Cuba, one of whom was sick, and his \ngovernment--the American Government--told this Bronze Star medal \nwinner, a very courageous soldier coming back from the war, that he was \nnot able to visit his sons. They restricted his right to travel.\n  Here is the point. The point is, the U.S. House of Representatives, \nthrough the Agriculture Committee, has now passed legislation that \neliminates the restrictions, eliminates the things done by the previous \nadministration to try to stop shipment of food to Cuba. I believe we \nhave the votes in the Senate to move that position as well.\n  I actually offered the amendment about 10 years ago in the Senate \nthat is now law that opened for the first time the ability to ship food \nand medicine for cash to Cuba. I just felt it was immoral. I think it \nis immoral to use food and medicine as a weapon, and that is what we \nare doing, including food and medicine as part of the embargo. I \noffered the amendment. It is now law. We shipped a couple billion \ndollars' worth of food to Cuba, all paid for in cash. But the previous \nadministration decided to change the rules and required payment before \nshipment as opposed to payment when the goods transferred. That was an \neffort to try to shut down agricultural sales to Cuba. The House has \nchanged that. We would do that as well. It is important to take this \naction. I was pleased last week when I read what the House of \nRepresentatives did. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  Here are pictures of who else believes we ought to lift the travel \nban. Marcelo Rodriquez does. He is a political prisoner in Cuba. Yoani \nSanchez does. She is one of the leading political bloggers in Cuba. \nGuillermo Farinas, who has staged several hunger strikes in Cuba, \nbelieves we should lift the travel ban. Oscar Chepe, a former political \nprisoner, and his wife Miriam Leiva, the founder of Ladies in White, \nbelieve we should lift the travel ban.\n  They are among 74 Cuban human rights activists who sent a letter to \nthe House of Representatives saying they believe we ought to lift the \ntravel ban.\n  I have visited with the folks in Cuba who are political dissents. \nThey do not like their government. They are doing everything they can \nto get a new government, a better government. But they also believe \nthis embargo and the travel ban does not serve their interest.\n  I believe that at some point, when it is appropriate, we will be able \nto do in the Senate what the House Agriculture Committee has done; that \nis, lift the travel ban and undo some of the detrimental things that \nwere done as well in the tightening in 2003.\n  I and Senator Enzi, along with 38 other cosponsors--that is 40 \nSenators--have cosponsored legislation that would lift the travel ban \nto Cuba. I believe when we have the opportunity, Senator Enzi and I \nwill offer that bill here on the floor, and I believe we will have the \nvotes to pass it in the Senate.\n  Once again, it is unthinkable to me that we have decided we are going \nto try to punish the Cuban Government by restricting the rights of the \nAmerican people. And we have done it for almost 50 years. By what \nauthority, by what justification do we believe the Federal Government \nought to tell the American people: You can travel wherever you want in \nthis world. Go to Iran, go to North Korea, China, Vietnam. But you \ncannot go to Cuba. By what justification does the government have the \nright to restrict that right of the American people? The answer is, \nnone, and it is long past the time we fix it. That is what I believe we \nwill do in the Senate in the weeks ahead.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in 2 minutes or so, let me talk briefly \nabout the FAA reauthorization bill, which we have passed out of the \nCommerce Committee and out of the full Senate--it passed 93 to 0 here \nin the Senate. Senator Rockefeller and I, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison \nand others, are working very hard to try to negotiate an opportunity to \nget a report that we can bring back to both the House and the Senate to \nget this done.\n  The reason this is urgent and so important is the modernization of \nour air traffic control system is long overdue and there is so much \nthat is needed in this FAA reauthorization bill. It deals with safety \nissues. As chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I held a number of \nhearings on the Colgan crash in New York--the tragic crash that took \nthe life of so many. So I wanted to make a point, because I know people \nare wondering what is happening on that legislation.\n  We had a meeting yesterday for over an hour. We are going to have \nanother meeting this week. We had a meeting the week prior to the break \nlast week. We are working very hard to try to find a way to bridge the \ngap. I think we are very close to being able to get something we can \nbring back to both the House and Senate. My hope is that early in this \nwork period we can get this done. I talked to Senator Rockefeller late \nlast night by phone after our meeting in the afternoon. So Senator Kyl \nand many others have been involved--Senator Warner.\n  This is a very big piece of legislation. Changing our air traffic \ncontrol system, modernizing our system from a ground-based radar system \nto a GPS system is a big, challenging project, but we have to get at \nit. This bill has languished way too long. We have reauthorized it \nmany, many, many times. Now it is time to get the legislation done and \nget it signed by the President.\n  We are working very hard, and I hope in the next week or two Senator \nRockefeller and I and Senator Hutchison and others can come to the \nfloor and report success and bring a bill to the Senate to vote on.\n\n\n                            Kagan Nomination\n\n  Madam President, let me also finally say--I didn't mention it \nearlier--that the Kagan nomination is going to come to the floor during \nthis work period, I am sure. I strongly support the Kagan nomination \nand intend to vote for her nomination. I think she is an awfully good \nnominee. I know many of my colleagues will be doing so as well. I fully \nexpect her to pass the Senate quite easily. I would expect the \nnomination to be approved quite easily.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, only this morning I was standing here and \nthe Senator from New Mexico was presiding over the Senate. I got \nthrough half of my remarks and had to yield to\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\nthe Senator from Maryland. Now that no one is on the floor, I wish to \ntake maybe 5 or 10 minutes and finish what I started this morning. I \nwas talking earlier today about how to reduce the amount of \noverpayments--we call them improper payments--the Federal Government \nmakes. Last year they added up to almost $100 billion, not counting the \nDepartment of Defense, not counting part of Medicare, not counting part \nof the Department of Homeland Security--a lot of money.\n  I also added that Federal agencies are doing, for the most part, a \nbetter job of estimating and identifying costly mistakes of improper \npayments. I think the White House deserves credit. Not only this \nPresident but his predecessor George W. Bush deserve credit for, not \nonly in the case of George W. Bush, saying: We ought to have improper \npayments in the law and we ought to make this a priority, but also for \nPresident Obama and his team who are beginning to scour Federal \nprograms for improper payments and also taking strong steps to try to \neliminate them in the future.\n  White House Budget Director Peter Orszag noted that agencies employed \nstricter standards for identifying improper payments, resulting in much \nof last fall's reported improper payments increase. I remember maybe 5 \nyears ago, when Senator Coburn and I were working on this issue, we \nfound there was maybe $40 billion worth of improper payments being \nreported by Federal agencies. Last year it was about almost $100 \nbillion. So it sounds as if we are going in the wrong direction.\n  As it turns out, what has actually happened is more agencies are \nreporting it. Initially, not very many agencies were reporting it, but \nas we have fuller reporting by all the agencies, we find we have a \nbetter idea of how big the problem is. It is not so much that it is \ngetting worse, it is just that we are having better reporting from the \nagencies.\n  Now that we are having that, the key is to make sure the agencies \nthat are making improper payments make fewer of them, and then that we \ngo out and recover the moneys that have been improperly paid.\n  The White House announced this winter--earlier this year--an \nexecutive order to not only improve the collection of improper payments \ndata, but to also improve our ability to avoid making improper \npayments, and to increase what I think is important, the use of \nrecovery auditing. I say the words ``recovery auditing''--postaudit \ncost recovery. I think for most people, their eyes kind of blur over \nand they tune out. We are talking about $100 billion here, money that \nis going out, most of it improperly, a lot of it overpayments. We are \ntalking about a country where our deficit is over $1 trillion. If we \nare going to have the ability to reduce our deficit, it is not going to \ncome from any one silver bullet or any one particular approach. But \nthis is an approach that can help.\n  I applaud the administration's concrete steps to improve transparency \nand make agencies and agency leadership more accountable.\n  Still, there is a lot more we can do, which is why our legislation \ncurrently on its way to the President's desk is so important in order \nto take the next steps, especially when it comes to actually going out \nand recovering the money we lose every year to avoidable errors and \npreventable fraud.\n  As I often say to my staff--they have heard me say this more times \nthan they care to remember--if it is not perfect, make it better. \nEverything that I do, I know I can do better. That includes making sure \nwe are making the appropriate payments to the right entity, for the \nright amount of money.\n  All of us in Congress share this responsibility to do that; that is, \nif it is not perfect, to make it better. We all share a responsibility \nto do that in curbing waste and fraud.\n  The legislation that I think the House is going to pass later today, \nand hopefully the President will sign later this month, is called the \nImproper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act. It is the result of a \n6-year journey. During the last Congress, I introduced an earlier \niteration of this bill with Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. Over \nthe last several years, I have chaired hearings on the issue of \nimproper payments, waste, and fraud. Since then, we have worked with \nthe Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, \nmany other inspectors general, and many other experts to refine and \nstrengthen our legislation.\n  The most recent version of that legislation was introduced last \nsummer--about a year ago--along with Senator Lieberman, who chairs our \nfull committee, Senator Collins, the ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator McCain, and \nSenator McCaskill. It was approved by the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs late last year and was approved by \nthe full Senate in June of this year. A companion bill was also \nintroduced in the House by Representative Patrick Murphy from \nPennsylvania, our neighbor to the north.\n  This legislation, I believe, is a perfect example of bipartisan \ncommon sense and bicameral common sense. And actually when you consider \nSenator Lieberman is an Independent, it is tripartisan--Democrat, \nRepublican, and Independent.\n  I think the bill makes a number of key reforms. First of all, it \nimproves transparency by lowering the threshold whereby agencies are \nsupposed to report improper payments. This will better inform the \npublic about where their taxpayer dollars are going, and it will help \nus in Congress find ways to fix the problems that lead to waste.\n  The second key reform in this legislation is it requires agencies to \nproduce audited corrective action plans with targets to reduce waste. \nIt is all well and good that we report improper payments or wasteful \npayments. The key is to stop doing it, to not just report it but to go \nafter it and stop repeating the same mistakes.\n  A third reform is that this legislation increases the recovery of \noverpayments by requiring all agencies that spend more than $1 million \na year to perform recovery audits on all their programs.\n  Finally, fourth and last, the legislation penalizes agencies that \nfail to comply with Federal financial management and accounting laws \nand would make sure that progress in eliminating improper payments is \npart of senior agency officials' performance evaluations. So you say to \nsomebody who is like a leader or supervisor in these Federal agencies: \nPart of your evaluation is going to be whether you are doing a good job \nof stopping overpayments, going out and making sure you do not make \nmore of them, and going out and collecting money that is being \n``mispaid'' or overpaid.\n  I am particularly pleased with the provision in the bill requiring \nmajor agencies to make greater use of tools that many private sector \nbusiness use to recover overpayments when they make them. When agencies \nhave used these tools, they have had some success, some real success.\n  About 7 years ago, 2003, Congress mandated what was at the time \ndescribed as a pilot Recovery Audit Contractor Program to examine \nMedicare fee-for-service payments. In other words, Congress said: OK, \nMedicare, when you are making these fee-for-service payments to \ndoctors, hospitals, and nurses, we want you to do, in three States--\nCalifornia, Florida, and New York--we want you to look at those three \nStates and see if we are overpaying money. If we are making mistakes in \nMedicare, go get it.\n  I think a year or so later, we added to the initial three States \nMassachusetts and South Carolina. During the first year of this \ndemonstration program, about $50 million was recovered and returned to \nthe Medicare trust fund. In the second year, about a quarter of a \nbillion dollars was recovered, returned to the Medicare trust fund. I \nthink if you add the total for the 3-year pilot program, which ended up \nin five States, they recovered about $1 billion. They recovered about \n$1 billion. It is real money.\n  One of the reasons why the Medicare trust fund is running out of \nmoney is because of fraud. Some people may have seen--I think it was on \n``60 Minutes'' a year or so ago. Mr. President, ``60 Minutes'' did a \nspecial where they focused on a bunch of doctors' offices in some town \nin south Florida. The doctors' offices had three things in common: One, \nthey had no patients; two, they had no doctors; three, they had no \nnurses. All they were were like a billing operation on Medicare, to \ndefraud money from Medicare and take it from the Medicare trust fund.\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\n  Last year, we were looking at the Medicare trust fund running out of \nmoney in about 8 years. That is untenable. With the changes we have \nmade in the health care reform legislation, I think we pretty much \ndoubled that life to maybe closer to 15 or 20 years, but we still have \na problem. With all the money that is defrauded from Medicare, we want \nto recover as much of it as we can and put it back into the program.\n  But in any event, the pilot program--which started in three States \nand expanded to five States--this year we are expanding it to all 50 \nStates.\n  There is also a provision in the recently enacted health care law--it \nis called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it is the \nhealth care reform legislation adopted earlier this year--but there is \na provision that says to the folks who run health care at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that they have to expand this \nprogram, this cost recovery program, to include Medicare Advantage, to \ninclude the Medicare prescription drug program, and also to include \nMedicaid. As money is recovered from fraud and overpayments and missed \npayments in Medicaid, that money will be split between the States and \nthe Federal Government.\n  The sooner the full program is up and operating, the sooner we can \nrecover even more money--I think probably billions of dollars--in \nadditional overpayments.\n  There is an added benefit to an expansion of recovery auditing. The \nRecovery Audit Contracting pilot program has identified dozens of \nvulnerabilities in the Medicare payment system that can lead to \nadditional waste and fraud.\n  According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--that is \nthe entity that oversees Medicare and Medicaid--the contractors hired \nto recoup overpayments identified ongoing vulnerabilities that could \nlead to future overpayments totaling about a third of a billion dollars \nmore. So not only did the contractors recover about $1 billion in \noverpayments in the 3-year pilot program, they also identified \nadditional problems in the systems they looked at, which, if we will \naddress them, will reduce and avoid errors in the future.\n  Tomorrow--what is today, Wednesday?--tomorrow, Thursday--I think \ntomorrow afternoon--the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, \nwhich I am privileged to chair, will hold a hearing, and that hearing \nwill examine the history and the opportunities for the Medicare \nRecovery Audit Contracting.\n  In conclusion, the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act, \nwhich again, hopefully, the House will pass today--the Senate has \nalready passed it; and hopefully the President will put his ``John \nHenry'' on it later this month--that legislation will allow us to make \neven greater strides in curbing waste and fraud in the work of Federal \nagencies during the years ahead. Given the size of the budget deficits \nwe face, we need to do that.\n  Enactment of this legislation is not the last step, but it is an \nimportant step. I look forward to seeing this important legislation \nsigned into law and to working with my colleagues and with the \nadministration on its successful implementation.\n  A lot of times people say to us: Why don't you do something about \nwaste, fraud, and abuse? They are convinced that a lot of their money \nends up being misspent, improperly spent, overpaid in some case. The \npeople, or entities, businesses, should not get any of this money. \nSomebody ought to do something about it. With the legislation that will \nbe on its way to the President, hopefully tomorrow, we are going to do \nsomething about it. We already are doing some pretty good things about \nit. We are going to do more, and we need to build on that record.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Wall \nStreet reform conference report. The Senate will make history when we \npass this legislation that finally holds Wall Street accountable and \nfinally cleans up the schemes and abuses that nearly brought our entire \neconomy to its knees. Most importantly, this bill ends once and for all \ntaxpayer-funded bailouts of Wall Street banks and investment firms. It \nfinally gets rid of any notion that any private company can somehow be \n``too big to fail.''\n  I never bought that argument. In fact, I was the only Democrat in the \nSenate to vote against both the bailout of Wall Street and the auto \nindustry. I do not believe in bailouts. But I do believe in making sure \nfolks are playing by the same rules.\n  Our economy went belly up a year and a half ago because there were no \nreferees on the field. With this bill, that is about to change. Big \nbanks will be required to pay for their own liquidation should they \nfail, and taxpayers will never again be a part of that equation.\n  The bill also streamlines the regulation of Wall Street, providing \nthe referees the tools they need to get the job done fairly and \neffectively.\n  It also ensures that everyone will now be playing by the same rules, \nand that unregulated entities offering financial products have to live \nup to the same standards as the community banks and credit unions that \nserve States such as Montana.\n  The bill has tough new rules to prevent the spread of risky and \ndangerous products such as subprime mortgages that torpedoed our \nNation's entire financial industry.\n  My focus over the last several months has been to make sure this bill \nis right for Montana and right for rural America. After some hard work, \nI think we did just that. This Wall Street reform bill is good for \nMontana's community banks, and it benefits small businesses.\n  Even in this era of bitter partisanship, the Senate unanimously \npassed an amendment I offered to make sure banks only pay their fair \nshare for Federal deposit insurance. Right now, smaller community banks \nare paying for 30 percent of this insurance, even though they account \nfor only 20 percent of all bank assets. That does not make sense, and \nthis bill fixes that problem.\n  This conference report also includes a provision I drafted requiring \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to consider the impact of all \nrules on community banks and credit unions and the rural customers they \nserve before any of those rules are made.\n  The legislation ensures that community banks will not be punished for \nthe bad behavior of the mortgage brokers who offer risky mortgages. \nThose banks will be able to maintain the community-based regulators \nthey currently have, and in the case of State chartered banks, the same \nlending limits they currently have.\n  Additionally, this bill ensures that community banks will be able to \ncontinue to provide the same mortgage products--including those \nspecific to farmers and rural Americans--to their customers.\n  For small businesses, this legislation makes it easier for investors \nto help get new small businesses up and running while protecting \ninvestors from schemers. It exempts small public companies from costly \nadditional compliance and regulation under Sarbanes-Oxley.\n  This bill is a win for Main Street. It holds Wall Street accountable \nand preserves the critical role community banks have in strengthening \ncommunities, creating jobs, and building small businesses. That is \nimportant because Montana families rely on their community banks to \nfinance and grow their businesses and farms, help pay their bills, and \nput their kids through school.\n  This is a strong bill. It ends taxpayer-funded bailouts. It begins a \nnew era of strong commonsense regulation to put the sideboards on our \nfast-moving financial industry, without taking away the fundamental \ntools it needs for healthy competition and growth, which strengthens \nthis economy.\n  Let me be clear. Our work on this legislation does not end today. I \nwill continue to remain vigilant to ensure this legislation is \nimplemented and enforced in the way it was intended. We simply cannot \nafford to do nothing and let our financial industry go by the wayside \never again.\n  With that, I thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the week before last, we had the hearing \non Elena Kagan for her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is a \ntremendously serious and important position. Five members of the \nSupreme Court--not just nine but only five--can redefine the meaning of \nwords in our Constitution and really alter, in many ways, the very \nstructure of our government. We have seen activist judges that I think \nhave tended in that direction, and it is dangerous and harmful because \njudges are given lifetime appointments. They are not accountable to the \npublic. They are protected. Even their salaries are not reducible while \nthey serve in office. So we have to know and believe they will be \nneutral, impartial, unbiased, and will render judgments based on the \nlaw and the facts and not on any preconceived commitments they may have \nhad.\n  Ms. Kagan is now the Solicitor General of the United States. She has \ntaken some sort of leave of absence in recent weeks since this \nnomination occurred, but she holds that title. The Department of \nJustice Solicitor General represents the U.S. Government in Federal \ncourt, usually before the Supreme Court, and in important cases before \nthe courts of appeals and often is involved in setting legal policy for \nthe United States and helping to advise on that. So it is important \nthat the American people know, before she is confirmed--if she is \nconfirmed--that she has not been involved in matters that would bias \nher and cause her not to be able to serve impartially under the law and \nunder the Constitution of the United States. That is an important \nquestion.\n  The day before yesterday, I believe, the Wall Street Journal had an \neditorial entitled ``Kagan and ObamaCare'' in which it raised questions \nabout the objectivity she might bring to the Court and whether she had \nbeen involved legally in the discussions or drafting the ideas \nconcerning the development and promotion of the health care reform bill \nso massively affecting health care in America. It raised the question: \nShould she recuse herself if that comes up, if she has been involved in \nthat? I think that is a very important question.\n  The seven Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote \nyesterday and asked Ms. Kagan to give detailed explanations as to what \nextent she may have been involved in any discussions regarding the \npromotion or legality of the health care reform bill. I think we are \nentitled to that. It is an important matter.\n  I see my friend Dr. Barrasso on the floor, who has been a great \nexpert in our debates on health care reform. He has repeatedly \nexplained how this legislation will impact health care throughout \nAmerica. As a physician, he understands that, and he has been able to \nexplain it to us in ways that any of us should be able to understand. \nIn fact, he gave us some very serious warnings about the fact that the \npromises made for this legislation were not legitimate, weren't real, \nweren't accurate, and in study after study and report after report that \nhas come out, Senator-Dr. Barrasso has been proven correct. The \nwarnings he gave us that it is not going to reduce costs and that other \ndifficulties will arise have been proven true--too much, in fact--and \nit is a matter of real seriousness.\n  So I guess I wish to say that a judge should recuse himself or \nherself if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned on any \nmatter that came before them.\n  I believe Dr. Barrasso has raised previously his concern about what \nit really means if the U.S. Government tells an individual American \ncitizen who is minding his own business that he has to have an \ninsurance policy. I will recognize him at this point and ask him to at \nleast share his thoughts on that important issue and why he believes \nhaving a fair judge on the Supreme Court is important.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I come to the floor today with my friend and colleague because I have \njust gotten back from a week of traveling all across the State of \nWyoming, a beautiful State this time of year. People are out and at \nparades. I had a chance to visit at several senior centers. The \nquestion that continued to come up was, Can the government force me to \nbuy health insurance?\n  A lot of people in Wyoming carry their copy of the Constitution with \nthem. They carry it in their breast pocket. They carry it with them. It \nis in the pickup truck. It is with them all the time. They continue to \nlook to the 10th amendment, which says:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  The people quote that. It just makes sense to the people of Wyoming \nthat Washington should not be able to come into their communities, into \nour State, into their homes, and say: You must buy this product.\n  So when I see the number of States--20 now--that have filed suit \nagainst the Federal Government because of a new health care law, a law \nthat I think is going to end up, if it is not repealed and replaced, \nbeing bad for patients, bad for payers, the taxpayers in the country \nand the people who pay their own health care bills as well, and bad for \nproviders--it is a bill that I think is bad medicine, to the point that \nSenator Tom Coburn and I, the other physician--there are only two \nphysicians who practice medicine in the U.S. Senate, and I have been \ntaking care of people and their families in the State of Wyoming since \n1983--we have come up with a report called ``Bad Medicine: A Checkup on \nthe New Federal Health Care Law.''\n  There are people who say: I don't like this. Now we have a nominee to \nthe Supreme Court who is very likely, if this works its way to the \nSupreme Court, to have an opportunity to make a ruling, a ruling for \nthe people of the United States, on whether this body--this Senate, \nthis House--has a right to tell the American people what product they \nmust buy, whether it is health insurance, whether it is cars, whether \nit is the kind of cereal they eat for breakfast in the morning. The \nAmerican people are very concerned.\n  So I come to the floor also with this editorial from Tuesday, July \n13, this editorial entitled ``Kagan and ObamaCare,'' because the \nfundamental question is, Should this nominee recuse herself if she is, \nin fact, confirmed by this body? One might say: Well, when would \nsomeone recuse themselves from making a decision? Because, after all, \nshe has been serving in this administration, serving this President, \nserving the President who has promoted such a piece of legislation that \nforces American citizens, forces the citizens of this country to buy a \nproduct.\n  The editorial says:\n\n       Recusal arises as a matter of judicial ethics if as a \n     government official she expressed an opinion on the merits of \n     the health-care litigation. This is what she would have to \n     render a judgment on were she to be confirmed for the High \n     Court.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       It is also the question on which she is likely to have \n     participated given her role at the Justice Department.\n\n  I would have to turn to my colleague who is the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  It says as well that:\n\n       The Solicitor General is the third ranking official at \n     Justice, its senior expert on Constitutional issues, so it's \n     hard to believe she wouldn't have been asked at least in \n     passing about a Constitutional challenge brought by so many \n     states. The debate about the suit was well underway in the \n     papers and on TV. The matter surely must have come up at \n     Attorney General Eric Holder's senior staff meetings, which \n     the Solicitor General typically attends.\n\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       We doubt Ms. Kagan would have stayed mum about the cases in \n     internal Justice councils on grounds that Mr. Obama might \n     later nominate her to the Court. At the time the Florida suit \n     was filed on March 23, she was only one of several potential \n     nominees whose names were being floated by the White House.\n\n  So here we have this, and that is when you get back to that opening\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\nparagraph I read: ``Recusal arises as a matter of judicial ethics.''\n  So I say to my friend and colleague from Alabama, is this not a \nlegitimate area of concern, especially in light of the fact that across \nthis great country people are offended by this law? I just saw a poll \nthat came out today. The popularity of this new law, which has never \nbeen very popular and which was forced down the throats of the American \npeople, is now 7 percentage points less popular now than it was even 2 \nmonths ago. So something exceptionally unpopular is getting even more \nunpopular. By a ratio of 2 to 1, people think it is going to raise \ntheir costs and lessen their quality of care.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator, on that \nquestion, are the American people right or are the people who promoted \nthis bill right? Are costs going up and is the quality of health care \ngoing down? What is the Senator's opinion?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I spent Friday visiting with colleagues, \nfriends, patients at the Wyoming Medical Center. Across the board, \nafter talking to physicians, talking to patients, talking to others in \nthe hospital as well as around the State of Wyoming, people believe it \nis going to be bad for patients, those waiting to get their care; bad \nfor payers, the taxpayers of this country, the individuals who are \npaying for their insurance as well; and bad for providers, the nurses \nand the doctors whom I talked to. They have incredible concerns about \nwhat the impact is going to be on nurses and doctors when taking care \nof patients. The patients' concerns are, are they going to get the kind \nof care they want, the kind they are accustomed to, because no matter \nwhere I go in Wyoming, I hear people saying: This is a bill that wasn't \npassed to help me; it was passed and forced down our throats to help \nsomeone else, and they are going to make me buy a product that I might \nnot want to buy, according to a number of criteria the government puts \nforward.\n  They may not want what the government says they have to buy, and then \nyou get back to the Constitution. Does this government and does \nCongress have a right to tell the American people what they must \npurchase?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a fundamental question. The Constitution gives \nthe U.S. Government the right to regulate interstate commerce, that is \ntrue. The Supreme Court, at times, has taken a most minimal effect on \ninterstate commerce and says the Federal Government can regulate it. \nBut I am not aware of a circumstance in which an individual in Wyoming, \nor Alabama, minding their own business and not participating in an \ninterstate commerce health insurance policy in any way, and the Federal \nGovernment waltzes in and says you must participate in this in \ninterstate commerce--you are not participating in it and they require \nthat you do participate in it.\n  If you believe--and there is only one view--that the Constitution is \na government of limited power, it has only powers that are delegated to \nit--and they are enumerated powers--then have we crossed a divide here \nthat we have not crossed before. That is why these lawsuits are being \nfiled. They are very real. The one in Florida may be farther along than \nmost of them; it is already out there. Ms. Kagan, at this very moment, \nsits as a Solicitor General of the United States--in title, if not \nfully acting--and was, I think, before this lawsuit was filed fully \nacting, and it impacts the Federal Government. The question we have \nasked that I think must be answered by her is exactly what kind of \nrelationship and discussion she may have had concerning this \nlegislation.\n  First, I ask Senator Barrasso--and not being a lawyer can be a \nbenefit in this body, but I assume from the tone of his comments that \nhe is a little uneasy that this high official in the Obama \nadministration--an administration that has committed the whole of its \nresources to the passing of this legislation--is now about to rise to \nthe Court and would be asked to decide what could be a deciding issue \nof whether this health care bill stays law or is struck down. So \nwithout the niceties at this moment on recusal issues, does that make \nthe Senator nervous?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The whole health care law makes me nervous. I look at \nthis and say that the underpinning of this law--the thing that holds it \ntogether--is the mandate on the American people that everyone buy \ninsurance, that everyone has to have insurance at work or through \nMedicare or Medicaid, but if none of those work, you have to buy \ninsurance. It is the government telling someone they have to buy it.\n  So I have great concerns when a government thinks it is so powerful, \nand this body thinks it is so powerful--more powerful than the American \npeople. I reject that, and I want to make sure that, as it gets to the \nSupreme Court, there are people on the Court who side with the American \npeople and, most importantly, with the Constitution--what to me the \ntenth amendment means--and the people of Wyoming, which is that the \ngovernment cannot come into our homes and say you must do this--you \nmust buy this product.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I think that is exactly correct. I will say that \nwhether or not being a high official in this administration, which is \nso committed to passing this legislation, whether that in itself \nlegally requires a person to recuse themselves on the Supreme Court \nfrom hearing such a case, I am not prepared to say at this moment, but \nit makes me uneasy.\n  I believe a judge who decides that question must be impartial and \ncannot be corrupted by friendship or empathy or bias in favor of the \nperson who appointed them. That is important.\n  Secondly, I ask Senator Barrasso, our question goes to a more \nspecific situation that could mandate recusal, and that is whether the \nnominee has participated in any discussions, strategies, or making \nlegal advice designed to promote this legislation. I think that would \nbe a clear situation that would require recusal.\n  Also, specific questions could come up regarding to what extent have \nthese lawsuits that have been filed affected her and has she expressed \nany opinions concerning the lawsuits.\n  Finally, I do not believe the President is entitled to launch onto \nthe Supreme Court a political loyalist who will be a legal rubberstamp \nfor anything that gets proposed, whether it is the takeover of AIG or \nof automobile companies or other things that may be decided. I think we \nneed to be careful about this.\n  This nominee needs to answer those questions because what the Senator \nis hearing is what I hear.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask my colleague this, as he participated in the \nhearings and the questioning. Apparently, Ms. Kagan says she will \nrecuse herself from participating in a number of cases--I think 11--on \nwhich she represented the government in her current job as Solicitor \nGeneral.\n  It seems that in a case such as this--the area that the President of \nthe United States put all of his credibility and effort into forcing \nthrough this body and through the House and, in my opinion, jamming \ndown the throats of the American people--if she is already going to \nrecuse herself on 11 other issues, it seems to me that we should also \nget that sort of a commitment on this issue.\n  As the Senator has said--and he has practiced law--recusal arises as \na matter of judicial ethics. Now we are talking about the ethics of the \nindividual involved, and the decisions that person would then make \nbased on the position to which they are nominated.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe that is correct. The standard is, among other \nthings, if your impartiality might reasonably be questioned--and many \njudges are very sensitive about this--if you own a bunch of stock and \nyou have one share in a big company like GE, and a case involving GE \ncomes before you, you are expected to recuse yourself, even though it \nis unlikely to have an impact on your finances. But it doesn't look \ngood.\n  I think we are entitled to know how sensitive this nominee is going \nto be to the dangers of her impartiality being questioned, even if her \nactions are not such that clearly, as a matter of judicial ethics, \nmandates her recusal. I think we need to talk about that, and I feel \nlike the American people that we meet with, who are concerned about \ngovernmental overreach, who wonder if we have lost all sense of the \nlimited power of this government in Washington, I believe those people \nare entitled to have absolute confidence that\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\nanybody confirmed to the Supreme Court will not sit on a case if they \ncan't be impartial, or if their impartiality could even reasonably be \nquestioned.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership on the issue, and I am glad we \nhad this colloquy. I hope we are going to get a complete answer from \nthe nominee soon about any involvement she may have had explicitly, and \nthen to perhaps also inquire further about to what extent she will be \nprepared to not participate if her impartiality can be questioned.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. If I can ask a final question. The final paragraph of \nthis editorial that the Senator will introduce into the Record says:\n\n       As someone who hopes to influence the Court and the law for \n     decades--\n\n  We are talking about an appointment that could last a lifetime, 30 or \n40 years.\n\n     Ms. Kagan should not undermine public confidence in her fair-\n     mindedness by sitting in judgment on such a controversial \n     case that began when she was a senior government legal \n     official.\n\n  It seems to me--and I ask the Senator at this time--where someone may \nbe embarking on a long career on the Court, wanting to do the right \nthing and head in the right direction, that the best decision would be \nto recuse herself from this case as well, if she is confirmed, rather \nthan get involved in it and potentially have an impact on her \nreputation for decades to come.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is correct. I appreciate the way the Wall \nStreet Journal expressed that. I think that is a legitimate position. I \nhope the nominee will take very seriously those concerns and will \nrespond promptly to the questions we have asked of her.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 13, 2010]\n\n                          Kagan and ObamaCare\n\n       Elena Kagan breezed through her recent confirmation \n     hearings, but there's some crucial unfinished business the \n     Senate should insist on before voting on her nomination to \n     the Supreme Court. To wit, she ought to recuse herself from \n     participating as a Justice in the looming legal challenges to \n     ObamaCare.\n       In response to Senate queries, Ms. Kagan has said she'll \n     recuse herself from participating in 11 cases on which she \n     represented the government in her current job as Solicitor \n     General. The challenge to ObamaCare isn't one of them, though \n     the cases brought by Florida and 20 other states were filed \n     in March, well before President Obama announced her \n     nomination on May 10.\n       Ms. Kagan was never asked directly at her hearings about \n     her role as SG regarding the healthcare lawsuits. The closest \n     anyone came was this question from Oklahoma Republican Tom \n     Coburn: ``Was there at any time--and I'm not asking what you \n     expressed or anything else--was there at any time you were \n     asked in your present position to express an opinion on the \n     merits of the health-care bill?''\n       Ms. Kagan: ``There was not.''\n       Regarding a potential recusal, that's not the right \n     question. Ms. Kagan was unlikely to have been consulted on \n     the merits of health-care policy, and even if she did express \n     an opinion on policy this would not be grounds for recusal. \n     The legal precedents on that are clear.\n       Recusal arises as a matter of judicial ethics if as a \n     government official she expressed an opinion on the merits of \n     the health-care litigation. This is what she would have to \n     render a judgment on were she to be confirmed for the High \n     Court. It is also the question on which she is likely to have \n     participated given her role at the Justice Department.\n       The SG is the third ranking official at Justice, and its \n     senior expert on Constitutional issues, so it's hard to \n     believe she wouldn't have been asked at least in passing \n     about a Constitutional challenge brought by so many states. \n     The debate about the suit was well underway in the papers and \n     on TV. The matter surely must have come up at Attorney \n     General Eric Holder's senior staff meetings, which the SG \n     typically attends.\n       We doubt Ms. Kagan would have stayed mum about the cases in \n     internal Justice councils on grounds that Mr. Obama might \n     later nominate her to the Court. At the time the Florida suit \n     was filed on March 23, she was only one of several potential \n     nominees whose names were being floated by the White House.\n       Under federal law (28 U.S.C., 455(b)(3)), judges who have \n     served in government must recuse themselves when they have \n     ``participated as counsel, adviser or material witness \n     concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning \n     the merits of the particular case in controversy.''\n       Though their public chance has passed, Senators can still \n     submit written questions to Ms. Kagan for the record. We hope \n     someone asks her directly whether the legal challenges to \n     ObamaCare ever arose in her presence at Justice, whether she \n     was ever asked her views, and what she said or wrote about \n     the cases.\n       We also think there are grounds for recusal based on her \n     response during her Senate hearings on the substance of the \n     state legal challenge. The Florida case boils down to whether \n     Congress can compel individuals to buy health insurance under \n     the Commerce Clause. Ms. Kagan danced around the history of \n     Commerce Clause jurisprudence, but in one response to Senator \n     Coburn she did betray a bias for a very expansive reading of \n     Congress's power.\n       The Commerce Clause has ``been interpreted to apply to \n     regulation of any instruments or instrumentalities or \n     channels of commerce,'' she said, ``but it's also been \n     applied to anything that would substantially affect \n     interstate commerce.'' Anything? This is the core question in \n     the Florida case. If she already believes that the Commerce \n     Clause justifies anything that substantially affects \n     interstate commerce, then she has all but prejudged the \n     individual mandate question.\n       A federal judge is required by law to recuse himself ``in \n     any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be \n     questioned.'' This has been interpreted to mean that the mere \n     public expression of a legal opinion isn't disqualifying. But \n     this is no routine case.\n       Ms. Kagan would sit as Mr. Obama's nominee on the nation's \n     highest Court on a case of momentous Constitutional \n     importance. If there is any chance that the public will \n     perceive her to have prejudged the case, or rubber-stamped \n     the views of the President who appointed her, she will damage \n     her own credibility as a Justice and that of the entire \n     Court.\n       As someone who hopes to influence the Court and the law for \n     decades, Ms. Kagan should not undermine public confidence in \n     her fair-mindedness by sitting in judgment on such a \n     controversial case that began when she was a senior \n     government legal official.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5814-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5814-S5822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have been fighting hard for a Wall \nStreet reform bill that protects my State's families, holds Wall Street \naccountable, and includes a guarantee that American taxpayers will \nnever again have to pay to bail out Wall Street or to clean up after \nbig banks' messes. I am proud to say that, finally, after months of \nhard work, we are so close now to passing legislation that does exactly \nthat.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. It should not be about right \nversus left or Republican versus Democrat. It should be about doing \nwhat is right for our families and small business owners in my State of \nWashington and across the country. It should be about who it is we \nchoose to stand up for and who we think needs our support right now.\n  Some people have spent the last few months standing up for Wall \nStreet and big banks, trying to water down this reform, and fighting \nagainst any changes that would prevent the big banks from going back to \ntheir ``bonus as usual'' mentality.\n  I have been proud to stand with so many others to fight against the \nWall Street lobbyists and special interest groups and stand up for the \nfamilies I represent in Washington--families who want us to pass strong \nreform that cannot be ignored or sidestepped in the future, who want us \nto end bailouts and make sure Wall Street is held accountable for \ncleaning up their own messes, and who want us to put into place strong \nconsumer protections to make sure big banks can never again take \nadvantage of our families, our students, or our seniors.\n  For most Americans, this debate is not complex; it is pretty simple. \nIt is not about derivatives or credit default swaps; it is about \nfundamental fairness. It is about making sure that we have good \ncommonsense rules that work for our families and our small business \nowners. It is about the person\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\nwho walks into a bank to sign up for a mortgage, or applies for a \ncredit card, or starts planning their retirement. We want to make sure \nthe rules are now on their side and not with the big banks on Wall \nStreet.\n  For far too long the financial rules of the road have not favored the \nAmerican people. Instead, they have favored big banks, credit card \ncompanies, and Wall Street. For too long, those people have abused the \nrules.\n  As we now approach this vote, I think it is important for all of us \nto be clear about who it is we are fighting for. I am fighting for \npeople such as Devin Glaser, a school aide in Seattle, who told me that \nhe had worked and saved his money and bought a condo before the \nrecession began. He told me he put 20 percent down on a traditional \nmortgage and was making his payments. However, like a lot of people who \nfound themselves underemployed as a result of this recession, Devin has \nbeen unable to find work for more than 25 hours a week. He told me he \nis now unable to pay his mortgage. He will be foreclosed on any day \nnow.\n  I am also fighting for people such as Rob Hays, a Washington State \nstudent whose parents have put their retirement on hold and gone back \nto work in order to send him to school. A few short years ago, Rob's \nparents were in the process of selling their home and preparing to \nretire. But then the foreclosure crisis took hold and they could no \nlonger find a buyer. As a result, they were forced to pay two mortgages \nwith the money they had saved for Rob's school, and retirement was put \non hold.\n  I am fighting for people such as Jude LaRene, a small business owner \nin Washington State, who told me that when the financial crisis hit, \nhis line of credit was pulled. That forced him to lay off employees, go \ndeep into debt on his personal credit card, and cut back on inventory--\ndespite the fact that his toy stores were more popular than ever.\n  I am fighting for people such as Devon and Rob and Jude because they \nare the ones being forced to pay the price now for Wall Street's greed \nand irresponsibility.\n  Whether it was gambling with borrowed money from our pension funds, \nmaking bets they could not cover, or peddling mortgages to people they \nknew could never pay, Wall Street made reckless choices that have \ndevastated a lot of working families.\n  In my home State of Washington, Wall Street's mistakes cost us over \n150,000 jobs. They cost average families thousands of dollars in lost \nincome.\n  They cost small businesses the access to credit they need to expand \nand hire and, in many cases, caused them to close.\n  They cost workers their retirement accounts they were counting on to \ncarry them through their golden years and students the college savings \nthat would help launch their college careers.\n  They cost homeowners the value of their most important financial \nasset as neighborhoods have been decimated by foreclosures.\n  They cost our schoolteachers and our police officers and all of our \ncommunities. And they cost our workers, such as Devon, our students, \nsuch as Rob, and our small business owners, such as Jude.\n  We owe it to people like them all across the country to reform this \nsystem that puts Wall Street before Main Street. We owe it to them to \nput their families back in control of their own finances. We owe it to \nthem to make sure the rules that protect families sitting around the \ndinner table at night, balancing their checkbooks and finding ways to \nsave for the future, not those sitting around the board room table \nfinding ways to increase profits at the expense of hard-working \nAmericans. To do that, we have to pass this strong Wall Street reform \nlegislation.\n  It is important for families to understand what this bill does and \nwhat exactly opponents of this legislation are fighting against.\n  This bill contains explicit language guaranteeing that taxpayers will \nnever again be responsible for bailing out Wall Street. It creates a \nbrandnew Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that will protect our \nconsumers from big bank ripoffs, end unfair fees, curb out-of-control \ncredit card and mortgage rates, and be a new cop on the beat to \nsafeguard consumers and protect their families.\n  It puts in place new restrictions for small businesses from unfair \ntransaction fees that are imposed by credit card companies. It enforces \nlimitations on excessive compensation for Wall Street executives. And \nit offers new tools to promote financial literacy and make sure our \nfamilies have the knowledge to protect themselves and take personal \nresponsibility for their finances.\n  I have heard so many stories from people across Washington State who \nhave scrimped and saved and made the best with what they had but were \ndevastated, through no fault of their own--people who played by the \nrules but who are now paying the price for those on Wall Street who did \nnot. These are the people for whom we have to stand up, the people \nwhose Main Street values I and so many others fight for every day.\n  With all of the new protections and reforms this bill contains for \nfamilies and small businesses, one has to ask: Who are the opponents \nfighting for and who are they standing up to protect?\n  I grew up working at my dad's five-and-dime store on Main Street in \nBothell, WA--actually on Main Street. Like a lot of people in the \ncountry, Main Street is where I got my values. I was taught by my dad \nthat the product of your work was not just about the dollars in the \ntill at the end of the day. I learned that a good transaction was one \nthat was good for your business and good for your customer. I learned \nthat strong customer service and lasting relationships often made your \nbusiness much stronger; that personal responsibility meant owning up to \nyour mistakes and making them right. I learned that one business relied \non all the others on the same street.\n  I was taught that customers were not prey and businesses were not \npredators, and that an honest business was a successful one.\n  It is time for us to bring those Main Street values back to our \nfinancial system, to bring back an approach that puts Main Street and \nfamilies over Wall Street and profits; that protects consumers, holds \nbig banks accountable for their actions, and makes sure people such as \nDevon and Rob and Jude are never again forced to bear the burden for \nbig banks' mistakes.\n  I urge my colleagues today to stand with us against the status quo \nand for this strong Wall Street reform bill that families and small \nbusinesses in Washington State and across the country desperately need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the financial \noverregulation bill. The so-called financial reform bill before us is \nbeing sold to the American people as holding Wall Street accountable \nfor the economic crisis that hurt every American family and business in \nevery community across the Nation. We are told this bill will end ``too \nbig to fail'' and prevent future bailouts.\n  Unfortunately, just as the stimulus bill was supposed to reduce \nunemployment and the health care bill was supposed to lower health \ncosts and reduce the deficit, this bill, too, will do the opposite of \nwhat is advertised. It will not prevent future bailouts. It will create \nanother huge Federal bureaucracy; and instead of punishing Wall Street, \nit will punish Main Street and the families who suffered--not caused--\nthe financial meltdown.\n  This bill was meant to rein in Wall Street. Yet the biggest \nsupporters are Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, and the biggest opponents \nare community banks and small businesses in every city and town and \ncommunity in the Nation. I think that tells us all we need to know \nabout this bill. I urge my colleagues to listen to the folks at home, \nthe people who have to make a living who are going to be burdened by \nit.\n  I strongly oppose cloture on this bill. Yes, there have been \nimprovements made, and I worked with my colleague, Senator Dodd, to \nmake sure we did not devastate the venture capital area. Unfortunately, \nthat is coming in another bill. But despite some of the progress we \nhave made, the provisions most harmful to taxpayers, families, and \nsmall businesses still remain.\n  As a matter of fact, new provisions have been airdropped into the \nconference report that are so problematic\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\nthat neither Chamber could agree to include them in either version. If \nwe are truly committed to enacting real bipartisan reform, then the \nmajority would never allow items that were never debated and voted on \nto be included in the bill.\n  I hope my Democratic colleagues will stand up for these principles \nabout which they have talked so loudly and say no to this backroom \npractice of airdropping totally new concepts into the bill.\n  I wish to talk now about some of the most egregious provisions in the \nbill.\n  First, it is unbelievable and unacceptable that so many of my \ncolleagues want to turn a blind eye to the government-sponsored \nenterprises, GSEs, that contributed to the financial meltdown by buying \nhigh-risk loans that banks made to people who could not afford them.\n  Everyone here knows what I am talking about. Despite this bill's \n2,300 pages, it completely ignores the 900-pound gorilla in the room: \nthe need to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or the toxic twins as I \nnot so fondly have to refer to them now.\n  The irresponsible actions by Fannie and Freddie turned the American \ndream into the American nightmare for too many families who have either \nhad their homes foreclosed or who are hanging on by a thread.\n  The irresponsible actions, pushed by previous administrations on \nFannie and Freddie, devastated neighborhoods and communities as \nproperty values diminished.\n  To add insult to injury, after Freddie and Fannie went belly up, it \nwas the very Americans who suffered from their irresponsible actions \nwho were left footing the bill.\n  As if that were not bad enough, unless we act now to reform the toxic \ntwins, over the next 10 years Fannie and Freddie will cost the American \ntaxpayers at least an additional $389 billion.\n  In the joy of the Christmas holiday last December, the administration \ntook off the $400 billion limit on them. I have to ask: How much money \ndo they think they can lose if $400 billion is not enough for them to \nlose?\n  What is in this bill to address this problem? Absolutely nothing. \nZip. Zero.\n  Next, this bill lumps in the good guys with the bad guys and treats \nthem all the same, particularly when it comes to derivatives.\n  Folks who are trying to manage and control costs are treated the same \nas folks who are spending and speculating in the market, making shady \nbets with money they did not have, making insurance bets on property \nthey did not own.\n  This was described in the book, ``The Big Short,'' by Michael Lewis. \nThese computer game derivatives, or insurance policies, were dreamed up \nby Wall Street geniuses, some who made billions, others who lost \nbillions. The billions in losses almost destroyed our financial system \nand poisoned the world's financial system.\n  I have heard some folks say: Why do these bad practices mean \nsomething is going to happen to me? The way this bill is drafted, \nutility companies may not be able to lock in steady rates for their \ncustomers, leaving them instead at the whim of a volatile market. The \nutility companies will have to pay billions to Wall Street or Chicago \nto clear their normal long-term contracts and postcollateral with \nenergy suppliers through clearinghouses run by big financial firms. \nThat money will be immediately passed along to every consumer of power \nfrom that utility company. That is what utilities do--they pass it on \nto you and me as electricity or gas or other customers of theirs.\n  Mr. President, you and I and folks in every community across the \ncountry could pay higher costs every time we flip on the light switch \nor turn on the air conditioner or heat.\n  That means family farms may not be able to get long-term financing, \nforcing many to quit farming and prevent many from beginning to farm.\n  The Wall Street Journal today, in a front-page article headed \n``Finance Overhaul Casts Long Shadow on the Plains'' tells how this \nbill will clobber folks in agricultural communities who have to have \nforward contracts. They never caused the problem, but it will tie up \ncapital and make them pay tribute to big firms on Wall Street or \nChicago. No wonder those big firms are for them. There is a lot of \nbusiness for them, a lot of expense for the farmer, the commodity \nhauler trying to make a living.\n  I am stunned that any Senator in good conscience would vote for a \nbill that would increase costs for every American, especially at a time \nwhen working families are struggling to make ends meet. One thing is \ncertain: This bill will enlarge government.\n  Today's Wall Street editorial opines that:\n\n       Dodd-Frank, with its 2,300 pages, will unleash the biggest \n     wave of new federal financial rulemaking in three \n     generations. Whatever else this will do, it will not make \n     lending cheaper or credit more readily available.\n\n  They go on to state that one law firm has estimated that the new law \n``will require no fewer than 243 new formal rule-makings by 11 \ndifferent agencies.''\n  What will be the effect? More lawyers, more bureaucracy, more \ntaxpayer money, and more lawsuits.\n  Certainly, I cannot vote in good conscience for a bill that creates a \nmassive new superbureaucracy with unprecedented authority to impose \ngovernment mandates and micromanage any entity that extends credit.\n  We are not talking about the big guys--the Goldman Sachs and the \nAIGs. In the real world, we are talking about the community banks, \nsmall retailers, and even your dentist.\n  I talked with a lot of small businesses and listened to them. A lot \nof people were concerned this past week when I was home about what is \ngoing on in Washington. I was talking with a group in Maryville in \nnorthwest Missouri.\n  I said: The uncertainty is really a problem for small businesses.\n  One small businessman corrected me. He said: No, it's the certainty. \nWe know what Washington has already done to the deficit, to the debt, \nto health care, what it is going to do to financial regulation, and \nwhat it is threatening to do to energy costs.\n  I asked everybody around the table: Should I have said ``certainty'' \nrather than ``uncertainty''?\n  They said: You certainly should.\n  Small businesses are not willing or able or even inclined to create \njobs when this massive government rollout of spending, taxation, and \nregulation is coming down on them.\n  Let's not be naive. Any of the new costs as a result of new mandates \nand regulations, regardless of the entity on which they are imposed, \nwill be passed down to the very people this bill claims to \nprotect. Under the new, misnamed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nor CFPB, the decisions on allocating credit will no longer be based on \nthe safety and soundness requirement for healthy banks. Instead, by \nempowering this new superbureaucracy with unprecedented power, \ndecisions on credit will be driven by the administration's political \nwill and agenda. Politics will then decide how to allocate credit while \noperating outside the framework of safety and soundness, thus putting \nmore risk back into the system when we were supposed to be taking risk \nout of the system.\n\n  This giant bill also contains a provision creating a new Office of \nFinancial Research. You will get to know this one. It is given the \nauthority to access personal financial information of any citizen in \nthe United States. Well, I don't know about you, but I would prefer not \nto have a new bureaucracy rifling through my personal account \ninformation in an era of economic and electronic communications where \nfraud and identity theft run rampant. Ordinary Americans who did not \ncause the financial meltdown should not be punished and placed at risk \nbecause the government wishes to create this new, unnecessary office.\n  I could continue to list provision after provision, pointing out \nexpansions of government and ill-intended policies that will create \nmore uncertainty while failing to hit the objective of regulatory \nreform. However, this Chamber doesn't have the hours for my speech \nalone. I could say: Harsh letter to follow. If anybody wants to know, \nwe will be happy to send them lots of chapters and lots of verses. But, \nmuch like the health care bill recently signed into law, I fear small \nbusinesses will soon learn of many more unintended consequences which \nhave yet to be seen. Even the bill's sponsors admit that the bill's \nlong reach will not be\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\nfully known until it is in place. Remember when the leader on the other \nside of this building said: If you want to find out what is in the \nbill, you will have to pass it. Well, in this bill, if you want to find \nout what it is going to do, unfortunately, you are going to find out if \nyou pass it. I don't want to have my fingerprints on what is going to \nhappen to businesses, to communities, and to jobs in the United States \nif it passes.\n  To sum it up, if the goal is to enact real reform that ensures we \nnever, ever have another financial crisis like the one we had 18 months \nago, the bill falls woefully short of that goal. It is light on reform, \nheavy on overreach and unintended consequences. Overall, this bill is \ntoo large, too costly for consumers, and would kill job creation at a \ntime when working Americans need to be left to do what they do best, \nand that is succeed.\n  There is no doubt we need to protect every American from ever again \nfalling victim to Wall Street gone wild. But what we do not want--and \nwhy this debate is so important--is to punish Americans for a crisis \nthey didn't cause. Unless we scrap this failed version and start over, \nthe Democrats' bill will do just that, and the costs will be paid by \nMain Street.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial from today's Wall Street Journal to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                       The Uncertainty Principle\n\n       So Republicans Scott Brown, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins \n     now say they'll provide the last crucial votes to get the \n     Dodd-Frank financial reform through the Senate. Hmmm. Could \n     this be Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's secret plan to take \n     back the Senate, guaranteeing another year or two of \n     regulatory and lending uncertainty and thus slower economic \n     growth?\n       Probably not, but that still may be the practical effect. \n     This week White House aides leaked to the press that \n     President Obama may seek a review of regulations that are \n     restraining business confidence and bank lending. Yet Dodd-\n     Frank, with its 2,300 pages, will unleash the biggest wave of \n     new federal financial rule-making in three generations. \n     Whatever else this will do, it will not make lending cheaper \n     or credit more readily available.\n       In a recent note to clients, the law firm of Davis Polk & \n     Wardwell needed more than 150 pages merely to summarize the \n     bureaucratic ecosystem created by Dodd-Frank. As the nearby \n     table shows, the lawyers estimate that the law will require \n     no fewer than 243 new formal rule-makings by 11 different \n     federal agencies.\n       The SEC alone, whose regulatory failures did so much to \n     contribute to the panic, will write 95 new rules. The new \n     Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection will write 24, and \n     the new Financial Stability Oversight Council will issue 56. \n     These won't be one-page orders. The new rules will run into \n     the hundreds if not thousands of pages in the Federal \n     Register, laying out in detail what your neighborhood banker, \n     hedge fund manager or derivatives trader can and cannot do.\n       As the Davis Polk wonks put it, ``U.S. financial regulators \n     will enter an intense period of rule-making over the next 6 \n     to 18 months, and market participants will need to make \n     strategic decisions in an environment of regulatory \n     uncertainty.'' The lawyers needed 26 pages of flow charts \n     merely to illustrate the timeline for implementing the new \n     rules, the last of which will be phased in after a mere 12 \n     years.\n       Because Congress abdicated its responsibility to set clear \n     rules of the road, the lobbying will only grow more intense \n     after the President signs Dodd-Frank. According to the \n     attorneys, ``The legislation is complicated and contains \n     substantial ambiguities, many of which will not be resolved \n     until regulations are adopted, and even then, many questions \n     are likely to persist that will require consultation with the \n     staffs of the various agencies involved.''\n       In other words, the biggest financial players aren't being \n     punished or reined in. The only certain result is that they \n     are being summoned to a closer relationship with Washington \n     in which the best lobbyists win, and smaller, younger firms \n     almost always lose. New layers of regulation will deter \n     lending at least in the near term, and they are sure to raise \n     the cost of credit. Non-blue chip businesses will suffer the \n     most as the financial industry tries to influence the writing \n     of the rules while also figuring out how to make a buck in \n     the new system.\n       The timing of Dodd-Frank could hardly be worse for the \n     fragile recovery. A new survey by the Vistage consulting \n     group of small and midsize company CEOs finds that \n     ``uncertainty'' about the economy is by far the most \n     significant business issue they face. Of the more than 1,600 \n     CEOs surveyed, 87% said the federal government doesn't \n     understand the challenges confronting American companies.\n       Believe it or not, Mr. Frank has already promised a follow-\n     up bill to fix the mistakes Congress is making in this one. \n     In a recent all-night rewrite session, he and Mr. Dodd made a \n     particular mess of the derivatives provisions. They now say \n     they didn't really mean to force billions of dollars in new \n     collateral payments from industrial companies on existing \n     contracts that present no systemic risk. But that's precisely \n     what the regulators could demand under the current language, \n     and the courts will ultimately decide when everyone sues \n     after the new rules are issued.\n       Taxpayers might naturally ask why legislators don't simply \n     draft a better bill now. But for Democrats the current and \n     only priority is to pass something they can claim whacks the \n     banks and which they can hail as another ``achievement'' to \n     sell before the elections.\n       More remarkable is that a handful of Republicans are \n     enabling this regulatory mess. Mr. Brown and Ms. Collins say \n     they now favor Dodd-Frank because Congressional negotiators \n     agreed to drop the bank tax. But lawmakers didn't drop the \n     bank tax. They only altered the timing and manner of its \n     collection. Instead of immediately assessing a tax on large \n     financial companies to pay for future bailouts, the final \n     version simply authorizes the bailouts to occur first. The \n     money to pay for them will then be collected via a tax on the \n     remaining firms.\n       Because this tax will be collected by the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation, even opponents of the bill have viewed \n     it as part of an insurance system. It isn't. Insurance is \n     when you pay a premium and the insurance company agrees to \n     replace your house if it burns down. A tax is when you pay \n     the government and then the government decides which houses \n     it wants to replace when there is a fire in the neighborhood.\n       Under Dodd-Frank, if Firm A pays to cover the cost of the \n     last bailout, there's no guarantee that the FDIC will rescue \n     its creditors if Firm A fails in the future. This is \n     fundamentally different from traditional deposit insurance, \n     which guarantees the same deal for every bank customer. Dodd-\n     Frank allows the FDIC to discriminate among creditors at its \n     discretion.\n       This transfer of wealth is a tax by any reasonable \n     definition, borne by the customers, shareholders and \n     employees of the companies ordered to pay it. Is this how Mr. \n     Brown plans to reward the tea partiers who carried him to \n     victory last winter in Massachusetts? Is this the key to a \n     small business rebound in Maine?\n       A good definition of a bad law is one that its authors are \n     rewriting even before they pass it. The only jobs Dodd-Frank \n     will create are in Washington--and in law firms like Davis \n     Polk.\n\n\nTriumph of the Regulators--Estimate of new rule-makings under the Dodd-\n                Frank financial reform by federal agency\n\nBureau of Consumer Financial Protection..............................24\nCFTC.................................................................61\nFinancial Stability Oversight Council................................56\nFDIC.................................................................31\nFederal Reserve......................................................54\nFTC...................................................................2\nOCC..................................................................17\nOffice of Financial Research..........................................4\nSEC..................................................................95\nTreasury..............................................................9\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n    Total*..........................................................243\n\n* The total eliminates double counting for joint rule-makings and this \nestimate only includes explicit rule-makings in the bill, and thus \nlikely represents a significant underestimate.\nSource: Davis Polk & Wardwell\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform Act. As the\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I was fortunate to play a \nrole in writing some of the most important reforms of this legislation, \nand that was the derivatives title. This historic legislation the \nSenate stands poised to approve will rein in the reckless Wall Street \nbehavior that nearly destroyed our economy, hurting Arkansas small \nbusinesses and costing millions of Americans their jobs.\n  In 2008, our Nation's economy was on the brink of collapse. America \nwas being held captive by a financial system that was so \ninterconnected, so large, and so irresponsible that our economy and our \nway of life were about to be destroyed. I will never forget the \nsobering meetings at the Capitol with then-Treasury Secretary Hank \nPaulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who informed us of \nthe imminent collapse of the U.S. economy. Overnight, the United States \nof America--the most powerful economic power on the globe--had been \nbrought to the brink of collapse.\n  Today, American families and small businesses are still managing the \nconsequences of the reckless behavior that occurred on Wall Street and \nnearly led to our economic collapse. Congress has the duty to the \npeople we represent and to future generations of Americans to ensure \nthat this country's economic security is never again put in that kind \nof jeopardy. Failure to correct the mistakes of the past is simply \nunacceptable. That is why I am proud to say that today we stand poised \nto deliver the historic reform the American people deserve.\n  This legislation provides 100 percent transparency and accountability \nto our shattered financial markets and regulatory system. As chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, I was proud to help craft the \nbill's strong derivatives title. This legislation brings a $600 \ntrillion unregulated derivatives market into the light of day, ending \nthe days of Wall Street's backroom deals and putting this money back on \nMain Street where it belongs. In all of our communities across this \nNation, these reforms will get banks back to the business of banking, \nprotecting innocent depositors and ensuring taxpayers will never again \nhave to foot the bill for risky Wall Street gambling.\n  After spending countless hours on this legislation and digging into \nthe details of the derivatives world, I am here to reassure my \ncolleagues and all Americans that this bill is strong, it is \nthoughtful, and it is groundbreaking reform that will fundamentally \nchange our financial system for the better. We worked hard to ensure \nthat it would.\n  It is important to reiterate that this reform is not regulation for \nregulation sake. It is surgical in its approach. We maintain an end-\nuser exemption, promote restraints on the regulators, where necessary, \nand provisions that recognize we are competing in a global financial \nmarketplace.\n  Over the next year, Congress will rely heavily on the regulators for \ntheir guidance and expertise as the rules and regulations are written \nfor this legislation. As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee--\none of the key committees of oversight--I pledge to be vigilant in this \nprocess and retain a watchful eye on those regulators. It is imperative \nthat our vision of strong reform is implemented properly; that everyone \nshould be doing their job--in the legislation we write, the regulations \nthat need to be written to match that, and the oversight to ensure that \nbalance continues. While the regulators must hold the financial system \naccountable for its actions, Congress must hold the regulators \naccountable, just as the voters hold us responsible for a lack of \nmeaningful reform.\n  As the Senator from a rural State, I will also ensure that our \ncommunity banks are able to continue to meet the lending needs of rural \nAmerica and will not be subject to unintended consequences. Our \ncommunity banks did not create this problem and should not have to \nshoulder the burden of paying for the solution.\n\n  America's consumers and businesses deserve strong reform that will \nensure that the U.S. financial oversight system promotes and fosters \nthe most honest, open, and reliable financial markets in the world. Our \nfinancial markets have long been the envy of the world. The time has \ncome for our country to restore confidence to our shattered financial \nsystem. The time has come for us, the United States, to lead by \nexample. We stand poised to deliver that reform today, and I look \nforward to final passage of this bill.\n  Finally, a bill of this complexity and importance requires \nperseverance and long hours, and the dedicated staff of the Senate \ndeserves congratulations. I thank my colleagues, of course, Senator \nDodd and his staff, for their tremendous work. In particular, I would \nlike to thank Ed Silverman, the Banking Committee staff director for \nhis dedication to finishing this legislation. I would like to also \nthank Senator Chambliss, my ranking member on the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, and his staff for their friendship and eyes and ears \nthroughout this process; Senator Reid and his staff, of course, for \ntheir leadership; and the administration and regulators for their \nextraordinary commitment to this reform bill; and certainly our House \ncolleagues, Chairmen Frank and Peterson--particularly Chairman Peterson \nof the House Agriculture Committee in particular, and their staffs, for \ntheir cooperation and leadership.\n  I also would like to thank my staff for their unbelievable hard work \nthroughout this process. There were a lot of long nights, a lot of \ncomplicated issues, and a lot of dedication on their part to ensuring \nthat what we produced was something that was good and solid for the \nfuture of this country, particularly Patrick McCarty, Cory Claussen, \nBrian Baenig, Julie Anna Potts, Matt Dunn, George Wilder, Courtney \nRowe, and Robert Holifield on our Agriculture Committee staff, as well \nas Anna Taylor on my personal staff.\n  We have an enormous opportunity to do something that is going to move \nus forward, understanding that we never get things perfect but, more \nimportantly, that we are willing to step to the plate and to do what we \ncan to make our country strong again, to make our economy strong again, \nto bring confidence to consumers and investors in this Nation and \nglobally in order to move ourselves forward--not just for ourselves but \nfor future generations. I urge my colleagues to support this conference \nreport, and I look forward to this legislation being signed into law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Franken.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. I wish to speak for a moment about the Dodd-Frank bill \nthat we are going to vote on apparently tomorrow evening. I wanted to \ntalk a little bit about politics, which is not my specialty, and then a \nlittle bit about the substance.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has been highly involved in this bill \nand made a positive contribution. I read recently comments made by our \nleader, the majority leader here, and the President, and actually the \nchairman of the Banking Committee regarding the fact that the reason \nthe bill is the way it is is partisan politics, and basically \ninsinuating that Republicans did not want to deal with a financial \nregulatory bill.\n  Nothing has disappointed me more than the fact that we have a bill \nthat has basically ended up wrapping folks around the axle as they \ntried to get two or three votes on our side of the aisle to pass this \nbill. We had a tremendous opportunity to pass a bipartisan bill. We had \na tremendous opportunity to pass a bill that would have shown the \nAmerican people that we in this body have the ability to work together \non big issues and solve problems. I think it is a shame we did not do \nthat. I have to say, from my perspective--and I think I put as much \ntime into this bill as anybody here in the Senate--it ended up being \nabout partisan issues. There was an overreach on issues that had almost \nnothing to do--as a matter of fact, absolutely nothing to do--with this \ncrisis, to advance some political agenda issues, and then, on the other \nhand, a total denial to deal with some of the core issues that\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\ngot us in this situation. So I am disappointed.\n  We talk a lot. We have had groups come in, and they talk us to about \nhow they want to see bipartisanship. Then some of us on both sides of \nthe aisle step out from time to time to do that. When it happens, and a \nlot of effort is expended, and the end product is not achieved, for a \nlot of forces that exist around here, the very people that you end up \nreaching out to criticize the fact that we ended up with a partisan \nbill.\n  Yet, at the end of the day, let's face it, one side has the majority, \none side has the minority. In this particular bill, I do not think \nthere was, at the end, a valid attempt to do that. So I am \ndisappointed. We have issues in this country as they relate to our \nfinancial system that do need to be addressed. No doubt, any bill of \nthis magnitude, 2,300 pages, has some good things in it. There are good \nprovisions in this 2,300-page bill. In many ways we punted most of the \nwork to regulators. They are going to spend the next 10 to 18 months \nmaking rules that leave a lot of instability in our financial system at \na time when I think people want to have a degree of certainty.\n  I think the Presiding Officer today tried to actually focus on \ngreater certainty in some areas, and I might have disagreed with some \nof those. But the fact is, I think part of our job here in legislating \nis to create a degree of clarity.\n  One of the shortcomings of this bill is that--I think the count keeps \ngoing. I have heard a count of 363 rulemakings. I have heard a group \ncome out and say there are 500 rulemakings. In essence, what we did \nwith this bill in many ways is say to the very regulators who had the \npower, candidly, to do most of what is in this bill anyway, they had \nthat power within their purview, did not do it, and kind of what we \nsaid is: Look, we would like for you to make rules.\n  So K Street and government relations folks are going to make a lot of \nmoney over the next 12 to 18 months as they now lobby regulators to \nsort of figure out what the rules of the road are going to be. In the \nprocess, again, jobs in the country will be more stagnant.\n  The other piece of this is that this all started with this sort of \npolitical agenda: We are going to bash Wall Street. Now Republicans \nhave come out and said, no, this is a Wall Street bailout. So we had \nDemocrats going to bash Wall Street, and Republicans saying, this is a \nWall Street bailout. Candidly, I do not know that it is either one. The \nfact is, I think most folks on Wall Street like this bill.\n  As a matter of fact, I am looking at hedge fund managers right now, \nreading the Financial Times, many of the folks who probably are \ninvolved in the riskiest businesses are now out forming new hedge \nfunds. Now they are moving to a more unregulated area than they were \nalready in. So it is pretty fascinating how we create bills and we do \nnot address the core issues, and then we have lots of unintended \nconsequences along the way, as we are seeing play out right now.\n  I am not supporting this bill, which I had hoped to cosponsor. I am \nnot supporting this bill out of partisanship; I am not supporting this \nbill because it misses the mark. This is not the worst bill that has \never been created. I am not going to say that. It is not. We just did \nnot do our work. I mean, basically what we have done is, as I \nmentioned, we left it to regulators. We did not deal with some core \nissues.\n  I offered an amendment to deal with underwriting. At the end of the \nday, regardless of everything that people talk about at hieroglyphic \nlevels, we had a lot of loans in this country that were written to \npeople who could not pay them back. We did not have underwriting \nstandards. We still do not have underwriting standards.\n  At the end of the day, we had two entities. I am not one of those who \nsaid, these entities were the core reason for the problem. But the fact \nis, we had two enablers, Fannie and Freddie, that, let's face it, what \nthey do is they allow people to write bad mortgages, pool them \ntogether, and then they insure or purchase those. They were enablers. \nWe have not dealt with that.\n  I do not support this legislation, not because it is the worst bill \nin the world. It is not. As a matter of fact, we do not even know what \nthe outcome of this legislation is. It is interesting, I read the \npapers and they talk about the fact that this is a historical piece of \nlegislation. We have no idea whether this bill is historical. We will \nnot know for a long time until the regulators decide what they are \ngoing to do with this bill, because basically the power is left to a \nhuge number of bureaucrats which, by the way, we have created, which is \ngoing to be like a malaise over our financial community because we did \nnot give a lot of clear direction. We left it to regulators. We created \na bureaucracy.\n  One other note. I think the issue that in many ways divided us--I \nknow people on the other side of the aisle knew this well, refused to \naddress it, although at one point we got very close and almost had a \ndeal--was this issue of the Consumer Protection Agency.\n  I am all for consumer protection. I think the concern that I had as \nan individual is we have created a new entity. It has no board. It is \nan amazing thing. It has no board. Because of the standards against \nwhich the way this organization is judged as it relates to its \nrulemaking, which is expansive across the entire financial industry, \nbecause of the standard against which you have to challenge, there is \nno veto ability.\n  This new organization has a budget anywhere from, I think, $600 \nmillion to $1 billion a year, and the only way the Presiding Officer or \nI will know what direction this organization is going to take is who \nleads it. This is an incredible place for us to be, for us as a \nCongress to be. I think it is an incredible place for the \nadministration to be, where we are creating an entity, a consumer \nfinancial protection organization, that has incredible rule-writing \nabilities, that has no board, no real veto ability, and yet on its own, \none person--I am not talking about a group of people, but one person is \ngoing to decide the nature of what this organization is going to engage \nin. I find that incredible.\n  For all I know, the fears that I have about it, the fears I have \nabout this organization, may not be borne out--may not be borne out.\n  I think the Presiding Officer very well may support this concept. He \nwill never know whether his hopes for this organization are borne out \nuntil we know who the person is and what their bent and flavor is.\n  I think that, again, as a body we had a responsibility to put a \nbalance in place so that we knew what the direction of this \norganization was going to be over time. I find that to be incredibly \nirresponsible.\n  As we look at this bill, I think one of the gauges of what it does \nis, we have the folks on Wall Street who rhetorically my friends on the \nother side of the aisle wanted to bash, and, candidly, all of America \nin many ways is upset with Wall Street is loving this bill. They have \ngot teams of compliance officers who have the ability to deal with \nregulations a consumer protection agency might put out, all these \nrulemakings. As a matter of fact, typically when we regulate like this, \nit is the big guys who benefit, and they get bigger.\n  But the community banks, the smaller banks in my State, and I think \nacross this country, are the ones that are concerned. I know we are all \nconcerned about the employment activity in our country. All of us want \nto see the economy improve.\n  At the end of the day, most Americans have to deal with these smaller \ninstitutions. Most Americans want to deal with these smaller \ninstitutions. They are people they go to church with, they go to Rotary \nClub, they see at the grocery store. These are the people they have \nrelationships with. What we are doing in this legislation is we are \nincreasing the cost of capital that is available to most Americans, and \nwe are limiting the amount of that increased cost--that capital is \ngoing to cost more--we are decreasing the availability.\n  So we are decreasing the availability of capital in communities \nacross our country, and we are increasing the cost of that. So I find \nthat it is an amazing place where we are. We all care about employment, \nand yet we put in place policies that are counter to that employment. \nSo, again, I am disappointed in the outcome of this bill.\n  I have appreciated working with many Members on both sides of the\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\naisle to come up with a balanced piece of legislation that will stand \nthe test of time, a piece of legislation, by the way, that will \nactually deal with the core issues that created this financial crisis. \nThis bill does not do that in every area. It does in some. I want to \nsay that some of the derivatives--clearing houses, I think that is a \ngood contribution. Again, I think we have got end users out across our \ncountry now who are panic stricken, farmers and others, who use \nderivatives in their daily lives. And now maybe--we do not know because \nregulators will decide down the road. We punted that. We said, we will \nlet the regulators decide. So for a period of time, they are going to \nbe concerned about whether they are able to put up their tractors and \nbarns and other things as collateral against derivatives or be in a \nmore risky position.\n  We have missed the mark. I realize that, ironically, after a year of \nwork, 2,300 pages, hundreds and hundreds of rules that are getting \nready to be generated by regulators. It is my understanding there is \nnow already another bill coming to correct this bill. That is pretty \namazing to me.\n  I wish to say that politics ends up overcoming substance, I have seen \nas bills come to the floor. We had an opportunity which we missed to \ntry to get this bill right in a bipartisan way. In spite of the fact \nthat I am disappointed I cannot support this legislation strictly on \npolicy grounds, I do want to say that our staff and our office is going \nto continue to be engaged with others. I know there is going to be a \nlot of other activity as a result of this bill, some of the unintended \nconsequences, some of the mistakes that have been made and some of the \nglaring omissions we did not deal with, things such as--it is hard for \nme to believe that we would not take the time to upgrade our Bankruptcy \nCode so that a large entity that fails goes through some of the same \nthings the same entity in Minnesota might go through. It is amazing to \nme that we did not do that work. But we still have an opportunity.\n  I know the Presiding Officers have now changed. I know the Presiding \nOfficer sitting here today is on the Judiciary Committee. I also know \nthat over the course of the next year or two we will have the \nopportunity to work on that and try to develop something so that when a \nlarge, highly complex financial entity fails, there is actually a sort \nof standard they go through when they fail that people understand, and \nthey understand the bankruptcy stats, they understand what their rights \nare going to be.\n  There is a lot of work left to be done. I am disappointed in where we \nare and what we are going to be voting on tomorrow night.\n  I cannot support it, but I do look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on changes that will have to be made, on the unintended \nconsequences this bill will create and, obviously, the many technical \nchanges that will result because of the fact that we rushed our work.\n  This process began mostly about substance. A lot of people put a lot \nof time into trying to understand substance. I know the Presiding \nOfficer focused on one particular issue and tried to offer some \nsubstance in that regard. At the end of the day, politics took over.\n  November is approaching. It would be nice in the eyes of some people \nto have a 60-, 61-vote bill. Some are said to like obstruction. I can \ntell my colleagues, nothing could be further from the truth, especially \non this piece of legislation.\n  What I regret most is, I know this bill is going to have the \nunintended consequence of hurting Tennesseans, hurting people from \nOregon and Minnesota and around the country. There is no question that \nwith all that we have laid out in these 2,300 pages, there will be less \ncredit available and the credit that is available will cost more money. \nWhat we really have done with this bill is hurt the average American.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the Dodd-Frank \nfinancial reform bill and to share the reasons it makes a great deal of \nsense to restore the lane markers and traffic signals to our financial \nsystem--lane markers and traffic signals that were ripped away \ncarelessly, thoughtlessly over the course of a decade and led to the \neconomic house of cards that melted down last year, doing enormous \ndamage to America's working families. There may be many in the \nfinancial world who feel pretty good about the most recent billion-\ndollar quarterly profits or million-dollar bonuses, but families in \nAmerica's working world are not feeling so good. They are looking at \ntheir retirement savings being decimated. They look at the value of \ntheir house and realize it is worth less than it was 6 years ago. For \nmany families, the amount they owe on the house is more than it is now \nworth. Families are looking at lost jobs and lost health care that went \nwith those jobs. They are looking at an economy that struggling to \nrecover, that is providing them few opportunities to get back on their \nfeet.\n  The meltdown triggered by the economic house of cards built up over \nthe last decade is enormous. It is not only the damage done to \nfamilies, it is the damage done to the economy as a whole. We cannot \ntalk to any room with owners of small businesses and not hear stories \nabout frozen lending, about credit lines cut in half, about \nopportunities to expand a business, but, despite a regular banking \nrelationship extended over a decade, that bank cannot now extend the \nloans that would enable them to seize that opportunity to create jobs. \nWe still have massive disruption in our securities market that provides \nthe credit that fuels not only home mortgages but many other parts of \nthe economy.\n  This economic meltdown has been a huge factor in contributing to the \nnational debt. In every possible way, the absence of responsible lane \nmarkers and traffic signals has wreaked havoc on the American family \nand the American economy. We are here now to set that straight, to \nrestore those lane markers and traffic signals.\n  What really happened? It can be summed up in two words: irresponsible \nderegulation. Let's get into the details a bit further. Let's start \nwith irresponsible deregulation that led to new predatory mortgage \npractices. One of those practices was liar loans, loans in which the \nloan officer was making up the numbers and putting them in because they \nknew they could turn around and sell that loan to Wall Street and have \nno responsibility for whether that family succeeded in making the \npayments.\n  Another predatory practice was steering payments--mortgage \noriginators getting paid huge bonuses to sign people up for mortgages \nthat had in the fine print hidden exploding interest rates, so the \nfamily could easily make the payments at 5 percent, but when that \nhidden language triggered 9 percent, there was no way the family was \ngoing to be able to make those loan payments. Since most of those were \non a 2-year delay, we can think of it as a 2-year fuse, a ticking \ntimebomb, a ticking mortgage timebomb that was going to go off and \ndestroy that family's finances. Then the prepayment penalty that locked \npeople into those loans. These retail mortgage practices resulted in \nirresponsible deregulation.\n  Then we had the securities that were made from those bad mortgages by \nfinancial firms, packaging those bad mortgages, putting a shiny wrapper \non them, and then selling them with AAA ratings to financial \ninstitutions, to pension funds, to investment houses, tossing those \nmortgage securities hither and yon without full disclosure. When those \nmortgages that were in those packages went bad, those securities were \ngoing to go bad. That is what happened in 2008 and 2009. It melted down \nthis economy.\n  Another piece was the irresponsible deregulation lifting leverage \nrequirements on the largest investment houses. Bear Sterns in a single \nyear went from 20-to-1 leverage to 40-to-1 leverage. That means they \nwere going to make a lot more money when everything is going up, but it \nmeans the moment things turn down, they can't\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\ncover their bets and they are going to go out of business.\n  Then we had credit default swaps. That is a fancy term for insurance \non the success of a bond. That new insurance was issued by AIG without \nany collateral being set aside to cover the insurance--complete failure \nto deregulate this new product. Those insurance policies, those credit \ndefault policies created an interwoven web in which if one firm failed \nand couldn't pay off its responsibilities under the credit default \nswaps or insurance policies, then the firm that it owed was going to \nfail. It set up a web of potential collapse.\n  Those are the types of dramatic issues created through irresponsible \nderegulation that we must address in this body and that are addressed \nin the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill.\n  First, the bill ends those three predatory mortgage practices I spoke \nof. It ends liar loans. It creates underwriting standards. My colleague \nfrom Tennessee mentioned he would like to see underwriting standards in \nthis bill. They actually are in the bill. That is a very important part \nof this legislation. This bill ends the steering payments, the bonuses \npaid to mortgage originators to basically guide people into tricky \nmortgages with hidden exploding interest rate clauses. This bill stops \nprepayment penalties that were used to lock families in. If you are in \na mortgage and you have to pay several pounds of flesh to get out of \nthat mortgage--and by that, I mean perhaps 10 percent of the value of \nyour house--where is that 10 percent coming from? You can't do it, so \nyou are locked in. You are chained to the steering wheel of a car going \nover a cliff. We have gotten rid of that practice.\n  The second main thing we have done is establish real-time consumer \nprotection to end scams and tricks and traps in financial documents. \nThere was a woman from Salem, OR, who wrote to me. She wanted to share \nher story, just one of the little pieces of malfeasance that had \noccurred. She had paid her credit card bill on a timely basis month \nafter month, year after year. She was very surprised when she received \na letter saying she had a late payment and owed a fee. So she called up \nthe credit card company and said: How can this be? I always pay on \ntime.\n  The person on the other end said: Yes, we received your payment, as \nyou indicated. But your contract says we don't have to post your \npayment for 10 days, and so we didn't post your payment right away. We \nposted it at the end of that 10-day period. At the end of the 10-day \nperiod, your payment was late. So you owe us this fee. It is all in \nyour contract.\n  She said: How can that be fair?\n  That is why we need a consumer protection agency for citizens across \nthe country. Members know what I am talking about because virtually \nevery one of us has opened up a statement and gone: Wait, how can that \nbe fair? We did have the delegation of consumer protection \nresponsibilities to the Fed, but the Fed had its monetary mission in \nthe penthouse of their office building. They had safety and soundness \non the upper floors, but they put consumer protection down in the \nbasement. They ignored it. They didn't act on the responsibilities they \nhad. So we put those responsibilities in an organization, a Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau that has a single mission--not a third \nmission or a fourth mission, not a forgotten mission, not a mission we \nput in the basement, but a first mission--so that Americans can choose \nfrom responsible financial products, not ones that compete to see who \ncan have the biggest scam, the biggest deception, the biggest trick or \nthe biggest trap but instead can compete on the cost of the product and \non the quality of the service.\n  The third thing this bill does is redirects banks to the mission of \nproviding loans to families and small businesses. This is the core \nfunction of the banking world. What happened over the last few years is \nsome of our banks said: It is a lot more fun to bet on high-risk \ninvestments than it is to make loans to families and businesses. But \nthat is not the mission of the banks that have access to the Fed window \nfor discounted funds from the Federal Reserve. That is not the mission \nof the banks that we insure their deposits. The function of those banks \nis to make sure there is liquidity in the hands of our businesses so \nthey can thrive and so families can thrive. This bill redirects them to \nthat mission.\n  Let me put it this way: High-risk investing is a little bit like \nhigh-speed car racing.\n  You know as you watch cars going around the race track they are going \nto push the boundaries, the limits of speed and traction, and they are \ngoing to do quite well. They are going to try to nudge ahead of the \nrest of the cars. But then, eventually, one is going to hit some rubber \non the track or some oil or some gravel or get bumped by another car \nand the race car is going to crash.\n  When you go to the track, you pretty well know in advance you are \ngoing to see a car crash. That is the way it is with investment houses. \nThey are competing with each other to find the best opportunities for \nthe highest return, so we know they are going to crash--that some of \nthem will--and we accept that. This is an important role in the \nformation, aggregation, allocation of capital. But we want them to \ncrash on the race track, not to crash out on the streets of the city or \nthe streets of the countryside. That is why this bill moves high-risk \ninvesting out of the banks that should be dedicated to the mission of \nproviding loans to small businesses and families.\n  Another key thing this bill does is restore integrity in the \nformation of securities. Let me put it to you this way. Imagine that an \nelectrician comes to your house because you are asking that electrician \nto wire up your basement. The electrician leaves, and you find out he \nor she took out a fire policy on your house. I think you might be a \nlittle worried about the quality of the wiring that was done in your \nbasement.\n  Or consider this possibility: You buy a car and you find out the \nperson who sold you the car took out a life insurance policy on you. \nWell, you do not like the idea, I do not like the idea, of the \npossibility that someone would sell a car that is defective so they can \ntake out a life insurance policy and maybe cash in.\n  Yet that was what was happening with securities: companies taking bad \nloans, putting them in a shiny wrapper, selling them, and then taking \nout an insurance policy--a credit default swap--so when that security \nwent bad they could cash in.\n  Well, we need to have a level of integrity in the formation of our \nsecurities or our bonds. This bill takes us in that direction. This \nbill puts the sale of swaps on organized markets. What are swaps? \nAgain, they are insurance policies, based on interest rates; insurance \npolicies, based on exchange rates; insurance policies, based on the \nsuccess of securities.\n  You cannot sell insurance to the general public without setting aside \nreserves, but these swaps were sold without reserves. So this bill \nbefore us today says reserves are necessary so the bet can be covered \nif the event you are insuring should happen.\n  It also creates a market for them so the customer--that is normally a \nbusiness that wants to hedge its interest rate risk or its exchange \nrisk or its investments in securities, that wants to hedge and protect \nitself against the possibility that those will go down or change--they \ncan get that at a much better price when they can do so through the \npower of a transparent, organized market.\n  So being able to hedge risk at a much cheaper price is a huge \ncontribution to the formation and allocation of capital in our country.\n  Finally, this bill allows a systematic way to dismantle failing firms \nin the financial world so it minimizes systemic risk and so the \nindustry itself picks up the cost of their failure, so we the taxpayers \nare not in a position of having to pick up that cost.\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side have simply asserted \nthe opposite to try to confuse the issue. Well, I think that is \nirresponsible because so much was done in this bill to make sure \nAmerican taxpayers are never again on the hook for the failure of \nfinancial firms in our Nation. This is the type of responsible lane \nmarkers and traffic signals we need in our system.\n  Certainly every one of us here believes there are further strides \nthat could be made. There are standards in this bill that I would like \nto have crisper. There are terms for which I know we will need fierce, \nvigilant regulation to make sure those terms are not expanded into \nloopholes.\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\n  This bill does not do as much as I would like to address the issue of \nperverse incentives in the system of rating securities, something the \nPresiding Officer was a huge advocate for, and put forward a terrific \npolicy to address. We are going to have to keep working on that piece.\n  But in each of these areas I have described, this is a quantum \nimprovement. I think colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that. \nSo beware of efforts to confuse the debate trying to say what is north \nis south and what is east is west.\n  So these are the reasons--these core improvements to our financial \nsystem that enhance the ability to aggregate and allocate capital \nefficiently--why I am supporting this bill. I applaud the chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, who steered this bill through enormous sets of \nobstacles. It is reported that Wall Street hired 1,000 extra lobbyists \nto try to torpedo the bill that is before us. That is a lot of \nobstacles to get through.\n  These are complex issues that required thoughtful analysis and had to \nbe worked and reworked. So I applaud the chairman's work in taking us \nto this point where we are prepared to send this bill on to the \nPresident's desk.\n  I would like to particularly thank my colleague, Carl Levin, who \nteamed up to work with me on a proposal to take high-risk investing out \nof the bank holding companies and to improve the integrity of bonds. \nThat was work that came straight out of the committee work he did in \nsuch a capable and timely fashion.\n  So with that, I conclude by saying we need a financial system that is \nnot about quarterly profit margins on Wall Street, that is not about \nthe size of bonuses on Wall Street but is about providing a foundation \nfor business to thrive, for employment to be increased, for families to \nfind work, and to build financial foundations for the success of those \nfamilies over the next several decades. That is the type of financial \nfoundation we need, and this bill certainly is a huge stride in \naccomplishing that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will not take long at this moment. I just \nwant to compliment our colleague from Oregon--as well as other members \nof the committee--for his work on this historic piece of legislation. \nThis was a long time in putting together a comprehensive, complicated \npiece of legislation dealing with financial reform. There are many \npeople who deserve credit for the product of this legislation, not the \nleast of which is Senator Merkley of Oregon, a new Member to this body \nbut a very active and vibrant member of the Banking Committee who added \nsubstantially to the product that is now before us.\n  So I appreciate having the opportunity to hear his observations about \nthe bill and look forward to further comments today and tomorrow by \nothers on this product. At a later point today, we will go into greater \nlength about the bill. But I would urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. I am very grateful to all who have been involved--both \nDemocrats and Republicans--in trying to make this as strong and as good \na bill as we possibly could.\n  I have listened with some interest today to the comments of others \nabout this legislation, with some amusement, I might add, in terms of \nobservations about how we got to where we did. But, nonetheless, that \nis the nature of this institution, I suppose.\n  With that, I again thank Senator Merkley for his fine work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5822-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5822-S5825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INVESTING IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the state of \nunemployment in our country and what we need to do to finally create \nsustainable jobs and grow our economy.\n  The unemployment rate currently stands at 9.5 percent nationally and \nin my State 10.7 percent. Clearly, something has to be done about this. \nIt appears that the new Senator we are expecting from the State of West \nVirginia may be the deciding factor when we vote later this month to \nbegin addressing this problem.\n  First, I think we need to understand that we need to instill \ncertainty into the economy by providing relief to the segment of our \nfellow citizens who cannot find work. Because of the downturn in the \neconomy, I have already voted multiple times to extend unemployment \ninsurance from the standard 26 weeks to 99 weeks, amounting to tens of \nbillions of dollars. But this emergency extension has now expired, \nleaving many without the benefits they need to stay afloat. So let's \nextend unemployment insurance once again. Resuming this emergency \nprogram through November 30 will cost about $33 billion, and I believe \nwe should pay for at least half of it from the stimulus funds.\n  Just before the recess, I supported an unemployment insurance \nextension that was fully paid for, but my Democratic colleagues blocked \nthat amendment offered by Senator John Thune, preferring instead to \ncontinually borrow money on the credit card of our children and \ngrandchildren. Last year, we borrowed $1.4 trillion. That means we \nborrowed 41 cents of every dollar we spent last year. Over half of this \ndebt is held by foreign investors. By the end of this year, our \nnational debt will be a staggering $13.8 trillion. That is an almost $2 \ntrillion increase in 1 year. As the book of Proverbs tells us in \nchapter 7, verse 22, ``The rich rule over the poor and the borrower is \nthe servant of the lender.''\n  America must address its debt and stop borrowing money from countries \nsuch as China and others that don't have our best interests at heart. \nWe just can't keep kicking the can down the road. Our national debt is \none of the most important problems we face, and our failure to begin to \naddress the fiscal crisis will damage our economy, our national \nsecurity, and the kind of future we leave to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Still, I know Ohioans are hurting, so I approached the majority \nleader and told him I would provide the vote he needed to extend \nunemployment insurance if the Democrats were willing to use some of the \nestimated $40 billion unspent stimulus money to help offset at least \nhalf of the stand-alone unemployment insurance extension. He rejected \nmy offer but remained at the table on what I considered to be a fair \nand simple bill: Extend the unemployment benefits and pay for half of \nit.\n  So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, let's get it \ndone. Let's extend UI benefits in a bipartisan manner and pay for at \nleast half with stimulus funds. I am confident we could get 60 votes \nfor that tomorrow.\n  Second, I know most people in America would rather have a job than \ncollect unemployment insurance. They would rather have a job than \ncollect unemployment insurance. But my concern is that not enough is \nbeing done by this administration--or by Congress, for that matter--to \nput people back to work or create an environment where businesses have \nenough confidence in the future to unleash a corporate, private sector \nstimulus.\n  I wish to quote from a current Newsweek article by Fareed Zakaria \nentitled ``Obama's CEO Problem. He needs business on his side now.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. He says the following:\n\n       Actually, there is a second stimulus, one that could have a \n     dramatic effect on the economy--even more so than government \n     spending. And it won't add to the deficit.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       The Federal Reserve recently reported that America's 500 \n     largest nonfinancial companies have accumulated an \n     astonishing $1.8 trillion in cash on their balance sheets . . \n     . and yet, most corporations are not spending this money on \n     new plants, equipment, or workers. Were they to loosen their \n     purse strings, hundreds of billions of dollars would start \n     pouring into the economy. And these investments would likely \n     have greater effect and staying power than any government \n     stimulus.\n\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The key to a sustainable recovery and robust economic \n     growth is to get companies to start investing in America. So \n     why are they reluctant, despite having mounds of cash lying \n     around? [Mr. Zakaria] put this question to a series of \n     business leaders . . . economic uncertainty was the primary \n     cause of their caution . . . but in addition to economics, \n     they kept talking about politics, about the uncertainty \n     surrounding regulations and taxes.\n\n  The Business Roundtable, which has supported the Obama \nadministration, has begun to complain about the myriad of new laws and \nregulations being cooked up in Washington.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       One CEO said to me, ``Almost every agency we deal with has \n     announced some expansion of its authority, which naturally \n     makes me concerned about what is in store for the future.'' \n     Another pointed out that between the new health care bill, \n     finance reform, and possibly cap-and-trade, his company had \n     lawyers working day and night trying to figure out the \n     implications of these new regulations.\n\n  Finally, Mr. Zakaria concludes:\n\n       Obama now needs to outline a growth and competitiveness \n     agenda that will seem compelling to the American business \n     community. This might sound like psychology more than \n     economics, and the populist left will surely scream that the \n     last thing we need to do is pander to business. But in fact \n     the first thing we need is for these people to start spending \n     their money--soon. As a leading New York businessman, who had \n     publicly supported Obama during the campaign, said to me, \n     ``Their perception is our reality.''\n\n  John Meacham, the editor of Newsweek, recently put it this way. He \nsaid:\n\n       A populism that begins in the boardroom would really be \n     change we could believe in.\n\n  So the administration and Congress should listen to these concerns, \ngive the private sector the certainty it needs to plan and grow, and \nunleash a lasting stimulus that doesn't cost a dime.\n  I am reminded of my second inaugural speech as Governor in 1995. I \nmade the following statement which I believe is still relevant today. I \nwas elected Governor in 1990, and this was my second inaugural speech \nafter being reelected:\n\n       We have tried to respond to a very clear message the voters \n     sent in 1990 and reaffirmed in 1994. People are fed up with \n     big government--fed up with government that presumed to know \n     or sought to provide all the answers--and fed up with \n     government that had forgotten its mission and lost touch with \n     its customers.\n       They were telling those of us in government that we were no \n     better than the people whose hard-earned dollars go into the \n     tax basket. Ohioans were expecting us to work harder and \n     smarter and do more with less, just as they were doing in \n     their households, farms, factories, and offices.\n       And they were reminding us of how Lincoln defined good \n     government. He said, ``The legitimate object of government is \n     to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have \n     done, but cannot do at all, or cannot do so well, for \n     themselves, in their separate and individual capacities.''\n\n  That is what Lincoln had to say.\n  I still believe these words are relevant today. I think the \ngovernment can serve the economic needs of the country by doing \nsomething I have talked about for a long time, which is by passing a \nsurface transportation reauthorization bill this year, which is a \nlegitimate objective for government. This is something people can't do \nindividually or working with others. The government has to do this. \nWith the U.S. economy struggling from the worst economic recession \nsince the Great Depression, the immediate impact of this bill would be \non jobs.\n\n  According to the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials, AASHTO, which represents the State \ndepartments of transportation, there are over $47 billion of highway \nprojects ready to go, supporting 1.6 million jobs--again, $47 billion \nof highway projects ready to go that would create 1.6 million jobs. \nAccording to the American Road and Transportation Builders, ARTBA, the \ntransportation construction industry supports the equivalent of \n3,383,200 American jobs.\n  Just think about the massive impact this industry has on employment \nin the United States. It directly provides more--this is something that \nis really surprising to me--it directly provides more American jobs \nthan the U.S. motor vehicle and parts manufacturers, plastics and \nrubber product manufacturers, beverage and tobacco product \nmanufacturers, and petroleum and coal products manufacturers, among \nothers. Our domestic transportation industry is the backbone of \nvirtually all of the major industry sectors that comprise the U.S. \neconomy--and the American jobs that they sustain. The infrastructure \nbuilt, maintained, and managed by this industry is a vital part of our \neconomy.\n  Unfortunately, the American transportation construction sector is \ncurrently in the worst condition since World War II, over 60 years ago. \nThe unemployment rate in construction is over 20 percent--higher than \nany other industry and two times higher than the unemployment rate in \nthe U.S. economy generally.\n  As a former member of the Laborers' International Local 310 in \nCleveland, I am particularly sensitive to the unemployment among my \nbrothers and sisters in the labor movement. Highway and transit \nconstruction accounts for about 75 percent of jobs for laborers in this \ncountry. The unions have underscored in meetings all over Ohio that \nthey don't want unemployment. They don't want unemployment. They want \njobs, and they can't understand why Congress is hellbent to push a \nclimate bill that will put more of them out of work rather than the \nreauthorization of the surface transportation bill.\n  Why aren't we spending our time on the reauthorization of surface \ntransportation? Why are we spending so much time on cap and trade?\n  I wish to share with my colleagues some stories everyday people on \nMain Street have to say.\n  Loree Soggs with the Cleveland Building and Construction Trades \nCouncil, which represents more than 17,000 union workers in northeast \nOhio, said workers are not seeing much of a spike in jobs, and \nunemployment figures range from 20 percent in some trades to 40 percent \nin other trades, such as electricians.\n  In Cincinnati, OH, Matt Brennan, CEO of Loveland Excavating, Inc., \nsays that his company's sales are down 53 percent, his workforce is \ndown 55 percent, and workers' salaries are down 25 to 35 percent due to \nthe lack of overtime. He has seen numerous projects abandoned due to \nlack of funding.\n  Banks are calling lines of credit for creditworthy contractors. There \nare no lending sources available. Many contractors are failing and \nclosing their doors. That is happening all over. This is not just \noccurring in my State but, as I say, across the country.\n  Mr. Hammack, president of C.W. Matthews Contracting Co., one of the \nlargest road construction companies in Georgia, said the ripple effect \nof the delay of a reauthorization bill has already reached firms like \nhis. His company has already laid off 700 of its 2,000 employees since \n2007 because of the recession. Now the delay in passage of the \nTransportation reauthorization bill and the dearth of State contracts \nmean he is planning to lay off as many as 200 more employees by the end \nof the year.\n  He said:\n\n       You can't proceed under business as normal when there's no \n     clear direction out there. It's too dangerous to bet on the \n     future and put your company in financial jeopardy.\n\n  He said that the administration's stimulus package, while a positive \nshot, hasn't provided long-term help for the heavy construction \ncompanies such as his.\n\n       The stimulus package, at least as it relates to Georgia, \n     isn't putting the heavy equipment to work that moves dirt.\n\n  He said:\n\n       . . . It's not a sustainable cure for what ails the \n     transportation industry.\n\n  Paul Campbell, executive vice president of Wheeler Machinery, a \nCaterpillar dealer in Salt Lake City, said that Utah's contract work \nhas ground to a standstill as well.\n\n       There's a trickledown when you mess with infrastructure. It \n     has a freezing effect on everything.\n\n  At his firm, this has meant 221 layoffs. He is considering laying off \nmore of the 629 employees left.\n  Mr. Campbell said:\n\n       There's very little private money going into any kind of \n     construction. You take the Federal contracts out of that and \n     it gets a whole lot worse really quick.\n\n  We need a reauthorization of the transportation bill. States are \nfacing the most difficult financial situation in 50 years. This year, \nin spite of the stimulus, 21 States have indicated that they would be \nforced to reduce spending in transportation.\n  The reauthorization is a ``three-fer.'' First, it is jobs, jobs, \njobs. This bill will\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\ngive confidence and certainty to an industry that is struggling right \nnow. Recently a contractor testified before the EPW Committee on how a \nlong-term bill will provide certainty to the transportation industry. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       Failure to pass a multiyear transportation bill creates \n     significant market uncertainty. The uncertainty makes it \n     difficult to hold onto valued employees. It makes it hard to \n     convince subcontractors to work for us; it makes it hard to \n     convince lenders to invest in us. When there is an \n     inconsistent flow of Federal funding, State agencies hold up \n     the release of projects that are ready to bid and construct.\n\n  Second, a reauthorization bill will be good for our competitive \nposition in terms of our economy and infrastructure. Our Nation's \ntransportation needs exceed current investment at all levels of \ngovernment. According to the Department of Transportation, the average \nannual investment level needed to maintain the current condition and \nperformance of our highway system is $105.6 billion, while the cost \nnecessary to improve our highways and bridges would be another $174.6 \nbillion. The bridges are in terrible shape. How many more Minneapolis \nI-35 bridges are lurking out there?\n  The last reauthorization bill, SAFETEA-LU, created the National \nSurface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission to study our \ninfrastructure needs. We called for the commission to give us the \nstraight facts. The commission called for investments of at least $225 \nbillion annually over the next 50 years at all levels of government to \nbring our existing transportation infrastructure to a good state of \nrepair and to support our growing economy.\n  Third, a reauthorization bill will help our environment. \nTransportation contributes almost 30 percent to the greenhouse gas \nemissions we have in this country. This figure blows my mind. The \naverage length of time that urban areas experience congested conditions \namounts to 6.4 hours each day. Anyone who travels in Washington here \nunderstands what that is about. The vehicles caught in stop-and-go \ntraffic emit far more emissions than they do without frequent \nacceleration and braking. In recent years, drivers have experienced \nover 4.2 billion hours of delay annually. Traffic congestion is also \nresponsible for 9 billion gallons of wasted fuel each year. Wasted fuel \nand lost productivity due to traffic congestion costs the U.S. economy \nover $78 billion annually. Think about that. A reauthorization bill is \nneeded to reduce congestion and consequently reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  A study recently prepared for the Federal Highway Administration \nfound that bottlenecks on the Nation's highway system--caused by \ncongested intersections, poor highway operations, inadequate capacity, \nand poor alignments--impose 243 million hours of delay on truck \nshipments with the direct costs of the delays totaling $7.8 billion per \nyear. According to the American Trucking Association, truckload miles \ntraveled nationwide were off 17 percent last year. The average miles \nper truck were down 20 percent. In other words, truck drivers are \nallowed to only work so many hours. They have X number of miles that \nthey can go. Because of the congestion we have today, they are getting \nalmost 20 percent less mileage covered. That is because of the \ncongestion they encounter all over this country.\n  This is a great time to invest in infrastructure. We will get a \nbetter bang for our buck. Because of the economy today, the return on \ninfrastructure investment is better than it has been in recent years. \nOver the years, we saw SAFETEA-LU money dwindle because of the high \ncost of oil. We also saw the high cost of steel. Because of the \neconomy, project bids are coming in extremely low. In fact, in Ohio, \nbids have been up to 30 percent lower. So what a time to invest. We are \ngoing to get a return on our investment.\n  The gas tax. I want you to know that I am not talking about borrowing \nthe money for the reauthorization of the surface transportation bill, \nas we do for everything else here. That is what the American people are \nvery upset about--spending and borrowing the money. The American \npeople, as I say, are fed up because they are concerned with the \ndeficit and budgets not being balanced as far as the eye can see. We \nwill not have to charge our kids' and grandkids' credit cards. We can \npay for this by increasing the gas tax, which has not been increased \nsince 1993. The fact is that Americans are willing to pay an increase \nin the gas tax to create jobs, improve our infrastructure, and better \nthe climate. Many of my conservative colleagues do not consider the gas \ntax as a tax but a user fee. The SAFETEA-LU-created National Surface \nTransportation Infrastructure Financing Commission recommends that \nCongress enact a 10-cent increase in the Federal gasoline tax and a 15-\ncent increase in the Federal diesel tax to just maintain our \ninfrastructure.\n  I remember when I was mayor and President Reagan was faced with a \nsimilar situation with the economy in 1982. We were facing record \nunemployment--about 10 percent. I remember that well. As I say, I was \nmayor of the city of Cleveland. We had 20 percent unemployment in \nCleveland. During the lameduck session, the Reagan administration \nproposed a gas tax increase and, subsequently, Congress passed the \nSurface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, which provided a 5-cent \ngas tax increase.\n  The American people think they are already paying increased gas \ntaxes. In 2009, Building America's Future conducted a poll, which found \nthat--that is Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania--60 percent of \nAmericans believe that the Federal gas tax has been increased every \nyear. But as you know, the gas tax has not been indexed to inflation, \nso its purchasing power has declined by 33 percent since it was last \nincreased in 1993.\n  I have been meeting with groups since March of last year. They \ndesperately want a reauthorization bill and they are willing to pay an \nincrease in the gas tax. Groups that in the past have never accepted \nsuch an increase--listen to this--the Chamber of Commerce, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, American Trucking Association--Bill \nGraves, the head of the truckers--the International Union of Operating \nEngineers, Laborers' International Union, Association of General \nContractors, National League of Cities, National Association of \nCounties, and the American Public Transit Association, to name a few. \nThere are many more.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of all \nthe groups that support increasing the gas tax. It is an unbelievable \ngroup, including the League of American Bicyclists. People are willing \nto do this.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n     Officials (AASHTO), American Road & Transportation Builders \n     Association (ARTBA), American Public Transportation \n     Association (APTA), Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), America \n     Bikes, American Concrete Pavement Association (ACPA), \n     American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC), American \n     Highway Users Alliance, American Society of Civil Engineers \n     (ASCE), American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA), \n     American Trucking Associations (ATA), Associated Equipment \n     Distributors (AED), Associated General Contractors of America \n     (AGC), Association for Commuter Transportation (ACT), \n     Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), Association of \n     Metropolitan Planning Organizations (AMPO), International \n     Union of Operating Engineers, Laborers' International Union \n     of North America (LiUNA!), League of American Bicyclists, \n     National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA), National \n     Association of Counties (NACo), National Association of \n     Development Organizations (NADO), National Ready Mixed \n     Concrete Association (NRMCA), New Starts Working Group, Safe \n     Routes to School National Partnership, Transportation Trades \n     Department, AFL-CIO, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \n     Joiners of America.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. This is what is exciting to me. Today, Senators Boxer, \nInhofe, Baucus, and our staffs are working full time--and a lot of \ncolleagues don't understand what is going on now--to get a bill done \nthis year on a bipartisan basis. Two Democrats and two Republicans are \nworking together. This is real stuff, OK, not something that the leader \nwill have to deal with in his office in terms of climate change and \nother things that we have been talking about. The good news is that the \nHouse of Representatives has been working on reauthorization for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, and the House bill has been voted out of subcommittee. The bill \nis ready to be preconferenced as soon as we get our work done. \nUnfortunately--and here is the thing I am concerned\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\nabout--we are still waiting to hear from the White House on their \npriorities. I recently met with Secretary Ray LaHood, and he indicated \nthat we will be hearing from the administration soon.\n  But the fact is the person we need to hear from is President Barack \nObama. That is who we need to hear from. He is out on the stump talking \nabout creating jobs. Here is an unbelievable opportunity--a way to \ncreate real jobs and not borrow the money from our kids and grandkids \nto pay for it. On occasion, the President has said he is opposed to any \ntax, including a gas tax, on the ``middle class.'' I point out that the \nKerry-Lieberman bill, which he supports, includes an increase in the \ngas tax of between 20 and 60 cents higher per gallon. That doesn't make \nsense. He supports that but not 10 cents for highways? It should be \nnoted that all the groups who want the reauthorization bill and are \nwilling to pay for it with a gas tax, by the way, are up in arms about \nthe Kerry-Lieberman bill, because they think it diverts funds from the \nhighway trust fund.\n  They sent a letter to the President, saying this gas tax is to be \nused for transportation and transit in this country. We don't warrant \nits use in the Kerry-Lieberman bill to raise money for things that \ndon't have anything to do with the concerns that we have.\n  Passing a surface transportation bill would put a large segment of \nthe economy to bed. Think about it. For 5 years, that part of our \neconomy will feel good about things. It will help States meet their \ninfrastructure needs. It will reduce greenhouse gases and provide \ncertainty and stability to keep it on the road to recovery.\n  Show me another bill that has bipartisan support from labor, \nmanufacturing, business, truckers, and State and local groups. I doubt \nany other piece of legislation will get this kind of support before the \nelection. Do you know what we need? We need a sorbet to bring people \ntogether. Let the American people know that we hear them. And do you \nknow something? We can get something done on a bipartisan basis, \nbelieve it or not. This legislation will create real jobs for \nAmericans. It will be paid for and will put a major part of the economy \nto rest without adding to an already staggering deficit. It will \neliminate the uncertainty about the future that is plaguing our country \nso we can move forward to provide brighter prospects for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  I guess the most important guarantee is that the bill will give peace \nof mind to millions of workers in transportation and allied industries. \nThey no longer will have to worry about unemployment compensation. They \nwill have a job. They can pay their mortgage, buy a car, pay for their \nkids' education; and they can have the peace of mind that comes from \nhaving a job.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From Newsweek, July 6, 2010]\n\n                          Obama's CEO Problem\n\n                          (By Fareed Zakaria)\n\n       The American economy is sputtering, and we are running out \n     of options. Interest rates can't go any lower. Another burst \n     of government spending--whether a good or bad idea--looks \n     politically impossible. Is there anything that could protect \n     us from the dangers of stagnation or a double dip? Actually, \n     there is a second stimulus, one that could have a dramatic \n     effect on the economy--even more so than government spending. \n     And it won't add to the deficit.\n       The Federal Reserve recently reported that America's 500 \n     largest nonfinancial companies have accumulated an \n     astonishing $1.8 trillion of cash on their balance sheets. By \n     any calculation (for example, as a percentage of assets), \n     this is higher than it has been in almost half a century. And \n     yet, most corporations are not spending this money on new \n     plants, equipment, or workers. Were they to begin loosening \n     their purse strings, hundreds of billions of dollars would \n     start pouring through the economy. And these investments \n     would likely have greater effect and staying power than a \n     government stimulus.\n       Now, let me be clear. I think there is a strong case for a \n     temporary and targeted government stimulus. Both people and \n     companies are being very cautious about spending. Right now, \n     government spending is what's keeping the economy afloat. \n     Without a second stimulus, state and local governments will \n     have to slash spending and raise taxes, which will produce a \n     downward spiral of higher unemployment, slower growth, lower \n     tax revenue, and a larger deficit. Joel Klein, the New York \n     City schools chancellor, told me that when the stimulus money \n     runs out at the end of this year, he will be forced to lay \n     off 5,000 teachers. Multiply that example a thousand times to \n     get a sense of what 2011 could look like.\n       But government spending can only be a bridge to private-\n     sector investment. The key to a sustainable recovery and \n     robust economic growth is to get companies to start investing \n     in America. So why are they reluctant, despite having mounds \n     of cash lying around? I put this question to a series of \n     business leaders over the past few days. They were all \n     expansive on the topic, and all wanted to stay off the \n     record, for fear of offending people in Washington.\n       Economic uncertainty was the primary cause of their \n     caution. ``We've just been through a tsunami, and that \n     produces caution,'' one said to me. But in addition to \n     economics, they kept talking about politics, about the \n     uncertainty surrounding regulations and taxes. Some have even \n     begun to speak out publicly. Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO of \n     General Electric, complained last Friday that government was \n     not in sync with entrepreneurs. The Business Roundtable, \n     which had supported the Obama administration, has begun to \n     complain about the myriad new laws and regulations being \n     cooked up in Washington.\n       One CEO said to me, ``Almost every agency we deal with has \n     announced some expansion of its authority, which naturally \n     makes me concerned about what's in store for us for the \n     future.'' Another pointed out that between the new health-\n     care bill, financial reform, and possibly cap-and-trade, his \n     company had lawyers working day and night trying to figure \n     out the implications of all these new regulations. Lobbyists \n     in Washington have been delighted by all this new activity. \n     ``[Obama] exaggerates our power, but he increases demand for \n     our services,'' the superlobbyist Tony Podesta told The New \n     York Times.\n       Most of the business leaders I spoke to had voted for \n     Barack Obama. They still admired him. Those who had met him \n     thought he was unusually smart. But they all thought he was, \n     at his core, anti business. When I would ask them for \n     specifics, they pointed to the fact that Obama had no \n     businessmen or women in his cabinet, that he rarely consulted \n     with CEOs (except for photo ops), that he had almost no \n     private-sector experience, that he'd made clear that he \n     thought government and nonprofit work was superior to work in \n     the private sector. It all added up to a profound sense of \n     distrust.\n       Some of this is a product of chance. The economic crisis \n     forced the government into expansions of its authority in \n     dozens of areas, from finance to automobiles. But precisely \n     because of these circumstances, Obama now needs to outline a \n     growth and competitiveness agenda that will seem compelling \n     to the American business community. This might sound like \n     psychology more than economics, and the populist left will \n     surely scream that the last thing we need to do is pander to \n     business. But in fact the first thing we need is for these \n     people to start spending their money--soon. As a leading New \n     York businessman, who had publicly supported Obama during the \n     campaign, said to me, ``Their perception is our reality.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Mr. President, I will be brief. I come to the floor this \nafternoon in anticipation of the vote tomorrow on the financial \nregulatory bill and to express the concerns I expressed before its \npassage on the floor originally, and my continuing concern today about \nits final form--and I understand it will pass with 60 votes.\n  Nobody has been more concerned about the economy and the financial \nmarkets and financial institutions of our country than I. In part, \nbecause of my lifetime in the residential real estate business, I have \nseen firsthand the sufferings in our mortgage industry, the \nforeclosures that have taken place, and what the subprime lending \nindustry did in the U.S. economy.\n  Before we rush to a reregulation of financial institutions, I think \nwe have to stop and reflect on some of the things we have already noted \nas Members of the Senate.\n  Senator Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, and myself introduced \nlegislation over a year ago called the Financial Markets Crisis \nCommission. We introduced it because we believed everything that had \nhappened in late 2008 through March of 2009 that collapsed our markets \non Wall Street, collapsed our securities, collapsed our mortgage-backed \nsecurities lending, and hurt our banks both community and national need \nto be investigated. We need to get to the root problem. We need to try \nto correct it.\n  This Senate passed the Conrad-Isakson amendment unanimously. The \nHouse passed it virtually unanimously. The Senate and the House funded \nit to the tune of $8 million. That commission is appointed and working \ntoday. It\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\nhas subpoena powers that it can issue, and it is issuing subpoenas. It \nis directed by statute to report back to us by December 31 of this \nyear.\n  Here we find ourselves in the position of getting ready to pass a \nfinancial reregulation bill on the floor of the Senate tomorrow, in the \nmiddle of the year in July, knowing that we are not going to have until \nDecember of this year the forensic audit of our financial system done \nby the Financial Markets Crisis Commission which we unanimously funded \nand demanded. It is like a doctor doing surgery before he does a \ndiagnosis. It does not make a lot of sense.\n  In particular, there is one part of the bill I want to focus on for a \nsecond that I think is rife for continuing problems without any \nregulatory oversight, and that is Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\n  I think everyone realizes that the purchase of mortgage-backed \nsubprime securities by Freddie and Fannie created the depository \nwhereby Wall Street went to raise the money to make subprime loans, \nknowing they could sell them to Freddie and Fannie. Once you create \nliquidity for those securities, you create a market, and those \nsecurities are going to be created to be funded or purchased by those \nentities.\n  That is exactly what happened over the 5 or 6 years preceding the \nbeginning of the collapse in late 2007. Freddie and Fannie went from \nzero holdings in subprime loans to as much as 13 percent of their \nportfolio. This was not just because they decided to buy them, but it \nwas in part because of a congressional directive for Freddie and Fannie \nto have a portion of their portfolio in what is known as affordable \nloans.\n  These affordable loans became subprime loans. They were securitized \non Wall Street. The securities sold around the world, with the \nlegitimacy of those securities based in part on the fact that U.S. \nGovernment-sponsored entities, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, were buying \nthem, but also because Moody's and Standard & Poor's rated them AAA. \nThen all of a sudden we had a tremendous collapse of subprime \nsecurities that had devastating consequences not just for the United \nStates but for the world.\n  Briefly, I want to tell a story to make that point. In August of \n2008, I was in Kazakhstan with Leader Reid and other Members of the \nSenate on a trip that later took us to Afghanistan and finally to \nGermany. When we arrived in Kazakhstan and landed at the airport, we \nwent into the city in an ambassador's vehicle. As we went by, I saw \nthis beautiful city in Asia, beautiful countryside, large buildings \nbeing built, beautiful flowers, obviously a country of great wealth. \nThey do have most of the oil in the old Soviet Union, now the Russian \nFederation.\n  As we came into town, I kept noticing vacant, half-finished 20- and \n30-story buildings with a chain-link fences around them and razor wire \non the fences and a padlock on the doors.\n  We went to the Embassy and went to a briefing. When it was over, we \nwere asked if there were any questions. I said: I have one. Is today a \nholiday?\n  The Ambassador's officer said: No, it is not a holiday. Why do you \nask?\n  I said: We passed 15, 20 buildings half finished, cranes up, 20 to 30 \nstories, padlocks on the gates, razor wire on the fences, nobody \nworking. What happened?\n  He said: U.S. mortgage-backed subprime securities.\n  I said: I beg your pardon.\n  He said: U.S. mortgage-backed subprime securities. He said: Just 3 \nweeks ago, Merrill Lynch in America wrote down their portfolio by 78 \ncents on the dollar. Therefore, the Bank of Kazakhstan, which had \nbought a number of these securities, wrote down their portfolio as \nwell. They stopped funding construction loans. They stopped making \nmortgages.\n  Kazakhstan is 11\\1/2\\ time zones away from Washington, DC. The \nreverberations of the subprime security collapse affected not just the \nUnited States but the world. Today what is happening in Europe and \nother areas is, in part in our recession, was a consequence of what \nbegan by a mandate by Congress for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to \npurchase affordable mortgage-backed securities which became the \nsubprime securities that collapsed the marketplace.\n  I tell that story and I make that statement to make my single \nimportant point on why this rush to judgment on the financial \nregulatory bill is wrong. It is wrong because it excludes Freddie Mac \nand Fannie Mae from any scrutiny or increased regulation. Let me repeat \nthat. The two entities that created the market that bought the \nsecurities that fueled the funds for Wall Street to put them together \nand sell them--the two entities, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae--are exempt \nfrom this financial reregulation bill in terms of scrutiny.\n  That just, to me, does not make any sense. I think when the Financial \nMarkets Crisis Commission reports back to us at the end of this year, \nit will make it clear that it is a mistake to rush to judgment.\n  It is critical that we have all the players under scrutiny and all \nthe players under regulation, not just trying to create a feel-good \nsystem where we reregulate those who are already regulated, saying we \nare doing something about the conditions in the market when, in fact, \nwe are raising the cost of doing business, lowering the ability for \nbanks and lending institutions to extend capital and, in fact, in some \nways contributing to a contraction of the recession we experience today \nin America.\n  When I cast my ``no'' vote tomorrow on financial reregulation, it \nwill not be because I don't think we need to do some things in the \nmarketplace, but it will be because I think it is time we listen to the \npeople we have charged to come back to us with a forensic audit and \ntell us what we should have done rather than take a rush to judgment in \na precarious and difficult time in the current recession in the United \nStates.\n  I am grateful for the time given to me. My vote tomorrow on the \nfinancial reregulation bill will be no. It is my hope that when the \nFinancial Markets Crisis Commission comes back in December, we will \nfind the right answers from that forensic audit to then make the right \ndecisions for the financial markets of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HAGENBECK\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, next Monday, LTG Franklin Hagenbeck will \nretire from the U.S. Army after 39 years of service. He is a friend and \na classmate from West Point, the class of 1971.\n  Buster Hagenbeck has distinguished himself as a soldier, as a \nscholar, as an individual of peerless leadership ability. He entered \nWest Point with the class of 1971. He graduated and was commissioned an \ninfantry officer. He served in a succession of assignments, culminating \nas the commander of the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan. There he \nfought the fight in Operation Enduring Freedom. He served with great \ndistinction, great judgment, and great discernment of the situation. He \ncertainly not only exemplified the courage and character of our troops, \nbut he felt very deeply for their concern and welfare. That is the type \nof individual, that is the type of soldier he is.\n  After serving as the G-1 of the U.S. Army, he was designated the 57th \nSuperintendent of the United States Military Academy. In the last \nseveral years, he has distinguished himself as a leader on not only \nissues of academic excellence but also, much more important, fulfilling \nthe fundamental mission of the Military Academy to produce men and \nwomen committed to the motto of the academy: ``Duty, honor, country.'' \nSelfless service to the Nation. Buster Hagenbeck personifies that \nspirit.\n  Under his leadership, West Point has been recognized by Forbes \nmagazine as the best liberal arts college in the country. Every year it \nhas successful candidates for Rhodes Scholarships and Marshall \nScholarships. It is ranked at the very top in terms of engineering \nschools in the United States. But the real hallmark of West Point, as \nit always has been and always must be, is the men and women they \nproduce, the young lieutenants who are today serving in Iraq and \nserving in Afghanistan, serving with courage and distinction.\n  I think it is not only comforting for them to know but inspiring that \ntheir Superintendent led forces in Afghanistan before them, that he \nknows what\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\nlies ahead of them, and that he has done everything in his capacity and \npower to ensure that they are ready to serve the Nation and lead the \nArmy.\n  I have been privileged to be his friend, to know both him and his \nwife Judy, to be a beneficiary of their warm friendship and their \nkindness.\n  As he retires from the U.S. Army, ending the last class of 1971 \ngraduates in active service to the Army and the Nation, I congratulate \nhim and thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5827-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL PATRICK FINNEGAN\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary \nofficer and gentleman--my dear friend BG Patrick Finnegan.\n  Pat Finnegan and I go back a long way. We were classmates from the \nclass of 1971 at West Point. We went to the Kennedy School of \nGovernment at Harvard University together. We went to the infantry \nofficer basic course together, the airborne school. In fact, I was \nLieutenant Finnegan's platoon leader.\n  Pat went on to serve first as an infantry officer and then as a \nmilitary intelligence officer. He was so talented and so obviously \nmarked for big things that he was selected by the Army to attend the \nUniversity of Virginia Law School. There he demonstrated his great \nlegal mind and talent by his remarkable success in the classroom. He \nwas a member of the Law Review, and then went into the Judge Advocate \nGeneral Corps. He served with distinction, never serving a Washington \nbillet, but always with the troops in the field, overseas in Germany, \nbut particularly with the Special Operations Command, those warriors \nwho are the tip of the spear for our military forces.\n  Pat returned to West Point as a full colonel to become the head of \nthe Department of Law. There he nurtured a generation of cadets. His \nsuccess was such that he was the most obvious and the best choice to \nbecome the dean of the Military Academy, and he assumed those duties. \nFor the last several years he has led the academic department at West \nPoint with distinction.\n  West Point has been selected by Forbes magazine as the best \nundergraduate institution in the country. It has been recognized in \nterms of the scholarships awarded to its students and in terms of the \nexcellence of its academic programs.\n  Pat contributed a lot more than just academic expertise. He and his \nwife Joan and their children and their grandchildren were a large part \nof the fabric of the West Point experience. They were there cheering on \nthe cadets at their athletic events. They were there in the good times \nand the bad times of cadets. They were a source of inspiration and \nencouragement for class after class at West Point. Pat and Joan have \nleft an indelible mark on the academy. They have done it with great \nlearning and great character, and they have inspired all of us with \ntheir dedication to the Army, to the country, and a dedication to each \nother and to their children.\n  It is with a great deal of pride that I salute BG Patrick Finnegan on \nhis retirement from the U.S. Army and salute him also upon his \nappointment as president of Longwood University. Longwood will never \nregret their choice of a distinguished soldier and a great gentleman as \ntheir new president.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5827-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5827-S5828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING GULF BIRD HABITAT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as you well know, it has been 3 months \nsince the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in a massive fireball, \nkilling 11 workers and injuring 17 others. But the extent of this \ntragedy is still beyond comprehension for everyone in this country. \nSince then, as we all know, as much as 50,000 barrels of oil per day \nhas flowed into the Gulf of Mexico. At that rate, the Exxon Valdez \ndisaster in Alaska has been duplicated every 4 days. I don't think that \nwhen this started, anyone thought that was possible.\n  There are many resources down there, as we know. It was slow going at \nfirst, but now we see more than 6,800 vessels, 117 aircraft, 3 million \nfeet of boom, and more than 45,000 personnel.\n  In May, I went on an aerial tour of the spill while I was in New \nOrleans. I saw firsthand the miles and miles of oil slick covering the \ngulf, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people in the gulf \ncoast as well as some of our Nation's most precious wildlife.\n  Our priorities are clear. First, we have to plug this well. We know \nthere are some efforts underway as we speak, as well as a long-term \nplan of pushing some cement in there, that we know may not be completed \nuntil mid-August.\n  The second is that BP and others responsible must pay so that the \ntaxpayers of our State of Minnesota as well as States across the \ncountry are not on the hook. The $20 billion the President and others \nnegotiated with BP was a very strong start because, as we know, what \nhappened with the Exxon Valdez--20 years later, a lot of those families \nstill had not gotten their money. Mr. President, 8,000 of the \nplaintiffs and fishermen died before they got their money in that case.\n  Third, we need to figure out what happened so this never happens \nagain.\n  Fourth, we need to reform the agencies that were supposed to be the \nwatchdogs but turned out to be the lapdogs and redouble our efforts to \ndiversify the energy supply.\n  I have focused on addressing this disaster because I believe we owe \nit to the taxpayers and because this disaster has devastated the \nresources that belong to all Americans. Now, as we face the worst \nenvironmental disaster in our Nation's history, we cannot lose sight of \na piece of it that I don't think has gotten enough attention. Why? \nBecause we have not even seen it play out yet. We have seen that \nwildlife down there right now. We have seen the pelicans drenched with \noil hobbling on the beaches. We have seen all that. But what we have \nnot seen yet--and we have no idea of the extent of the problem yet--is \nwhat is going to happen to the 13 million migratory birds, waterfowl \ncoming from Minnesota, coming from Wisconsin, that winter in the gulf \ncoast in those marshes.\n  At first, no one, understandably, focused on the unsettling \nproposition that millions of birds that winter in the gulf every fall \nand winter will be faced with toxic shorelines and toxic marshes, but \nas the oil laps up on the shore, we have to face this unacceptable but \nreal problem right now.\n  As you know, in our State we know summer has arrived when we hear the \nloon calls from our 10,000 lakes. Minnesota is home to half a million \nducks and the largest population of loons in the continental United \nStates. Hunting and wildlife watching is part of our heritage, but it \nis also an important part of our economy. Waterfowl hunting contributes \nalmost $50 million in economic activity in Minnesota every year, and \nMinnesota has the third highest birding participation rate of all \nStates, at 33 percent or 1.5 million people.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is heading up the Natural Resource \nDamage Assessment and Restoration Program, which will come up with an \nestimate of restoration costs that will be sent to BP for them to pay \nto help clean up the shorelines, the estuaries, and the marshes. \nAdditionally, the new escrow account that has been created will help \nensure that the claims process for individuals and businesses runs \nsmoothly and efficiently, and it will also help ensure that claims by \ngovernment--State, local, and tribal--that are submitted to BP will not \nbe delayed by a slow claims process.\n  But, while the Unified National Incident Command is doing all it can \nto stop the leak, it is important that we simultaneously do all we can \nto protect the habitat of the birds and the ducks in the gulf that \nsupport our hunting and birding economy in this country.\n  In just a few weeks, millions of birds will begin to migrate south \nfrom Canada, from the Great Plains and parts of the Midwest. They will \nfly hundreds or even thousands of miles to the gulf coast, where they \nspend their winters.\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\nRemember, all we have seen so far is just the birds that live down \nthere in the heat. Think of when all the birds go down there. This is \nwhat they are going to find. They are going to find that beaches that \nused to have beach balls are now filled with tar balls. So many of them \ngo to the marshes and the wetlands, and the oil is starting to creep \ninto those marshes. We cannot really put up a sign for those birds that \nsays: Hey, go to Mexico instead. There are naturally other places they \ncould go, but, guess what. They can't read. Nor are we going to be able \nto put some big net up to stop them from flying to those places. I \ntalked to people, experts on this, from Ducks Unlimited and other \nplaces. These birds do not have the instinct to avoid those oily areas. \nThey are going to just plow back in where they went last winter. That \nis why a bipartisan group of Senators joined me in sending a letter to \nSecretary Salazar to ensure that proper attention and coordination is \nalso made with U.S. Fish and Wildlife and conservation organizations \nthat are working to protect the habitat of migratory birds.\n  I am pleased that just this week, the National Incident Command \nannounced the launch of a new Web site, restorethegulf.gov, dedicated \nto providing the American people with clear and accessible information \nand resources related to the BP oilspill response and recovery.\n  It is also important that as we focus on stopping this terrible leak, \nwe also prepare for the serious and imminent threats to the birds and \nwildlife that play a critical role in the regional gulf economies and \nto the more distant regional economies in places such as Minnesota and \nWisconsin.\n  In just a few weeks, we must be ready for the mass influx of ducks \nand birds in the gulf region. If we fail to prepare, countless \nunsuspecting birds, wildlife, will not return to Minnesota and our \necosystems and economies will feel the impact, not just in Minnesota \nbut throughout the country; not just in Louisiana, not just in Florida. \nIt will spread. We will continue to push, with the recovery efforts, to \nmake sure there is adequate focus on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5828-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5828-S5835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to spend a couple of minutes, a few \nminutes this evening, if I can, talking about the Wall Street reform, \nthe financial reform bill. I want to begin by thanking the Presiding \nOfficer who, while not a member of the committee, played a very active \nrole during the consideration of the legislation on the floor of this \nbody a number of weeks ago.\n  There will be a debate again, I know, tomorrow before we actually \nvote on final passage of the bill. A lot of this I will talk about this \nevening I have discussed in the past over many weeks and months that \nhave brought us to this particular moment, where within the next 24 \nhours we will make a final decision as to whether this body is prepared \nto endorse the efforts to reform our financial system in this country \nso that we never ever again subject the American people to what they \nwere subjected to in the fall of 2008 where the Congress of the United \nStates, along with President Bush, asked the American taxpayer to write \na check for $700 billion to bail out financial institutions which, \nthrough their own misfeasance and malfeasance, as well as those of \nregulators who failed to act, put this country and in fact the globe at \nfinancial risk.\n  I shall never forget as long as I live the meeting in mid-September \nin the offices of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, along with Democrats and \nRepublicans, and their respective committees in Congress, where the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the Secretary of the Treasury \nunder President Bush announced to all of us that if we did not act \nwithin a matter of days, and I am literally quoting the Federal Reserve \nChairman and the Secretary of the Treasury, that if we did not act \nwithin several days, the entire financial system of this country and \nmaybe a good part of the world would melt down, were their words.\n  So we acted over the next several weeks. There are a number of \nMembers here who were deeply involved in that effort. The country \nreacted with great outrage over how we had ever gotten to that position \nand what steps we were going to take to see to it that we would never \never again subject our Nation not only to the cost of bailing out these \nfirms but also the cost that has ensued as a result of the financial \ncollapse to jobs and homes, retirement accounts, ability of families to \neducate their children, all of the effects that have been visited upon \nthe American people and many others as a result of events that began to \ntranspire years ago, culminating in the difficulties we saw in the fall \nof 2008.\n  Before I begin any remarks about the bill itself and what we have \ntried to achieve, I want to begin by thanking my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Blanche Lincoln, who chairs the Agriculture \nCommittee. She shared a responsibility with me in this bill, and while \nthe bulk of the titles came out of the Banking Committee bill, a very \ncritical piece of this legislation involved the participation of the \nAgriculture Committee. She and Saxby Chambliss, my colleague from \nGeorgia, along with their colleagues on the committee, worked very hard \nand I thank them and their staffs for the work they have produced in \norder to make this a stronger and a better bill.\n  I want to thank my House counterpart, Barney Frank of Massachusetts, \nwho chairs the Financial Services Committee of the other body. He, \nalong with Chairman Peterson of the Agriculture Committee, did a very \ngood job in pulling together the House version of this bill. They \nactually completed their work back in December of last year. The House \nmoved more quickly for all of the reasons that Members are aware of, \nthe rules of the institution and others that facilitate the rights of \nthe majority to basically move along through the underbrush without the \nnuances that the Senate provides for in terms of the consideration of \nlegislation.\n  I sat, along with my Senate colleagues from the Banking Committee and \nthe Ag Committee, for 2 long weeks, almost 70 hours in a conference \ncommittee. For those who wonder what a conference committee is, very \nsimply it is when the Senate acts on a bill and the House acts on a \nbill, and you need to resolve the differences between the two, we meet \nin what is called a conference committee.\n  The leadership of both Chambers appoints conferees to represent the \ninterests of the respective Chambers, as you then sit down and try and \niron out those differences. Chairman Barney Frank chaired that \nconference committee. There were 42 of us, Members of the House and the \nSenate, who got together for that lengthy period of time, including one \nall-night session, to produce what is in front of us today, and that is \nthis. This is the conference report that reflects the work of both \nbodies over many months in trying to craft a series of ideas and \nproposals that would minimize, if not all together prohibit, the \ntragedy we have been through over these last several years.\n  I would also be remiss at this juncture if I did not thank the \nmembers of the Senate Banking Committee who spent a lot of time \ntogether over the last number of years. I became chairman of this \ncommittee about 30 months ago, in January of 2007. My great friend and \ncolleague with whom I served for so many years from Maryland, Paul \nSarbanes, retired from the Senate. The ranking member, Senator Shelby, \nwas chairman of the Banking Committee for about 4 years prior to \nJanuary of 2007. So on the seniority system, I reached the elevated \nstatus to become chairman of this committee at a critical moment when \nobviously the bottom began to fall out of our economy. Since January of \n2007, our committee has had around 80 hearings on this subject matter \nalone that has produced the ultimate product before us here this \nevening and tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\n  I want to begin by thanking my Democratic colleagues on the committee \nand the members of their staffs. Tim Johnson of South Dakota, who has \ndone a wonderful job, has been deeply involved in a number of critical \nissues before the committee.\n  Jack Reed of Rhode Island is a very valued member of the committee, \nspent a lot of time working with Senator Gregg on the derivative \nsection in this bill.\n  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, extremely knowledgeable about \nfinancial matters, has been invaluable in understanding the nuances and \nthe difficulties, as well as understanding this institution very well, \nand I want to thank him for his service.\n  Senator Bayh of Indiana, who, along with myself, will be retiring at \nthe end of the year, has been a strong member of the committee, brought \na good perspective on the needs of American business and industry as we \nworked our way through the legislation; Bob Menendez of New Jersey, \ntremendously helpful as well.\n\n  Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, again a knowledgable businessman in his \nprevious life, comes to the Senate with a lot of strong ideas and \ncontributed to this bill.\n  Dan Akaka of Hawaii also added considerable financial literacy. This \nhas been a subject matter he has long been interested in, and seeing to \nit to how we might elevate the knowledge and understanding of consumer \nresponsibility when it comes to financial matters.\n  Sherrod Brown of Ohio. We serve together on two committees involved \nin both the Health, Education and Labor Committee, which the Presiding \nOfficer also serves on. He is a member of the Banking Committee, and \nagain was tremendously helpful and interested in the subject matter.\n  Jon Tester of Montana did a very good job as well and was invaluable \non rural America, the interests of small banks, the financial needs of \nmore rural aspects, more rural areas of our Nation.\n  Jeff Merkley who played a critical role, along with Carl Levin, on a \nmajor part of this bill dealing with proprietary trading, the so-called \nMerkley-Levin rule, which was debated at length over many weeks and is \npart of this bill.\n  Mark Warner of Virginia is a new member of this body, a former \nGovernor of Virginia, and a person who has spent a good part of his \nlife working in the area of financial services. I cannot begin to say \nenough about Mark Warner's involvement with this bill. He was \ninvaluable in terms of helping to understand and bring together various \npeople from disparate points of view on resolution mechanisms, as well \nas winding down of financial institutions and how they ought to work. \nAnd while a junior member of the committee, his involvement, his \nparticipation, was that of any senior member--in fact, more so. So I \nthank him.\n  Then, of course, Michael Bennet of Colorado, as well who comes from a \nvaried background, including financial services, understands it well.\n  So I thank my Democratic colleagues on the committee for their work.\n  Senator Shelby, the Republican ranking member, and I have been great \nfriends for many years, served in the other body and this body together \nfor a number of years. And while we have differing points of view on \nthis bill, and he is not a supporter of it, the Shelby-Dodd amendment, \nwhich was offered at the outset of the debate on the floor of this \nChamber, put aside I think for most Members once and for all the issue \nof a bailout, too big to fail. I thank him for that and his involvement \nin the process as we moved forward.\n  Bob Bennett of Utah, tremendously knowledgeable, played a very \nimportant role on the Banking Committee over many years.\n  Jim Bunning, the nemesis of the Federal Reserve, was never shy at \nexpressing his concerns about the conduct of the Federal Reserve Board. \nI thank him for that.\n  Mike Crapo of Idaho is very knowledgeable, worked with Chuck Schumer \non corporate governance issues. He contributed to this bill. A number \nof amendments we adopted were Crapo amendments that strengthened the \nlegislation.\n  Bob Corker, worked with Mark Warner. I thank Bob Corker. I listened \nto his remarks earlier today. We have a different point of view on the \nevolution of this bill, but, nonetheless, I thank him for his work on \ntitles I and II of the legislation. Along with Senator Warner, I think \nthey made a significant contribution--and his staff as well.\n  Mike Johanns of Nebraska again has strong interest in the \nlegislation; Senator Vitter of Louisiana; Senator DeMint of South \nCarolina; also Senator Hutchison. A number of amendments were adopted. \nKay Bailey Hutchison of Texas was deeply interested in regional banks, \nthe Reserve banks, and played an important role.\n  Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, again a retiring Member at the end of \nthis Congress, while we have had some differences on this bill, which \nyou will no doubt hear more of over the next 2 days, Judd Gregg played \nsuch a pivotal role in the fall of 2008 in trying to put together a \nproposal that would restore some stability to the financial \ninstitutions in our country. While we have our disagreements, I have \ngreat respect for him. He is a knowledgeable Member, one who brings a \ngreat deal of passion to his beliefs and views. There are a lot of \nmatters in which I could point to Judd Gregg's involvement. I thank him \nas well.\n  Those are the members of the Banking Committee. So before beginning \nany substantive discussion of the bill itself, I wanted to thank the \nleadership of the House, the Financial Services Committee, and my \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee, as well as, of course, Blanche \nLincoln of the Agriculture Committee for their work.\n  At a later point in these remarks, I will go through and mention \nstaff, people who played such a critical role as well. But I thought at \nthe outset we need a recognition of these Members. Yesterday I spoke \nbriefly about the role of the majority leader, Harry Reid. And again, \nwhile not involved on a daily basis in the production of this \nlegislation, the majority leader played such an important role in \nmaking sure the institution provided the time and the space and the \nprocedures for the consideration of a matter such as this. As I \nmentioned earlier, he could have very easily decided to truncate the \ndebate. We ended up taking 4 weeks of the time of this body, \nconsidering, as I mentioned earlier, some 60 amendments on the floor, \nopen-ended debate. There were only one or two examples where a \nsupermajority was required. There was only one tabling motion, I \nbelieve, of any of those amendments.\n  A significant number of amendments were adopted that were offered by \nthe minority to this bill, as well as amendments that were offered on a \nbipartisan basis. In fact, of the 60 amendments that were adopted in \nthe consideration of this bill, 30 of them, one-half, came from the \nminority as well as a bipartisan combination of amendments that were \noffered by both a Democrat and Republican together.\n  So one-half of the product that was adopted on the floor of this \nChamber is a reflection of the work of Members from both sides of that \npolitical spectrum. And while Members may not want to crow about that, \nI do, because I think it is a reflection of the determination to make \nsure that this bill would be available for amendment and consideration.\n  No one is guaranteed success with their ideas, but you ought to be \nguaranteed an opportunity to be heard, and what we did in the \nconsideration of this bill is provide that guarantee, and far beyond \nthe guarantee. As I said, one-half of all the amendments adopted over 4 \nweeks were successfully offered by the minority or on a bipartisan \nbasis, Democrats and Republicans. So the process has been an open one, \none in which regardless of whether you like or support the bill, I \nwould hope it would become an example of how the Senate can conduct its \nbusiness on a major legislative proposal.\n  Today and tomorrow, the Senate of the United States will have the \nopportunity to bring some closure to one of the most challenging times \nin our recent history with the passage of comprehensive financial \nreform. This bill was not written to reshape our economy, the most \npowerful economy the world has ever known. Nor was it written to hinder \ninnovation in our financial sector, the spirit of creativity and \nentrepreneurship that has made our economy the envy of the developed\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nworld, still is strong and vibrant, and I think enhanced by what we \nhave done with this legislation.\n  As tempting as it would be to let the cries of protest from the worst \noffenders of the large financial institutions serve as an argument for \npassage, this bill was not written to punish Wall Street, despite the \ndesires of many.\n  Our reform legislation does not have an agenda of its own. I would \nlike to point out what we are trying to achieve with this legislation. \nHere you can see on the graph behind me--I will have several graphs to \npoint to people--our job was--and you can look at various orders of \nmatters on the graph--to end bailouts and too big to fail. Maybe more \nso than any other issue, this one is an issue which Members of the body \nwere joined together in a common cause that never again did we want to \nsee a bailout of a financial institution at the expense of the American \ntaxpayer. So our first goal, in my view, was to end too big to fail and \nto end these bailouts.\n  Another is to grow jobs and create wealth. Obviously, you cannot \nwithout a vibrant financial services sector where credit becomes \navailable, whether it is a small bank in Alaska or Connecticut, where \ncredit can flow, capital can move, so businesses can grow and jobs can \nbe created. And while this is not a jobs bill per se, in the absence of \ndoing what we are doing, the idea of talking about long-term growth in \nour country without reforming the financial institutions would be a \npipedream, in my view. So this legislation has as its goal to help \ncreate job growth in our Nation.\n  We want to empower consumers and investors. I will get into this in \nmore detail, but the idea that there is someplace in our Nation where a \ngroup of people get up in the morning, not as a second or third \nafterthought, worrying about what happens to the consumer of financial \ninstitutions, whether it be a credit card, a student loan, a home \nmortgage, a car loan, whatever, an insurance policy--when you get up \nthat morning, your primary obligation is to make sure that average \nconsumer in this country who needs and depends every day on financial \nservices will have someone watching out for them, to see to it that \nthey are not going to be abused, defrauded, and taken advantage of. For \nthe very first time in our Nation's history, we will have such a place \nbecause of this legislation. It is not perfect. It is not exactly what \neveryone was looking for. But I think allowing an agency like this, a \nbureau, to exist that will be able to focus its attention on that \nconcern is a major contribution to this legislation.\n  Fourth, we have here the issue of putting tools in place to avoid \nthese problems from growing as large as they did. One thing I think is \nvery important to say about this bill. There is nothing in this \nlegislation that will stop another economic crisis. It would be \nludicrous to suggest we have. There will be other economic crises. The \nquestion we ought to be asking ourselves is, If there is one, can we \nminimize the effect of it or do we have a situation where a relatively \nsmall crisis can metastasize, much as a cancer might, across the \neconomic spectrum in such a way that we find ourselves with job losses, \nforeclosures, and the like, that we have gone through?\n  We provided in the bill the tools to see to it that our regulatory \nagencies and others will have the capacity and the ability to identify, \nto spot early on problems that emerge both here at home and around the \nworld. And I emphasize ``around the world'' because we have all \npainfully learned in the last number of weeks and months that a \nfinancial problem in a relatively small country some 10,000 or 12,000 \nmiles from here can pose problems right in our own backyard. I speak, \nobviously, of the difficulties occurring in Greece and Europe as well. \nSo it is very important that we have the capacity and the tools to \naddress financial crises when they happen, as certainly they will.\n  Then lastly, of course, in this bill we rein in what we call the Wall \nStreet enlarged bonuses that have so angered the American public, where \npeople, even last year, in the midst of all this crisis and hardship--\n$20 billion was handed out in bonuses in the major financial \ninstitutions in our country. Again, I believe people who do good work \nand work hard ought to be rewarded. But how do you explain to the \nperson who lost their job, their home, their retirement, their ability \nto educate their children, that an institution that brought this \ncountry to near collapse is rewarding its members with bonuses of $20 \nbillion? So our legislation gives shareholders and others the \nopportunity in corporations to decide what those remunerations ought to \nbe, as they should as the owners of these businesses. It is not a \nradical idea. In fact, it is radical not to allow people who ultimately \nare the owners of these businesses, as well as those whose hard-earned \nmoney gets invested, to have some say in all of this.\n  So our proposal before you is a comprehensive solution. It is not \nencompassing. There are obviously areas we did not deal with for \nreasons I will address momentarily. But it is a comprehensive solution \nto a very complicated set of problems.\n  This bill is a response to the failure of our financial regulatory \nsystem to protect ordinary families from the consequences of others' \nbad decisions. This legislation is the change I think the American \npeople deserve after all they have lost and been through.\n  The effects of the crisis on our financial system are being felt all \naround us, and they will continue to be felt for some time, even with \nthe adoption of this legislation. I have repeated these statistics, I \nknow, over and over, and I will try to do this briefly, but it is \nimportant once again that we understand the impact of what has \noccurred. Sometimes, just by saying the numbers we dilute the influence \nor importance of it.\n  Mr. President, 8.5 million of our fellow citizens have lost their \njobs in this economic crisis. Our unemployment rate is dangerously \nclose to double digits. The fact is, it hovers near 20 and 30 percent \nwith lower income people. If you are making $30,000 to $40,000 a year, \nthe unemployment rate is triple that number of 9.5 percent or 10 \npercent. If you are making more than $75,000 or $80,000 a year--and \nmany do--the unemployment rate is about 4.5 percent or 5 percent. So \nwhen you talk about a 9.5 percent or 10 percent number, that is \noverall, but within income groups, the number is much higher among \nlower income workers and working families than it is for the national \naverage. So the job loss has been significant.\n  I wish there were some way to convey the sense of loss this is for \nall of us, not just for those who lose their jobs, but what it means to \nour confidence and our trust and our optimism as a people is far beyond \nthe cost of some financial impact. Again, these numbers hardly reflect \nthe damage done to our country.\n  Mr. President, 7 million people in our country have lost their homes \nor entered foreclosure, and millions more are teetering on the brink of \nforeclosure. Again, I say in this area, for those of us who serve here, \nobviously, the idea of foreclosure is about as remote as anything we \ncould think of. We are well compensated as Members of the Senate to be \nin this Chamber. But that notion of having to go home to your family \nbecause of a job loss, because of a bad mortgage--one you got into that \nyou could not afford--all of a sudden having to let your family know \nthat the home we live in, we dreamed about, that we got so excited \nabout acquiring, no longer is ours; we have to move; we have to leave--\nagain, I do not know if you could begin to explain or describe what \nthat means to an individual, to a family, to be through that.\n  So the 8.5 million jobs, the 14.5 million unemployed citizens in our \nNation--a 55-percent increase, by the way, since the crisis began--\nagain, the number I have mentioned to you of 9.5 percent of \nunemployment--I mentioned the 7 million homes that have been in \nforeclosure since the housing crisis began. In the first quarter of \n2010, half of the States saw an increase in the rate of homes entering \nforeclosure as opposed to a year ago.\n  So while we are on the brink, I hope, of passing this bill, let there \nbe no doubt or illusions--that problems persist and this bill does not \nbring your home back. It does not bring a job back for you in the \nmorning. It does not restore your retirement account. But hopefully it \nwill see to it that we never have to see our country go through these \nkinds of difficulties again.\n\n  We have lost dozens of community banks over the last several years.\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\nThousands of small businesses have had to close their doors. Trillions \nof dollars in retirement savings and household wealth have evaporated \nas well.\n  Let me again just go through some of those numbers for you. The \nimpact of the crisis on community banks: 90 banks in 2010 with assets \ntotalling $75 billion through July 9 of this year have closed their \ndoors, and 89 of the 90, by the way, held assets of less than $10 \nbillion. These are small community banks that have had to close their \ndoors as a result of the crisis. In 2009, there were 140 banks in our \ncountry with assets of $170 billion that also closed their doors, and \n135 of the 140 that closed their doors had assets of less than $10 \nbillion. So again, we have seen over the last 2 years the number here \napproaching 250 banks, the overwhelming majority being small banks.\n  The FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has on its watch \nlist of institutions 700 banks that are shaky. Again, saying they are \nshaky does not mean they are about to close their doors. But there is a \nwatch list that the FDIC pursues. Again, I would love to tell you that \nthe passage of this bill is going to stop all of that from happening \nimmediately. It does not. But it certainly minimizes the possibility of \never watching that happen again as a result of the circumstances we \nhave been through.\n  Our work continued as Democrats and Republicans in the committee \nworked to put together a framework as far back as November. In fact, it \ngoes back and predates earlier. But last November, my colleague from \nAlabama, the former chairman of the committee, Senator Shelby, \nannounced--and I believe he was correct--that we had gotten about 80 \npercent of the way to a bipartisan consensus on this legislation. That \nis about where it ended, I guess, but nonetheless this bill does \nreflect at least strong measures in here that were crafted on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  On the Senate floor, we debated the bill for 4 weeks, carefully \nconsidering the ideas and concerns of our colleagues. Some 32 \namendments were offered either by the minority or together with a \nDemocratic and Republican author, of the 60 amendments. Half of the \nadditions that were made to the bill over 4 weeks came from the \nminority, either alone or working with a majority member.\n  Then, for the first time in recent memory, we broadcast every minute \nof the almost 70 hours of the conference committee between the other \nbody, the House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate. This \nconference committee was on C-SPAN. There were no backroom deals \nbecause there was not a back room. Everything was done--all--every \nminute of that conference was reported to the American public--in fact, \nbeyond. C-SPAN, picked up by satellite, was available literally around \nthe world to monitor the events in the conference committee. We \napproved an additional 14 amendments by my Republican colleagues during \nthe conference. We worked out our differences with colleagues in the \nHouse and produced a finished conference report that we have before us \ntoday.\n  So, again, this chart behind me reflects those efforts.\n  As I mentioned, in the conference committee we held eight public \nmeetings over 2 weeks, for almost 70 hours, where the 42 of us gathered \nto resolve the differences between these two bills. We approved some 32 \namendments in the conference committee. There were 79 votes held. Of \nthe 32 amendments that were approved by the conference committee, 14 \ncame from our Republican colleagues and 18 came from our Democratic \ncolleagues. Almost an equal number were adopted offered by both the \nminority and majority in conference.\n  Again, almost an equal number were adopted here on the floor of the \nSenate. Of the 60 amendments we debated here, 32 were, again, either \nminority amendments or done in conjunction with a Democratic colleague. \nWe held some 39 rollcall votes on the floor of this body to consider \nthe bill over the 4 weeks we debated the legislation.\n  I do not want to dwell on all of that, but I think it is important \nbecause, as I pointed out earlier, we went through a health care \ndebate. I was very involved in that because of the tragedy, the loss of \nmy great pal and friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who \nchaired the HELP Committee. With his illness, I was asked to take over \nthe acting chairmanship of that committee. We all know what a painful \nprocess it was to come to a conclusion on the health care debate. \nAgain, I regret, I am sorry it went through that process--not exactly a \ntextbook version of how a bill ought to become law--but nonetheless an \nimportant contribution to our country.\n  This bill, by contrast, is a model in many ways of how a bill ought \nto become law. We did it under an open process. We had a conference \nthat was open, amendments were offered, and Members could be heard. I \nam not suggesting that is a reason solely for someone to support this \nbill or oppose it, but I do think it is important in how this body \nconducts its business as a model of what can be done to restore some \ncivility to a process that is sorely lacking in it on too many \noccasions as we try to resolve the matters that our constituents have \nsent us here to work out.\n  So I talk about the number of votes cast, the time spent, the \nopenness of the process because it ought to be rewarded to some degree. \nIf, in fact, there is no different conclusion, the same roadblocks are \noffered, and whether or not we have a closed process much as the health \ncare debate was, or as open a process as the financial services bill \nwas, and at the end of the day you are still faced with the same \nobstruction in trying to pass a bill, why would you bother going \nthrough all of this? It seems to me there ought to be a reward for a \nprocess that is as involved and as inclusive as this one has been.\n  So throughout this debate we have heard the same arguments, of \ncourse, coming from the opposers of this legislation: Slow down. Don't \noverreach. Let's let the market work things out. Let's wait for another \nday and start over. I keep hearing that argument over and over, and as \ninfuriating as that can be to hear from some of the very same people \nwho caused this mess to begin with, we have taken great pains to listen \nto all sides and included their ideas and proposals in this conference \nreport that is before us. What we haven't heard is an alternative plan \nto fix the gaping loopholes in our system. Indeed, the alternative is \nto maintain the status quo. That is all I can conclude because there is \nno other option, nor has there been placed on the table, that which \nallowed this process to happen. A status quo that was dangerous 2 years \nago, it is even more so tonight.\n  If we let this opportunity to reform our financial system go by, we \nwill find ourselves, tragically, someday far too soon, in an even \ndeeper hole financially, facing even more of a mess, and needing to \nwrite an even bigger bill to clean it up. I would predict that another \ngeneration or two would pass before such another historic effort as we \nhave crafted here would come before this body if we fail to accomplish \nwhat is before us tomorrow. We cannot afford to let that happen. We \nmust not let that happen. This is truly a strong and historic piece of \nlegislation. It puts a permanent end to too big to fail, to taxpayer \nbailouts--gone.\n  Allow me to remind my colleagues of what is in this historic bill, \nalong with the too-big-to-fail concept and ending the bailouts that \nhave too often persisted in the past. Wall Street firms understand if \nthey gamble with their own risks, it is one thing. Gambling with others \nis a flaw that we will not tolerate. The American people deserve this \nassurance, and we provide it in this bill. They were put on the hook, \nof course, for an unprecedented emergency action that we had to take to \nsave our economy from completely collapsing. They were and still are \nangry that they had to pay for the greed and recklessness of others, \nand they were and are still today even angrier that their generosity \ndidn't seem to motivate Wall Street to change its culture, as banks \ncontinue to lavish large bonuses on executives while Main Street \nAmericans lost their homes, their jobs, their retirement, and their \nwealth.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this bill creates a consumer protection \nagency with authority and independence. It ends too big to fail; it \nestablishes an advanced warning system for financial threats; and it \nprovides new transparency and accountability for derivatives and other \nexotic financial instruments. It makes public companies and\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\nexecutives more accountable to their shareholders, and it gives \nregulators powerful authorities to protect investors and depositors. \nThis legislation, I say to Wall Street, with its outright ban on any \nfuture too-big-to-fail bailouts, is the other shoe dropping.\n  Our bill also establishes, as I mentioned, a consumer financial \nprotection bureau, the very first-of-its-kind watchdog. It will have \none job and one job only; that is, to protect and empower American \nconsumers and their financial decisions. American families shouldn't \nhave to have an advanced business degree to plan for their financial \nfuture, and they shouldn't have the fear that they will get ripped off \nby a shady lender or a scam artist as too often has been the case.\n  For too long they have been on their own because the seven different \nagencies that were supposed to be looking out for them were distracted \nby their other sometimes conflicting missions.\n  Americans need to know this new consumer protection bureau would not \nmake decisions for them. The new bureau will make sure consumers have \nthe information they need to make good decisions about their home \nmortgages, their student loans, their home equity loans, their credit \ncards, and other financial matters. It will protect them from being \ntrapped by unfair or deceptive or abusive lending practices, and if \nthey do encounter a problem, there is a single toll-free number to call \nand get help.\n  By the way, let me just add to this last point about consumer \nprotection: I have heard some Members suggest we don't deal with \nunderwriting standards for home mortgages. I am looking to staff here, \nbut I think there are some 40, 50, 60 pages of this bill, pages and \npages alone dedicated to underwriting standards when it comes to \nresidential mortgages. We spent a great deal of time in seeing to it \nthat no longer would we have these no-doc loans, no requirements, no \ninformation, nothing at all that too often led to the financial \ndifficulties we are in.\n  I urge my colleagues and others to read the bill or read the \nsections. There is a whole area of this bill, a significant part of it, \ndealing with underwriting standards for residential mortgages.\n  This bill will provide an early warning system to sound the alarm \nshould large institutions or new financial products or practices \nthreaten the stability of our financial system. Most Americans were \ncompletely unfamiliar with innovative financial instruments such as \ncredit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities until those very \ninstruments sparked a crisis that put millions of people out of work. I \nnoted with some interest just yesterday, I believe it was, that the \nformer Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson--I don't want to \nexaggerate his comments, but I think I concluded that he thought this \nbill was a good bill. He identified specifically this early warning \nsystem in our legislation as one of the important provisions that had \nnot existed earlier on, not just last year but going back to 2004, \n2005, as he rightly points out, when the problems began to emerge, that \nthis problem that we have gone through never would have happened to the \nextent it has.\n  So one of the highlights of this bill is that we have far more than \njust one set of eyes now looking over the landscape both at home and \nabroad, including State regulators who I think can bring a valuable \ncontribution to the oversight responsibilities when it comes to \ndetermining whether institutions themselves or product lines or \npractices are so risky that they endanger our financial system. Then \nthey have the power to respond to that as well, to see to it that those \npractices can be brought to a stop before they cause the problems that \nthe last crisis did in so many other areas of our economy.\n  Our legislation contains strong provisions that bring the $600 \ntrillion derivative market out of the shadows and into the sunlight. \nLet me repeat that number. This is an area where we went from $60 \nbillion, I think it was--a $60 billion to $90 billion industry of the \nderivatives market to $600 trillion--that is with a ``t''--globally, \njust a massive market, operating in the shadows. Again, our legislation \nshines the bright light of sunshine on these transactions so we have \nfar more transparency in this area.\n  Let me quickly point out that there is absolutely nothing inherently \nwrong with derivatives. In fact, quite the contrary. Derivatives are \nvitally important if utilized properly in terms of wealth creation and \ngrowing an economy. But what was once a way for companies to hedge \nagainst sudden price shocks has become a profit center in and of \nitself, and it can be a dangerous one as well, when dealers and other \nlarge market participants don't hold enough capital to back up their \nrisky bets and regulators don't have information about where the risks \nlie. AIG was the classic example, of course, where that happened.\n  Derivatives should help companies manage their risks. That is why \nthey are valued, so they can continue to grow their businesses, hire \nworkers, and improve the quality of our economy. But during this \ncrisis, panic and confusion in the derivatives market led to job \nlosses. Derivatives traders lost sight of the impact their actions were \nhaving on the real economy in our Nation.\n  With this bill, companies can continue, obviously, to use derivatives \nto hedge their commercial risks, but they must do so in a much safer \nand transparent way that would not put our whole financial system at \nrisk.\n  Meanwhile, of course, this bill includes reforms to executive \ncompensation and corporate governance that will make corporate \nexecutives more accountable to the owners of their businesses--the \nshareholders in these companies--and new protections for investors.\n  Despite the wild protestations of some on Wall Street who, given \ntheir actions in the lead-up to this crisis, have little standing to \nlecture us about keeping our financial system healthy, this bill is \ngood for the financial sector as well. Our bill rewards creativity and \ninnovation without the pressure to take outrageous risks or to deal \nunfairly with consumers. Honest firms can focus on competing for \nbusiness by serving their customers better, and for community banks \nreform means stronger core funding, fair deposit insurance premiums, a \nstronger insurance fund, and a far more level playing field. These \nbanks will get to keep their Federal regulator, and they would not be \ncharged assessments by the new consumer protection bureau.\n  For retailers, this reform bill means freedom from inflated \ninterchange fees and for consumers. I wish to thank Richard Durbin, our \ncolleague from Illinois, the majority whip, whose insistence on this \nlanguage in the bill provoked significant debate and discussion. I \ndidn't mention him earlier, but I wish to thank Senator Durbin for his \ninvolvement, and I thank retailers and others across the country who \nstrongly supported this provision in this bill. Fifteen million \nretailers today will be able to earn more and charge their customers \nless because of these provisions in the bill.\n  For seniors and veterans and minorities, reform means protections \nagainst some of the most hideous scams targeted at these populations in \nour country. Again, I point out--I don't know if we have this up, but \nhere was the headline in the Wall Street Journal the other day: ``Big \nWin for Small Banks in Overhaul.'' That certainly is the case. There \nare 8,000 of them in this country. The Independent Community Bankers \nAssociation, while not endorsing the whole bill, sent a memorandum to \nevery Member of this body, I think this morning or yesterday afternoon, \noutlining why the major provisions in this bill are very good for our \nsmall banks in this country. I have enumerated just a couple of \nmeasures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this juncture the memorandum from the ICBA, if I may.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            ICBA Commentary\n\n               The Good Is Oft Interred With Their Bones\n\n            (By Jim MacPhee, Mike Menzies and Sal Marranca)\n\n       A tsunami of paper, e-mails and every other form of \n     communication predicting everything from the destruction of \n     community banking to financial Armageddon is washing over \n     bankers nationwide as a result of the House passage of the \n     conference report on Wall Street Reform. Some of this stuff \n     is so extreme it practically implies the end of life as we \n     know it. It has Chicken Little in a full sprint.\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\n       Ok, enough already. There is some really bad stuff in the \n     bill. Some of the information soaking bankers about the bad \n     stuff is actually very true and accurate, some of it is \n     exaggerated and a bit of a stretch, and some of it is just \n     downright lies designed to scare the daylights out of \n     community bankers. That is so community bankers will pull \n     Wall Street's chestnuts out of the fire for them. Why do you \n     think it is called the ``Wall Street Reform Act''?\n       Everyone has been made painfully aware of all the evil in \n     the bill. What seems to be lacking is a fair and balanced \n     look at what actually may be some good elements in the bill--\n     if you are a community bank that is. Not much good in there \n     for Wall Street--we freely admit that.\n       From our personal observations, we know that a fair number \n     of community bankers watch the FOX News Channel. And \n     according to FOX News, it does its best to be ``fair and \n     balanced.'' So, in the interest of ``fair and balanced,'' and \n     because just about everything evil, bad and terrible has been \n     said about the Wall Street Reform Act that can be said, let's \n     at least look into the bill and see if there is anything \n     remotely redeeming for community banks.\n       Keep in mind that we are not fair and balanced when it \n     comes to the financial services industry. As longtime \n     community bank executives, we freely admit that we are \n     fiercely devoted and passionate about the community banking \n     industry and don't represent nonbank financial firms or Wall \n     Street. So with that disclaimer, let's look at the other side \n     of the coin.\n       A U.S. Senate Banking Committee summary of provisions in \n     the bill that will benefit community banks might be a good \n     place to start. As already mentioned, while the Wall Street \n     Reform Bill contains some burdensome measures for community \n     banks, particularly those that impose government price \n     controls on debit interchange fees, the legislation also \n     includes many important provisions and exemptions for \n     community banks that ICBA fought for and won. Some of those \n     provisions will directly benefit community banks' bottom \n     lines. Others are designed to buffer community banks from the \n     actions lawmakers were intent on taking to rein in the \n     megabanks and nonbank financial firms.\n       Among many other measures beneficial to community banks in \n     the bill, four in particular are worth highlighting . . .\n       Fairer Deposit Insurance System. The bill will require the \n     FDIC to assess insurance premiums based on total liabilities, \n     not on domestic deposits. This provision alone will save \n     community banks a total of $4.5 billion over three years.\n       Deposit Insurance Coverage. The bill will permanently raise \n     the FDIC deposit insurance limit to $250,000. It will also \n     extend unlimited deposit insurance coverage for non-interest-\n     bearing transaction accounts under the Transaction Account \n     Guarantee program for two years.\n       Too-Big-To-Fail Regulations. To reduce too-big-to-fail \n     funding advantages and systemic risks, the bill will require \n     the largest banks to hold more capital and liquidity \n     reserves. In addition to creating a new systemic-risk \n     council, the bill will put in place new resolution authority \n     to wind down the largest institutions that fail.\n       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Exemptions. ICBA \n     vigorously and continually opposed the creation of the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but the bill offers \n     several important measures to exempt community banks from \n     direct bureau oversight. Most nonbank financial firms, for \n     the first time, will be subject to the same lending rules and \n     standards that community banks must follow. Banks with up to \n     $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined for \n     compliance by their current regulator. A measure to give the \n     bureau ``backup enforcement'' authority over community banks \n     was eliminated.\n       Significantly, the CFPB will not have authority to impose \n     assessments on community banks to pay for its operations. \n     Also, the bureau will be required to consult with the banking \n     regulators before proposing any rule and during the comment \n     process (ICBA fought hard for these exemptions). In all of \n     its rule making, the bureau also will have to specifically \n     consider the benefits and costs a new consumer-protection \n     rule would have on banks with less than $10 billion in \n     assets, and to rural bank customers. Before proposing any \n     rule that would significantly affect community banks, the \n     bureau must convene a panel to gather input directly from \n     community banks.\n       Now if this bill is defeated all the bad stuff will just \n     come back like a bad habit, but all the good stuff listed \n     above goes away--likely for good. As Mark Antony said at \n     Caesar's funeral, ``the evil that men do lives after them; \n     the good is oft interred with their bones.'' In the context \n     of Wall Street Reform, Mark Antony is saying that if the bill \n     goes down the bad stuff in the bill will live on in many, \n     many different forms, but the good stuff for community banks \n     in this Act will be buried with it. Through the ages \n     Shakespeare's wisdom has been proven time and again.\n       At the end of the day, each community banker will have his \n     or her own view of this bill. And that view will be shaped by \n     his or her own circumstances, and that is as it should be. As \n     your elected ICBA executive committee members, we will always \n     ensure that ICBA stays true to its mission to represent the \n     best interests of community banks at all times and flier. We \n     hope this commentary gives you at least a glimpse of the \n     other side of this issue.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the ICBA memorandum highlights all of the \nthings done in this bill that warrant the headline in the Wall Street \nJournal about how the overwhelming majority of the 8,000 small banks in \nthis country do well under this bill. I thank the ICBA for stepping up \nand making that case for us. The American Bankers Association had been \nvehemently opposed to this legislation and tried to convince people \nthey represented all banks in the country. The ICBA took great offense \nat this suggestion and hence the memo sent around to all Members.\n  I wish to thank other colleagues as well--I didn't mention this \nearlier--regarding the small business provisions. Particular thanks go \nto our colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, who chairs, along with \nSenator Landrieu, the Small Business Committee. They paid particular \nattention to how small businesses would be affected by this bill and \nmade a number of suggestions which we adopted as part of the bill on \nthe Senate floor and again preserves them in the conference committee. \nThese are not minor suggestions. They were significant ones and added \ngreat value to this bill.\n  We all talk about small business, but if we are not careful, too \noften they get lost in the debates around here. Senator Snowe and other \ncolleagues--I see my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Hagan, as \nwell--expressed interest as to what would happen to small banks and \nsmall businesses and our desire to reform a system to make sure they \nwere not going to be overly burdened with regulations and other things \nthat would make it difficult for them to operate.\n  So there are other provisions in here, particularly with regard to \nconsumer protection, where the needs and concerns of small businesses \nmust be addressed before rules are promulgated. That would not have \nhappened except for the contribution of my colleague from Maine.\n  I would be remiss, as well, if I didn't mention--I didn't discuss it \nhere--the capital requirements in this bill. There was a lot of \ndiscussion about that. It was the amendment of Susan Collins, our \ncolleague from Maine as well, who, along with working with the FDIC and \nSheila Bair, came up with a very strong provision in this bill that is \na very workable and flexible provision but helps us avoid one of the \nmajor problems that contributed to this crisis, which is the capital \nstandards that raised the risks and caused so many of our institutions \nto get into the trouble they were in. Senator Collins made other \nsuggestions to the bill that were important as well. But I think those \nparticularly dealing with capital standards contributed very much to \nthis, and I am grateful to her, as well as her colleague from Maine, \nSenator Snowe, for her contributions.\n  I mentioned earlier we talked about trying to get this right on the \nquestion of proprietary trading, the so-called Volcker rule that was \nraised by the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  Again, I thank Paul Volcker for his contribution, his tireless \neffort. He has long since left public life, and he could have sat back \nand offered general commentary on everything, but he decided, at his \nyoung age, to get back involved and engaged in this bill. He made a \nstrong contribution to the concept of proprietary trading, where \ndepositors' money should not be put at risk when banks are making \nchoices that involve risk. It is one thing to risk your own money, but \nto risk your depositors' money is another matter. But it is more \ncomplicated than the two sentences I have just uttered.\n  I thank Scott Brown of Massachusetts, because this was not merely a \nparochial interest out of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. There is \nthe whole issue of the de minimis participation, where banks literally \nhave to hedge to protect depositors' money against interest rates. \nThere are a number of legitimate areas where that is required and \nnecessary. As a result of Senator Brown's involvement and work, we took \nnote of that, and it reflects his ideas and thoughts in this bill as \nwell. It is a stronger bill as a result of his involvement.\n  These areas of small business, capital standards, and de minimis \nparticipation were all significant contributions\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\nto our legislation. I thank them all for their work. There are many \nother aspects. I thank Senator Lugar and Ben Cardin of Maryland for \ntheir proposal dealing with extraction of natural resources, and \nrequiring that companies that are public that do so have to say in \ntheir public filings with the SEC how much they are paying the mostly \ndeveloping countries for the right to extract these natural resources. \nI am told by those who follow these issues that that provision alone \ncould have a huge impact when it comes to the ability of developing \ncountries to understand what has happened to their natural resources \nand some of the corruption that exists in their country.\n  I note the presence of my friend from Minnesota. I mentioned earlier, \nwhen he was presiding, his contribution on rating agencies. This was a \nsubject matter we debated and discussed endlessly, trying to figure out \nhow to get greater accountability out of the rating agencies, greater \ndue diligence, so that when the institution or person making the \ndecision to purchase a securitized product that had been rated as AAA, \nor AA, or B, or whatever that label is on there--for years people have \nrelied on that. You saw that AAA and you didn't have to know much more. \nIt didn't get any better than that.\n  We learned painfully that those ratings were not based on due \ndiligence by the rating agencies but on the information of those \npurchasing the ratings from the departments who were relying \nexclusively on the very entity being rated. In a sense, it was \nfundamentally false to suggest that the rating agency had drawn the \nconclusion that a particular product, whether a securitized mortgage or \nothers, was actually of the value that the rating would indicate.\n  Our colleague from Minnesota, of course, played an important role in \nsuggesting an alternative idea that has been incorporated in the bill. \nI am deeply grateful to him for his involvement. I mentioned earlier \nsome of the provisions.\n  Jeff Merkley is a member of our committee.\n  One of my dearest friends during my service here in the Senate is my \ncolleague Carl Levin. We don't serve on committees together. He is \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and also chairman of the \nGovernment Operations Committee--the names change; I still believe that \nis the name of the committee--which has broad jurisdiction, but he held \na critical hearing days before we brought this bill to the floor of the \nSenate, highlighting many of the problems that have persisted in the \nfinancial services sector. Working with our colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Merkley, Senator Levin and he crafted a proposal to deal with \nproprietary trading--the Volcker rule, which I mentioned a moment ago. \nIt was due to their involvement that those ideas were incorporated into \nthe bill.\n  When you have a 2,500-page product--I see my colleague from Michigan; \nI didn't know he was here. I thank him for what he did in this bill. I \nhave spent a lot of time here, but I suspect that over the next 24 \nhours or so there will be more discussion about it.\n  Again, I have been asked: Do you disagree with anything in the bill? \nOf course I do. This is a bill crafted by a committee, working with our \ncolleagues in this Chamber, and with the 435 others in the other \nChamber, working with the White House, the regulators, and the \nstakeholders in trying to fashion a bill that would reform our \nfinancial system. I wrote a bill back in November that I would have \npreferred. But you don't get to write your own bill. You can do that, \nbut that may be where it begins and ends. We serve in a legislative \nbody, so it takes compromise and working together to try to achieve the \nbest results we can, recognizing that, in the end, you have to produce \nthe votes. A good idea that doesn't have the votes is just that--an \nidea. But we bear responsibility of more than just coming up with \nideas. The American public expects nothing less of us than to fashion \nproposals that will minimize great risks to them. None of us lost a job \nor a home in the last 2 years. None of us has watched our retirement \naccount evaporate overnight. None of us will worry whether our children \ncan get a higher education. That all happened to the people we \nrepresent across the country. They are asking that we do our best. They \ndon't ask for perfection. They know we have not solved every problem, \nand that we are not going to bring back their homes and their jobs; but \nthey expect us to respond to the situation that brought us to the brink \nof financial disaster. This is our best effort to do so. It is not \nperfect, I know that. It is not exactly what I would write on my own, \nnor is it what anybody else would have written. But it is our best \njudgment on what we can do.\n  We won't know the full results of what we have done until the very \ninstitutions we have created, the regulations we have suggested and \nprovided for are actually tested. We can't legislate wisdom or passion. \nWe cannot legislate competency. All we can do is create the structures \nand hope that good people will be appointed who will attract other good \npeople--people who will make careers and listen and see to it that \nnever again do we go through what we have been through. That is not our \njob. Ultimately, that is dependent upon what happens after this bill \nbecomes law--if it does. We need to see to it that the human leadership \nthat makes up these bodies who will be responsible for regulating the \nactivities in these financial areas does its job. None of us has the \npower to guarantee that. All we can do is provide them with the tools \nand the structure and the architecture that will allow them to do that \njob well. We have done our best to provide those very tools, and that \nstructure, and that architecture, in a complicated time--in the midst \nof understandable anger and frustration. I cannot legislate anger and \nfrustration. That is not our job here. As angry as we are, as mad as we \nmay be at institutions and individuals, that cannot be our motivation \nin crafting the legislation that the American people expect.\n  Many have endorsed this bill, but not because they love every aspect \nof it. I am grateful to Sheila Bair at FDIC. She has been stalwart in \nher effort to seeing to it that consumers, small banks, and others \nwould survive and do better. I am grateful to her and the staff of the \nFDIC.\n  I am grateful to Tim Geithner and the Treasury folks, who have done a \ngreat job working our way through technical matters and the like, so we \ncan understand the implications of various ideas to get the job done.\n  I am grateful to the National Credit Union Administration's chairman, \nMr. Matz, who was helpful in putting this bill together.\n  I mentioned the ICBA, the independent community banks, and their \nimportance as well.\n  Again, I thank the former Federal Reserve Chairman, Paul Volcker. \nAlso the 20 pension fund managers, including the Connecticut State \nTreasurer, as well as the CEO of the California State Teachers \nRetirement System, the Massachusetts Laborers' Benefit Fund, Service \nEmployees International Union, the National Treasury Employees Union, \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group, National Consumer Law Center, \nAmericans for Financial Reform, Consumer Federation of America, \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons, the Leadership Conference on \nCivil and Human Rights, North American Securities Administration, the \nInstitute for College Access and Success--on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of the myriad organizations \nacross this country that endorsed this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Sheila Bair; \n     National Credit Union Administration Chairman Matz; Former \n     Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker; 20 prominent Pension \n     plan managers including the CT State Treasurer and the CEO of \n     the CA State Teachers' Retirement System; Massachusetts \n     Laborers' Benefit Funds; Service Employees International \n     Union (SEIU); National Treasury Employees Union; U.S. Public \n     Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG); National Consumer Law \n     Center; Americans for Financial Reform; Consumer Federation \n     of America; American Association for Retired Persons (AARP); \n     The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; North \n     American Securities Administrators Association; The Institute \n     for College Access & Success; National Association of College \n     Stores; National Association of Convenience Stores; National \n     Restaurant Association; National Grocers Association; The \n     Food Marketing Institute; The Merchants Payments Coalition; \n     The Petroleum Marketers Association of American and New \n     England Fuel Institute; and 7-Eleven and its Franchisees.\n\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, lastly, I think it is worth noting that in \nall the analysis that we did to root out the cause of the crisis, it \nwas not the American people who were at fault. Their prosperity was \nbuilt on hard work, entrepreneurship, and creativity. Those qualities \nare as strong now in the American people as they have ever been. We \nhave seen a pattern of exploitation on the part of some executives and \nothers in the financial sector, and a lack of wisdom on the part of too \nmany Washington regulators. What we have seen is a lack of integrity on \nthe part of some greedy individuals, who sought to get rich by ripping \noff the American families. What we have seen is a lack of compassion \nand competence on the part of those who were supposed to be watching \nout for the interests of consumers and investments.\n  As a result, there has been a deficit of trust in our markets, \nforesight in our regulatory system, and confidence in our economy.\n  The challenge we have faced all along is how do you restore those \nthings? How do we restore trust? I can't put a number on that for you. \nI can't tell you the financial implications of the absence of trust or \na diminution of it. How do we bring back confidence and optimism, which \nhas been the hallmark of our Nation, even through the most difficult of \ntimes? You can't legislate trust or confidence or optimism. As I said, \nyou cannot legislate wisdom or integrity, and we have not sought to do \nso in this bill.\n  There is nothing I or any other legislator or Senator can do to stop \na banker from making a bad decision or a trader for putting profit over \nprinciple. Our system will always depend, in part, on human beings. So \nit will always include human error.\n  But our system also depends on institutions and those we can do \nsomething about. That is what this effort is all about. We can \nstrengthen them to make our financial system more resilient to the \nshocks that occur and make our economy as a whole less vulnerable to \nthe effects of those shocks.\n  If you ever played a board game called Jenga with your kids, it \ninvolves stacking a series of oddly shaped blocks, one on top of the \nother. But because the foundation on which the first block is laid \nnever grows any broader, there is only one way to build, and that is \nup. As you build, the stack becomes more and more unstable, until \nsomeone places one fateful block in the wrong spot and the entire \nstructure comes crashing down.\n  By allowing banks to shop for the most lenient regulators, in a \nsimilar fashion, by failing to put a strong cop on the consumer \nprotection beat, by leaving the door open to taxpayer bailouts, we were \nbuilding our wealth on a narrow and unstable Jenga foundation.\n  Yet by putting in place strong, clear rules, by giving regulators \nboth the authority and the responsibility to enforce those rules, we \ncan make our structures safer to invest in, safer to start a business \nin, and safer to participate in the economy of our Nation.\n  In short, this legislative proposal insists that we rebuild the \nfoundation of our prosperity and, thus, restore the trust that allows \nus to prosper as a great nation.\n  This is one of my last acts as a Member of this body, in the \nlegislative context. I am very proud of my colleagues and of this bill. \nI am proud of the work we have done over the past several years to make \nit as strong as we possibly could.\n  I thank my staff as well: Amy Friend sits next to me, our legislative \ncounsel. I also thank Ed Silverman, the staff director. I also \nthank Jonathan Miller, Dean Shahinian, Julie Chon, Charles Yi, Marc \nJarsulic, Lynsey Graham Rea, Catherine Galicia, Matthew Green, Deborah \nKatz, Mark Jickling, Donna Nordenberg, Levon Bagramian, Brian \nFilipowich, Drew Colbert, Misha Mintz-Roth, Lisa Frumin, William \nFields, Devin Hartley, Beth Cooper, Colin McGinnis, Neal Orringer, \nKirstin Brost, Peter Bondi, Sean Oblack, Erika Lee, Abigail Dosoretz, \nRobert Courtney, Caroline Cook, Joslyn Hemler, Dawn Ratliff, and all of \ntheir families.\n\n  I thank our legislative counsels: Laura Ayoud, Rob Grant, Allison \nWright, and Kim Albrecht Taylor.\n  I want to thank the Democratic floor staff: Lula Davis, Tim Mitchell, \nTricia Engle, and Meredith Mellody.\n  These are remarkable people whose names will never enjoy the \nspotlight or get notoriety, but day in and day out and over weekends \nand around the clock, they made all the difference in seeing to it that \nwe arrived at this moment. There are Democrats and Republicans and \npeople who work off the Hill who contributed as well. There are too \nmany names to mention.\n  I thank Chairman Frank and Dick Shelby, my Republican colleague, as \nwell as Blanche Lincoln, who did such a great job along the way. It is \na moment of some pride as well as success that we have come this far.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of staff on both sides of the \nCapitol be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                   HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE\n\n       Jeanne Roslanowick, Michael Beresik, David Smith, Adrianne \n     Threatt, Andrew Miller, Daniel Meade, Katheryn Rosen, Kate \n     Marks, Kellie Larkin, Tom Glassic, Rick Maurano, Tom Duncan, \n     Gail Laster, Scott Olson, Lawranne Stewart, Jeff Riley, Steve \n     Hall, Erika Jeffers, Bill Zavarello, Steve Adamske, Elizabeth \n     Esfahani, Daniel McGlinchey, Dennis Shaul, Jim Segal, Brendan \n     Woodbury, Patty Lord, Lois Richerson, Jean Carroll, Kirk \n     Schwarzbach, Marcos Manosalvas, Marcus Goodman, Garett Rose, \n     Todd Harper, Kathleen Mellody, Jason Pitcock, Charla \n     Ouertatani, Amanda Fischer, Keo Chea, Sanders Adu, Hilary \n     West, Flavio Cumpiano, Karl Haddeland, Glen Sears, Stephane \n     LeBouder.\n\n\n                OFFICE OF REPRESENTATIVE CAROLYN MALONEY\n\n       Kristin Richardson.\n\n\n                 OFFICE OF REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS\n\n       Milan Dalal.\n\n\n                OFFICE OF REPRESENTATIVE MARY JO KILROY\n\n       Noah Cuttler.\n\n\n                  OFFICE OF REPRESENTATIVE GARY PETERS\n\n       Jonathan Smith.\n\n\n                      HOUSE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE\n\n       Clark Ogilvie.\n\n\n                         HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE\n\n       Greg Waring.\n\n\n                  HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE\n\n       Phil Barnett, Michelle Ash, Anna Laitin.\n\n\n                       HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\n\n       George Slover.\n\n\n            HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE\n\n       Mark Stephenson, Adam Miles.\n\n\n                       HOUSE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL\n\n       Jim Wert, Marshall Barksdale, Brady Young, Jim Grossman.\n\n\n                        SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE\n\n       Ed Silverman, Amy Friend, Jonathan Miller, Dean Shahinian, \n     Julie Chon, Charles Yi, Marc Jarsulic, Lynsey Graham Rea, \n     Catherine Galicia, Matthew Green, Deborah Katz, Mark \n     Jickling, Donna Nordenberg, Levon Bagramian, Brian \n     Filipowich, Drew Colbert, Misha Mintz-Roth, Lisa Frumin, \n     William Fields, Beth Cooper, Colin McGinnis, Neal Orringer, \n     Kirstin Brost, Peter Bondi, Sean Oblack, Steve Gerenscer, \n     Dawn Ratliff, Erika Lee, Joslyn Hemler, Caroline Cook, Robert \n     Courtney, Abigail Dosoretz.\n\n\n                      SENATE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE\n\n       Robert Holifield, Brian Baenig, Julie Anna Potts, Pat \n     McCarty, George Wilder, Matt Dunn, Elizabeth Ritter, \n     Stephanie Mercier, Anna Taylor, Cory Claussen.\n\n\n                       SENATE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL\n\n       Rob Grant, Alison Wright, Kim Albrecht-Taylor, Colin \n     Campbell, Laura McNulty Ayoud.\n\n\n                     CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE\n\n       Baird Webel.\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this afternoon \nto\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\ndiscuss two nominees for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals--Judges \nJim Wynn and Albert Diaz.\n  When I came to the Senate, I had high hopes of increasing the number \nof North Carolinians on the court. North Carolina is the fastest \ngrowing and largest State served by the Fourth Circuit. Yet only 1 of \nthe 15 seats is filled by the abundant talent from our State, and over \nthe past century North Carolina has had fewer total judges on the court \nthan any other State.\n  Furthermore, there have been inexcusable vacancies on this court \nthroughout history. Given that the U.S. Supreme Court only reviews 1 \npercent of the cases it receives, the Fourth Circuit is the last stop \nfor almost all Federal cases in the region. We must bring this court \nback to its full strength. Since 1990, when this court was granted 15 \nseats, it has never had 15 active judges.\n  Judge Wynn brings decades of judicial experience to the bench. He has \nserved on the North Carolina Court of Appeals since 1990 and had a \nbrief tenure on the State supreme court. He has been the chair of the \nbar association's Judges Advisory Committee on Ethics.\n  Additionally, Judge Wynn has served on Active and Reserve Duty in the \nNavy for 30 years and was a certified military trial judge. He has been \nhonored for his extraordinary service several times, including three \nMeritorious Service Medals.\n  Judge Diaz has served since 2005 as one of North Carolina's three \nbusiness court judges. Prior to that, Judge Diaz was a judge on the \nState superior court for nearly 4 years.\n  As a business court judge, Judge Diaz has handled complex business \ncases. He started as a lawyer in the U.S. Marine Corps, was an \nappellate counsel in the Navy's Office of the Judge Advocate General \nand has been a judge in the Marine Corps Reserves.\n  Judge Diaz also has extensive experience in business litigation and \nhas served on the State Judicial Council which advises the State \nsupreme court's chief justice on ways to improve the courts. He is a \ngraduate of New York University Law School, with a graduate degree in \nbusiness from Boston University and undergraduate degree in business \nfrom the University of Pennsylvania.\n  I note that both judges have received unanimous ratings of well \nqualified from the American Bar Association.\n  Additionally, both men's confirmation to this Federal bench will be \nhistorically significant, as Judge Diaz will be the first Latin \nAmerican on the Fourth Circuit and Judge Wynn will be the fourth \nAfrican American to ever serve on this bench.\n  These fine men have the support of both myself and my colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Burr. Editorials and newspapers throughout \nNorth Carolina have praised these nominations and have urged their \nswift confirmation. The Charlotte Observer said Judges Wynn and Diaz \nare ``widely regarded as intelligent, ethical judges who have won \nrespect for their judicial and military careers. They are the kind of \njudges the federal bench needs . . . Their quality is so unquestioned \nthat only partisanship could stall their nominations.''\n  Unfortunately, I worry that is what is happening. Both Judge Wynn and \nJudge Diaz were approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January \n28--Judge Diaz unanimously and Judge Wynn with only one dissenting \nvote. But for over 5 months now, the nominations have languished on the \ncalendar. It is past time that these two fine judges be confirmed to \nthe Fourth Circuit.\n  Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that \nat a time to be determined by the majority leader, following \nconsultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and consider en bloc the following nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar: Calendar No. 656, Albert Diaz, to be a U.S. Circuit \nJudge for the Fourth Circuit, and Calendar No. 657, James Wynn, to be a \nU.S. Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit; that the nominations be \ndebated concurrently for up to 3 hours, with the time equally divided \nand controlled between Senators Leahy and Sessions or their designees; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \non confirmation of the nominations in the order listed; that upon \nconfirmation, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table en bloc, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill be objecting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the perspective of the \njunior Senator from North Carolina, but my perspective on the Fourth \nCircuit covers a little longer period of time.\n  I advise my friend that for the last Congress of the Bush \nadministration, the Democratic majority only confirmed one nominee to \nthe Fourth Circuit. As a result, the circuit was fully one-third vacant \nwith five vacancies when President Bush left office.\n  These vacancies were not due to President Bush's failure to nominate \nseveral qualified candidates. As a result, my Democratic friends had to \nresort to creative reasons to justify keeping these seats open.\n  To give an example, the Fourth Circuit seat from Maryland was kept \nvacant for the entirety of the Bush administration--8 years. The last \nnominee for that seat the Democrats objected to was a fellow named Rod \nRosenstein. Nobody could reasonably contest his credentials, so my \nDemocratic colleagues turned his virtues into a vice, saying he was \ndoing too good a job as U.S. attorney in Maryland to be promoted to the \ncircuit court.\n  Despite the unfair treatment that Mr. Rosenstein received, many \nSenate Republicans in this Congress, including myself, supported \nPresident Obama's nominee to this seat, Andre Davis.\n  Also in this Congress, Republicans, including myself, supported the \nconfirmation of Barbara Keenen of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit. With \nher confirmation, the Senate has confirmed twice as many nominees to \nthe Fourth Circuit as occurred during the entire last Congress of the \nBush administration when Democrats controlled the Senate.\n  With respect to the vacancies from North Carolina, President Bush put \nup a nominee who satisfied all of Chairman Leahy's criteria for \nconfirmation--Judge Robert Conrad. Judge Conrad had the strong support \nof his home State Senators. He received the blessing of the ABA, the \nDemocrat's so-called gold standard, and he would fill a judicial \nemergency. Yet Judge Conrad could not even get so much as a hearing.\n  In fact, the Senate has been processing President Obama's judicial \nnominees, both district and circuit court nominees, faster than it \nprocessed President Bush's judicial nominees.\n  How has the President responded to our efforts to work in good faith? \nHe recess appointed Donald Berwick before the Finance Committee could \neven schedule a hearing on him, and despite the fact that Republicans \non that committee requested that a hearing be scheduled on his \nnomination.\n  Let me give my colleagues a brief timeline of the nomination of \nDonald Berwick.\n  On April 19, 2010, the President nominated Dr. Berwick to serve as \nAdministrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Less \nthan 3 months later, and without a Senate Finance Committee hearing \ntaking place, the President recess appointed Dr. Berwick. The reason \noffered was that the Republicans were blocking this vital appointment, \nso they could wait no longer to follow the constitutional process of \nSenate confirmation. Yet this position was vacant for the first 16 \nmonths of the Obama administration and has not had a confirmed \nAdministrator since 2006, since my friends on the other side of the \naisle were blocking the Bush administration nominee.\n  Democrats did not schedule so much as a committee hearing for Donald \nBerwick. The mere possibility of allowing the American people the \nopportunity to hear what he intends to do with their health care was \nreason enough for this administration to sneak him through without \npublic scrutiny.\n  Given the President has been so dismissive of the Senate's right to \nprovide advice and consent under the Constitution, I am not inclined at \nthis\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\npoint to consent to the request proposed by my friend from North \nCarolina. Therefore, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, it is disappointing that we cannot get \nconsent for these judges. Senator Richard Burr and I together \nintroduced these two individuals at the Judiciary Committee hearing. I \nwill say that I remain committed to working with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, as well as any Senator who has concerns over either \njudge, to working toward a reasonable solution that would allow an up-\nor-down vote on Judges Wynn and Diaz.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5837-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5837-S5840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BUDGET DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an incredibly \nimportant subject--our Nation's budget deficits. The deficit for fiscal \nyear 2009 was about $1.4 trillion. The total national debt is now just \nunder $13.2 trillion. These numbers are staggering and represent a \ntremendous threat to our Nation.\n  We have been hearing a lot about these numbers over the last few \nmonths from Members on both sides of the aisle. We heard about the \neconomic dangers of running these deficits--the dangers to us, to our \nchildren, and to the very future of this Nation.\n  I share these concerns over the direction of our budget deficits and \nour rapidly growing debt. I have held these concerns for some time, as \na matter of fact. In a New York Times op-ed way back in 1988--22 years \nago--I expressed my alarm that we had gone from being the world's \nlargest creditor Nation to its largest debtor Nation. I noted then that \nthe accumulated trade and budget deficits of the Reagan years worked \nout to about $20,000 per American family.\n  What frustrates me is that I have heard these deficit and debt \nnumbers serve as an excuse for not passing an extension of unemployment \nbenefits. We have been unable to get cloture on these extensions, \ndespite spending weeks of the Senate's time on this matter and despite \nnumerous attempts.\n  Opponents say our deficits must be addressed, our debt cannot grow \nany larger, we have to draw a line in the sand and insist these \nbenefits be fully paid for.\n  This is troubling to me for two reasons. First, because these \ndeficits are not new. Many of my colleagues seem to have suddenly \nbecome aware of them only a year and a half ago.\n  More importantly, I am troubled because one of the biggest threats to \nour long-term deficits is a double-dip recession and the stunting of \nour Nation's economic growth. This shortsightedness is not only \njeopardizing our short-term economic recovery and our future economic \nhealth, it is causing us to abandon the real and urgent needs of \nfamilies at home and in our States.\n  Please indulge me as I take a few minutes to take stock of exactly \nwhere we find ourselves.\n  We all know that our unemployment rate has been hovering at about 10 \npercent, its highest level in over a quarter of a century. There are \n14.6 million Americans looking for jobs but unable to find them. Nearly \nhalf of these are friends, family, and neighbors who have been out of \nwork for over 6 months, despite sustained efforts to find jobs.\n  Long-term unemployment is the worst it has been in the 60 years that \nthese statistics have been kept. We have to go back to 1983 to find \nnumbers even half this bad.\n  The competition for each job is fierce. It is not uncommon for \nhundreds of people to be fighting for a single job. This chart shows \njust how hard it is to find work right now. In 2006, there were about \n1.5 unemployed workers for each job opening. That number has exploded \nto five unemployed workers for every opening.\n  It does not surprise me that countless Americans have given up \nlooking and are not even counted in the bleak unemployment statistics I \nhave been quoting. They have just given up.\n  I can't imagine many things more demoralizing than not being able to \nfind work, not being able to take care of your family. I have heard the \nclaim from one of my colleagues that unemployment insurance provides an \nincentive for the millions of unemployed to just sit on their duffs and \nnot look for work. I couldn't disagree more strongly. Unemployment \ninsurance doesn't keep people from working. The lack of jobs keeps \npeople from working.\n  I have traveled all over Minnesota talking to people who are out of \nwork. I have gone to the Anoka County Workforce Center; I have gone to \nunion halls in Duluth, in Bemidji, in Rochester, and I have met with \nfolks who are literally depressed. These are people who have worked \ntheir whole life--guys who started their first paper route when they \nwere 9 years old, who took pride in doing their job, even when it meant \ngoing out on a 30-below-zero winter morning in Minnesota, and they have \nbeen working ever since. Work is an enormous part of their identity. \nThese Minnesotans don't want an unemployment check, they want work. \nStill, I have had a number of them come and say to me: You know, if it \nweren't for my unemployment insurance, I wouldn't be in my house.\n  One of my constituents wrote to me and said:\n\n       I was employed for 23 years since college graduation and \n     now am in need of extended unemployment benefits as the \n     economy slowly recovers via a ``jobless recovery.'' As a \n     college graduate with an MBA and 23 years of continuous \n     employment at ``good jobs,'' I never imagined even needing \n     basic unemployment. As an active job seeker, I have met \n     hundreds of other job seekers and virtually every one of them \n     wants a job and wants to work.\n\n  Now this constituent and thousands of others like him have to hear \nthis junk about how unemployment insurance incentivizes people not to \nwork. I don't know where the Senators who are saying that are going in \ntheir States, but from what I have heard from my other colleagues, it \nis like this all over the country.\n  But even if we ignore the human side of our economic crisis, even if \nwe are to look only at what is best for our Nation's economy, both in \nthe short term and the long term, it is still the right answer to \nextend unemployment benefits and to do so without offsetting them by \ncutting other important programs. I am not an economist--not many of us \nhere are--but there happens to be a pretty convincing record for us to \ndraw from.\n  According to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's economy.com, and \na senior adviser to Senator McCain's Presidential campaign, extending \nunemployment insurance benefits creates $1.63 in demand for every \ndollar spent. That is pretty simple, and it makes sense. Unemployment \nbenefits are likely to be spent quickly and in local communities. \nUnemployed workers no longer get a paycheck, but they still have to pay \ntheir mortgages and they still have to put food on the table and pay \ntheir electric bills.\n  Throughout this crisis we have all heard from economist after \neconomist who is closely watching the strength of consumer spending--\nour economy rises and falls on it. Unemployment benefits support \nconsumer spending and stimulate the economy. Like other automatic \nstabilizers--programs for which eligibility is triggered when the \neconomy sinks and are used less as the economy recovers--unemployment \nbenefits are effective and appropriate stimulus measures.\n  Do you know what else has proven to work? Food stamps, with $1.73 \nyield for every dollar spent. Generally, the State governments return \n$1.38 on every dollar spent. That is why I have cosponsored a bill with \nmy friend from Ohio, Senator Brown, to deliver aid to States. The Local \nJobs for America Act could save 1 million public sector jobs--the jobs \nof teachers, firefighters, police officers, childcare workers.\n  Of course, increased investment in our Nation's infrastructure yields \n$1.59 for every dollar spent. Infrastructure spending repairs our \ncrumbling bridges and roads to keep us competitive in the global \nmarketplace. We could build our way out of this crisis just as we did \nafter World War II with our interstate highway system. The 21st-century \nversion of the interstate highway system is our broadband network. \nCommerce is now highly dependent not just\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\non bridges and roads but on efficient communications.\n  There is no small irony in the fact that we have fallen behind other \ncountries in our access to the Internet, a technology created by U.S. \nGovernment research dollars, and one which itself created so much \nwealth in the United States and around the world. The Recovery Act has \nalready invested $85 million in grants and $32 million in loans to \nexpand broadband coverage in Minnesota. That is a good thing because \nthe more parts of this country we can reach with the broadband network, \nthe more people in our country who will be engaged in trade and in our \neconomy.\n  This expansion can also help reduce our Nation's other deficit--the \ntrade deficit. The President's export initiative, along with improving \nexchange rates and local economic growth, can contribute to boosting \nour exports, and that means more jobs, more growth, and reduced budget \ndeficits. Our country has plenty to offer, especially as countries \nthroughout the world transition to green economies.\n  In my home State, a National Science Foundation grant helped the \nUniversity of Minnesota develop a technological breakthrough that will \nlead to an ultra-efficient solar cell. These cells can produce 60 \npercent more energy. We shouldn't be importing Chinese solar panels. We \nshould be using this technology to develop our own, for our own use and \nfor export.\n  But all these things--unemployment benefits, infrastructure, \nresearch--cost money. They all require spending. Some of my colleagues \nseem to think that long-term deficit reduction and short-term spending \nare somehow incompatible. Take for example the Recovery Act. Yes, it \nadded to our short-term deficit--perhaps. But imagine where our economy \nwould be now if we hadn't enacted it.\n  I know some of my colleagues will say: Well, the stimulus package was \na failure. The President said unemployment would hit 8 percent if we \ndidn't enact the stimulus package, and unemployment has been nearly 10 \npercent for months. Well, yes, but there are a couple of possibilities. \nEither the stimulus package was a failure or the recession left by the \nBush administration was even worse than his advisers thought it was \nwhen President Obama said that.\n  When President Bush left office, we were bleeding jobs. We lost about \n800,000 jobs in that last month of the Bush administration, about \n750,000 the first month of President Obama's administration. We lost \n4.4 million jobs in Bush's final year in office. Yet with the Recovery \nAct, the President has been able to turn the economy around and \nimmediately stem the growing losses. The numbers of jobs lost got \nsmaller and smaller each month. This year we have had 5 straight months \nof growth, and we have created 882,000 net jobs this year. Does anybody \nsee a trend line?\n  Some may note this little negative bar at the end. That is primarily \nthe result of losing some temporary census jobs. But if we look at only \nthe private sector, we actually saw a net increase of jobs in June. \nImagine what this would look like without the Recovery Act. Last month, \nthe CBO estimated that the Recovery Act has increased the number of \npeople employed from 1.2 to 2.8 million. It is the view of many \neconomists that but for the Recovery Act we would have slipped into a \ndepression. In that case, our deficit would actually be a lot higher \nthan it is today because that is what happens during a depression.\n  Let's remember what was in the Recovery Act. Roughly one-third went \nto State governments, roughly one-third went to tax cuts for 95 percent \nof Americans, and roughly one-third went for infrastructure. Many of \nthese projects are now coming online.\n  I travel all over my State, and I talk to mayors and city planners \nand county commissioners--as I know the Presiding Officer does in his \nState of Alaska--and I talk to small business owners. Usually, I don't \nknow, nor do I particularly care, which political party they belong to. \nAlmost invariably they thank me for stimulus funds that financed the \nrepair of an aging wastewater plant or some officers or teachers or \nfunding for worker training or a home foreclosure counseling program \nthat prevented homes from going into foreclosure, saving their \ncommunities money. Yes, local and State Republican officeholders and \nsmall businessmen thank me for the Recovery Act, a lot, and I wasn't \neven here to vote for it. Still, they thank me. And you know what. \nAfter they thank me, they say: More. They ask for more.\n  We have an economic crisis on our hands. Congress should be making \ninvestments that provide the highest returns on investment that can be \nat the same time stimulative to our economy. Now is not the time to \nstop investing. Short-term shocks to the system will impair our \neconomic recovery. We should simultaneously be looking for long-term \nbudgetary solutions while continuing to invest in our recovering \neconomy. These are not incompatible. In fact, I believe it is necessary \nto do both.\n  If we don't, we risk seeing a repeat of what happened in 1937. Our \ncountry had been making great strides toward a full economic recovery. \nProduction was up, wages were up, unemployment had come down from over \n25 percent when Roosevelt took office to 14 percent in 1937. So after \nhis landslide election in 1936, President Roosevelt, upon the advice of \nhis Treasury Secretary, declared the depression over.\n  His Treasury Secretary, Henry Morganthau, was getting uneasy about \nthe long stream of deficits they had been running. To reverse course, \nthey cut Federal recovery program spending and raised taxes. This \ndecision proved to be premature. The economy's impressive growth rate \nof the previous 4 years--it grew 11 percent in 1934, 9 percent in 1935, \n13 percent in 1936, 5 percent in 1937--came to a screeching halt, and \nthe economy took another dive. The unemployment rolls increased by 5 \nmillion people, up to 19 percent. The economy shrank by 3.4 percent in \n1938, and the country's remaining economic indicators remained low \nuntil the beginning of World War II.\n  We shouldn't make the same mistake twice. We should continue \ninvesting in our future instead. But some colleagues are skeptical of \nthis approach and talk about the United States as if we were Greece.\n  Let me be clear: We are not Greece. If we were to take a look at \ninterest rates on the U.S. Treasury bonds, we would see that a 10-year \nTreasury bond is yielding just about 3 percent in interest. That is the \nmarket's pricing. If the market really thought U.S. Treasurys were \nrisky, the market would demand more than 3.09 percent interest on a 10-\nyear Treasury.\n  The market says we are not Greece. Yet the threat from taking some of \nthe measures Greece has recently taken is very real. Cutting back on \nspending now will jeopardize our economy and could push us into a \ndouble-dip recession. That would drive up unemployment even more, drive \nsmall businesses under, and stop us from growing out of the deficits we \nall want to eliminate.\n  Growing our economy is how we have come out of far worse deficits in \nthe past. At the end of World War II, our budget deficits had reached \nover 30 percent of our GDP, but we grew out of it. Today, it is just \nover 10 percent of our GDP. After World War II, the publicly held debt \nwas 109 percent of GDP, compared to OMB's projection that we will be at \n64 percent by the end of this year. We grew ourselves out of it, and we \ncan do it again.\n  Destimulating our economy at this fragile moment is simply not wise. \nDon't take my word for it. Burton Malkiel, a member of President Ford's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, said in 2003:\n\n       If there is any time in which one ought to have a deficit \n     it is a time where there is economic slack and a job market \n     that is not recovering.\n\n  Manuel Johnson, one of President Reagan's Assistant Treasury \nSecretaries, said he didn't think short-term deficits have much to do \nwith the economy's performance. And Reagan's Chief Economic Adviser, \nMartin Feldstein, who was also one of our most distinguished \nconservative academics, was one of the strongest voices for robust \nstimulus legislation last year.\n  Let's keep going. Michael Boskin, adviser to President George H.W. \nBush, said:\n\n       The notion that deficits are bad is way too narrow. \n     Deficits can be a serious problem over the medium and long \n     term. There are times it is good to see the deficit worsen or \n     the surplus turn into a deficit.\n\n  And he means those times--he means during an economic downturn.\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\n  The chair of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, \nGregory Mankiw, said:\n\n       It is a textbook principle of prudent fiscal policy that \n     deficits are an appropriate response in times of war and \n     recession.\n\n  Earlier, I mentioned one of Senator McCain's campaign advisers, Mark \nZandi. He said that it is typical to run large deficits during a \nrecession and the true problem is persistent large deficits.\n  To my colleagues who refuse to enact anything that adds a penny to \nthe deficit, what else can I say to convince you? Short-term deficits \nduring a recession are acceptable. In fact, many of the conservative \neconomists advising Republican Presidents or Presidential candidates \nhave said they are prudent and even good. When we distinguish between \nshort- and long-term deficits, we start to paint a very different \npicture.\n  I don't want anyone to hear me as saying we should just spend, spend, \nspend. Everyone agrees we are on a track that is unsustainable. Without \nsignificant changes to policy, the Center on Policy and Budget \nPriorities projects that our national debt could grow to 300 percent of \nGDP over the next 40 years. That is almost three times as large as the \npost-World War II level. The problem must be addressed with a careful, \nmeasured, and multifaceted approach, the same approach that balanced \nour budget just 10 years ago.\n  As you can see, here in 2000 we were running a surplus of $200 \nbillion and we were headed down the path to eliminating completely the \npublicly held debt. In fact, our debt could have been paid off today, \nby today, if no changes had been made to Federal spending policy. But \nPresident Bush and Congress did make changes when they took over in \n2001, such as passing massive tax cuts for the wealthy. As a result, \nour national debt more than doubled under President Bush.\n  In January 2009, when President Obama was just taking office, CBO \nestimated that he was left with a $1.2 trillion deficit for the fiscal \nyear and the residual effects of ill-advised economic policies.\n  Let's take a look at this chart which shows our current 10-year \nbudget outlook. As you can see, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities projects there will be five major contributors to the \ndeficit in 2019. The one that is obviously least under our control is \nthe economic downturn. It is the red. Then there are the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. That is the green. That proportion is pretty \nsubstantial. But here is this little blue, kind of turquois line. That \nlittle thing is the Recovery Act. This is legislation that is targeted \nover and over for being such a huge contributor to our deficit. This \nsliver is what so many of our colleagues complain about, that one. Most \nof its contribution to the deficit is clustered right here in the first \n2 years when the economy most needed a boost, but its longer term \nbudget effects are tiny when compared to its effectiveness in keeping \nus from falling into another Great Depression. And when compared to \nthis yellowish-orange block, the block responsible for over $7 trillion \nin debt over this 10-year period, these are the Bush-era tax cuts which \nwere passed without being paid for. This block is the result of an \nexperiment in economic theory. I think the record is clear that the \nexperiment failed. But no matter what you think of the effect of that \npolicy choice on our economy, you cannot deny the effect of that policy \nchoice on our deficit because here it is, in yellowish-orange.\n  So when my colleagues come down here to rail against the Recovery \nAct, to blame the Recovery Act for increasing the deficit, I guess it \ncan be technically accurate--a little bit of the blame, this much, \nmaybe a centimeter, that goes to the Recovery Act, even though it very \npossibly kept us from slipping into a second Great Depression, in which \ncase deficits would have been much larger. But I also want the American \npeople to have a sense of how much of the blame should go to the \nRecovery Act and how much of it belongs elsewhere, and I think you see \nit.\n  This chart gives you a good idea of where all the debt came from. As \nyou can see, the debt accelerates upward with President Reagan and \nPresident George H.W. Bush. It smooths out under Bill Clinton. And then \nit spikes, it skyrockets under George W. Bush, as I mentioned before. \nPresident Obama was left with a projected $1.2 trillion deficit in his \nfirst year in office. However, even though this massive debt was handed \nover to us by our last President, it does not diminish our \nresponsibility to address it.\n  I am glad to see that so many of my colleagues also appreciate the \nseriousness of this responsibility and some are proposing commonsense \nsolutions to bring these long-term deficits under control. We took a \nmajor step earlier this year by passing comprehensive health care \nreform. Health care costs were the No. 1 factor contributing to long-\nterm government deficits. The cost curve on those were out of control. \nUnder previous policies, the costs of Medicare and Medicaid would have \ngobbled up a third of the total Federal budget by 2030. But health care \nreform included reforms such as the value index that will finally \nprovide incentives for providing high-quality care at a lower cost, as \nwe do in Minnesota, instead of providing the most expensive care \npossible without regard to outcomes.\n\n  This legislation alone will have an enormous impact on the long-term \ndeficit. The CBO estimates it will bring down the deficit by $143 \nbillion in the first 10 years and even more in the following decade. \nThat is hundreds of billions of dollars, and that doesn't even include \nthe reduction of private costs to families that will result from the \nimprovements in the overall efficiency in our health care system. These \nare CBO numbers, the same CBO whose numbers I quoted earlier about the \nalarming size of projected future deficits if we take no action; the \nexact same alarming numbers my friends on the other side of the aisle \nquoted. They are quoting CBO. If you want to rely on those CBO numbers, \nthen CBO numbers are what we must rely on to score health reform.\n  I strongly support the health care reform bill we passed and am \noptimistic about the positive changes it will bring to the lives of \nmillions of Americans, including bringing down our deficit.\n  Let's look at our tax policy. As recently as 1980, the top bracket \nfor the very wealthy in this country was 70 percent, and for two \ndecades prior to that, the wealthiest Americans had income tax rates \nbetween 70 and 90-some percent. Today, it is 35 percent. These \ndeclining rates on the wealthiest Americans mean that more tax revenue \nis coming from middle-income earners. This is during a period when the \ngap between those at the top and those in the middle has grown \nsubstantially.\n  On top of that, we have allowed the estate tax to expire completely \nin 2010. This is a tax that affects less than one-half of 1 percent of \nall Americans. My colleagues across the aisle will argue that the \nestate tax punishes the most productive members of our society, the \nchildren of the extremely wealthy. This gift to our most fortunate sons \nand daughters cost the rest of us $14 billion this year alone. That tab \nfor that $14 billion in lost revenues from America's multimillionaires \nand billionaires will be passed to all of our kids--not just the $14 \nbillion but the interest on it as well.\n  I think Teddy Roosevelt put it the best. He said:\n\n       The man of great wealth owes a particular obligation to the \n     state because he derives special advantages from the mere \n     existence of government.\n\n  Those who want to eliminate the estate tax understandably don't put \nthe children of the incredibly wealthy in their campaign literature. \nInstead, they talk about family farmers, as if family farms have been \nlost to the estate tax. Yet according to the New York Times, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation was unable to name one family farm lost \nbecause of the estate tax.\n  Opponents of the tax insinuate that it is impossible to design a \npolicy that continues to protect the family farms that might be even \nslightly affected. Yet it is, of course, quite possible to do that. I \ncosponsored a reasonable approach to estate tax reform offered by \nSenator Sanders, Harkin, and Whitehouse. It retains the 2009 exemption \nlimits--$3.5 million per person and $7 million per couple--with a \nprogressive, tiered structure so that the ultrawealthy pay more. And, \nyes, it makes provisions for family farms.\n  This proposal will help ease the burden of middle-class families who \nare now expected to close the budget gap.\n\n[[Page S5840]]\n\n  Working families are also on the hook for the corporate welfare that \nis compounding the national debt. Our tax system is riddled with \nloopholes so corporations can escape liability by shifting operations \noverseas. In fact, corporations are often actually rewarded for sending \njobs overseas by our tax system. That has to stop.\n  There is something even more offensive. If BP is taken to court \nbecause of their negligence in this oilspill and a judge finds they owe \npunitive damages, those punitive damages can be deducted as a business \nexpense. Why do we allow these oil giants that earned hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in profits in the past decade to deduct punitive \ndamages from the taxes they should pay? And that is if they pay taxes \nat all. ExxonMobil did not pay any taxes last year. Despite its $45 \nbillion profit, it paid no income tax.\n  I do not bring this up to inspire anger at corporations. I bring it \nup because these loopholes and allowances create revenue shortfalls. \nRevenue shortfalls equal deficits, unless they are shifted onto the \nbacks of middle-class families.\n  But we would be remiss to go after these big oil companies without \nalso tackling our own spending problems. Secretary Gates has led the \nway in explaining how we can, and must, achieve savings in the defense \nbudget. While nothing is more important than the defense of our Nation, \nnational security is not well-served by unnecessary, incredibly \nexpensive weapons programs. Nor are we well-served by programs that \ncome in late, and way over budget.\n  Secretary of Defense Gates recently quoted his predecessor, Secretary \nRumsfeld, who said it best: ``A person employed in a redundant task is \none who could be countering terrorism or nuclear proliferation. Every \ndollar squandered on waste is one denied to the warfighter.'' That was \nSecretary Rumsfeld on September 10, 2001.\n  Our national security priorities must be matched to our real defense \npriorities in the 21 century, not dictated by expensive weapons systems \nthat are only benefiting the bottom line of big defense contractors.\n  These are all things that we can do to bring down long-term deficits.\n  We urgently need bipartisan solutions. One idea that I have \nsupported, a deficit reduction commission, was proposed by Senators \nConrad and Gregg. This commission would make recommendations that would \nthen come up for an up-or-down vote by Congress. That proposal failed, \ndespite its broad bipartisan support. The commission was ultimately \nsupported by more on this side of the aisle than by those across it, \nincluding those who cosponsored the original bill and then voted \nagainst it when it came up as an amendment. I am curious what changes \ncould be made to such a proposal for it to attract more support. I \nwelcome working with my colleagues across the aisle to find such an \napproach.\n  We are all agreed that the current path forward is unsustainable. But \nwe differ on what changes need to be made. It is economically unsound, \nand potentially dangerous, to require that all spending be offset while \nwe are still recovering from a recession, reeling from nearly 10 \npercent unemployment rates, and looking for ways to temper the jobs \ndeficit of 12 million workers.\n  We are putting our economy back at risk just when it is finally \nturning a corner. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has \nwarned that the upcoming phase-out of Recovery Act spending and State \nand local spending cutbacks are likely to exert further downward \npressure on the economy.\n  Our working and middle classes are still struggling, and they \ncontinue to need our help. We can help them by extending unemployment \ninsurance and COBRA subsidies for those who lost a job through no fault \nof their own. We can retain vital nutrition assistance programs in the \nRecovery Act to make sure kids do not go hungry. And we can make \ninvestments in renewing our Nation's infrastructure.\n  These are not government hand-outs, these are the most effective ways \nto get our economy going again and contributing to our economic \nrecovery. Without these measures, we risk slipping back into a \nrecession. And as I have noted, recessions directly contribute to long-\nterm deficits.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join with me in standing up to the \nrhetoric that all spending is created equal. I encourage my colleagues \nto show compassion toward those still out of work. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support spending programs that will help us emerge from \nthis downturn. And I encourage my colleagues to join forces in coming \nup with new ways to tackle our long-term deficits because they matter.\n  We face enormous economic problems: the short-term economic crisis \nand the long-term deficit. But we also face a seemingly intractable \npolitical problem. As long as this body refuses to face up to the \nsimple facts about where our deficits came from and what we need to do \nto solve them, as long as we turn a blind eye to the simple facts about \nwhat will get us out of this major downturn we will be unable to reach \nthe solutions demanded by these problems and deserved by the American \npeople.\n  Simply put, if we do not face facts, we can not do our jobs. And that \nwould leave this country in serious trouble.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5840-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5840-S5842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, roughly 2 years ago, our Nation suffered a \ncatastrophe. It was not a hurricane or an earthquake. It was no act of \nGod. It was a man-made disaster, manufactured in the boiler rooms of \nunscrupulous mortgage lenders and the offices of pay-for-hire credit \nrating agencies, in the headquarters of sluggish regulators, and then \nvastly expanded in its negative impact in the boardrooms of Wall Street \nfinancial firms.\n  The financial crisis they all helped create has cost millions of \nAmericans their jobs, their homes, and their financial security. It has \nendangered businesses large and small. It continues to weigh down our \neconomy today. It required trillions of dollars of government aid just \nto keep the crisis from sliding into a depression.\n  Addressing the causes of this crisis, in an effort to ensure that it \nis not repeated, is our very serious obligation. We now have before us, \nmonths in the making, something that constitutes our best efforts to \ncarry out that obligation. The legislation before us contains many \nimportant provisions.\n  But it is, in sum, an attempt to build a firewall between the worst \nhigh-risk excesses of Wall Street on the one hand and the jobs and \nhomes and futures of ordinary Americans on the other. I strongly \nsupport the Dodd-Frank bill and encourage our colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Senator Dodd spoke at some length a few minutes ago about this bill. \nHe said that he cannot legislate integrity, wisdom, passion, or \ncompetency. That is surely true. But without Senator Dodd's integrity, \nwisdom, passion, and competency, we would not be where we are today, on \nthe threshold of making a generationally important reform of the \nfinancial community.\n  Senator Dodd made reference to the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, and the investigations which we held into the financial \ncrisis. I have seen up close and personal and in detail the worst of \nthose excesses. Our colleagues on the subcommittee, including my \nranking member, Senator Coburn, my very active member on that \nsubcommittee, Senator Kaufman, and others, we saw these excesses in \nfour different hearings.\n  For over almost a year and a half, our subcommittee devoted our \nresources to examining some of the causes and consequences of the \nfinancial crisis. We issued dozens of subpoenas. We examined millions \nof pages of documents. We conducted over 100 interviews. We took more \nthan 30 hours of testimony during those four public hearings.\n  Those hearings focused on the practices of risky mortgage lenders, \nusing Washington Mutual, WaMu, as a case history. We focused in the \nsecond hearing on the failures of the regulators to rein in WaMu's \nrisky practices, in a third hearing on the inaccurate risk assessments \nof credit rating agencies, and then in the fourth hearing on the \negregious practices of some Wall Street investment banks using, as a \ncase history, Goldman Sachs.\n  In each of those hearings, we learned important facts about how the \nfinancial industry and those tasked with\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\noverseeing it failed in their obligations, plunging the Nation into \ncrisis and a deep recession. I want to set out how the legislation \nbefore us addresses many of the lessons we learned in the \nsubcommittee's investigation.\n  Our hearings began with a case study of Washington Mutual Bank, a \n$300 billion Seattle-based thrift, that, thanks to its reckless \nlending, became the largest bank failure in America's history. In the \npursuit of higher and higher profits, WaMu's management turned its \nfocus from traditional mortgage lending to high-risk subprime and \nadjustable-rate mortgage loans.\n  In doing so, it engaged in practices that endangered the bank, its \nborrowers, and the economy at large. It sold loans to borrowers that it \nknew or should have known would be unable to repay. It paid its \nsalespeople more if they sold higher risk loans, with higher interest \nrates or other terms that made them more difficult to repay.\n  Internal audits repeatedly found high levels of fraud and abuse in \nthe bank's loans. But business continued as usual. WaMu then dumped \nthese risky loans into the financial system, selling them or packaging \nthem into mortgage-backed securities that Wall Street eagerly scooped \nup, flooding the stream of commerce with toxic assets like a polluter \ndumping poison into a river.\n  WaMu collapsed in 2008, leaving behind a trail of shattered \nhomeowners and investors. Its case history was emblematic of a whole \nhost of irresponsible mortgage lenders that loaded up our mortgage \nmarkets with toxic securities.\n  The legislation before us does much to address these problems. A \nconsumer financial protection bureau will bring new scrutiny to the \npractices of financial companies, providing important oversight that \ncan end the kind of abusive and even fraudulent practices used by WaMu \nand other mortgage lenders.\n  Other provisions will require those who create mortgage-backed \nsecurities, such as WaMu, and the investment banks it used, to retain a \nportion of the risk of securities that are backed by those high-risk \nloans, such as subprime mortgages or option ARMs so that securitizers \nwill not be able to offload all that risk onto the market and walk away \nfrom the losses that occur down the road.\n  Still another set of provisions in this bill ban so-called liar \nloans, which allowed WaMu and others to sell loans without any \ndocumentation of a borrower's income or ability to repay.\n  The bill also prohibits the practice of paying salespeople more for \ngouging homeowners with higher rates or other terms that make loans \nharder to repay. Each of those reforms addresses critical problems \nexposed in our subcommittee's hearings, which helped to build the \nlegislative history supporting the need for this bill.\n  Most of the reforms also require implementing regulations. I hope \nthat those writing the regulations will pay heed to the problems \nuncovered in our hearings and take the steps needed to protect our \nmortgage markets from future abuses.\n  WaMu might not have been able to engage in its worst practices for as \nlong as it did had it been confronted by Federal regulators. Instead, \nour investigation found that the Office of Thrift Supervision, WaMu's \nprimary regulators, was more a lapdog than a watchdog. Repeatedly its \nexaminers identified enormous problems with the bank's lending and \nsecuritization operation. Yet higher-ups in the Office of Thrift \nSupervision failed to take appropriate action. When the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation sought to address the obvious problems in WaMu, \nthe Office of Thrift Supervision, OTS, erected roadblocks that \nprevented action.\n  Documents show that the head of OTS referred to Washington Mutual as \ntheir agency's constituent, perhaps reflecting an awareness that the \ncountry's largest thrift was also the OTS's largest single source of \nfunding.\n  I am also afraid that comment calling Washington Mutual a constituent \nof its regulatory agency also ignored the obligation that should result \nfrom an agency being a fiduciary whose constituents are not the people \nthey regulate but are the people of the United States of America.\n  Clearly, OTS has outlived its usefulness, and the legislation before \nus dissolves the OTS. In addition, a new Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil will have broad authority to monitor individual financial \ninstitutions as well as the system at large to catch problem \ninstitutions such as WaMu and problematic practices such as high risk \nlending before they endanger the financial system as a whole.\n  Credit-rating agencies also failed their essential role in this \ncrisis. Our investigation found these agencies, which supposedly supply \nexpert and objective analysis of credit risk, used faulty risk models \nand assigned super-safe AAA ratings to products later revealed to be \nlittle better than junk. Paid by the Wall Street firms whose products \nthey were supposed to objectively assess, they sought market share by \nworking with these firms to ensure the high ratings needed to sell \nrisky products to risk-averse investors such as pension funds and \nuniversity endowments. They failed to account for overwhelming evidence \nthat fraud was a major factor in a growing number of mortgage loans.\n  The Dodd-Frank bill sets up a new office in the Securities and \nExchange Commission to oversee and examine the work of the credit-\nrating agencies. I pay tribute, by the way, to Senator Franken for the \nwork he did in this area in the amendment he offered to the Senate. The \nDodd-Frank bill requires the agencies to disclose their methodology and \ntheir track records. It allows investors to file private causes of \naction against such agencies that fail to thoroughly investigate \nproducts they rate.\n  The bill also tasks the SEC with examining the clear conflict of \ninterest involved in Wall Street firms shopping for the highest rating \namong the various rating agencies. I am hopeful, at the end of the \nstudy, the SEC will adopt the approach taken in the Franken amendment \nthat won bipartisan support in the Senate, and establish an \nintermediary that will separate the credit-rating firms from the \ninvestment banks that press them for high ratings in return for \nlucrative compensation. As part of their work, I hope the SEC will take \nan in-depth look at the documents and testimony in our subcommittee \nhearings that laid bear the conflicts of interest that undermine the \naccuracy of credit ratings.\n  Wall Street investment banks also played the major role in the \ncrisis. Seeking ever higher profits, they aggressively marketed the \nmortgage-backed securities and exotic derivatives tied to the mortgage \nmarket that were at the heart of the crisis. Increasingly, those banks \ndrew their profits not from helping client investors prosper but by \ntrading for their own accounts, often in direct conflict with their \nclients' interests. Internal e-mails that the subcommittee disclosed \nshowed Goldman Sachs repeatedly marketed mortgage-related financial \ninstruments that it created and knew to be faulty, junk, and worse. \nAfter it did so, it then made the large bets against those very same \ninstruments. Our investigation also showed Goldman Sachs made a large \nbet that the mortgage market as a whole was headed down, a bet it \ndenies to this very day that it made, despite a mountain of evidence \ncontained in the firm's own documents that it did so.\n  With Senator Merkley, I worked to address the outrageous conflicts of \ninterest revealed in our hearings on investment banks. The Dodd-Frank \nbill makes important progress on this front. It sharply limits the \nrisky proprietary trading that Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street \nfirms used to rack up enormous profits while endangering the stability \nof the financial system.\n  While I wish the bill was more forceful in limiting these risky \ntrades, especially in terms of limiting financial firm investments in \nhedge funds and private equity funds, the language in this bill will \nadd substantial strength to the stability of the financial system.\n  In addition, the bill includes language to end the conflicts of \ninterest revealed in our investigation of Goldman Sachs. No longer will \nfinancial firms be able to package and sell asset-backed products to \ninvestors and then bet against those same products. Those conflicts of \ninterest will end, unless the regulators water down our strong language \nwith weak enforcement.\n  The Dodd-Frank bill contains other much needed measures as well. It \nwill\n\n[[Page S5842]]\n\nbring new transparency and accountability to the shadowy market in \nderivatives. It will protect taxpayers from the need to engage in the \nkind of multibillion-dollar bailouts required in the current crisis by \nallowing for an orderly resolution of failing financial firms. It \nempowers regulators to establish tough new capital requirements that \nmake it harder for firms to become so big they endanger the stability \nof the system. It requires hedge funds to register with the SEC and \nprovide information about their once-hidden operations. It also \nstrengthens the process for shareholders to select corporate directors \nand to limit excessive executive pay.\n  We have seen all too clearly the consequences of lax regulation and \ntepid oversight, the consequences of assuming that Wall Street can \npolice itself. That attitude has put millions of Americans in \nunemployment lines, has plastered foreclosure signs on millions of \nAmerican homes, and has pumped billions of dollars of taxpayer money \ninto Wall Street firms that happily profited from their risky bets and \nthen leaned on the rest of us to bail them out when the bill came due.\n  I say to those colleagues who are considering voting against this \nbill: Knowing what our investigation and others have discovered, how \ncan you oppose this effort to erect a wall between Wall Street's never-\nending appetite for reckless risk and the rest of the American economy?\n  It is time to put the cop back on the beat on Wall Street. It is time \nto end Wall Street's ``heads we win, tails you lose'' game. It is time \nto prevent as best we can the next manmade disaster threatening our \njobs, our homes, and our businesses. It is time to pass this major \nfinancial reform legislation, and I hope we will see a strong vote for \nit in the day ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5842-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5842-S5843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN TRIP\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

In Afghanistan, we met in Kabul \nwith General Petraeus, with Ambassador Eikenberry, with President \nKarzai, with many of his ministers.\n  Then, in Afghanistan, we traveled to Kandahar Province, where we met \nwith General Carter, who is the commander of the ISAF forces, the \nKandahar Governor and the city mayor of Kandahar. Then we met with the \ncommander of the Afghan Army's 205th Corps, Major General Zazai.\n  One of the key things we saw, and something which is critically \nimportant to the success of this mission in Afghanistan, is that the \nAfghan Army be strengthened, take responsibility, primarily, for the \nsecurity of the country, and lead operations which are joint operations \nbetween the Afghan Army and the coalition forces, including American \nforces.\n  That will be dramatized, that movement towards the shift of \nresponsibility to the Afghans, where it belongs. A dramatic moment is \ngoing to take place later in July or early in August when, in a major \noperation in the area around Kandahar city, right in the heart of \nTaliban country, there is going to be a large number of forces that are \nAfghan forces, a large number of American forces, and from other \ncountries, and it will be the Afghans who will be in the lead in that \noperation.\n  This is the Taliban's worst nightmare: facing an Afghan-led force \nthat is going to clear them from control of the area. The Afghan people \ndetest the Taliban, and they respect their own army. And our major goal \nand mission should be to build up that army, strengthen it sizewise and \nwith equipment and training so it can take major security \nresponsibility for that country. This is the path to success in \nAfghanistan.\n  Again, because of this planned operation, which is now announced, and \nbecause of a number of other steps which have been taken--a very \nsignificant number of positive steps in the last 6 months--I have some \nconfidence we are on the way to a successful outcome in Afghanistan.\n  Afghanistan has made progress in a number of ways since my visit \nthere in January.\n  The progress I refer to is toward the key goal of preventing \nAfghanistan from being dominated by a Taliban organization that would \nonce again provide a haven for the international terrorist movement, \nal-Qaida.\n  To achieve that goal, Afghanistan must be able to take principal \nresponsibility for its own security. We and other outsiders cannot \nsecure Afghanistan, but we can help the Afghan security forces do so.\n  The building blocks to achieve that goal are present. The Afghan \nNational Army, ANA, is respected by the people and the Taliban is \ndespised and feared because of the terror they spread and threaten.\n  A capable, strong, large Afghan Army is the Taliban's worst nightmare \nbecause it means that the Taliban's propaganda that foreigners seek to \ndominate Afghanistan rings hollow. This is particularly true when \nAfghan troops are in the lead in joint operations with the troops of \nISAF.\n  That is why I believed we should have focused on training and \nequipping the ANA, why we should have sent in trainers and mentors \ninstead of sending in more combat troops. That is why when President \nObama decided to send in 30,000 more U.S. troops, I strongly supported \nthe decision to begin to reduce those troops in July of 2011. That date \nis the action-driving mechanism to demonstrate to the Afghans the \nurgency of acting to get their army up to the size and capability where \nthey can succeed in the mission so vital to them and to us--securing \ntheir country against the Taliban.\n  A number of steps have been taken in the last 6 months toward \nachieving that goal.\n  First, recruitment for the ANA is up, partly because, according to \nGeneral Caldwell, who leads the ISAF training mission, the announcement \nof the July 2011 date last December incentivized the Afghan leaders to \nact to stimulate recruitment.\n  Second, the Afghan army has grown very quickly, exceeding the goals. \nLast December the army had 100,000 men; by May the number was 125,000; \nand Minister of Defense Wardak said he expects to announce that the end \nof September 2010 goal of 134,000 will be met by the time of the Kabul \nconference in late July.\n  Third, the ratio of ISAF forces to Afghan forces is improving in \nterms of Afghans becoming numerically dominant. When I was with our \nmarines in Helmand Province in January, there were two or three marines \nfor each Afghan soldier. In Kandahar Province, where Senator Reed and I \nvisited last week, the ratio is about one to one and by September it \nwill be predominantly Afghan.\n  Fourth, the partnering in the field between the ANA and ISAF is real. \nEvery Afghan unit from battalion down to company level is now planning \nand operating together with ISAF units. This has the twin benefits of \ntraining Afghan troops and having the Afghan people see that it is \ntheir respected army that they want to provide the security which is \ndoing that, rather than foreign troops which have less understanding of \ntheir culture and will someday leave.\n  Fifth, and central to the success of the mission of Afghans being \nprincipal providers of security, is the fact that Afghan troops are \nmore and more in the lead in joint operations. A highly significant \nevent will take place at the end of July and early August. A major \njoint ANA-ISAF operation will move into the Taliban heartland of the \nArghandab Valley, just west of Kandahar city. Approximately 10,000 \ntroops--the Afghan 205th Corps with 5,160 soldiers and ISAF with 4,430 \nsoldiers--will clear the area of insurgents.\n\n  The planning is complete and the orders signed. It is a major, \nincredibly important effort and, of great significance, the Afghans \nwill be in the lead.\n  The significance of this will not be lost on the Afghan people, nor \non the Taliban.\n  Kandahar Province is where the Taliban movement was born. Months of \neffort have been extended to ``shape'' the upcoming effort. The city of \nKandahar and its environs are being secured at the cost of many lives--\nboth Afghan and coalition forces--so as to\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\nprevent additional insurgents from reinforcing the Arghandab region.\n  This will not be just a clearing operation.\n  It will be a clear and hold operation, with Afghan National Police, \nANP, and the Afghan National Civil Order Police, ANCOP, doing the \nholding with the Afghan National Army and coalition military police.\n  As the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Conway, said:\n\n       To have American Marines standing on a corner in a key \n     village isn't nearly as effective as having an Afghan \n     policeman or Afghan soldier.\n\n  The key to success of a counterinsurgency effort, which is aimed at \nprotecting the people, is winning the support of those people. A \nsignificant sign of progress in this respect is that the tips needed \nabout the whereabouts of the Taliban, so essential to defeating them, \nare coming into the coalition in vastly increasing numbers. An ISAF \nStrategic Assessment report indicates that there has been increased \nreporting by local Afghans on the locations of IEDs and weapons caches, \nresulting in a higher ratio of finds/turn-ins to explosions.\n  Sixth, the equipping of the Afghan Army is beginning to happen. We \nauthorized the transfer of equipment from Iraq to Afghanistan for the \nANA instead of bringing all that equipment back to the United States. \nWe learned that 800 of 1,600 up-armored humvees have arrived in \nAfghanistan and the rest will soon arrive.\n  There are other reasons for optimism. We met with the Governor of \nKandahar Province and the mayor of the city of Kandahar. Their \noutspoken opposition to the Taliban and the warlords who have been in \npower and who recently assassinated the District Governor of Arghandab \nremains strong and resolute.\n  Those are some of the signs of progress, but it has come at great \ncost. We have lost almost 1,200 of our brave troops in Afghanistan, and \nmany times that number wounded. The cost to our treasure has been high. \nThe months ahead will see more casualties, almost all inflicted by \nIEDs. The strain on our extraordinary troops and their families and on \nthe U.S. civilians in Afghanistan is great. Despite the stress, their \nmorale is high, and regardless of whether one agrees with the mission \nin Afghanistan, those men and women deserve a tribute from all \nAmericans. We stand in awe of them.\n  There are also significant threats to the Afghan mission.\n  The first threat emanates from Pakistan. While Pakistan has taken \nsteps relatively recently to take on some terrorist groups, and has \ndone so at a real cost to the Pakistan Army, they have not taken on a \nnumber of groups that use Pakistan as a safe haven, crossing the border \ninto Afghanistan to attack Afghan and ISAF forces, or supplying and \nsupporting those attacks and then returning to the Pakistan safe haven.\n  Two of those groups are the Haqqani network in the North Waziristan \narea of the federally administered tribal area, FATA, across the border \nfrom eastern Afghanistan, and the home of the Afghan Taliban in Quetta, \njust across the border from Kandahar.\n  The State Department maintains a list of foreign terrorist groups. \nThe State Department has said it is currently considering adding the \nPakistani Taliban to that list. In my view, the Haqqani network has \nalso long belonged on that list. We would not tolerate such groups \nattacking us from a neighboring country. Pakistan's failure to attack \nthem, knowing full well, as they do, the location of their headquarters \nin Miranshah and Quetta, is also intolerable.\n  A second threat to the success of our Afghan mission is the failure \nof the Afghan Government to provide noncorrupt, effective government to \ntheir people. This has been the subject of much concern. President \nKarzai's administration and international action on the civilian \ngovernment side are beginning to stir into long overdue action.\n  The number of U.S. Government civilians in Afghanistan has tripled \nsince 2009, with a greater percentage in the field outside Kabul.\n  A third threat to the success of the Afghan mission is the \nundiminished power of warlords and power brokers and the so-called \nprivate security contractors, paid with U.S. taxpayer dollars, who are \nengaged in bribes and perverse, blatant racketeering and rip-offs.\n  General Rodriguez, commander, International Security Assistance Force \nJoint Command and deputy commander, United States Forces--Afghanistan, \nis determined to protect our convoys from the warlords and their thugs \nwho extort fees for safe passage and often collaborate with the Taliban \nto create the very threat of insecurity they presumably are hired to \nguard against.\n  The Afghan people hate and live in fear of the power brokers and \nwarlords.\n  They corrupt the local police and are one reason why there is little \npublic confidence in the local police.\n  Training of more and better local police and the expansion of the \nAfghan Civil Order Police, ANCOP, are hopeful signs. But the \ncombination of warlords and power brokers operating in effective league \nwith private security contractors, the Taliban, and an often corrupted \nlocal police, remain a significant threat to the Afghan mission's \nsuccess.\n  The role of Afghan private security contractors, who often have \ndevastating connections to our enemies and who rip off American tax \npayers, and who are facilitated by the failures of U.S. contractors to \nadequately vet and oversee their activities, will be the subject of a \nforthcoming report of a Senate Armed Services investigation.\n  Fourth, because success of the Afghan mission depends, probably more \nthan anything else, on the rapid growth and capability of the one \nnationally respected institution, the ANA, the continuing failure of \nNATO allies to fill the shortfall of perhaps 2,000 trainers for \npartnering in the field with Afghan Army and police, so-called \noperational mentoring and liaison teams, OMLTs, and police operational \nmentoring and liaison teams, POMLTs, is inexcusable.\n  Many of our allies, notably the Brits, Canadians, Australians, Poles, \nDanes, and Georgians have been most admirable in their efforts. But too \nmany NATO allies have failed to make commitments or carry out \ncommitments so important to the success of the first NATO out-of-area \ncombat mission. Continuing pressure on the laggard allies shouldn't be \nneeded--but it is.\n  The success of the Afghan mission ultimately depends on a political \nsettlement. An approach to the reintegration of those lower level \ninsurgents who can be reintegrated, and the reconciliation with those \ngroups that are not irreconcilable, is underway. The Afghan Government \nis leading that effort also, as, of course, it must. While our views \nand experiences in this regard are surely relevant, a brilliant British \ngeneral leading the ISAF effort in Kandahar reminded us of what T.E. \nLawrence said to the British over 100 years ago in a similar situation \nin a place that is not too far distant from Afghanistan:\n\n       Do not try to do much with your own hands. Better (they) do \n     it tolerably than you do it perfectly. It is their war and \n     you are to help them, not to win it for them. Actually, also, \n     under the very odd conditions (there), your practical work \n     will not be as good as, perhaps, you think it is.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BYRD\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of one \nof the Senate's giants, Robert C. Byrd. My family and I were saddened \nto learn of his passing on Monday morning at the age of 92. I will \nremember Senator Byrd as a fierce defender of the Constitution, master \nof Senate procedure and a proud fighter for West Virginia and its rural \nheritage. Senator Byrd was more than just a colleague, he was a mentor. \nHe taught me--and everyone who had the honor of serving with him--never \nto apologize for standing up for your State.\n  During more than a half century of service in Congress, Senator Byrd \ngave a voice to those who would not have been heard otherwise. There \nare times when it is easy to get caught up in the petty bickering and \npartisan squabbles that seem to be increasingly plaguing this chamber. \nBut, we would all do well to follow the example Senator Byrd set for \nall of us during his legendary Senate career and never lose sight of \nthe fact that we are sent here to fight for those in our home States \nand across the country who cannot fight for themselves.\n  Senator Byrd's work on behalf of his constituents is well known. West \nVirginians knew they could count on their senior Senator to come here \nto Washington and deliver for them. They were not alone. I will never \nforget how helpful Senator Byrd was to my State. Louisiana lost a true \nfriend. Through storms and floods, Senator Byrd made sure that promises \nmade to the gulf coast, particularly to Louisiana, were not broken. He \nkept an eye on the fair and just distribution of funds to Gulf Coast \nStates, and I and everyone I represent will always be grateful for his \ndedication to our recovery.\n  One critical example is his effort to provide funding for Louisiana's \nRoad Home program. Road Home, which is the largest single housing \nrecovery program in U.S. history, was designed to provide compensation \nto Louisiana homeowners whose houses were destroyed by Hurricane \nKatrina or Rita. In late 2007, as Louisiana faced a daunting program \nshortfall, it was Senator Byrd who stepped up to help me secure $3 \nbillion to keep this rebuilding program going.\n  A year later, Senator Byrd once again stood up for the people of \nLouisiana, when he worked with me to include $8.7 billion for gulf \ncoast hurricane recovery and protection in the emergency supplemental \nspending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan. The funding provided for \nlevees, criminal justice needs, health care and housing for low-income \nhurricane survivors.\n  Senator Byrd once said, ``The people of Louisiana have the strength \nand the spirit to rebuild their homes and their communities. We owe \nthem the support to get the job done.'' He did not just pay lipservice \nto the gulf coast. He delivered for us time and again, because he \nunderstood the importance of standing up for those who were hit so hard \nby the tragic storms that battered the Louisiana coast.\n  Senator Byrd was not just a colleague who put his weight behind \nfighting for the gulf coast region. He was also a walking encyclopedia \nof Senate history, and he was always willing to impart his vast \nknowledge to anyone who wanted to learn about the legends that walked \nthese halls for more than two centuries before us.\n  When I was first sworn in as a U.S. Senator, back in 1997, my entire \nfamily came to Washington for the event. After it was over, I asked \nSenator Byrd if he would give my family--both adults and children--a \nhistory lesson on the Senate. He graciously obliged, and for 2 full \nhours spoke eloquently and expertly on the history of this great body. \nHis lecture left a lasting impression on every single member of the \nLandrieu family, and it is a memory we will always cherish.\n  Senator Byrd spoke with such passion about John C. Calhoun, Henry \nClay, Daniel Webster, Rebecca Felton, Everett Dirksen and the many \nother historical figures who shaped the Senate. It is only appropriate \nthat he will forever be mentioned in the same breath with these men and \nwomen he so truly admired. And, it makes me proud to have had the \nopportunity to serve with a man who left such an indelible mark on this \nChamber.\n  As we reflect on Senator Byrd's remarkable life and career, our \nprayers are with the Byrd family. But we all take comfort in knowing \nthat while he leaves behind one of his great loves--the Senate--he is \nfinally going home to be with his greatest love--Erma.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Pete Domenici from New Mexico \nserved in this body for 36 years. During that time, he was the first \nRepublican chairman of the Budget Committee and later chaired the \nEnergy Committee where, more than almost anyone, he helped spur the \nrevival of interest in nuclear energy. He was truly one of the most \nconsequential senators of the last half century. As we mourn the loss \nof another very consequential Member of this Chamber, Senator Robert \nByrd of West Virginia, I thought it was appropriate to share Senator \nDomenici's thoughts on the passing of Senator Byrd.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici's statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Senator Pete Domenici on the Passing of Senator Robert C. \n                                  Byrd\n\n       I'm sorry I can't be at Senator Robert Byrd's memorial \n     service in person because I'm celebrating the first family \n     reunion with my eight children--and their children--from \n     across the country. My wife will join me at this event, and I \n     will be prevented from attending the ceremony for my great \n     friend, Robert Byrd.\n       I worked with Senator Byrd for my entire 36 years in the \n     Senate. Above all else, I found him a man that one could \n     trust implicitly. He and I both served on the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee for many years, where he was a \n     strong advocate for his home state. He and I both supported \n     local projects for our states and believed that `earmarks' \n     were not only legitimate, but part of the Senator's duty to \n     his state.\n       When history is finally written of the United States Senate \n     there is little doubt in my mind that he will go down as one \n     of the greatest of all. He knew the rules and he played by \n     them. He knew the issues and he fought for them. He \n     understood America's greatness and he heralded it. But most \n     of all, he seemed to always remember the working men and \n     women of his state and this country. He will be missed. I \n     must say thank you, Robert, for your friendship and all you \n     did for me and all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5844-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5844-S5845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my opposition \nto the Restoring American Financial Stability Act. When the Senate \nfirst passed the bill in May, I opposed it and explained my reasons for \ndoing so. At that time I hoped the House and Senate would make some \nchanges to the bill during the conference committee to address the root \ncauses of the financial crisis as well as scale back the overreaching \npowers granted to the new consumer protection bureau. Unfortunately, \nneither of these changes occurred, and I still believe the bill largely \nignores the glaring, fundamental problems that led to our current \nfiscal catastrophe while increasing regulatory burdens on business when \nthe economy is still struggling to recover. In addition, as Fareed \nZakaria recently noted, the uncertainty created by this and other \nexpansive legislation, such as health care reform and potentially cap \nand trade, is causing many businesses to refrain from new investments \nuntil they can understand the full implications of these measures.\n  As for this legislation, it is now clear that over the past decade or \nso, specific factors played a critical role in leading our Nation into \nthe financial crisis that first arrested the credit markets in 2007, \nleading to the collapse of some of our largest financial services firms \nand a stock market crash in late 2008. The resulting events produced a \nwidespread foreclosure crisis and a devastating recession with massive \njob loss and sustained record unemployment, all of which continue to be \nfelt by families throughout Ohio and the Nation. In response, Congress \nhas taken up legislation that purports to correct what went wrong and \nrestore safety, soundness, and stability to our financial markets to \nfoster recovery and fortify the foundation for a strong economy.\n  Why, then, do I oppose the passage of this legislation? Simply put, \nbecause it\n\n[[Page S5845]]\n\ndoes not get the job done. This legislation fails to address the causes \nof the financial crisis, while overreaching in its expanded regulation \nof businesses, large and small, throughout the economy. I voted to \nbring the bill to the Senate floor because I believed the American \npeople wanted us to debate the issues that caused the financial \ncollapse and bring forth legislation that would work to minimize the \npossibility of a future collapse, but this bill fails in too many \nrespects.\n  First, the bill fails to address two primary causes of the financial \nmeltdown, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose push to acquire subprime \nmortgages--spurred by Congress--helped produce a real estate bubble \nthat burst and sent shockwaves across global financial markets, forcing \nthe U.S. economy and other global economies into a tailspin. These now-\ngovernment-owned institutions, which failed in the midst of the \nfinancial crisis, continue to drain taxpayers for billions of dollars. \nIn May, Fannie and Freddie requested an additional $19 billion of \ntaxpayer moneys to fund operations, bringing the total government \nassistance to roughly $145 billion, or an average of $7.6 billion per \nmonth. Moreover, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently \nestimated that over the next decade, Fannie and Freddie could cost \ntaxpayers almost $400 billion. Yet these two giant, systemically risky \ninstitutions--whose bailouts far outsize any of those given to other \nfinancial institutions--are ignored in this legislation.\n  Second, at the heart of this financial crisis were residential home \nloans written to borrowers who did not have the ability to pay their \nmortgages. When these borrowers defaulted on a massive scale, \nwidespread investment securities based on their mortgages lost \nsignificant value, sending investors panicking and retreating while \nportfolios collapsed and credit froze. These loans were made in large \npart because of poor underwriting standards and a failure by many \nlenders and brokers to ensure that buyers had the means to repay their \nloans. During the Senate debate on this legislation, my colleague, \nSenator Bob Corker, offered a commonsense amendment to establish sound \nunderwriting standards, including a minimum down payment, full \ndocumentation, and proof of income and ability of the borrower to pay \nthe mortgage. Amazingly, my colleagues rejected this amendment, and \nthus virtually nothing in this legislation addresses this problem.\n  Third, the new consumer protection bureau created by this bill is too \nwide in its regulatory scope, and I believe it will saddle businesses \nwith new, often unnecessary burdens. The bureau is granted authority to \nreach its tentacles like an octopus into various sectors of the \neconomy, and pull businesses that were not part of the problem--\nincluding retailers, medical providers such as dentists, lawyers, \nadvertising agencies, and even nonprofits--under new government \nregulation. Attempts by some of my colleagues to curtail the largely \nunchecked reach of this new regulator were mostly rejected.\n  Finally, new regulations related to over-the-counter derivatives fail \nto adequately protect businesses across Ohio and other States that use \nthese risk management tools. I have heard from many businesses \nconcerned that they could be forced to divert capital away from job-\ncreating investments as a result of new clearing procedures in the \nlegislation. They also complain that they may now be forced to use less \ncustomized derivative products, which would result in more--rather than \nless--risk. As businesses sideline more capital, they become less \nliquid; as they face more risk, they become less creditworthy, and in \nturn have less access to credit. I am fearful that these new regulatory \nburdens will serve primarily to slow any eventual economic recovery \nrather than address the underlying causes of the financial collapse. \nFor example, uncertainty over these potential effects has created \nwidespread concern among farmers in particular, who had nothing to do \nwith the financial meltdown but could face consequences under the \nlegislation.\n  In sum, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act fails to \naddress the root causes of the problem and overreaches in its \nregulation. I am disappointed these concerns were not resolved during \nthe conference committee, and thus I will not support the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5845-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5845-S5846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL MICHAEL P.

His superb leadership and strong \npersonal engagement strengthened relationships within local, State and \nFederal partnerships.\n  During his tenure as district commander, Colonel Crall superbly \nmanaged an annual operating budget in excess of $200 million which \nfunded the planning, engineering, construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of the Pittsburgh district's 23 locks and dams, and 16 \nreservoirs covering 26,000 square miles in a five-State area.\n  Colonel Crall's implementation of funding provided to the district \nthrough the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act shows that he is an \neffective steward of taxpayer dollars. The act provided over $140 \nmillion for the Pittsburgh district, almost doubling the district's \nannual budget. Under Colonel Crall's leadership, the district awarded \ncontracts for projects to help reinvigorate the region's economy. These \ncontracts have also assisted in improving the reliability of the some \nof the oldest facilities in the Corps.\n  Early in his tenure, he was faced with the challenge of a severe \nflash flooding event where he quickly directed available Corps \nauthorities to provide emergency relief and offer immediate assistance. \nColonel Crall's actions strengthened the Corps' partnership with local \ncommunities and reiterated the Corps value in the region. This event \nset the foundation for a tenure that focused on ensuring the safety of \ncitizens of the region and a commitment to protecting their property. \nIn addition, Colonel Crall's true compassion for the constituents \nimpacted by this unfortunate event set the tone for his continued \nengagement in local flood reduction needs throughout the Pittsburgh \ndistrict.\n  Throughout his time at the helm of the Pittsburgh district, Colonel \nCrall continued to stress the Army Corp's concern for maintaining and \nimproving water quality. For instance, Colonel Crall recognized the \neffect of natural gas drilling on the Monongahela River and immediately \ntook action to reduce any negative impact on public health and safety \nassociated with this activity.\n  As a decorated military officer, Colonel Crall exemplified his \ndevotion to our soldiers and country through his active role with the \nflight 93 Memorial. With a singular focus on overcoming unnecessary \ndelays, he directed his team to work with the National Park Service to \nensure that the Corps involvement in the memorial was timely and done \nwith great care. Colonel Crall's efforts are helping to move the \nproject in a positive direction. Simply stated, his personal \ninvolvement will help ensure that the sacrifices of the patriots aboard \nflight 93 will be appropriately memorialized.\n  Colonel Crall's excellent communication skills and collaborative \napproach greatly improved the district's image and reputation among the \ngeneral public, stakeholders, and the workforce. Throughout his entire \ntour of duty, Colonel Crall's superb leadership and strong personal \nengagement was instrumental in demonstrating the value of the \nPittsburgh district throughout\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\nthe Upper Ohio Valley. Colonel Crall's performance of duty reflects \ngreat credit upon himself, the Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Army. \nWe honor his service and wish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5846-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING BENJAMIN GORDON POWELL, JR.\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \ncome to the Senate floor today to reflect upon the passing of Benny \nPowell, Jr., an esteemed jazz trombonist from Louisiana. Louisiana and \nthe Nation lost a musical icon on June 26 when Benny passed away, but \nhe lives on in our memories and in the music that he created.\n  Born March 1, 1930, in New Orleans, LA, Benjamin Gordon Powell, Jr. \nfirst set his sights on the parade drum. At the time, his mother was \nworking as a maid in the French Quarter and she played the piano. \nThankfully, his mother quickly realized his enthusiasm for music and \nencouraged Benny to play the trombone. By the time he was 14, Benny had \nlanded his first professional band gig. He was tremendously musically \ngifted, even from such a young age.\n  Benny has said of the trombone that he loved most how expressive the \ninstrument was. In an interview with the Times-Picayune in 2001, he was \nquoted as saying that, ``It's like a voice. It can go from a whisper to \na roar.''\n  Benny has performed from coast to coast with a variety of musical \nfigures. In 1961, he played at President Kennedy's inauguration. He has \nrecorded or performed with Frank Sinatra, Screamin' Jay Jawkins, Lionel \nHampton, pianist Randy Weston, in Broadway pit bands, and for many \nyears in the house band on ``The Merv Griffin Show.'' However, he is \nprobably best known for playing with Count Basie from the early 1950s \nthrough the early 1960s. Since 1944, he taught at the New School for \nJazz and Contemporary Music, passing along his gift to aspiring young \nmusicians. I know younger generations were encouraged and inspired by \nhis talents, strength and wisdom.\n  There is a deep rooted musical tradition in New Orleans that Benny's \nmusic exemplified by his clear passion and rich sound. We will miss his \ninspiring gift. As we reflect on his life and his contributions, our \nprayers are with his daughter, Demitra Powell Clay, his sister, \nElizabeth Powell McCrowey, and his grandchildren, Faith and Kyle \nSwetnam. May we all find some solace in the part of Benny that \ncontinues to live on in his music.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5846-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING GIRLS INC.\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I congratulate Girls Inc. \nof Fort Smith, first place winners in the National Park Foundation's \ninaugural First Bloom program, in which fourth to sixth graders plan \nand grow native plants that help educate visitors in national parks \nacross the U.S.\n  For more than a year, Girls Inc. has tended the ``officers' garden'' \nat the Fort Smith Historic Site, a part of the National Park Service. \nTo blend in with the history and heritage of the site, the girls wear \n1860s attire, complete with a dress, apron, and bonnet. The girls \ncultivate, plant, water and grow the garden in the way women and girls \nof that era would have, using plants and seeds that were available in \nthe Civil War-era in Fort Smith. Because of the girls' dedicated \nefforts, the garden has expanded to twice its original size.\n  The officers' garden at the Fort Smith site was started 2\\1/2\\ years \nago by park interpreter Keri Powers, who would explain to visitors the \nsignificance of having a garden for officers' wives, which not only \nprovided food and medicine, but also was a social space for family and \nfriends to gather.\n  Girls Inc. competed against students with projects in some of our \nNation's most best-known national parks, such as Bryce Canyon in Utah \nand Glacier Bay in Alaska. Their hard work and perseverance paid off, \nand I know all Arkansans share my pride in their accomplishments.\n  As a part of their first place prize, the girls received an all-\nexpenses paid trip to Washington. I was honored to meet with these \nyoung girls today, to hear more about their project and their \nexperiences. While in Washington, the girls plan to meet with other \nmembers of Arkansas's congressional delegation, tour the National Mall, \nand visit the White House.\n  Girls Inc. of Fort Smith represents the best of Arkansas. Along with \nall Arkansans, I congratulate them for this tremendous \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5846-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING HARVEST OF HOPE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

The contribution will contain the millionth pound of \nrice the group has donated, which equals thousands of Arkansans who \nhave received the vital sustenance and nutrition they need.\n  Harvest of Hope is comprised of community leaders from DeWitt, \nBatesville, and Malvern who cook and sell smoked meats and use the \nproceeds to buy rice for the Arkansas Rice Depot. Times are tough for \nmany Arkansans, and I commend these communities for their dedication to \nhelping those in need.\n  Each community hosts a ``Harvest of Hope'' event annually. DeWitt's \nHarvest of Hope occurred over the Fourth of July holiday. Batesville \nand Malvern will hold their Harvest of Hope events this Labor Day.\n  Hunger is an epidemic in Arkansas and across our Nation. In fact, \nArkansas has the highest incidence of childhood hunger in the country. \nIn my role as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, I have fought to make strong improvements to our child \nnutrition programs that will put us on a path toward ending childhood \nhunger.\n  I commend the communities of DeWitt, Batesville, and Malvern for \ndoing their part to help end hunger in our State. Along with my fellow \nArkansans, I will continue my fight to ensure that Arkansans have \naccess to the food and nutrition they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5846-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRATULATING MISS ARKANSAS PAGEANT CONTESTANTS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

These women \nrepresent the best of our State, and I am proud to see them work toward \ntheir personal and professional goals as they compete in this event.\n  Since 1938, the Miss Arkansas Pageant has sent a representative to \nthe Miss America Pageant. In the early days, the Miss Arkansas Pageant \nwas held in various cities across the State, including in my hometown \nof Helena. In 1957, the pageant moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas's ``Spa \nCity,'' where it has taken place ever since.\n  This year, 44 contestants seek the title of Miss Arkansas, which will \nbe determined Saturday evening. I wish them all the best as they strive \nto achieve their goals. I also congratulate Miss Arkansas 2009 Sarah \nSlocum for the work she has done over the past year representing our \nstate and our Arkansas values.

Mr. President, today I congratulate Mr. Jeff \nTheerman, executive director of the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer \nDistrict, MSD, on his election as the new president of the National \nAssociation of Clean Water Agencies, NACWA.\n  Mr. Theerman is an accomplished leader and committed environmental \nsteward. He has dedicated his career to the improvement of the \nenvironment and public health in Missouri, and throughout the Nation. \nWithout a doubt, he is ideally suited for this national leadership \nposition with NACWA.\n  Mr. Theerman has served Missouri through his work at MSD for over 25 \nyears. In October of 2003 he was named MSD's executive director, \nwillingly and ably accepting accountability for all aspects of the \nutility's operations.\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\n  As MSD's executive director, Mr. Theerman leads one of the Nation's \nlargest wastewater and stormwater management utilities, providing \nservices to approximately 1.4 million people in the city of St. Louis \nand St. Louis County. Under his leadership, the MSD currently operates \nseven wastewater treatment facilities, treating an average of 330 \nmillion gallons of water per day and maintaining 9,649 miles of sewers.\n  Since joining others in founding NACWA 40 years ago, the Metropolitan \nSt. Louis Sewer District has benefitted from its active engagement with \nthe organization. A member of NACWA's board of directors since 2004, \nMr. Theerman has served as the organization's secretary, treasurer, and \nvice president. It is fitting that his election as president coincides \nwith the 40th anniversary of NACWA's advocacy on behalf of the Nation's \nclean water agencies--and the environment we all value so much.\n  Mr. Theerman is a great example of accountable and responsible \nleadership in my State.

I am certain his actions will ensure continued water quality \nprogress for St. Louis, MO, and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5847-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING MATHEWS BROTHERS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize one of the oldest \ncontinually operating businesses in my home State of Maine that has \nbeen truly successful at adapting to the changing times. Mathews \nBrothers has been manufacturing high quality windows and doors in the \ncoastal town of Belfast for over 156 years, showing that resilience, \ninnovation, and hard work can overcome even the worst economic \ndownturns in American history. Currently employing more than 120 \nindividuals, Mathews Brothers provides a prime example of how small \nbusinesses can weather economic downturns to emerge stronger time after \ntime.\n  Mathews Brothers was founded in 1854 as a sawmill and millworks \ncompany by brothers Noah Merrill Mathews and Spencer Walcott Mathews. \nThroughout the years, the firm has set out to add a variety of \ndifferent products to its repertoire, from blinds and shutters, to \ncoffins and spiral staircases. Today, the company uses state-of-the-art \nequipment and materials to produce traditional wood, vinyl and \ncontemporary composite windows and doors out of its three manufacturing \nplants in Belfast, Rockland, and Bangor.\n  As continual innovators, Mathews Brothers launched Dream Kitchen \nStudio in 2008 as a separate division providing windows, doors, and \nkitchens to businesses, homeowners, and contractors throughout the \nMidcoast region of Maine. Indeed, the company has been breaking \nbarriers and achieving a host of accomplishments from its inception, \nincluding being the largest woman-owned business in Maine at the start \nof the 20th century, as well as building the Jennie Flood Kreger, the \nlargest and only 5-masted schooner ever built in Belfast.\n  In recent years, Mathews Brothers has sought to improve its business \nmodel by cutting costs while maintaining quality. Toward this end, they \nrecently completed a two month train-the-trainer lean manufacturing \ninitiative with the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership that \ninstructed 116 employees and helped save the company at least $75,000. \nIn addition to this critical project, the company has sought to expand \ninto overseas markets to sell its products, including participation in \ntrade missions to Brazil, Korea, and Japan in the past several years.\n  Furthermore, Mathews Brothers maintains a strong commitment to our \nenvironment, as it recycles 100 percent of its scrap glass, vinyl, \nmetal, paper, and cardboard from the manufacturing process. The company \nalso uses a recycling glass washer, helping it save 67,000 gallons per \nmonth in water consumption. Leftover sawdust is sent to local farms for \nuse as stall bedding, while scrap wood is sold off as kindling or \nfirewood. The firm takes its role as steward of the land seriously \nthrough its membership in the Maine Chapter of the U.S. Green Building \nCouncil and the Maine Forest Products Council.\n  Mathews Brothers has also shown a continued commitment to its local \ncommunity and actively encourages their employees to engage in \ncommunity service activities. This commitment originated over a century \nago in 1904 with then-President Orlando Frost's commitment to help \nstart up the Waldo County General Hospital. Their employees still \nvolunteer in the oncology department and eagerly participate in the \nhospital's annual fall oncology walk. Mathews Brothers' commitment to \ncommunity service was on display again in 2007 when the company raised \nover $7,000 to purchase phone cards for soldiers from Maine deployed in \nIraq.\n  Not surprisingly, Mathews Brothers has earned numerous awards for \nmanufacturing and customer service excellence. The firm was recently \nawarded the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership's Manufacturing \nExcellence Award in June 2010. The award recognizes the company's \nsuccess in achieving world-class manufacturing status and \nimplementation of best manufacturing practices to stay ahead of the \ncompetition, all while maintaining a commitment to loyally serving its \ncustomers and assisting the community at large. The company has also \nreceived the Governor's Award for Business Excellence in 1994, and was \nchosen as the Belfast Area Chamber of Commerce's Business of the Year \nin 2007, among other distinctions.\n  While rising to the top of its field over the past century and a \nhalf, Mathews Brothers has never forgotten the community that helped it \nget there. Its consistent and enthusiastic endeavors to serve the \ncommunity and its customers have not gone unnoticed, and I praise them \nfor their efforts to modernize in the face of globalization, a process \nwhich has not been kind to American manufacturers. I thank everyone at \nMathews Brothers for their philanthropic efforts and tremendous \nperseverance, and offer my best wishes for another 150 years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5847-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5847-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5847-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5847-S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3923.

A bill to protect information relating to consumers, to \nrequire notice of security breaches, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nBennett to introduce an important and bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat will help protect American's from identity and financial theft.\n  As you may have heard in the news, in 2009 Heartland Payment \nSystems--a national company that processes payments for retailers and \nrestaurants located in nearly all 50 states--was hacked, leaving \npossibly 100 million people at risk of identity fraud or financial \ntheft. These types of scenarios happen more than we would like and have \nthe potential to keep American's from getting a loan, a new bank \naccount, or--in worst case scenarios--from even paying the monthly \nbills. This situation is simply unacceptable and this bill will help \naddress these serious problems.\n  Our bill requires entities such as financial institutions, retailers, \nand Federal agencies to safeguard sensitive information before it is \ncompromised, investigate possible security breaches, and to notify \ncustomers when there is a substantial risk of identity theft or account \nfraud.\n  For example, these new requirements would apply to retailers who take \ncredit card information, data brokers who compile private information, \nand government agencies that possess nonpublic personal information.\n  My colleague and I modeled our legislation after the data security \nand breach-response regime established under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \nof 1999, and subsequent regulations. It also builds on existing law to \nbetter ensure federal and state regulators comply with the law and to \nmake certain that data security procedures are uniformly applied.\n  Lastly, we need to replace the current patchwork of State and Federal \nregulations for identity theft with a national law, like this one, that \nprovides uniform protections across the country. Our comprehensive \napproach will better serve consumers by making it easier for businesses \nand government agencies to take the steps necessary to adequately \nprotect all Americans from identity theft and account fraud.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this important \nand necessary bill enacted before it is too late. I think everyone can \nagree that our identities and bank accounts are some of the most \nimportant aspects of our lives and that, if stolen, can at a minimum \nmake life extremely difficult.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to implement certain defense trade treaties; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Defense Trade \nTreaty Implementation Act of 2010.\n  The purpose of this bill is to provide authority to implement two \ntreaties on defense trade cooperation currently pending before the \nSenate--one with the United Kingdom and one with Australia. These \ntreaties would facilitate defense cooperation with two close allies by \neliminating licensing requirements for certain categories of defense \narticles.\n  I have long supported the objectives of these treaties. Indeed, in \n2003--before the treaties were negotiated--I introduced legislation \nthat would have provided the President the authority to waive licensing \nrequirements for similar defense trade with the United Kingdom and \nAustralia.\n  Subsequently, the Bush administration negotiated these treaties, and \nthey were submitted to the Senate in 2007. To date, the Senate has not \nbeen able to act on the treaties, in significant part because of \nconfusion and uncertainty about how they would be implemented and \nenforced in U.S. law.\n  This legislation would address the problem by providing clear \nlegislative authority under the Arms Export Control Act to implement \nand enforce the treaties. In particular, it would provide authority to \nexempt from licensing requirements under the Arms Export Control Act \nexports of defense articles made in connection with the treaties.\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\nIt would provide authority for the President to issue regulations \npursuant to the Arms Export Control Act to implement and enforce the \ntreaties. It would provide authority to allow violations or abuses of \nthe treaty to be prosecuted under enforcement provisions of the Arms \nExport Control Act. It would provide for notification to the Congress \nof significant exports of defense articles made pursuant to the \ntreaties.\n  Previous efforts by both the Bush and Obama administrations to \ndevelop a viable approach for implementing and enforcing the treaties \nwithout new legislation have been unsuccessful to date, and have \ncreated unfortunate delays in bringing these treaties into force. I \nbelieve that this legislation will put the implementation and \nenforcement of the treaties on a far sounder and more certain footing, \nand eliminate the confusion that has led to these delays.\n  I look forward to working with other members and with the \nadministration on this legislation. It is my hope that passage of this \nlegislation, together with a resolution of advice and consent to the \ntreaties containing appropriate protections for the Senate's role in \noverseeing arms exports and approving significant future changes to the \ntreaty regime, may allow the treaties to enter into force this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to reform \nDepartment of Defense energy policy, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to help the Pentagon turn energy from a source of risk to a \nsource of advantage. The Department of Defense, DOD, Energy Security \nAct would decrease the Pentagon's consumption of petroleum, reduce \nreliance on the grid, and help plan for the future. All of this would \nhelp achieve an important goal that we all support: enhancing our \nnational security.\n  I am grateful to my former colleague on the House Armed Services \nCommittee, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who introduced \nthe counterpart bill in the House of Representatives. I am also \ngrateful to Senator Bennet for cosponsoring this legislation. I look \nforward to continuing to work with both of them on this important \nlegislation and on this important issue.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, I have focused on the intersection of \ndefense and energy for some time.\n  The United States is the world's largest consumer of energy. We \ndepend on foreign imports for nearly 60 percent of our oil. Nearly \nevery military challenge we face is either derived from or impacted by \nour reliance on fossil fuels and foreign energy sources.\n  The Pentagon is a large microcosm of this even larger problem. The \nU.S. military is the single largest consumer of energy in the world--\nconsuming more energy per day than 85 percent of the world's countries. \nIt is the largest electricity consumer in the federal government and \nthe single largest buyer of fuel in the United States--using 2 percent \nof our total national consumption.\n  Energy supply security affects DOD's ability to accomplish its \nmission, and\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nefforts to secure supply lines and deliver fuel in-theater directly \nresult in the deaths of service members charged with protecting it. But \nour military's reliance is not just on the battlefield. At home, \ndefense facilities rely on a fragile national grid, leaving critical \nassets vulnerable. The Defense Science Board found in its 2008 report \n``More Fight--Less Fuel'' that ``critical national security and \nhomeland defense missions are at an unacceptably high risk of extended \noutage from failure of the grid.''\n  The Pentagon's energy consumption has serious national security \nimplications, but it also presents opportunities. As the Logistics \nManagement Institute wrote, ``Aggressively developing and applying \nenergy-saving technologies to military applications would potentially \ndo more to solve the most pressing long-term challenges facing DOD and \nour national security than any other single investment area.''\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation. The Department of \nDefense Energy Security Act addresses energy supply and use by \ndecreasing consumption by facilities and vehicles and increasing the \nuse of renewable electricity sources to relieve the Department's \nreliance on external power sources. In addition, the bill sets \noverarching policies to implement sustainable acquisition practices, \nsets new DOD Energy Performance Goals, and requires DOD to develop an \nEnergy Performance Plan and an implementation assessment for \naccomplishing its goal of deriving 25 percent of its electricity from \nrenewable sources by 2025.\n  Utilizing alternative energy sources and energy efficiency \ntechnologies can help our military increase energy reliability and \nreduce its dependence on oil; improve efficiency in operations, \nplatforms, and vehicles; reduce the costs to taxpayers of military-\nconsumed electricity and fuel; expand portable clean technology options \nfor use in combat and logistics; act as an anchor customer for the \nalternative fuels and energy efficiency industries; and reduce grid \nvulnerabilities at our military installations.\n  Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and foreign sources of energy \nis a goal we all share. Helping the Defense Department achieve this \ngoal should be a national priority. I urge my colleagues--of both \nparties--to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Tester, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Udall of \n        Colorado, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 3586.

JANE GOODALL ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n BEGINNING OF HER WORK IN WHAT IS TODAY GOMBE STREAM NATIONAL PARK IN \n                                TANZANIA\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 581\n\n       Whereas on July 14, 1960, Dr. Jane Goodall arrived at Gombe \n     Stream Chimpanzee Reserve in what is today Tanzania;\n       Whereas Dr. Goodall's research led to numerous \n     groundbreaking discoveries including the creation and use of \n     tools by chimpanzees;\n       Whereas these and other behavioral observations of \n     chimpanzees forever changed human understanding of the \n     differences between humans and other animal species;\n       Whereas between 1968 and 1986, Dr. Goodall published a \n     collection of articles and books that remain the foundational \n     scientific works on chimpanzee and wildlife studies;\n       Whereas her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of \n     Behavior published by Harvard University Press, details the \n     range of behaviors that make up the essential corpus of \n     chimpanzee natural history and remains today a critical \n     reference for researchers in the field;\n       Whereas Dr. Goodall's writings not only formed the bedrock \n     of the descriptive analytical study of chimpanzees, they also \n     altered the paradigm of the study of culture in chimpanzees \n     and other animals, especially species with complex social \n     behaviors;\n       Whereas in support of the research she began, and to \n     advance her vision, Dr. Goodall established the Gombe Stream \n     Research Center in 1965 and the Jane Goodall Institute in \n     1977;\n       Whereas researchers in many other institutions continue to \n     carry out pathbreaking analyses related to chimpanzee \n     behavior based on Dr. Goodall's original scientific work;\n       Whereas scientists continue to make new discoveries in the \n     field of chimpanzee and wildlife studies today;\n       Whereas since 1986, Dr. Goodall has advocated for the \n     conservation of chimpanzees and other species, for the \n     protection of the natural world, for the care of chimpanzees \n     and other animals in captivity, and for world peace;\n       Whereas Dr. Goodall travels the world approximately 300 \n     days a year, delivering dozens of lectures and engaging with \n     youth of all ages;\n       Whereas Dr. Goodall has been a leader in mobilizing \n     community involvement in conservation and continues to \n     practice and promote conservation efforts based on the \n     important link between human welfare and environmental \n     stewardship;\n       Whereas Dr. Goodall has received the highest honors in her \n     field;\n       Whereas in 2008, she was awarded the Leakey Prize, the \n     nation's most prestigious award in human evolutionary \n     science;\n       Whereas the Leakey Prize has only been given 7 times in the \n     past 4 decades;\n       Whereas in 2007, she received the Harvard Museum of Natural \n     History's Roger Tory Peterson Medal, and in 1989, she \n     received the Anthropologist of the Year Award;\n       Whereas in 1995, she received the National Geographic \n     Society's Hubbard Medal ``for her extraordinary 35-year study \n     of wild chimpanzees and for tirelessly defending the natural \n     world we share'';\n       Whereas Dr. Goodall's numerous honors include the Medal of \n     Tanzania, Japan's prestigious Kyoto Prize, the Benjamin \n     Franklin Medal in Life Science, the United Nations \n     Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's 60th \n     Anniversary Medal, the Gandhi-King Award for Nonviolence, the \n     Albert Schweitzer Award of the Animal Welfare Institute, the \n     Encyclopedia Britannica Award for Excellence on the \n     Dissemination of Learning for the Benefit of Mankind, and the \n     French Legion of Honor, which was presented to her in Paris \n     in 2004 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin;\n       Whereas in April 2002, United Nations Secretary-General \n     Kofi Annan named Dr. Goodall a United Nations Messenger of \n     Peace;\n       Whereas such Messengers help mobilize the public to become \n     involved in work that makes the world a better place, serving \n     as advocates in such areas as poverty eradication, human \n     rights, peace and conflict resolution, HIV/AIDS, community \n     development, and conservation;\n       Whereas upon becoming the new United Nations Secretary-\n     General, Ban Ki-moon continued her appointment;\n       Whereas in 2004, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace, Prince \n     Charles invested Dr. Goodall as a Dame of the British Empire, \n     the female equivalent of knighthood;\n       Whereas during the last half of the 20th century, she \n     blazed a trail for and inspired other women primatologists, \n     such that women now dominate long-term primate behavioral \n     studies worldwide;\n       Whereas Dr. Goodall has been a role model for youth of all \n     ages, inspiring boys and girls alike to take action for \n     people, animals, and the environment; and\n       Whereas through her Jane Goodall Institute, she established \n     the Roots & Shoots global youth program, which now has \n     members in more than 120 countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate recognizes--\n       (1) the 50th anniversary of the beginning of Dr. Jane \n     Goodall's work in what is now Tanzania, Africa, as \n     significant in scientific history;\n       (2) the significant role that Dr. Goodall's work and \n     scientific study have had on our knowledge and understanding \n     of both the natural and human worlds; and\n       (3) recognizes the positive role that Dr. Goodall's work \n     and research have had in education, science, and conservation \n     alike.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, today I stand to recognize \none of the greatest scientists and leaders of our time and to introduce \na resolution honoring the educational and scientific significance of \nDr. Jane Goodall on this the 50th anniversary of her first day's work \nin what is now Tanzania.\n  Fifty years ago today, Jane Goodall, a young and ambitious scientist, \nfirst set foot on the shores of Lake Tanganyika to begin her research \nunder the direction of Dr. Louis Leakey. In the ensuing years, Dr. \nGoodall became the world's expert on chimpanzees. She had numerous \ngroundbreaking discoveries. She published articles and books that \nremain the foundational scientific works on chimpanzee and wildlife \nstudies. She established the Gombe Stream Research Center and the Jane \nGoodall Institute to support further research.\n  Jane has received many of the highest honors in her field and has \nbecome a prominent advocate for international conservation and peace. \nConsequently, she has been recognized and honored by political leaders \nand kings and queens throughout the world. The resolution I submit \ntoday recognizes Dr. Goodall for her past, present, and future \ncontributions in the fields of science and conservation.\n  Beyond her incredible knowledge and skills in the sciences, Dr. Jane \nGoodall is an amazing human being. Her love of others and of the living \nthings around her is what I believe drove her to achieve such great \nsuccesses. Anyone\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\nwho hears her speak can feel her sincere adoration for the chimpanzees \nto which she dedicated her life. It is that love and drive that have \nmade Dr. Goodall world-renowned in her field and admired and beloved \nthroughout the world.\n  I imagine the ambitious young Jane, who boldly set out on the shores \nof Lake Tanganyika, was much like the many inspired young people who \nnow work for her and with her. Across the globe, the same hope and \ninspiration that took Jane into the jungles of Africa now drive \nthousands of young people to organize conservation and community \nprograms through the Roots and Shoots program which was founded in \n1991. These young people care about their communities, their natural \nresources, and about the living things around them. They, like the \nyoung Jane Goodall, want to make a difference in the world, and they \nstrive every day in their own lives to be a catalyst for positive \nchange.\n  I believe Jane's focus on encouraging young people is one of her \ngreatest accomplishments. Through her own experience as a young \nscientist, she knows the strength of the connection young people \ndevelop with nature if they have the opportunity. We live in a world \nwhere many young people have no connection to the natural world or to \ntheir community--a world where urban areas lack any connection to the \nrhythms of nature, where video games and indoor activities predominate, \nwhere a sense of community is absent. A generation lacking that \nconnection is doomed to failing. Jane saw the need to connect them. She \nsaw the need to inspire them. Roots and Shoots provides that crucial \nconnection.\n  Dr. Goodall's work with young activists does not focus on one area of \nthe world or on one issue of significance; her Roots and Shoots program \nis in 120 different countries. Young people from preschool through \ncollege gather in classrooms, nature centers, refugee camps, zoos, and \nmany other places to identify issues that concern them, and then they \nact. And, boy, do they act. They are a force for positive change.\n  We thank Jane Goodall for all her contributions to making this a \nbetter world.\n  We know that when one person in a community ignites positive action, \nit is contagious. When each community works for positive change, they \nconnect. Community efforts become national endeavors. And nations take \naction on a global scale. The world becomes a better place--one person \nat a time.\n  With the help of student leaders and adult mentors, these young \npeople create hands-on projects to address the issues impacting their \nhomes and communities. Over the past two decades, tens of thousands of \nyoung people have formed a network across the globe and are building \nupon Dr. Jane Goodall's legacy of positive change in the world. This is \na network of hope and a generation of positive actors. Thanks to their \nyoung and active hearts, our world will thrive into the future.\n  For 50 years, Dr. Goodall has worked to expand and improve our world. \nHer work has spread so widely that Jane Goodall is a household name. \nAnd with that name, young people from America to Africa and all around \nthe globe learn the wonders of the natural world and our link to the \ncreatures around us, including Dr. Goodall's beloved chimpanzees.\n  Dr. Goodall recognizes the power that each person has to make \npositive change. She is a brilliant example of the great things that \nare possible when one young person connects with the natural world and \nis inspired to make a difference.\n  Today, I honor my good friend Dr. Jane Goodall. I ask my colleagues \nto do the same. And I thank her for her example, and for her confidence \nin the immense power that young people have to improve the future.\n  Let us all work together to make positive change in our communities \nand support coming generations in their creative and noble ambitions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/14/senate-section/article/S5859-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 582--RECOGNIZING THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL \n IMPACTS OF THE BRITISH PETROLEUM OIL SPILL ON THE PEOPLE OF THE GULF \n COAST AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE AND URGING BRITISH PETROLEUM TO GIVE ALL \n DUE CONSIDERATION TO OFFERS OF ASSISTANCE, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES FROM \n    THE STATES DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE DEEPWATER HORIZON OIL SPILL\n\n  Mr. WICKER (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. LeMieux, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nShelby, and Mr. Vitter) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S.
