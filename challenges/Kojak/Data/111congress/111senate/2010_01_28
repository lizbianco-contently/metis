Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont. I hope \nI will not inconvenience him. I have a very short opening statement. I \nthank him for giving me the opportunity to make this statement.\n  As always, we appreciate the President coming to the Capitol last \nnight. I take him at his word when he says he wants to work with us on \nissues that benefit the Nation and in particular to grow jobs. I would \nlike to speak this morning about two areas in particular that meet the \ncriteria of bipartisan achievements and job growth--agreements to \nincrease our exports and finding more American energy. Those are two \nareas upon which we ought to be able to find bipartisan agreement.\n  The President called for increased exports and for the Congress to \npass trade agreements that have languished under the current majority \nin the Senate. Republicans agree with the need to increase trade and \nwith the need to ratify trade agreements with Colombia and other \nimportant trading partners that so far have met resistance on the other \nside of the aisle. We also support passing a sensible bill to help \nPakistan establish reconstruction opportunity zones that actually \nincrease trade and do not impose self-defeating restrictions. We agree \nwith the President's call to pass these agreements. We agree that these \nagreements will lead to more American jobs. The Congress should act on \nthese agreements.\n  The President also called for producing more American energy. This is \nan area with a huge opportunity for American jobs that cannot--cannot--\nbe sent overseas. We agree with his call for more clean energy produced \nhere in America. We agree with his call for building more nuclear \nplants. We agree with his call for increased offshore exploration for \noil and gas. We agree with his call for development of clean coal \ntechnologies. We should build a new generation of clean nuclear plants \nin this country. Senate Republicans support building 100 new plants as \nquickly as possible. We hope Democrats will join us in that effort, \nparticularly now with the President's call to action. The President \ncould start by moving forward on the nuclear loan guarantee program \nthat was included in the bipartisan 2005 Energy bill. He could also put \nforward a plan for dealing with the waste that comes from these plants \nin a safe and secure manner.\n  The President and I agree on the need to meet in the middle to find \nbipartisan agreement to grow jobs. I have outlined two specific areas \nwhere the President and Republicans in Congress agree. We know that \nincreased American energy, without a new national energy tax, will grow \ngood jobs. We know that increasing markets for our farmers, \nentrepreneurs, and manufacturers overseas through trade agreements will \ngrow good jobs. We can get these done, and I hope the President will \njoin us in calling on the majority to bring these issues to the floor \nin the Senate.\n  One thing we had hoped to hear more about from the President last \nnight was the administration's handling of the attempted Christmas Day \nbombing. After 9/11, all Americans recognized the need to create and \ncoordinate myriad tools of defense, security, and intelligence to \nprotect us from future attacks. That is why Americans are so troubled \nby the fact that the administration seems to have lost sight of this \nessential requirement for national security out of a preoccupation with \nreading the Christmas Day bomber his Miranda rights. Apparently, there \nwas little, if any, coordination among key components of the \nadministration's national security apparatus on how to treat this \nterrorist who nearly killed 300 innocent people over Detroit on \nChristmas Day. Shockingly, the administration then made the hasty \ndecision to treat him as a civilian defendant, including advising him \nof the right to remain silent, rather than as an intelligence resource \nto be thoroughly interrogated in order to obtain potentially lifesaving \ninformation.\n  Republicans have issued a letter to Attorney General Holder demanding \nanswers to some of the vital questions that arise out of the \nadministration's handling of this attempted attack. It is critical that \nAmericans have a full and timely understanding of the policy and legal \nrationale upon which the ill-\nadvised decision surrounding this narrowly averted calamity was made. \nUntil these concerns are addressed, Republicans will continue to raise \nthem on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand I have 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope the American people watched and \nheard President Obama's speech last night and were reassured. I know I \nwas. There are so many things that he covered, I will not try to repeat \nall of them. I would like to expand on one of the very important \nmatters he raised. On this, I will wear my hat as chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  The Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision last week in Citizens United v. \nFederal Election Commission. That decision threatens to allow \ncorporations to drown out the individual voices of hard-working \nAmericans in our elections. By overturning years of work in Congress, \nyears of work by both Republicans and Democrats alike--campaign finance \nlaws, and by reversing a century of its own precedent, the \nconservative, activist bloc on the Supreme Court reached an unnecessary \nand improper decision that is going to distort future elections. The \nCitizens United decision turns the idea of government of, by, and for \nthe people on its head. It creates new rights for Wall Street at the \nexpense of Main Street.\n  Congress, on behalf of the American people, struggled for years to \nenact campaign finance reform. Virtually every American wanted campaign \nfinance reform. We finally did that in a bipartisan way in the landmark \n2002 McCain-Feingold Act overcoming a filibuster and passing it with a \nbipartisan supermajority. This milestone campaign finance reform \nstrengthened the laws, protecting the interests of all Americans by \nensuring a fair electoral process. It was a matter of serious \nconsideration by Congress, and was signed into law by President George \nW. Bush.\n  In the 2003 case McConnell v. the Federal Election Commission, the \nUnited States Supreme Court upheld the key provisions of the McCain-\nFeingold Act against a First Amendment challenge. That was consistent \nwith 100 years of judicial precedent and law, including a longstanding \ncriminal law prohibiting corporations from contributing to Federal \nelection campaigns. We have long prevented corporate contributions to \nFederal campaigns, at least since the time of President Teddy \nRoosevelt. The prohibitions included in the Tillman Act were signed \ninto law in 1907.\n  Now only 6 years after upholding 100 years of precedent, resolving \nthe question in McConnell, and after a number of other Supreme Court \nopinions upholding these campaign regulations as needed to ensure \nfairness in elections, a thin majority of the Supreme Court, made \npossible by President Bush's appointment of Justice Alito, has thrown \nout important parts of the law, and they have run roughshod over a long \nline of longstanding Court precedent. This is a threat to the rule of \nlaw. It overrules congressional efforts to keep powerful, monied \ninterests from swamping individual voices and interests. This decision \nputs the special interests of big oil, banks and insurance companies \nahead of the interests of the American people, and it risks corrupting \nour political process. It shows no deference to Congress and no respect \nfor the rule of law as reflected in\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\nthe precedents of the Supreme Court. I agree with Justice Stevens, who \nwrote in his extraordinary dissent in Citizens United:\n\n       [T]he court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity \n     of elected institutions across the nation. The path it has \n     taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this \n     institution.\n\n  At his confirmation hearing, Justice Alito, under oath, testified \nthat the role of the Supreme Court is a limited role. It has to do what \nit is supposed to do vigilantly but also has to be equally vigilant \nabout not stepping over the bounds and invading the authority of \nCongress. That was then when he was seeking confirmation. This is now. \nAs Justice Stevens' dissent makes clear, the narrow majority of the \nJustices, including Justice Alito, substituted their own preferences \nfor those of the duly-elected Congress, despite 100 years of the \nSupreme Court's own precedents.\n  This is the most partisan decision since Bush v. Gore. That decision \nby the activist conservative bloc on the Supreme Court intervened in a \npresidential election. This decision is broader and more damaging in \nthat they have now decided to intervene in all elections. Just as in \nBush v. Gore, last week, the conservative activists currently on the \nSupreme Court unnecessarily went beyond the proper judicial role to \nsubstitute their preferences for the law. Last week's decision is only \nthe latest example--yet perhaps the most extreme--of the willingness of \na narrow majority of the Supreme Court to render decisions from the \nbench to suit their own ideological agenda.\n  I believe that the activist conservatives now on the Supreme Court \ngot this decision dramatically wrong as a matter of constitutional \ninterpretation and also common sense. Corporations are not the same as \nindividual American men and women. They do not have the same rights, \nthe same morals, the same ideals. They do not vote. They do not have \nthe same role in our election as individual citizens. When the Supreme \nCourt made its landmark decision to ensure election fairness through \nthe constitutional protection of the principle of one-person-one-vote, \nit did the right thing. Last week, the conservative bloc undermined \nthat core constitutional principle by imposing its view that moneyed \ncorporations should dominate the airwaves and election discourse. \nRather than abiding by the limitations that Congress has developed to \nensure a multitude of voices in the marketplace of election contests, \nthey decided that the biggest corporations should be unleashed so that \nthey can be the loudest and most dominant at the expense of our \ndemocratic principles.\n\n  At the core of the first amendment is the right of individual \nAmericans--individual men and women--to participate in the political \nprocess, to speak and, crucially, to be heard. That is what the \ncampaign finance laws were designed to ensure; that American men and \nwomen could be heard and fairly participate in elections. This right is \nfundamental to the legitimacy of our democracy--to our ability to \ngovern ourselves because it is the foundation of our other rights.\n  Last week's decision puts these inalienable rights at risk by \nignoring not only the extensive findings of Congress in passing the law \nbut also logic and reality. The loud megaphones that can be bought by \ncorporate money can drown out the unamplified voices of individual \nAmericans. This is true even in an age when the Internet has vastly \nexpanded avenues for citizens to speak to each other. The campaign \nfinance laws passed by Congress reflected clear reasons for treating \nindividuals and their free speech rights differently from corporations \nand their money. We have done so for at least 100 years. We sought \nadditional reforms after the corruption of Watergate, and again at the \nturn of this new century. Those reforms and reasonable regulation are \nnow left in tatters.\n  The purported principles of the conservative activists cannot be \nlimited to section 441b of title 2 of the United States Code, as \namended by section 203 of the McCain-Feingold Act. If corporations can \nuse their wealth to make independent expenditures for electioneering \nbecause they are now suddenly being given, by five people on the \nSupreme Court, constitutional rights in elections, what can prevent \nthem from contributing to individual campaigns? What principle allows \nus to bar foreign corporations--foreign corporations--from likewise \nengaging in campaign communications?\n  The largest companies garner annual profits of hundreds of billions \nof dollars. They are doing this even during one of the greatest \nfinancial disasters in our Nation's history. If even a fraction of that \nmoney were directed toward political activity, those companies would \nhave the financial power to dominate and determine this country's \nelections and the laws of this country. To put this in perspective, as \nDoug Kendall of the Constitutional Accountability Center pointed out \nafter the decision, if Exxon-Mobil diverted only two percent of the $45 \nbillion in profits it generated in 2008, ``this one company could have \noutspent both presidential candidates and fundamentally changed the \ndynamic of the 2008 election.'' The same could be said for numerous \nother companies who will now be able to dwarf the contributions and \nvoices of individual Americans.\n  The risks of this new ruling extend even further. The conservative \nactivist majority in Citizens United fails to make clear whether the \nnew ``rights'' it has conferred are limited to American corporations or \nif they apply to foreign corporations. Can the Chinese or subsidiaries \nof Chinese corporations or Saudi oil companies now also spend unlimited \namounts of money and come in and decide, in effect, American elections?\n  Saudi Aramco is estimated to be worth $781 billion. Petro China's \nestimated net worth is $100 billion, with profits rivaling Exxon \nMobil's, in the tens of billions each year. Likewise, Venezuelan oil \ntakes in tens of billions a year. A German insurance company named \nAllianz is worth $2.5 trillion. Another insurance concern, ING Group, \nis valued around $2 trillion. HSBC Holdings is valued at almost $2.5 \ntrillion, with annual sales of almost $150 billion. Bank of American \nitself has sales of over $100 billion a year. Then there are the Wall \nStreet firms and investment houses, which certainly will not support \nplanned banking industry reforms.\n  It is hard to envision this is what the Founders, who threw off the \nshackles of oppression, meant to enshrine in the Constitution when they \nwrote the First Amendment. It is also hard to understand how these \nconservative activists, who sound incessant alarm bells about the \ndangers of applying foreign law and recognizing rights for noncitizens \nin our courts, now cannot understand the threat of this encroachment on \nthe very core of our democracy. The Citizens United decision is \ndisconnected from the plain text and history of the Constitution, the \ncareful policy choices of the elected branches, and the guidance of the \nSupreme Court's own legal precedents and the rule of law.\n  I am also disappointed with the Justices, who as nominees before the \nSenate, when they were testifying under oath, proclaimed their belief \nin judicial modesty and judicial restraint, could then turn around and \nso brazenly ignore the proper judicial role and in so cavalier a manner \noverturn Supreme Court precedent and override the rule of law. In his \ndissent, Justice Stevens noted that ``there were principled, narrower \npaths that a Court that was serious about judicial restraint could have \ntaken.'' In deciding an unnecessarily broad question--when the parties \nthemselves advanced numerous, narrower grounds of decision--the \n``majority has transgressed yet another `cardinal' principle of the \njudicial process.''\n  I cannot remember a time in my 36 years in the Senate when I have \ncome to this floor to criticize even decisions I disagree with, but \nthis one I am because it goes to the very core of our democracy, and it \nwill allow major corporations, which should have laws written to \ncontrol their effect on America, to instead control America. That is \nnot the America I grew up in. It is not the America Vermonters believe \nin, where individuals have a right to speak but not mega corporations.\n  How did the Court come to the opposite conclusion about the rights of \ncorporations to spend unlimited money on elections from that enshrined \nin our laws and prior Supreme Court decisions? Did we amend the \nConstitution to somehow equate corporations to people? No, we did not. \nNowhere does the Constitution even mention corporations. Did we modify \nthe first\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\namendment? No. The first amendment reads as it did 6 years ago--indeed, \nas it did 219 years ago, when the Bill of Rights was ratified, and the \n14th State in the Union--Vermont--ratified the Constitution.\n  As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent:\n\n       The only relevant thing that has changed since Austin and \n     McConnell is the composition of the court.\n\n  Six years ago Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was part of the \nSupreme Court's majority upholding the limits on corporate spending in \nthe McCain-Feingold Act, retired. The meaning of the Constitution \nshould not change from one year to another due to the replacement of \none Justice. As the dissenting Justices noted:\n\n       [T]he final principle of judicial process that the majority \n     violates is the most transparent: stare decisis. . . . But if \n     this principle is to do any meaningful work in supporting the \n     rule of law, it must at least demand a significant \n     justification, beyond the preferences of five justices, for \n     overturning settled doctrine.\n\n  As judicial nominees often testify, the rule of law depends on the \nstability provided by the consistent application and interpretation of \nthe Constitution and the laws. So does the ability of Congress to act \nto pass laws. The Latin phrase that lawyers use to talk about the \nimportance of respecting and following prior court rulings or precedent \nis ``stare decisis.''\n  As Justice Stevens wrote in the dissent:\n\n       Stare decisis protects not only personal rights involving \n     property or contract but also the ability of the elected \n     branches to shape their laws in an effective and coherent \n     fashion.\n\n  That is why every Supreme Court nominee that I can recall who has \nappeared before the Judiciary Committee has been asked whether he or \nshe is committed to following precedent. This is central to assuring us \nand the country that a Justice will be committed to the rule of law and \nunderstands the role of a judge. Courts should only depart from \nprecedent with ample justification. As Justice Stevens wrote in \ndissent:\n\n       No such justification exists in this case, and to the \n     contrary there are powerful prudential reasons to keep the \n     faith with our precedents.\n\n  The same five Justices willing to overturn well-established precedent \nto create broad new rights for corporations in Citizens United had no \ntrouble severely limiting free speech rights for individuals. In a 2007 \ncase, Morse v. Frederick, Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices \nScalia, Alito, Thomas and Kennedy, held that the First Amendment did \nnot protect an 18-year-old student from being suspended for holding up \na banner across the street from a school during the 2002 Olympic Torch \nRelay. They held the principal could suspend that student, a legal \nadult, for displaying the banner, not on school grounds, but across the \nstreet from the school. All that was needed was for the school \nadministrator to believe that the banner somehow promoted illegal drug \nuse and was therefore against the school's policy. Perhaps if that \nstudent had incorporated, these five Justices would now find his First \nAmendment rights protected. These are the same Justices who recently \nreached out to ban the streaming of public trial proceedings on a \nmatter of public interest, as well, on similarly flimsy grounds in \norder to impose their own preferences.\n  It is also difficult to understand the lack of concern in Citizens \nUnited for the potential of massive corporate spending to distort \nelections in light of the Supreme Court's ruling issued only months ago \nin Caperton v. Massey. In that case, Justice Kennedy wrote that the \npossibility of bias due to campaign contributions in a state judicial \nelection meant that the judge was wrong not to recuse himself from \ndeciding a case involving a defendant who had spent $3 million \nsupporting his election campaign to the bench. I agreed with that \ndecision. There, Justice Kennedy wrote:\n\n       We conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias--\n     based on objective and reasonable perceptions--when a person \n     with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant \n     and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the \n     case by raising funds or directing the judge's election \n     campaign when the case was pending or imminent.\n\n  What I do not understand is how these same standards and obvious \nlogic were not applied to corporate spending in election campaigns.\n  Last week's decision and its troubling inconsistency with the Court's \nother interpretations of the Constitution leaves with us serious \nquestions about how to ensure that our elections are not corrupted by \nunchecked corporate spending. It also reinforces the profound concern I \nhave had about the real-world consequences of the Supreme Court's \nrecent decisions for hard-working Americans--real Americans--on issues \nsuch as equal pay for equal work; the power of Congress under the 14th \nand 15th amendment, to pass civil rights laws, such as the Voting \nRights Act; and issues thought to be long settled, such as the meaning \nof Brown v. Board of Education. The newly constituted Supreme Court \nseems determined to accrue to itself the powers given by the \nConstitution to Congress and to rewrite long-established precedents, \ncertainly acting contrary to what these same Justices said in their \nsworn testimony when they were being confirmed. The Judiciary Committee \nhas explored these concerns in a series of recent hearings, and we will \nhold a hearing soon to examine the impact of the Citizens United \ndecision. This case is just the latest example of why every seat on the \nhighest court affects the lives of everyday Americans.\n  I think every one of us, as Americans, must work to ensure that the \nsystem of checks and balances envisioned by the Founders is not cast \naside by the whimsical preferences of five Justices overriding the \nrights of 300 million Americans. I look forward to working with \nPresident Obama and Senators from both sides of the aisle as we try to \nrestore the ability of every American to be heard and effectively \nparticipate in free and fair elections.\n  Again, I can only emphasize that I do not recall a time in my 36 \nyears coming here to speak about Supreme Court decisions I disagree \nwith, even though there have been many. But this is so egregious that, \nas chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would feel I was \nneglecting my duties if I did not come and speak against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to share a few comments on \nthe Sessions-McCaskill discretionary caps amendment that would limit \nspending to the budget items and budget levels we passed.\n  Before doing so, I would like to say I was disappointed last night \nthat the President and my good friend and very effective leader of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, have politicized a very important \ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Justices didn't \ntake an oath not to reverse bad precedent. They swore an oath of \nfidelity to the U.S. Constitution, and the first amendment guarantees \nthe right of free speech.\n  For over a decade, I warned against this, and others warned this \nlegislation we were passing violated the first amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution. In fact, one of the supporters of the amendment, Senator \nFeingold, at one point offered a constitutional amendment to amend the \nfirst amendment because he recognized this campaign restriction on \nspending during an election cycle ran afoul of the Constitution, but at \nsome point they decided to go forward with it.\n  I would say two things about it. How it happened was this: During \noral arguments on the showing as to whether a corporation which had \nproduced a film about one of the Presidential candidates could show \nthat film before an election and which was being blocked by the court--\nwhere they said you can't show a film about an election candidate, and \nthey objected, saying: This is free speech--the Supreme Court asked \nthis question during oral argument to the government's lawyer who was \ndefending the statute we unwisely\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\npassed, and the question was: Well, Counsel, what if a company produced \na book and wanted to publish a book, would this statute prohibit that? \nWhat was the answer? Yes.\n  Well, the Supreme Court said: Wait a minute. This is a serious thing. \nSo you--Congress--passed a law that prohibits a group of American \ncitizens from publishing a book that might have something to do with an \nelection? This is a big deal. We have laws that protect pornography and \nall kinds of things, but the first amendment was written for free \npolitical speech.\n  Anyway, I don't want to go into it today, I have talked a lot about \nit before, but I wanted to push back a little. I am very disappointed \nbecause my colleague and the President are attempting to politicize a \nvery significant first amendment issue that we knew existed when this \nbill was passed. The New York Times, which supported it, was a \ncorporation. They can write editorials on the day of an election. But \nif the Ford Motor Company gets tired of GM getting billions and \nbillions of dollars from the Federal Government, can they not run an ad \nand say: Don't do this.\n  Anyway, we will be voting soon on a very important piece of \nlegislation, and so I am pleased to be working with Senator Claire \nMcCaskill, my Democratic colleague from Missouri, to say we need to do \nbetter about spending, and we do.\n  What happens in this body is, we too often find ways to get around \nthe budgets we pass. Last year, we passed a budget that I thought spent \ntoo much, but it passed and it is our budget and it calls for spending \nover the next 5 years to have around 1 to 2 percent growth. But, \nhistorically, we have been violating that. Historically, we find this \ngimmick, this way to go above that. It is going above that, and I can \ndemonstrate how baseline increases in spending compound themselves over \nthe years and get us into serious financial trouble. What we need to do \nis stay with our budget.\n  We need to have an option to go outside the budget or above the \nbudget in case of an emergency--there is no doubt about that--but we \nhave too often been able to get around the budget through manipulation \nand through emergency spending designations. Our bill has a number of \nDemocratic Senators who are supporting it, and I think most Republicans \nwill support it. I think we have an opportunity to pass it, and it \nwould provide some integrity to our process.\n  The American people aren't trusting us. I think they are right not to \ntrust us and I am prepared to debate that. I can show they have a right \nnot to trust the budget numbers we put out because we don't stick with \nthem. So this amendment would say that for 5 years we will take the \nvery numbers that were in last year's budget--the budget we are \noperating under today--and we would place them in a statute by number. \nThe amendment would say how many millions of dollars we will allow to \nbe spent this year in defense numbers and nondefense numbers. When we \ndo that, if there comes an attempt to violate the budget and to spend \nmore, then a Senator could raise a point of order and it would take a \ntwo-thirds vote of the Senate to override that point of order.\n  I think that is good, sound legislation. Make no mistake, it will put \nsome teeth in the budget. There are those of us who know we have given \nin too often to the desire to spend more because we get multiple \ndemands from our citizens and we sometimes are unable to say: Well, I \ndo need to help you, but I am going to have to cut over here. What we \ndo say is, I can't reduce anything. Now that would make those people \nuneasy and unhappy with me. But I want to help this person, so I will \njust increase my spending and go over on the debt and over the budget \nlimit.\n\n  I am of the belief that this legislation, though modest, is very \nconsistent with the numbers President Obama talked about last night. In \nfact, I think it is almost in perfect harmony with the freeze he \nsuggested should happen last night. This would actually allow a 1- to \n2-percent increase, as I said, in defense or nondefense spending. This \nwould be the kind of thing that would be in harmony with the \nPresident's proposal.\n  The American people are cynical. We say these things--the President \nsays these things, Members of the Senate say these things--but our \nspending, when we look back at it, doesn't do so well. Last year our \ndomestic discretionary spending, the money we actually controlled in \nthe Senate, increased 12 percent, which is a number above what we can \nrealistically justify. Remember, we also had, on top of that, the \nstimulus package. A lot of that money hasn't been spent--maybe a third \nof it. That is pouring into the economy.\n  Now is the time for us to get hold of baseline spending. I believe we \ncan do it. These are some of the objections we have had about it. Would \nit prevent the Federal Government from responding to emergencies? No. I \npoint out the emergency spending bills that came up before Congress \nwere consistently passed with huge majorities. For example, the Defense \nbill on the war against terrorism and tsunami relief, 100 to 0; on \nsupplemental veterans health care, we had 99 to 1; the Katrina spending \nwas passed by unanimous vote; the second emergency for Katrina, 97 to \n0; another Katrina vote, 93 to 0; supplemental appropriations for \ndisaster loans, no budget point of order even raised; another Hurricane \nKatrina supplemental, 80 to 14; Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, \n74 to 25.\n  The votes have been high. But every one of these things does not need \nto be passed perhaps at the level initially proposed. Sometimes you may \nsupport Katrina or some other supplemental and you think the numbers \nare too high and you are going to object and the appropriators can come \nback with a smaller number and it would pass. I say that is the process \nwe work with.\n  We are violating the budget act too much. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this legislation and vote for it. Would it prevent Congress \nfrom adequately funding missions in Iraq and Afghanistan? The answer to \nthat is no. The 67-vote threshold would not apply in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and our war against al-Qaida because the amendment \nexplicitly states this rule does not apply ``in the case of the defense \nbudgetary authority, if Congress declares war or authorizes the use of \nforce,'' which we have done in these situations.\n  In wartime it does not constrict our ability. We still have to vote \nfor it and make sure we have the vote for it, but we don't have to have \na supermajority for votes. I think that is the important part of it.\n  Some would say you are attempting to balance the entire budget by \nreducing nondefense discretionary spending, which is a relatively small \npart of the budget. I would say we know this will not fully balance the \nbudget, but I can demonstrate, and have, that the growth in spending \nthat is occurring on the discretionary accounts in the last several \nyears has far exceeded the growth of Medicare and Social Security, and \nit is crowding out our ability to fund Medicare and Social Security. It \nis a threat to us, to those programs, as well as to the long-term \nfiscal status of our country.\n  Finally, I point out that I just left the Budget Committee hearing. \nMr. Elmendorf, the CBO Director, testified today and indicated that, if \nseveral more things that are likely to occur, which he did not use in \nhis calculations, take place the number would be much worse, much \nhigher. He said we are facing a critical economically threatening force \nof debt that we have to act better about. Chairman Conrad and Ranking \nMember Gregg said the same thing in their opening statements.\n  I point out what he reaffirmed, their score, that under the present \npath we are on, we now pay, in 2009, $200 billion per year in interest. \nThat is what we paid to people who loaned us money, the public debt. In \nabout 2019, 10 years, that debt will triple from $5.7 trillion to over \n$17 trillion, and the interest we pay in 1 year on that debt is $799 \nbillion.\n  When you think about it, the Federal Highway Program is about $40 \nbillion or $50 billion. The aid to education is not much more than \nthat. This is going to crowd out all kinds of spending that so many of \nmy colleagues would like to see happen. We are either going to have \nmassive increases in taxes or major reductions in spending just so we \ncan budget and pay for the interest on this debt. He says it is \nunsustainable. This is a nonpartisan person.\n  The Concord Coalition has a great focus on excessive spending in this\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\ncountry. The Concord Coalition supports the amendment that Senator \nMcCaskill and I are offering; so does the Committee for a Responsible \nFederal Budget, a great bipartisan group that has been watching budget \nissues for many years and is composed of some of the previous budget \ndirectors and experts on these matters, a very responsible, respected \ngroup. The Heritage Foundation, a solid group of conservative scholars \nwho have written persuasively about the dangers of debt, as well as the \nNational Taxpayers Union, which represents individual Americans who \nrealize the threat to our country from soaring debt and bigger and \nbigger spending, all support this legislation.\n  I think it is the kind of bipartisan legislation that will send a \nmessage not just to our Congress that we are going to contain spending \nbut also to the whole world that we are putting in place some things \nthat indicate we are going to be serious about avoiding this path we \nare on.\n  This is not made up. This is based on present commitments of the U.S. \nGovernment in law based on projections of income that we will receive \nand the spending levels that are surging. I hope our colleagues will \nseize on this. I think it will help the stock market. I think it will \nhelp our own focus. It would be a statement by Senators that we are \nserious about this, and we will work together to get it done. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the same \ntopic the last Senator spoke about. Let me, if I might, start my \ncomments today by complimenting Senator Sessions. I look at that graph \nthat was just up and the one thing it points out to me in very vivid \ndetail is that spiraling cost, that straight-up cost, is only to pay \nthe interest. It does not even start to pay down the principal.\n  I stand here today before offering some comments about this further, \nthinking how much we would unleash the potential of this country if we \njust sent a signal that we were getting serious about our spending, our \ndebt load, and we were intent on addressing that.\n  That is what brings me to the floor of the Senate today. I rise today \nto speak against raising the debt ceiling. This is a decision that \nshould not be taken lightly. No one in this body should take this \ndecision lightly. It is a serious matter, enormously serious. Our \ncountry has debt, and it is important that we start to deal with these \ncommitments and the spending that is just out of control.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: ``Pay every debt as if God wrote the \nbill.'' Yet I could not support increasing the amount that the Treasury \ncan borrow by $1.9 trillion--it is the largest increase ever \ncontemplated--in the current environment of spending the people's money \nas if it meant nothing. You see, what is missing for me, to get to a \npoint where you could raise the debt ceiling, is a commitment, a plan, \na serious plan, a roadmap on how we get our spending under control.\n  The orchestra, sadly, continues to play oblivious to our government \nbarreling down on this entitlement-and-spending iceberg which is coming \nour way. There is just no doubt about it.\n  If this increase passes, the debt limit will have increased about 35 \npercent in the last year. Think about that: 35 percent in the last \nyear. We are not talking about a few million dollars or billion \ndollars. We are talking about trillions of dollars.\n  Let me repeat that. Since this administration took the reins, our \ndebt ceiling will have increased by over one-third.\n  We as parents teach our children, we say: Money doesn't grow on \ntrees. How many times did I tell my kids that? But it seems as if the \nU.S. Government has missed this sage lesson. The latest proposed \nincrease is undoubtedly the largest increase in history, more than \ndouble the previous record of $984 billion.\n  Since arriving here I have consistently argued for setting priorities \nand against wasteful spending. I would like to say again, and I have \nsaid this on the Senate floor, as my time as Governor of Nebraska went \non I realized there were no easy choices in balancing the budget, but \nwe had a constitutional mandate to balance the budget back home in \nNebraska. What is more, our State constitution prohibited us from \nborrowing money.\n  What did that mean? I couldn't balance the budget by issuing debt. \nThis whole idea of the Federal Government issuing more and more debt \nwas a foreign concept back home.\n  When I came out here to join the President's Cabinet, I did not have \nto turn to the last Governor and say: I am sorry about all that debt I \ntook on for the State. There is no debt in Nebraska. We pay our bills. \nSince arriving here, though, I have begun to realize this government \ntries to be all things to all people every day and all day. The U.S. \nGovernment simply cannot continue on that path. We believe back home \nthat less government is better government.\n  Many of my colleagues would probably come to the floor and stand and \ndisagree with that. They may believe that you have to literally spend \nyour way out of these problems, you have to spend your way to wealth. \nBut there is nothing in our heritage that would lead me to the \nconclusion that is the right approach.\n  Even if you disagree, we can have a respectful debate. I am hard \npressed to find anyone, though, who would argue with the reality of the \nnumbers. I used to tell my cabinet when I was Governor, when we were \ndealing with tough budget issues: Look, folks, this is not magic; it is \nmath.\n  And the numbers do not lie. The numbers tell us that the Nation's \nfiscal course is not sustainable. By the end of this year, our debt \nheld by the public will be more than 60 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. Think about this. Among internationally recognized economic \nthresholds, 60 percent is generally known as the tipping point toward \nan unsustainable nation. The European Union actually treats it that \nway. You cannot even be a member of the European Union if your debt \nexceeds 60 percent of your gross domestic product. Think about this. \nThis great Nation would not be eligible to join the European Union.\n  Looking down the road, within 10 years our publicly held debt will \napproach the 90-percent mark. You see, once that snowball gets going \ndown that mountain, good luck of ever stopping the avalanche.\n  We will not be able to catch up with this runaway debt if we do not \nstart dealing with it now. We are, in my judgment, on the verge of a \nvicious cycle that requires more taxes, more debt to be taken on by \nAmerican families and sent overseas to foreign creditors. If we allow \nour country to slip into this cycle--and we are dangerously close to it \nnow--then that shining city on the hill former President Reagan would \noften speak about is more dim, if not dark.\n  Instead of voting to increase the debt limit and simply kicking the \nfiscal can down the road, we need, first, to devise some concrete \ninterventions. Unfortunately, the President's 2010 budget proposes a $1 \ntrillion deficit, on average, for each of the next 10 years. With that \nvision, debt limit increases are going to be very commonplace around \nhere. The cost of bearing such debt will swallow up our Nation's \nresources. It will diminish productivity.\n  I know the temptation is great--I saw it last night in the \nPresident's speech. I say this very respectfully--the temptation is \ngreat to say, you know, folks, these are the last guy's problems. This \nis the problem I created. All I can say is this: What that reminds me \nof would be like me becoming the mayor of Lincoln--and I served two \nterms as mayor there--and this time of the year, you have terrible \npothole problems. It would be like me saying: Those potholes there were \ncaused by the last guy. I will fix the ones that arose during my \ntenure.\n  I think what the American people are asking us to do is to start \nworking together to solve the problems. But, unfortunately, these are \nnot just potholes in the road of our Nation's history, these are \nmassive problems that are going to seriously impact our children and \ngrandchildren and bring down their quality of life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes fifty-five seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I am happy to go back and forth if \nthat would be the agreed-upon order of things. That would be certainly \nacceptable to me. I wanted to make sure what time we had on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In a little while we are going to be casting votes on an \nissue of enormous consequence, and that is whether we reappoint Ben \nBernanke as Chairman of the Fed. I am here to argue that would be a \nvery bad decision; that we should reject this nomination; that we need \nin this country a new Wall Street which understands its function is not \nsimply to make as much money as it can for extraordinarily wealthy \npeople on the Street, but to begin to interject the function of Wall \nStreet into our productive economy, make credit available to small and \nmedium-sized businesses so we can break out of this horrendous \nrecession, which is causing so much pain from one end of this country \nto the other.\n  In order to create a new Wall Street, we need a new Fed, and we need \na new Fed Chairman who is going to provide new leadership. The same \nold, same old is not going to work. Everybody in America agrees and \nunderstands that a little over 1 year ago, our Nation--in fact the \nworld's financial system--came to the edge of a major collapse.\n  Everybody also understands that the function of the Fed is to protect \nthe safety and soundness of our financial institutions. That is its \nmain function. Can anybody deny with a straight face that the Fed and \nits Chairman, Mr. Bernanke, failed at its task? They failed. This is \nnot a personal attack against Mr. Bernanke.\n  But while Wall Street became converted into the largest gambling \ncasino in the history of the world, where was Mr. Bernanke and the Fed, \nwhose job it is to protect the safety and soundness of our financial \ninstitutions? They were not there. It seems to me to be a very bad idea \nto reward somebody with reappointment who failed at an enormously \nimportant task which has driven this country into a severe recession so \nthat 17 percent of our workforce today is either unemployed or \nunderemployed.\n  Millions of our fellow Americans have lost their homes; they have \nlost their savings; they have lost their ability to send their kids to \ncollege; they have lost their hopes for the future. Mr. Bernanke failed \nat his job. He should not be rewarded with reappointment.\n  Further, many of us, after 8 years of the Bush administration, said \nit is time for a change. It is time to change the priority of this \nNation, time to move us in a new direction. The evidence is \noverwhelming that from an economic perspective as well as many other \nperspectives, the Bush administration failed.\n  Let me quote from the Washington Post earlier this month. This is \nwhat they said about the Bush economy:\n\n       The past decade was the worst for the U.S. economy in \n     modern times. It was, according to a wide range of data, a \n     lost decade.\n\n  Let me repeat.\n\n       A lost decade for American workers. There has been zero net \n     job creation since December, 1999. Middle income households \n     made less in 2008, when adjusted for inflation, than they did \n     in 1999.\n\n  A lost decade. Standard of living for American workers down, creation \nof wealth down for American workers.\n  Ben Bernanke was appointed by George W. Bush to be Chairman of the \nFed. He was a member of the Bush administration. In fact, he was the \nchairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.\n  Why do you want to reappoint someone who not only failed at his job \nas Chairman of the Fed, in terms of protecting the safety and soundness \nof our financial institutions, but was an architect of the Bush \neconomy, which was a disaster for American workers? We need a new \ndirection at the Fed.\n  It is not only looking back at the failures of Mr. Bernanke, it is \nlooking forward and saying, how can the Fed respond to begin to protect \nthe middle class and working families of our country? Here is something \nthat has not been discussed enough. The Fed today has enormous powers.\n  Many will remember that as part of the bailout, Mr. Bernanke and the \nBush administration not only pushed for a $700 billion bailout for Wall \nStreet, but on top of that Mr. Bernanke provided trillions of dollars--\nlet me underline that--trillions of dollars in zero-interest loans to \nlarge financial institutions.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I had the opportunity to ask Mr. \nBernanke which financial institutions received these trillions of \ndollars. I do not think that is an unreasonable question on behalf of \nthe American people. Mr. Bernanke said, in so many words: Sorry, \nSenator, not going to tell you. The American people do not have to know \nwho received trillions of dollars of their money. That to me is totally \nunacceptable. We need transparency at the Fed. Mr. Bernanke has not \nprovided that transparency.\n  I have introduced legislation to bring that transparency to the Fed. \nSomeone whose views are very different from mine on many issues, Ron \nPaul in the House, brought forth similar legislation. We need \ntransparency. We need a Chairman of the Fed who will give us that \ntransparency. That is something Mr. Bernanke can do tomorrow. In my \nState of Vermont, and I am sure in your state of New York, Madam \nPresident, people are calling you every single day and they are saying: \nWe are sick and tired of paying 25 or 30 percent interest rates on our \ncredit cards from the same banks and bunch of crooks that we bailed out \nwho got us into this recession in the first place.\n  Imagine that. You have people who act on Wall Street in a reckless, \nirresponsible, illegal way. Taxpayers bail them out, and they say: \nThank you, taxpayers. By the way, we are going to raise your interest \nrates on your credit cards. Have a nice day.\n  All over America, people cannot believe that. They are outraged this \nis happening. Well, you know what. Mr. Bernanke and the Fed have the \nauthority today to lower interest rates on credit cards. They could do \nthat today, and that is what they should do, because one of their \nresponsibilities is to protect consumers against outrageous and \nfraudulent activities. In my view, charging people 25 or 30 percent is \noutrageous and fraudulent and usurious.\n  All over this country--the President mentioned it last night, \nappropriately so--small and medium-sized businesses that are making a \nprofit are crying out for low-interest loans in order to expand their \nbusinesses and to hire new workers.\n  One of the great economic problems we are having as a Nation--the \nPresident touched on it last night--is the need for small productive \nbusinesses to get the low-interest loans they need.\n  Well, Mr. Bernanke was there with zero-interest loans for large, \nfailed, fraudulent, dishonestly run Wall Street firms, but he is not \nthere for small businesses all over this country that desperately need \nlow-interest loans. The Fed has the authority today--not tomorrow, \ntoday--to provide low-interest loans to small and medium-sized \nbusinesses so that we can begin to hire new workers and bring our \neconomy out of this severe recession we are currently in.\n  The reason, as I understand it, that the taxpayers of this country, \nagainst my vote, I should say, were asked to bail out the crooks on \nWall Street was because they were too big to fail. You see, if a small \nbusiness goes under, that is okay. Someone has worked their whole life \nbuilding the business, the business fails, no problem. We do not help \nthem. But if you are a big financial institution and you engage in \nreckless, illegal behavior, we bail you out because if you go down, you \nare going to take a large part of the economy with you, you are too big \nto fail.\n  Many of my colleagues might be surprised to know that three out of \nthe four largest financial institutions we bailed out because they were \ntoo big to fail are bigger today than they were before we bailed them \nout because they were too big to fail. That may make sense to somebody, \nnot to this Senator.\n  It seems to me that what common sense suggests is that we break up \nthese large financial institutions so, A, the American people are never \nagain put in the position of having to bail them out because they are \ntoo big to\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nfail and, B, that we begin to understand what Teddy Roosevelt \nunderstood 100 years ago: concentration of ownership is dangerous for \nthe economy.\n  Today, we have four major banks providing two-thirds of the credit \ncards in the country--four major financial institutions, two-thirds of \nall credit cards. We have four financial institutions writing half of \nall the mortgages in America. That is wrong. Break up the large \nfinancial institutions.\n  Ben Bernanke has the ability to begin to do that tomorrow. I have not \nheard one word from him to suggest he will do so.\n  The American people are angry. The American people are frustrated. \nWhat they are angry and frustrated about is that in many instances, \nthey are working longer hours for lower wages than they used to, if \nthey are fortunate enough to have a job. The American people are \nfrustrated and angry because this immediate financial crisis and severe \nrecession was caused by the recklessness and irresponsibility of a \nhandful of people on Wall Street. The American people are frustrated \nand angry because they are not seeing the kind of accountability and \nchange in terms of the activities on Wall Street they expect and demand \nto happen. Quite the contrary. After having bailed out people who acted \nin an illegal and irresponsible way, what they are seeing is Wall \nStreet pumping millions of dollars into campaign contributions and \nlobbying so that we can bring them back to where they were before the \nbailout.\n  The American people want change in the way our financial institutions \nrun. The American people want change at the Fed. I believe the American \npeople want a new Chairman or Chairwoman at the Fed. Now is the time to \nsay to the American people: We hear you. We are going to bring about \nchange. We are going to deny the reappointment of Ben Bernanke as \nChairman. We are going to ask President Obama to give us a new nominee \nwho will stand up for the middle class and working class of this \ncountry rather than for the big-money interests on Wall Street.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add the \nfollowing cosponsors to my amendment No. 3309: Senators Barrasso, \nCrapo, and Johanns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S280-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CARFA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, the CARFA bill that will be voted on \nshortly has passed this Senate every Congress since the 107th Congress. \nIt has either passed by rollcall vote or unanimous consent. This is \nnothing new. It has passed this body multiple times. Now it counts. Now \nwhen people vote on it, this will count. The CARFA bill breaks the \nFederal Government into four pieces. A fourth of the Federal Government \nis looked at each year, and then recommendations are made in a \nprivileged motion that must be voted on. It is a spending commission. \nIt is targeted at reducing Federal spending, which is clearly where the \nAmerican public wants us to go. They don't want to raise taxes; they \nwant to focus on getting wasteful spending under control.\n  This is a mechanism we have done before. It is a mechanism that has \npassed this Congress multiple times in the budget agreement. This time \nit counts. I ask my colleagues to look at this and say: If you voted \nfor it in the past, do it now. We clearly need to do it.\n  Last night, the President spoke about the need to track the deficit. \nHe was clear that we need to get the deficit under control. The first \nstep in getting the deficit under control is to reduce spending, get \nspending under control.\n  Here is the latest chart on the gross Federal debt as a percentage of \nthe GDP. This year, we passed the 90-percent threshold of debt to the \neconomy. So of the total economy size, about $14 trillion, 90 percent \nof that is going to be gross debt. This is publicly and privately held \ndebt combined. This is the level at which economists say this starts \nhurting the economy. It can drive down growth as much as 4 percent per \nyear. We have had many years where we haven't even had 4 percent \ngrowth. We could put ourselves in negative growth by carrying this \nlevel of debt. And we blew through that number this year, headed toward \n100 percent of debt to GDP. That is this year's number. That is the one \nthat is just out.\n  Here is a breakdown of that. Some will say we are at 60 percent debt \nto economic activity. That is of the publicly held debt. That is the \npiece the Chinese own, and others. But if we look at total debt--this \nis what we owe to ourselves, the Social Security trust fund, other \ntrust funds that I think we ought to pay back--we ought to be \nresponsible with that. That is way up here, up over the 90-percent \nlevel. It is in the danger zone. It is time to get it under control.\n  CARFA is the way to do it. CARFA is a simple mechanism. It is eight \npeople appointed, four by this body, four by the House. It makes \nrecommendations on elimination of programs. Those must pass by six of \nthe eight members who vote on that. That then is reported to the \ncommittee structure that is in the applicable areas of the \nrecommendations for elimination. The committee has 30 days to review \nthe recommendations. They can't amend it, but they can review the \nrecommendations, say to the public: Here is what this is going to do if \nwe make these cuts. Then it is subject to a privileged motion. The \nactual report comes before the body as a privileged motion. There is 10 \nhours of debate before we go to the bill. Then there is debate on the \nbill and a required vote with a 51-vote margin to pass it. That is all \nin the statute. This is the BRAC process, the Base Closure and \nRealignment Commission process used in the past to close military bases \nand to save us $60 billion annually in spending on military bases, \nclosing down bases, putting them in more efficient alignment. This will \ndo the same at the Federal level.\n  It is not as if we don't have wasteful spending at the Federal level. \nThis chart shows the scorecard the OMB does on Federal spending by \nagencies. We can see a bunch of agencies get Ds or Fs on program \nreviews. The Department of Labor, Department of Education get Fs on \ntheir spending as far as its utility and for what it was targeted to \ndo. If we have entire agencies rated at F or D or D-minus, don't you \nthink there are a few programs in there that ought to be eliminated and \nthat probably we can do without, without hurting the overall government \nor people or the economy? Absolutely. That is what the American people \nare screaming for us to do. They don't want us to raise taxes; they \nwant us to cut spending. That is what the public is doing in this \nprocess. This is very clearly the process we should follow.\n  This is the time that this vote counts. My colleagues have been \nwilling to support this concept in the budget resolution. Now is the \ntime that it would have the force of law, if we are able to get it \nthrough. This is one the public is going to hear more and more about, \nas everybody gets focused on spending and what we need to do there. \nThis will be the type of process that we need to do and that we need to \nuse.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the CARFA amendment, and I would hope my \ncolleagues would put that in the bill so we can get a process by which \nwe could legitimately start cutting Federal spending in a responsible \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S280-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S280-S291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           INCREASING THE STATUTORY LIMIT ON THE PUBLIC DEBT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kansas.\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I understand I have 2 minutes to speak on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to show two other charts. This \nis not new information, but I think it is pretty dramatic in its \npresentation, the level of the massive addition of Federal debt at \nlevels we have never seen before. We are looking at $1.4 trillion in \ndeficits. That is the annual addition. We have not seen numbers this \nsize before. We haven't seen these percentages since World War II, the \nmassive war effort we went into in World War II.\n  This is a critical situation at a critical time, and it must be \naddressed. The answer isn't to just extend the line of credit, which is \nwhat this bill--the base bill extends the line of credit by $1.9 \ntrillion. It is nice that we have the ability to say: OK, we will have \nthe line of credit extended by $1.9 trillion, but it doesn't address \nthis, it just allows this to go on.\n  The CARFA bill gets at this line and starts cutting that. It starts \ncutting irresponsible Federal programs. It starts cutting duplicative \nFederal programs and programs that have accomplished their purposes. We \nhave things we are funding that were started 50, 100 years ago, and \nthey have actually accomplished what they were supposed to do and ought \nto be terminated. Yet they don't get terminated because there is no \nculling process that goes on. The Federal Government hasn't cut its own \nfunding system for 100 years.\n  When I first came to Congress, we made a 1-year cut in Federal \nspending of 1 percent from one year to the next year. We eliminated \nsome 200, 300 Federal programs. I used to give a speech asking people: \nDo you remember any of those programs we cut? Can you name two? I would \npay people $10 if they could name two we eliminated. They heard about \nthe ice being delivered to Members' offices, so they got that one. But \nthey could never get a second one. Think of the number of programs that \nare rated as failing that we could eliminate and nobody would notice. \nThey would applaud the fact that we were actually cutting Federal \nspending which has been very difficult for this body to get done. Here \nis a mechanism with which we can get it done.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the day before yesterday, the Senate \nvoted on the amendment offered by the chairman and ranking Republican \nmember of the Budget Committee to create a budget commission. The \nSenate rejected that amendment. The proponents fell 7 votes short of \nthe 60 votes they needed.\n  I opposed that amendment because it would have forced the Senate to \nconsider the commission's recommendations using a fasttrack process. It \nwould have outsourced our job to the commission.\n  The Senator from Kansas proposes a commission that also would create \na fasttrack process. It would also put vital programs like Medicare, \nfarm programs, and veterans' programs in the crosshairs. Thus, all who \nopposed the Conrad-Gregg commission on process grounds should oppose \nthis amendment for the same reasons.\n  As well, the Brownback commission would address only the spending \nside of the budget. So those who wanted a broader commission should \nhave that reason to oppose this commission, as well.\n  I have been advised that the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad, joins me in opposing this commission.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to take a minute to speak in \nfavor of this amendment. This should not be as hard as it appears. All \nthis amendment is doing is asking us to live up to our vote last year \non the budget bill. What we all decided to do last year on the budget \nbill was set some limits on spending for the next few years. All we are \ndoing with this amendment is saying we are going to have to live up to \nour vote. It has 2 percent increases every year.\n  People have said there is going to be a problem because of the 67-\nvote threshold. Well, I have looked over the emergency votes we have \nhad in this Chamber and there has not been a time when we haven't \ngotten them--on Katrina or other things. It exempts anytime Congress \nauthorizes force. I wish to emphasize that for my colleagues. Anytime \nCongress has authorized force of our military, it exempts it.\n  Somebody spoke about the veterans. Do my colleagues think we can't \nget 67 votes for the veterans in this Chamber?\n  Seriously, it is time we begin to live up to what we say, and in the \nbudget bill we all voted to do this. So let's put it in the law as we \nhad in the 1990s. Don't ask me why we let it expire in 2002. I wasn't \nhere. But we had both pay-go and this kind of freeze in the 1990s and \nwe balanced the budget and we created a surplus. Let's go back to that \ntime for the sake of our grandchildren.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, let's make it clear. This is not the \nplan the President presented last evening. The President allows growth \nin Homeland Security. This amendment does not. The President's proposal \ndoesn't put a cap on emergency spending. Yes, we have decided certain \nthings are an emergency. Yet it doesn't mean that all of us will agree. \nHe doesn't put a cap on that.\n  The President's plan will request more than $700 billion for Defense. \nThis amendment allocates $614 billion. To exceed this amount, we need \n60 votes. Does the Senate want to make the Defense budget subject to 60 \nvotes?\n  As chairman of the committee, I agree that everyone should tighten \ntheir belts. The problem with this amendment is that all the tightening \nwill be done on a small portion of the budget, while the revenues and \nmandatory spending will still be unchecked.\n  This is a flawed amendment. It is not the President's plan. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

On this vote, the yeas are 56, the nays are \n44. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nthree votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3305\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let's not kid ourselves. We are in this \nfinancial situation and these pay-as-you-go rules are necessary because \nwe spent the last decade spending money we did not have. We spent \ntrillions on two wars, tax breaks for millionaires, corporations, and \nother red ink policies. Those days should be over. We simply can no \nlonger afford it.\n  The idea behind pay-as-you-go is very simple. The rule we are \nproposing for the government is the same one Americans use every day in \ntheir individual lives, the same ones we teach our children: In order \nto spend a dollar, we have to have that dollar in our wallet. This law \nwill enforce that commonsense approach.\n  Here is what it does not do. It does not block emergency spending. It \ndoes not keep businesses from creating jobs. And it does not prevent \nCongress from cutting taxes.\n  For all the Republican rhetoric on sensible spending, their recent \nchoices call their seriousness into serious question. We drafted a \nhealth reform bill to reduce the deficit by as much as $1.3 trillion \nover the next 20 years. That is a fiscally responsible plan, and zero \nRepublicans supported it.\n  Senators Conrad and Gregg proposed a commission with the explicit \nresponsibility of reducing our deficit even further. That is a fiscally \nresponsible plan. And seven Republicans--I repeat, seven Republicans--\nvoted no, even though they sponsored the legislation.\n  The legislation we voted on, the Conrad-Gregg amendment, would have \ncreated an entitlement commission to look at what is wrong with the \nfinancial condition of this country, and seven Republicans who \nsupported that amendment by offering their name as cosponsors of it \nvoted against it. Had we had six of those seven votes for that \nlegislation--I will use leader time--had six of the seven voted for \nthat legislation, it would have passed. We would now have a commission. \nIt would have been similar to what we did with the base closings. We \ndid some terrific things with base closings that we could never have \ndone but for that legislation. But I repeat, seven Republicans who \ncosponsored the legislation voted against it.\n  The American people can see right through that doublespeak. I am \nconfident, as we all are, that they are tired of it.\n  As the President pointed out last night, pay-as-you-go in the 1990s \nled to record surpluses. Its absence in the next decade led to record \ndeficits.\n  The road back to economic recovery is a long one. If we are to travel \nit successfully and prudently, if we are to create jobs and government \nresponsibility, pay-as-you-go must be one of the rules of that road.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, first, I thank the Democratic leader, the \nmajority leader, for his endorsement of the Conrad-Gregg initiative, \nalthough that is not what this amendment is about.\n  This amendment is about pay-go. Pay-go is one of those terms of art \naround here that has a political life of its own, and its political \nlife is independent of its substantive action.\n  Yes, pay-go worked when we had it in the nineties. We had a Congress \nwhich was willing to enforce it. Regrettably, over the last 2 years, \nwhen pay-go has been in place as a budgetary item--not much different \nthan doing it statutorily--pay-go has been waived by the majority of \nthis Senate and specifically by the majority party on an incredible \nnumber of occasions. It has been waived. It has been gamed. It has been \ngone around. It has been stepped on. It has been ignored to the tune of \n$1 trillion. Madam President, $1 trillion of spending has occurred in \nthe last 2\\1/2\\ years which should have been subject to a pay-go point \nof order, which should not have survived a pay-go point of order but \nagainst which no pay-go point of order was made because pay-go was \ngamed.\n  The idea that pay-go is a substantive exercise around here is \npolitically inaccurate. It is political fraud. I mean, basically, pay-\ngo is used to make a statement that you are going to be fiscally \nresponsible, but it does not happen.\n  This is a nice political cover vote. I am going to vote for pay-go, \nand I am going to be tough on spending when, in fact, we know that \nwhenever an item comes to this floor for all intents and purposes that \nshould be subject to a pay-go point of order, it is not. Pay-go is not \npay-go. Pay-go is Swiss-cheese-go. It is full of holes.\n  I have great respect for the other side of the aisle. So if they will \nrename this Swiss-cheese-go, I may vote for it. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that we change the name of pay-go to Swiss-cheese-go, \nand then I might be willing to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will use leader time.\n  This is not the time for being funny. This is a time for addressing \nthe problems we have in this country with a debt that is going on and \non.\n  No one can dispute what I said, and that is, during the nineties when \nwe had pay-go, record deficits were gone. Because of pay-go, we created \na situation in this country where we were spending less money as a \ngovernment than we were taking in.\n  Think about that. As a result of that, we had unending optimism by \nthe business community and economic growth that has been unparalleled. \nSo this is not a time for jokes. This is a time for addressing a \nserious problem.\n  My friend, who has the knowledge of the financial situation of this \ncountry as much as anyone in the country, knows this is not a time for \njokes and trying to be funny. We have a situation in America today that \ncalls for action. Of course, we can waive the pay-go rules if there is \nan emergency, but it is up to this body to determine if there is an \nemergency.\n  I hope everyone understands this legislation does not block emergency \nspending, it does not keep businesses from creating jobs, and it does \nnot prevent Congress from cutting taxes. I hope Republicans will join \nwith us in restoring fiscal stability to our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. REID. Time is up.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not the leader, so I do not get leader time. I ask \nunanimous consent for another minute so I might respond to the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, a little humor even in serious times does \nnot hurt things, I do not think. The point is substantive, even if it \nwas humorously presented, which is that pay-go around here has become \nfarcical. It\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\nis not used to discipline our budget process at all. That is why over \n$1 trillion of spending has resulted which should have been subject to \npay-go points of order.\n  I do not think you can present a pay-go statutory point of order as \nbeing something other than what it will be, which is basically \nsomething so full of holes it will have virtually no effect on our \ncapacity to discipline ourselves because we have already shown we do \nnot discipline ourselves under the present pay-go rules we have. From \nmy standpoint, this proposal does not hold water as a way to discipline \nourselves and bring our fiscal house in order.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the leader in allowing me to take an \nextra minute. I did not hear him object to my offer, but I will \nwithdraw it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I cannot support this pay-go amendment \nbecause it would continue the double-standard that exists between taxes \nand spending. Under current law, more than a dozen mandatory programs \nwill expire over the next 10 years. Extending these programs will cost \nnearly $1 trillion according to CBO. But, unlike tax cuts that expire \nduring these same years, pay-go does not apply to the cost of extending \nthese mandatory programs. This double standard is unacceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, pay-go, as we are attempting to legislate, \nhas not been in effect. That is what we are trying to do. That is why \nthis legislation is so vitally important. I appreciate the work of the \nBudget Committee and the Finance Committee getting us to the point we \nare today with the legislation we are attempting to pass.\n  We are going to bring about in this country something that people can \nunderstand. They are going to understand that we are going to proceed \nin this body as they do paying their car payment, their housing \npayment. That is what we are trying to do. That is what this \nlegislation is for.\n  I am terribly disappointed in my Republican colleagues. Let's join \nand do something good for this country as it relates to the economy. \nThis is a step in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are 4 minutes, equally divided, prior to \na vote on amendment No. 3299 offered by the Senator from Montana.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the next amendment is about whether the \nUnited States will pay its bills. It is about whether the United States \nwill continue to pay the interest it owes on the money it has borrowed. \nThe spending laws that created the debt are behind us. The only \nquestion remaining is whether the government will honor its obligation \nto pay the bill. We have gone to the restaurant, we have eaten the \nmeal, and now the only question is whether we will pay the check. It is \nthat simple.\n  If Congress does not enact this legislation, the Treasury will \ndefault on its debt for the first time in American history, which means \nlower Social Security payments for a portion of those beneficiaries, \nand we would fail to pay full pay benefits to a portion of the \nbeneficiaries of all other Federal programs.\n  But that would pale in comparison to the cataclysmic result in the \nfinancial markets if we don't honor our obligation. The value of \nTreasuries would plummet, leaving 401(k) plans and investors holding \nmuch less value. The value of the dollar would decline significantly. \nUltimately, the question of America's sovereignty and the degree to \nwhich we are controlling our future would be in doubt and other \ncountries would be dictating the results and telling us what to do.\n  We must pay our bills; we must pay our debts; we must vote for this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Montana is right. We have to pay our \nbills. But we also have to make it clear we are not going to continue \nto run up bills we can't pay for. It is not responsible to raise the \ndebt ceiling in this manner if we aren't going to put in place any \nresponsible activity to bring under control the rising debt, and there \nis no proposal here to do that--in fact, just the opposite. The \nproposal from the administration, and passed by this Congress, was a \nbudget that will increase the debt every year for the next 10 years by \nover $1 trillion, on average.\n  There is no proposal to bring that down. The debt will double in 5 \nyears. It will triple in 10 years under the budget passed by the \nDemocratic leadership of this Congress and the President's budget. That \nis not fiscal discipline.\n  To raise the debt ceiling by $1.9 trillion while doing nothing to \naddress the debt and how it is being added to is totally irresponsible. \nIt is like a drunken sailor asking to have the bar open all night.\n  Why are we going to this number, by the way? Why $1.9 trillion? So \nthat the Congress does not have to face up to the debt ceiling before \nthe next election. We ought to have to face up to it again before the \nnext election because the people of this country have a right to know \nwhether this Congress is going to do something about controlling the \nrate of growth of the debt before the next election.\n  Instead, we are seeing this attempt to try to take this off the table \nby moving it past the next election. The American people do not believe \nit should be off the table. That is what Massachusetts was all about. \nThey are worried about this debt. They are worried about what we are \ndoing to the next generation of Americans--to our children--by running \nup this debt.\n  This is not correct. We should not vote for this massive increase in \nthe debt ceiling until we get some responsible action around here on \nthe issue of how we are going to control the debt and deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are \n40. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nis considered made and laid on the table.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, 2 days ago, Senator Coburn offered a \nseries of amendments to the debt ceiling bill requiring $120 billion in \nfunding cuts, including $1.3 billion from the State Department. During \nthe debate on those cuts, Senator Coburn stated that the ``foreign ops \nappropriations increased by . . . 33 percent last year.''\n  If that were accurate, I would share the Senator's concern. But when \nthe Senator purports to speak for the American people, as he often \ndoes, he should stick to the facts.\n  The Senator surely knew that by suggesting the State and Foreign \nOperations budget increased by 33 percent in a single year he was \ndistorting the actual increase, and that he was not counting the \nbillions in supplemental funding for these programs in fiscal year \n2009, every dollar of which was added to the Federal deficit and will \nhave to be paid in future years because the former Republican \nadministration wanted to pretend to be spending less.\n  In its fiscal year 2010 budget, the Obama administration, responding \nto pressure from Congress, stopped the budget gimmickry of funding \nongoing programs like aid for Iraq, year after year, in off budget \n``emergency'' supplementals. Instead, the President requested funding \nfor these programs in its regular fiscal year 2010 budget. If you \ncompare the fiscal year 2010 budget request with the fiscal year 2009 \nbudget request minus the fiscal year 2009 supplemental funding, as the \nSenator from Oklahoma did, you obviously get a distorted result that \nsuggests a much bigger increase than actually occurred. It makes a \ngreat talking point, it sparks cries of outrage, but it is not what \nactually occurred.\n  The actual increase for State and Foreign Operations from fiscal year \n2009 to fiscal year 2010, if you count regular budget and supplemental \nappropriations, was 9 percent. And the bulk of that increase was for \nglobal health programs, to combat HIV/AIDS and H1N1, for humanitarian \ncrises such as the funds we are using to save lives in Haiti today, and \nfor personnel to fill vacancies at embassies and USAID missions around \nthe world that have been short staffed--some by as much as 20 percent--\ndue to transfers of personnel to priority posts such as Iraq and \nAfghanistan. These increases were supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  As I said during the debate on the Coburn amendments, there may be \nprograms that are not achieving the results they should and which can \nbe eliminated. No one wants to waste money that could be better spent. \nBut Senator Gregg, the ranking member, and I spend a good deal of time \neach year making the difficult choices that Senator Coburn declined to \nmake when he proposed his 5-percent cut. It is easy to sit on the \nsidelines and accuse others of overspending when you do not take \nresponsibility for determining what the actual needs are, and decide \nwhich programs to fund and which not to fund, whether they are \nrequested by the President or by other Senators. If we had funded them \nall, we would have spent two or three times our allocation. We always \nstay within our allocation, which in fiscal year 2010 was close to $900 \nmillion below the President's budget. And we did it with no earmarks.\n  So let's be honest about the budget. There was nothing close to a 33-\npercent increase last year, and it is important to set the record \nstraight.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, our Nation faces unprecedented fiscal and \neconomic challenges. This situation did not happen overnight. It did \nnot happen in 2009. It is a situation created by 8 years of \nmismanagement and complacency under President Bush. For a decade, the \neasy replaced the difficult, and instead of seizing the chance in 2001 \nto wipe out our national debt, President Bush and his supporters went \nin the opposite direction. They focused on the short term, they \nencouraged lax regulatory oversight, particularly of financial markets, \nand they adopted an economic doctrine that called for borrowing to fund \nvirtually every major Presidential initiative--tax cuts that were \nskewed toward the rich, difficult and costly wars in Iraq and in \nAfghanistan, and a prescription drug program that failed to negotiate \ncosts with drugmakers and still leaves many seniors without coverage.\n  Let's be clear: When President Bush took office, he was handed a \nprojected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion, which was quickly frittered \naway. In 8 years, the Bush administration added more debt than all the \nprevious administrations combined, all the while middle-income \nhouseholds saw their earning power decline.\n  Due to these failed and irresponsible economic and fiscal policies, \nthe Obama administration inherited the worst recession since the 1930s \nand a $1.3 trillion budget deficit. It should be no surprise to anyone \nthat President Obama and Congress cannot reverse this mountain of bad \ndecisions and deficits in a year, but we have been trying. Indeed, \naccording to the very same nonpartisan agency, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, that predicts our budget deficit for this year, the health care \nreform bill the Senate passed reduced health care spending and would \nhave cut the deficit by $130 billion in the first 10 years and over $1 \ntrillion over 20 years. We also had to take action on a recovery bill \nthat kept States from cutting police, firemen, and teachers, gave our \nGovernors funds to repair and rebuild our infrastructure, and provided \n$288 billion in tax cuts to help middle-class families and businesses \ndeal with the recession. These were not easy steps, but they were the \nright steps, and it is fair to note that the other side of the aisle's \nanswer to these proposals has been to oppose these measures and offer \nno coherent alternative.\n  Today, because of the shortcomings of the Bush administration and the \nrecession that started in December 2007, we face the question of \nwhether we want to default on the government's financial obligations to \nSocial Security recipients and those who have purchased U.S. bonds. If \nwe follow the course proposed by the other side of the aisle and vote \nno, the outcome is an even worse economic situation. Ask any economist \nof any background whether the government should default on its \nobligation and the answer is a resounding no. Yet that is what is \nproposed by too many here in the Senate. Although it is troubling to \nhave to raise the debt to pay for a series of irresponsible choices, \ntax cuts, and a war in Iraq--all of which I opposed--it would be \nirresponsible to reject this measure.\n  There is no doubt that we need to address the long-term fiscal \nchallenges facing our Nation. However, we should not lose sight of the \nfact that producing a budget is not merely adjusting numbers on a \nledger; it is allocating resources to serve people. Today, our first \norder of business has to be ensuring that economic recovery has taken \nroot. While some areas of the country have shown signs of recovery, \nmost Americans have not seen the benefits. In places such as Rhode \nIsland, where State governments lack the resources to help people who \nare struggling to deal with crushing unemployment levels, the need for \nFederal assistance remains great.\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\n  To balance the budget, we will have to make very difficult decisions, \nbut many of us here have made them before. In 1993, without any support \nfrom congressional Republicans, Democrats made the tough decisions and \ntook politically difficult votes that brought the budget surpluses that \nwere handed off to President Bush 8 years later and then quickly \nsquandered. Through the tough decisions we made, we were able to not \nonly turn the economy around but eliminate deficit spending and cut the \ndebt. Indeed, I remember that in 2001 some on the other side used the \nargument that we were paying off the government's debt too quickly as \none reason they supported President Bush's reckless tax cuts for the \nwealthiest. And I stand ready to work with those who want to do the \nhard work of making the compromises that are necessary when it comes to \nspending and revenues. I am ready to support a pay-go rule that says \nyou cannot pass a new bill without offsetting its costs, and I would \nurge my colleagues to reconsider the largess of the last farm bill, the \nmultibillion dollar giveaway to ethanol makers, and the host of tax \ncuts for oil companies and companies that shift American jobs overseas.\n  It is instructive to remember that in 1993 the challenge was met, as \nit should have been, through the normal legislative process, not by \nhanding off the tough choices to a deficit commission. Congress can do \nbetter than give its responsibilities to a commission whose \nrecommendations would very likely tilt toward cuts in programs that are \ncrucial to our seniors and our young people. At the same time, the \nrecord shows that similar commissions have been unsuccessful in the \npast. It is only when elected representatives tackle the tough issues \nthat we see positive results. Conversely, when these issues are \nignored, as they were during the last administration, we see how \nquickly fiscal responsibility can unravel.\n  President Obama and this Democratic-led Congress have already begun \nto take the hard and decisive steps to get our fiscal house in order. \nIn response to skyrocketing health care costs, the Senate passed a \nhealth care bill that would meet President Obama's goal of reducing \nhealth care spending below projected levels, reining in the deficit by \n$132 billion over the next 10 years and by up to $1.6 trillion over the \nnext 20 years.\n  We have a difficult series of choices before us. Yet we can respond \nto the crisis of the moment and get our Nation on a path of fiscal \nsoundness.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I came to the floor a little more than a \nmonth ago to discuss perhaps one of the most critical issues facing our \ngreat country: the skyrocketing national debt. I had hoped that once \nDemocrats went home and heard the concerns of their constituents, they \nwould return to Washington with a new perspective. Believe me, I heard \nfrom Nevadans in the townhall meetings I held this month that increased \nspending and more debt is simply not acceptable.\n  Voters in Massachusetts echoed those same feelings last week when \nthey voted to put a stop to a bloated health care bill and protest out-\nof-control spending. I don't see how the message can be any clearer. \nThe debt we are accumulating is unsustainable; it will bankrupt this \nNation and force future generations to suffer for our fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  Based on the votes today on the Senate floor, it appears that \nDemocrats have decided to turn a deaf ear to the concerns of American \nvoters. We have voted to raise the debt limit once again to make room \nfor more spending. Ironically, the debt limit was put into place to \nprovide Congress with constitutional control of the American purse \nstrings. The debt limit was designed as a form of fiscal accountability \nto be used by the President and Congress to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment does not spend or borrow more than it collects in revenue.\n  I, along with many Americans, have tried to impose this simple yet \nvital rule to our children. Don't spend more than you can afford. Don't \ngo into debt. But Congress is teaching them the exact opposite lesson: \nspend what you want and someone else will take care of it.\n  Although the debt limit has increased regularly over the years in \norder to accommodate annual Federal deficits, it has absolutely \nskyrocketed in the last several years. For example, from 1996 to 2002, \nthe debt limit increased by 16 percent. But from 2003 to 2009 the debt \nlimit increased 84 percent. And if we pass this legislation before us, \nthe total increase from 2002 to January of 2010 will be over 120 \npercent.\n  I would like to recap the last month and a half with regard to the \ndebt limit. It was raised by $290 billion in December of last year. \nToday, the Senate Democrats voted to raise the debt limit by another \n$1.9 trillion. After just 1 year in office, the Obama administration's \nspending has left American families in quite the financial hole. Since \nhis inauguration, the national debt has increased by $1.7 trillion.\n  And when you look at the burden on hard-working American families, \nthe news is just as bad. The Federal debt per household in 2009 was \n$68,000, and that is projected to increase to $137,000 in 2019 under \nthe Obama administration's budget. Nevadans are hurting enough right \nnow--they don't need this added burden. Under the Democrats' \nleadership, debt limit increases will become a regular occurrence. The \ndebt subject to limit is projected to grow to $24.5 trillion by 2019.\n  This vote accomplishes only one thing: passing the responsibility for \npaying for the massive spending to future generations. We need to do \nbetter than that--we need to think of our grandchildren's future when \ndeciding how to vote.\n  Democrats claim the massive spending this year was necessary because \nof the ``Republican recession,'' but the Democrats' wasteful spending \nthis year does too little to create jobs. In fact, since President \nObama's inauguration the private sector has lost 3.4 million jobs.\n  And Nevada right now is going through an unprecedented economic \ndownturn. Our unemployment rate just went up again to 13 percent, and \nthat number doesn't account for those who have stopped looking for \nwork. We have to stop this spending and start focusing on the real \nsolution to the slow economy--jobs.\n  Witin 5 years, Democratic policies will more than double the amount \nof debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2008 and will more \nthan triple it by 2019, according to both OMB and CBO estimates. A \nsingle Obama term will add about as much new debt held by the public as \nall other Presidents in U.S. history combined. That statistic should be \nshocking to everyone, even to the current White House.\n  And we should all remember that this debt is only one part of the \ncrisis. The Federal Government has promised more than $70 trillion in \nentitlements that it cannot pay for. That is a staggering number.\n  Between Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other liabilities, \neach American household shoulders roughly $600,000 in IOUs. That is \nseparate and apart from each household's share of the national debt. \nKeep in mind that this does not include health care reform.\n  And where is all this borrowed money coming from? Well, almost half \nof it comes from foreign countries. China is our country's largest \nforeign creditor, holding roughly 10 percent of our Nation's debt. And \nlike any loan that you or I would get at the local bank, the Chinese \ndon't lend money for free. Federal interest payment on foreign-owned \ndebt has nearly doubled since 2000. We are sending a whole lot of \ntaxpayer money abroad.\n  Today, I introduced a bill, the Commission for Fiscal Sustainability \nAct of 2010, to take an effective step toward a solution. This \nlegislation would establish a commission with the goal of fiscal \nsustainability to guarantee the long-term fiscal strength and economic \nsecurity of the United States. The legislation would require that the \ncommission focus solely on recommendations to decrease Federal spending \nwithout the need for tax increases.\n  Now we hear of a new proposal from the White House to freeze \ndiscretionary spending. I am hopeful that President Obama is sincere in \nhis desire to freeze spending, but I find it very hard to believe that \nhe will be able to contain the fiscally irresponsible Democratic \nmajority which has yet to show restraint in this area.\n  I don't like to sound pessimistic because this is the greatest \ncountry in the history of the world. And I truly\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\nbelieve that. And I believe that these challenges can be solved. But we \nmust act. We must show leadership--fiscally conservative leadership and \nstop this out of control spending. American families have had to make \ntough choices to balance their budget. They understand that they cannot \nhave it all. But we in Congress want to have it all--even when we can't \npay for it. That is simply unsustainable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 4 minutes of debate on passage.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think we all know where we are.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Statutory Pay-As-You-Go \n     Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to reestablish a statutory \n     procedure to enforce a rule of budget neutrality on new \n     revenue and direct spending legislation.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS AND APPLICATIONS.\n\n       As used in this title--\n       (1) The term ``BBEDCA'' means the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (2) The definitions set forth in section 3 of the \n     Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and \n     in section 250 of BBEDCA shall apply to this title, except to \n     the extent that they are specifically modified as follows:\n       (A) The term ``outyear'' means a fiscal year one or more \n     years after the budget year.\n       (B) In section 250(c)(8)(C), the reference to the food \n     stamp program shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n       (3) The term ``AMT'' means the Alternative Minimum Tax for \n     individuals under sections 55-59 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, the term ``EGTRRA'' means the Economic Growth and \n     Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-16), \n     and the term ``JGTRRA'' means the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief \n     and Reconciliation Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-27).\n       (4)(A) The term ``budgetary effects'' means the amount by \n     which PAYGO legislation changes outlays flowing from direct \n     spending or revenues relative to the baseline and shall be \n     determined on the basis of estimates prepared under section \n     4. Budgetary effects that increase outlays flowing from \n     direct spending or decrease revenues are termed ``costs'' and \n     budgetary effects that increase revenues or decrease outlays \n     flowing from direct spending are termed ``savings''. \n     Budgetary effects shall not include any costs associated with \n     debt service.\n       (B) For purposes of these definitions, off-budget effects \n     shall not be counted as budgetary effects.\n       (C) Solely for purposes of recording entries on a PAYGO \n     scorecard, provisions in appropriation Acts are also \n     considered to be budgetary effects for purposes of this title \n     if such provisions make outyear modifications to substantive \n     law, except that provisions for which the outlay effects net \n     to zero over a period consisting of the current year, the \n     budget year, and the 4 subsequent years shall not be \n     considered budgetary effects. For purposes of this paragraph, \n     the term, ``modifications to substantive law'' refers to \n     changes to or restrictions on entitlement law or other \n     mandatory spending contained in appropriations Acts, \n     notwithstanding section 250(c)(8) of BBEDCA. Provisions in \n     appropriations Acts that are neither outyear modifications to \n     substantive law nor changes in revenues have no budgetary \n     effects for purposes of this title.\n       (5) The term ``debit'' refers to the net total amount, when \n     positive, by which costs recorded on the PAYGO scorecards for \n     a fiscal year exceed savings recorded on those scorecards for \n     that year.\n       (6) The term ``entitlement law'' refers to a section of law \n     which provides entitlement authority.\n       (7) The term ``PAYGO legislation'' or a ``PAYGO Act'' \n     refers to a bill or joint resolution that affects direct \n     spending or revenue relative to the baseline. The budgetary \n     effects of changes in revenues and outyear modifications to \n     substantive law included in appropriation Acts as defined in \n     paragraph (4) shall be treated as if they were contained in \n     PAYGO legislation or a PAYGO Act.\n       (8) The term ``timing shift'' refers to a delay of the date \n     on which outlays flowing from direct spending would otherwise \n     occur from the ninth outyear to the tenth outyear or an \n     acceleration of the date on which revenues would otherwise \n     occur from the tenth outyear to the ninth outyear.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The \n     timely submission of such a statement, in conjunction with \n     the appropriate designation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) \n     or (1)(B), as applicable, shall establish the budgetary \n     effects of the PAYGO Act for the purposes of this Act.\n       (ii) Effect.--The latest statement submitted by the \n     Chairman of the Budget Committee of that House prior to \n     passage shall supersede any prior statements submitted in the \n     Congressional Record and shall be valid only if the PAYGO Act \n     is not further amended by either House.\n       (iii) Failure to submit estimate.--If--\n\n       (I) the estimate required by clause (i) has not been \n     submitted prior to passage by that House;\n       (II) such estimate has been submitted but is no longer \n     valid due to a subsequent amendment to the PAYGO Act; or\n       (III) the designation required pursuant to this subsection \n     has not been made;\n\n     the budgetary effects of the PAYGO Act shall be determined \n     under subsection (d)(3), provided that this clause shall not \n     apply if a valid designation is subsequently included in that \n     PAYGO Act pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) and a statement is \n     submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B).\n       (B) Conference reports and amendments between houses.--\n       (i) In general.--Prior to the adoption of a report of a \n     committee of conference on a PAYGO Act in either House, or \n     disposition of an amendment to an amendment between Houses on \n     a PAYGO Act, the Chairmen of the Budget Committees of the \n     House and Senate may jointly submit for printing in the \n     Congressional Record a statement titled ``Budgetary Effects \n     of PAYGO Legislation'' which shall include an estimate of the \n     budgetary effects of that Act if available prior to passage \n     of the Act by the House acting first on the legislation and \n     shall submit, if applicable, an identification of any current \n     policy adjustments made pursuant to section 7 of this title. \n     The timely submission of such a statement, in conjunction \n     with the appropriate designation made pursuant to paragraph \n     (1)(C), shall establish the budgetary effects of the PAYGO \n     Act for the purposes of this Act.\n       (ii) Failure to submit estimate.--If such estimate has not \n     been submitted prior to the adoption of a report of a \n     committee of conference by either House, or if the \n     designation required pursuant to this subsection has not been \n     made, the budgetary effects of the PAYGO Act shall be \n     determined under subsection (d)(3).\n       (3) Procedure in the senate.--In the Senate, upon \n     submission of a statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO \n     Legislation'' by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \n     for printing in the Congressional Record, the Legislative \n     Clerk shall read the statement.\n       (4) Jurisdiction of the budget committees.--For the \n     purposes of enforcing section 306 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974, a designation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), \n     (1)(B), or (1)(C), that includes only the language \n     specifically prescribed therein, shall not be considered a \n     matter within the jurisdiction of either the Senate or House \n     Committees on the Budget.\n       (b) CBO PAYGO Estimates.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Estimates.--Section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(3) CBO paygo estimates.--\n       ``(A) The Chairs of the Committees on the Budget of the \n     House and Senate, as applicable, shall request from the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of \n     the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation.\n       ``(B) Estimates shall be prepared using baseline estimates \n     supplied by the Congressional Budget Office, consistent with \n     section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n       ``(C) The Director shall not count timing shifts, as that \n     term is defined at section 3(8) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-\n     Go Act of 2010, in estimates of the budgetary effects of \n     PAYGO Legislation.''.\n       (B) Sideheading.--The side heading of section 308(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by striking \n     ``Reports on''.\n       (2) Guidelines.--Section 308 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(d) Scorekeeping Guidelines.--Estimates under this \n     section shall be provided in accordance with the scorekeeping \n     guidelines determined under section 252(d)(5) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.''.\n       (c) Current Policy Adjustments for Certain Legislation.--\n       (1) In general.--For any provision of legislation that \n     meets the criteria in subsection (c), (d), (e) or (f) of \n     section 7, the Chairs of the Committees on the Budget of the \n     House and Senate, as applicable, shall request that CBO \n     adjust the estimate of budgetary effects of that legislation \n     pursuant to paragraph (2) for the purposes of this title. A \n     single piece of legislation may contain provisions that meet \n     criteria in more than one of the subsections referred to in \n     the preceding sentence. CBO shall adjust estimates for \n     legislation designated under subsection (a) and estimated \n     under subsection (b).

Each \n     paragraph in section 7(f)(1) shall be considered a separate \n     subsection for purposes of this section.\n       (4) Further guidance on estimating budgetary effects.--\n     Estimates of budgetary effects under this subsection shall be \n     consistent with the guidance provided at section 7(h).\n       (5) Inclusion of statement.--For PAYGO legislation adjusted \n     pursuant to section 7, the Chairman of the House or Senate \n     Budget Committee, as applicable, shall include in any \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'', \n     submitted for that legislation pursuant to section 4, an \n     explanation of the current policy designation and \n     adjustments.\n       (d) OMB PAYGO Scorecards.--\n       (1) In general.--OMB shall maintain and make publicly \n     available a continuously updated document containing two \n     PAYGO scorecards displaying the budgetary effects of PAYGO \n     legislation as determined under section 308 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, applying the look-back \n     requirement in subsection (e) and the averaging requirement \n     in subsection (f), and a separate addendum displaying the \n     estimates of the costs of provisions designated in statute as \n     emergency requirements.\n       (2) Estimates in legislation.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (3), in making the calculations for the PAYGO \n     scorecards, OMB shall use the budgetary effects included by \n     reference in the applicable legislation pursuant to \n     subsection (a).\n       (3) OMB paygo estimates.--If a PAYGO Act does not contain a \n     valid reference to its budgetary effects consistent with \n     subsection (a), OMB shall estimate the budgetary effects of \n     that legislation upon its enactment. The OMB estimate shall \n     be based on the approaches to scorekeeping set forth in \n     section 308 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as \n     amended by this title, and subsection (g)(4), and shall use \n     the same economic and technical assumptions as used in the \n     most recent budget submitted by the President under section \n     1105(a) of title 31 of the United States Code.\n       (4) 5-year scorecard.--The first scorecard shall display \n     the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation in each year over \n     the 5-year period beginning in the budget year.\n       (5) 10-year scorecard.--The second scorecard shall display \n     the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation in each year over \n     the 10-year period beginning in the budget year.\n       (6) Community living assistance services and supports \n     act.--Neither scorecard maintained by OMB pursuant to this \n     subsection shall include net savings from any provisions of \n     legislation titled ``Community Living Assistance Services and \n     Supports Act'', which establishes a Federal insurance program \n     for long-term care, if such legislation is enacted into law, \n     or amended, subsequent to the date of enactment of this \n     title.\n       (e) Look-back To Capture Current-year Effects.--For \n     purposes of this section, OMB shall treat the budgetary \n     effects of PAYGO legislation enacted during a session of \n     Congress that occur during the current year as though they \n     occurred in the budget year.\n       (f) Averaging Used To Measure Compliance Over 5-year and \n     10-year Periods.--OMB shall cumulate the budgetary effects of \n     a PAYGO Act over the budget year (which includes any look-\n     back effects under subsection (e)) and--\n       (1) for purposes of the 5-year scorecard referred to in \n     subsection (d)(4), the four subsequent outyears, divide that \n     cumulative total by five, and enter the quotient in the \n     budget-year column and in each subsequent column of the 5-\n     year PAYGO scorecard; and\n       (2) for purposes of the 10-year scorecard referred to in \n     subsection (d)(5), the nine subsequent outyears, divide that \n     cumulative total by\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\n     ten, and enter the quotient in the budget-year column and in \n     each subsequent column of the 10-year PAYGO scorecard.\n       (g) Emergency Legislation.--\n       (1) Designation in statute.--If a provision of direct \n     spending or revenue legislation in a PAYGO Act is enacted as \n     an emergency requirement that the Congress so designates in \n     statute pursuant to this section, the amounts of new budget \n     authority, outlays, and revenue in all fiscal years resulting \n     from that provision shall be treated as an emergency \n     requirement for the purposes of this Act.\n       (2) Designation in the house of representatives.--If a \n     PAYGO Act includes a provision expressly designated as an \n     emergency for the purposes of this title, the Chair shall put \n     the question of consideration with respect thereto.\n       (3) Point of order in the senate.--\n       (A) In general.--When the Senate is considering a PAYGO \n     Act, if a point of order is made by a Senator against an \n     emergency designation in that measure, that provision making \n     such a designation shall be stricken from the measure and may \n     not be offered as an amendment from the floor.\n       (B) Supermajority waiver and appeals.--\n       (i) Waiver.--Subparagraph (A) may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (ii) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this subsection shall \n     be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling \n     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this \n     subsection.\n       (C) Definition of an emergency designation.--For purposes \n     of subparagraph (A), a provision shall be considered an \n     emergency designation if it designates any item as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to this subsection.\n       (D) Form of the point of order.--A point of order under \n     subparagraph (A) may be raised by a Senator as provided in \n     section 313 (e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (E) Conference reports.--When the Senate is considering a \n     conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in \n     relation to, a PAYGO Act, upon a point of order being made by \n     any Senator pursuant to this section, and such point of order \n     being sustained, such material contained in such conference \n     report shall be deemed stricken, and the Senate shall proceed \n     to consider the question of whether the Senate shall recede \n     from its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or \n     concur in the House amendment with a further amendment, as \n     the case may be, which further amendment shall consist of \n     only that portion of the conference report or House \n     amendment, as the case may be, not so stricken. Any such \n     motion in the Senate shall be debatable. In any case in which \n     such point of order is sustained against a conference report \n     (or Senate amendment derived from such conference report by \n     operation of this subsection), no further amendment shall be \n     in order.\n       (4) Effect of designation on scoring.--If a provision is \n     designated as an emergency requirement under this Act, CBO or \n     OMB, as applicable, shall not include the budgetary effects \n     of such a provision in its estimate of the budgetary effects \n     of that PAYGO legislation.\n\n     SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND SEQUESTRATION ORDER.\n\n       (a) Annual Report.--Not later than 14 days (excluding \n     weekends and holidays) after Congress adjourns to end a \n     session, OMB shall make publicly available and cause to be \n     printed in the Federal Register an annual PAYGO report. The \n     report shall include an up-to-date document containing the \n     PAYGO scorecards, a description of any current policy \n     adjustments made under section 4(c), information about \n     emergency legislation (if any) designated under section 4(g), \n     information about any sequestration if required by subsection \n     (b), and other data and explanations that enhance public \n     understanding of this title and actions taken under it.\n       (b) Sequestration Order.--If the annual report issued at \n     the end of a session of Congress under subsection (a) shows a \n     debit on either PAYGO scorecard for the budget year, OMB \n     shall prepare and the President shall issue and include in \n     that report a sequestration order that, upon issuance, shall \n     reduce budgetary resources of direct spending programs by \n     enough to offset that debit as prescribed in section 6. If \n     there is a debit on both scorecards, the order shall fully \n     offset the larger of the two debits. OMB shall transmit the \n     order and the report to the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate. If the President issues a sequestration order, the \n     annual report shall contain, for each budget account to be \n     sequestered, estimates of the baseline level of budgetary \n     resources subject to sequestration, the amount of budgetary \n     resources to be sequestered, and the outlay reductions that \n     will occur in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year \n     because of that sequestration.\n\n     SEC. 6. CALCULATING A SEQUESTRATION.\n\n       (a) Reducing Nonexempt Budgetary Resources by a Uniform \n     Percentage.--\n       (1) In general.--OMB shall calculate the uniform percentage \n     by which the budgetary resources of nonexempt direct spending \n     programs are to be sequestered such that the outlay savings \n     resulting from that sequestration, as calculated under \n     subsection (b), shall offset the budget-year debit, if any, \n     on the applicable PAYGO scorecard. If the uniform percentage \n     calculated under the prior sentence exceeds 4 percent, the \n     Medicare programs described in section 256(d) of BBEDCA shall \n     be reduced by 4 percent and the uniform percentage by which \n     the budgetary resources of all other nonexempt direct \n     spending programs are to be sequestered shall be increased, \n     as necessary, so that the sequestration of Medicare and of \n     all other nonexempt direct spending programs together produce \n     the required outlay savings.\n       (2) Programs and activities in unified budget only.--\n     Subject to the exemptions set forth in section 11, OMB shall \n     determine the uniform percentage required under paragraph (1) \n     with respect to programs and activities contained in the \n     unified budget only.\n       (b) Outlay Savings.--In determining the amount by which a \n     sequestration offsets a budget-year debit, OMB shall count--\n       (1) the amount by which the sequestration in a crop year of \n     crop support payments, pursuant to section 256(j) of BBEDCA, \n     reduces outlays in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal \n     year;\n       (2) the amount by which the sequestration of Medicare \n     payments in the 12-month period following the sequestration \n     order, pursuant to section 256(d) of BBEDCA, reduces outlays \n     in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year; and\n       (3) the amount by which the sequestration in the budget \n     year of the budgetary resources of other nonexempt mandatory \n     programs reduces outlays in the budget year and in the \n     subsequent fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 7. ADJUSTMENT FOR CURRENT POLICIES.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide for \n     adjustments of estimates of budgetary effects of PAYGO \n     legislation for legislation affecting 4 areas of the budget--\n       (1) payments made under section 1848 of the Social Security \n     Act (referred to in this section as ``Payment for Physicians' \n     Services'');\n       (2) the Estate and Gift Tax under subtitle B of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n       (3) the AMT; and\n       (4) provisions of EGTRRA or JGTRRA that amended the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (or provisions in later \n     statutes further amending the amendments made by EGTRRA or \n     JGTRRA), other than--\n       (A) the provisions of those 2 Acts that were made permanent \n     by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280);\n       (B) amendments to the Estate and Gift Tax referred to in \n     paragraph (2);\n       (C) the AMT referred to in paragraph (3);

and\n       (B) what those net outlays would have been if--\n       (i) the nominal payment rates and related parameters in \n     effect for 2009 had been in effect through December 31, 2014, \n     without change; and\n       (ii) thereafter, the nominal payment rates and related \n     parameters described in subparagraph (A) had applied and the \n     assumption described in clause (i) had never applied.\n       (3) Limitation.--If the provisions in the legislation that \n     cause it to meet the criteria in paragraph (1) cover a time \n     period that ends before December 31, 2014, subject to the \n     maximum adjustment provided for under paragraph (2), the \n     amount of each current policy adjustment made pursuant to \n     this section shall be limited to the difference between--\n       (A) estimated net outlays attributable to the payment rates \n     and related parameters specified in that section of the \n     Social Security Act (as scheduled on December 31, 2009, to be \n     in effect for the period of time covered by the relevant \n     provisions of the eligible legislation); and\n       (B) what those net outlays would have been if the nominal \n     payment rates and related parameters in effect for 2009 had \n     been in effect, without change, for the same period of time \n     covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible \n     legislation as under subparagraph (A).\n       (d) Estate and Gift Tax.--\n       (1) Criteria.--Legislation that includes provisions \n     amending the Estate and Gift Tax under subtitle B of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall trigger the current \n     policy adjustment required by this title.\n       (2) Adjustment.--The amount of the maximum current policy \n     adjustment shall be the difference between--\n       (A) total revenues projected to be collected under the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as scheduled on December 31, \n     2009, to be in effect); and\n       (B) what those revenue collections would have been if, on \n     the date of enactment of the legislation meeting the criteria \n     in paragraph (1), estate and gift tax law had instead been \n     amended so that the tax rates, nominal exemption amounts, and \n     related parameters in effect for tax year 2009 had remained \n     in effect through December 31, 2011, with nominal exemption \n     amounts indexed for inflation after 2009 consistent with \n     subsection (g).\n       (3) Limitation.--If the provisions in the legislation that \n     cause it to meet the criteria in paragraph (1) cover a time \n     period that ends before December 31, 2011, subject to the \n     maximum adjustment provided for under paragraph (2), the \n     amount of each current policy adjustment made pursuant to \n     this section shall be limited to the difference between--\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\n       (A) total revenues projected to be collected under the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as scheduled on December 31, \n     2009, to be in effect for the period of time covered by the \n     relevant provisions of the eligible legislation); and\n       (B) what those revenues would have been if the estate and \n     gift tax law rates, nominal exemption amounts, and related \n     parameters in effect for 2009, with nominal exemption amounts \n     indexed for inflation after 2009 consistent with subsection \n     (g), had been in effect for the same period of time covered \n     by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation as \n     under subparagraph (A).\n       (4) Duration of policy adjustment.--Adjustments made \n     pursuant to this subsection are available for policies \n     affecting the estate and gift tax through only December 31, \n     2011.

Madam President, today the Senate passed the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 as an amendment to H.J. Res. 45. As chairman \nof the Senate Budget Committee, I ask that the following section-by-\nsection analysis of that act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\n Section-by-Section Analysis of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010\n\n       Section 1--Short Title: The title of this Act is the \n     ``Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.''\n       Section 2--Purpose: The purpose of the Statutory Pay-As-\n     You-Go Act (PAYGO) of 2010 is to reestablish a statutory \n     procedure to enforce a rule of budget neutrality on new \n     revenue and direct spending legislation.\n       Section 3--Definitions and Applications: Section 3 sets \n     forth definitions of terms used in the PAYGO statute. Many \n     terms are defined by cross-references to the standard \n     definitions used in other budget laws, including the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) of 1985. Terms that \n     are of particular importance include:\n       Budgetary effects. Budgetary effects are defined as the \n     amount by which PAYGO legislation changes mandatory outlays \n     or revenues relative to the baseline. The budgetary effects \n     of changes in tax or mandatory spending law are measured \n     relative to what revenues or mandatory spending would \n     otherwise have been if not for the legislation, as measured \n     by the baseline (as defined in section 257 of BBEDCA). Off-\n     budget effects (i.e., Social Security trust funds and the \n     Postal Service fund) and debt service are not counted as \n     budgetary effects. ``Mandatory spending'' and ``direct \n     spending'' (the term used in the statutory language) are \n     synonymous.\n       PAYGO legislation/PAYGO Act. Legislation, or provisions \n     thereof, that increases or reduces revenues, or increases or \n     reduces the cost of mandatory programs, is called PAYGO \n     legislation or a PAYGO Act. In this Act, the terms are used \n     interchangeably. PAYGO legislation is subject to statutory \n     PAYGO.\n       Legislation subject to PAYGO also includes provisions in \n     annual appropriations bills that change revenue or mandatory \n     spending law in appropriations bills. Changes in \n     mandatory spending law are considered discretionary in the \n     current and budget years because the Appropriations \n     Committees can offset the costs or use the savings by \n     adjusting funding levels for discretionary programs in \n     those years. But mandatory spending provisions in \n     appropriations bills having outyear budget authority \n     effects--that is, effects in those years after the budget \n     year--are considered PAYGO legislation. This is generally \n     consistent with the existing point of order in the Senate \n     against ChIMPs (Changes in Mandatory Programs). However, \n     such provisions for which the mandatory outlay effects net \n     to zero over the period consisting of the current year, \n     the budget year, and the four subsequent years shall not \n     be counted as having budgetary effects.\n       Timing shift. A timing shift involves a shift of costs from \n     within the PAYGO window, i.e., the ten-year period covered by \n     the PAYGO scorecard, to outside the window (or savings from \n     outside the window to within the window). More technically, \n     the term is defined to refer to a delay of the date on which \n     mandatory outlays would otherwise occur from the ninth \n     outyear (the last year taken into account in the PAYGO \n     calculation) to the tenth outyear (not taken into account in \n     the PAYGO calculation) or an acceleration of the date on \n     which revenues or offsetting receipts or collections would \n     otherwise occur from the tenth outyear to the ninth outyear. \n     Timing shifts are not counted for purposes of statutory PAYGO \n     to prevent gaming the PAYGO scorecard.\n       Section 4--PAYGO Estimates and PAYGO Scorecards: Section 4 \n     establishes procedures for determining the budgetary effects \n     of legislation subject to PAYGO. These budgetary effects are \n     entered by OMB on the PAYGO scorecards, as defined in section \n     4(d), and are used to determine whether a sequestration order \n     must be issued.\n       Estimates of budgetary effects are made either by Congress \n     or OMB. Subsection (a) establishes the procedures Congress \n     must follow in order for its estimate of budgetary effects of \n     legislation to be used for PAYGO enforcement. If Congress \n     follows these procedures, the Congressional estimate of \n     budgetary effects shall be used by OMB. If Congress does not \n     follow these procedures, the budgetary effects of legislation \n     subject to PAYGO shall be estimated by OMB. Subsection (b) \n     establishes the procedures by which the House and Senate \n     Budget Committees obtain estimates from CBO, and the \n     procedures to be used by CBO for making estimates. Subsection \n     (c) outlines the additional procedures to be followed by CBO \n     or OMB, as applicable, when adjusting the estimates of \n     budgetary effects for legislation that qualifies for a \n     ``current policy'' adjustment under section 7 of this Act. \n     Subsections (d)-(f) relate to procedures used by OMB for \n     PAYGO estimates and enforcement. Subsection (g) addresses \n     procedures for legislation designated as an emergency for the \n     purpose of statutory PAYGO.\n       (a) PAYGO Estimates. Congress can establish the budgetary \n     effects of PAYGO legislation by following a two-step process. \n     First, the text of PAYGO legislation must include one of the \n     statements prescribed in paragraphs (1)(A), (B), or (C). \n     Second, the Chairman of the relevant Budget Committee must \n     submit for printing in the Congressional Record a statement \n     of the budgetary effects of the legislation, also referred to \n     as the ``cost estimate'' or ``score.'' A Congressional \n     estimate must satisfy both of these requirements to be valid. \n     If Congress fails to follow this procedure for legislation \n     that is subsequently enrolled and signed by the President, or \n     chooses not to provide an estimate of budgetary effects, the \n     OMB estimate of a PAYGO Act's budgetary effects is used for \n     PAYGO enforcement.\n       The statements prescribed in paragraphs (1)(A), (B), or (C) \n     establish a reference in the legislative text of PAYGO \n     legislation to an estimate of budgetary effects to be \n     submitted for printing in the Congressional Report before a \n     vote on passage. The statement may be included in the \n     original text of the legislation, or by amendment as may be \n     allowed under the regular procedures in either House. The \n     estimate need only be submitted for printing in the \n     Congressional Record before a vote on passage. The actual \n     estimate of budgetary effects is never inserted into the \n     legislative text of PAYGO legislation. This process avoids \n     the need to amend PAYGO legislation to include an updated \n     estimate of budgetary effects if amendments are adopted.\n       The Chairmen of the Budget Committees in each House are \n     responsible for submitting estimates of budgetary effects for \n     printing in the Congressional Record. Printing the statement \n     in the Congressional Record ensures that the estimate of \n     budgetary effects is, at the time of the vote on the bill \n     that is enacted into law, unambiguous, fixed, and knowable, \n     for Members, for OMB, and for the public.\n       This two-step process avoids the Constitutional concerns \n     identified in Bowsher v. Synar, 479 U.S. 714 (1986) and \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. \n     919 (1983) because Congress will establish the budgetary \n     effects of the PAYGO Act through the legislative process, not \n     after enactment. An unambiguous and fixed estimate available \n     prior to a vote is incorporated by reference in the PAYGO \n     legislation. Matters incorporated by reference are binding on \n     the executive branch. See Hershey Foods v. USDA, 158 F. Supp. \n     2d 37, 41 (D.D.C. 2001), aff'd on other grounds, 293 F.3d 520 \n     (D.C. Cir. 2002); see also United States v. Sharpnack, 355 \n     U.S. 286, 293 (1958).\n       1. Required Designation in PAYGO Acts: One of three \n     statements must be included in legislation subject to PAYGO \n     for the Congressional estimate to be entered by OMB on the \n     PAYGO scorecard. The statements provide the basis in the \n     legislative text for incorporating the Congressional estimate \n     by reference into the PAYGO Act.\n       The three statements address three possible scenarios under \n     which a PAYGO Act may be signed by the President: (1) \n     legislation is originated by the House and passed without \n     amendment by the Senate; (2) legislation is originated by the \n     Senate and passed without amendment by the House; and (3) \n     legislation is agreed upon by both Houses after differences \n     are resolved by a conference committee or by amendments \n     between the Houses.\n       Statement (1)(A) refers to an estimate provided by the \n     House Budget Committee Chairman. This statement would be \n     included in legislation originated in the House of \n     Representatives. If the House Budget Committee Chairman \n     submits a statement of budgetary effects for printing in the \n     Congressional Record before the vote on passage in the House, \n     the budgetary effects of that legislation will have been set \n     by the House. If the Senate then passes the House bill \n     without amendment, the House PAYGO estimate will be placed on \n     the PAYGO scorecard by OMB. Similarly, if the Senate \n     originates and passes PAYGO legislation with the statement \n     prescribed in (1)(B), and the Chairman of the Senate \n     Budget Committee submits a statement of budgetary effects \n     for printing in the Congressional Record before the Senate \n     votes, the House of Representatives will have accepted the \n     Senate estimate as controlling if it passes the Senate \n     bill without amendment.\n       One House may strike the statement inserted in the \n     legislative text by the other House and replace it with the \n     statement referring to the estimate submitted by the Chairman \n     of its Budget Committee. In doing so, the second House has \n     rejected the first House's estimate. A disagreement between \n     the Houses on the estimate of budgetary effects becomes a \n     matter in dispute between the Houses to be resolved by the \n     House and Senate Budget Committees.\n       The statement in (1)(C) refers to an estimate of budgetary \n     effects jointly submitted to the Congressional Record by the \n     Chairman of the House and Senate Budget Committees. This \n     statement must be included in a conference report, or \n     amendments between the Houses, when the Houses resolve the \n     differences in their budgetary estimates. Where differences \n     between the Houses are to be resolved in a process of \n     amendments between the Houses, the requirement of a joint \n     statement prevents the House acting first from having an \n     advantage in negotiations. The joint statement also \n     underscores that different estimates of the budgetary effects \n     of legislation must be resolved to the satisfaction of the \n     Chairmen of both Budget Committees if Congress wants a \n     Congressional estimate to be placed on the PAYGO scorecard.\n       Presumably not all PAYGO legislation will contain a \n     Congressional estimate of budgetary effects. For example, the \n     budgetary effects of a particular PAYGO Act may be so small \n     that Congress chooses not to complete an estimate. It is also \n     possible that the Houses cannot come to an agreement on an \n     estimate of budgetary effects. Absent a designation pursuant \n     to section 4(a)(1) and estimate submitted pursuant to section \n     4(a)(2), the estimate made by OMB post-enactment will be \n     entered on the PAYGO scorecards.\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\n       In some cases, one piece of PAYGO legislation could have \n     multiple designations and estimates throughout the \n     legislative process--the first by the originating House, the \n     second by the second House acting upon the legislation, and a \n     third by the conference committee. For the purpose of \n     directing OMB as to what amounts are to be entered on the \n     PAYGO scorecards, the only estimate that matters is the one \n     contained in the version of the legislation passed by both \n     Houses and presented to the President for signature. \n     Conversely, the omission by one or both Houses of a \n     designation and estimate earlier in the legislative process, \n     for whatever reason, has no bearing on the validity of an \n     otherwise valid estimate appropriately referenced in a PAYGO \n     Act signed by the President.\n       2. Determination of Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Acts: In \n     order for Congress's estimate of budgetary effects to bind \n     OMB, a valid statement must be submitted for printing in the \n     Congressional Record by a Chairman of the Budget Committee, \n     or by the Chairmen jointly, as applicable. However, the \n     Chairmen are not obligated to submit a statement. The \n     statement, if submitted, must be titled ``Budgetary Effects \n     of PAYGO Legislation.''\n       The Chairmen of the Budget Committees retain full \n     discretion over the Congressional estimate of budgetary \n     effects for the purposes of enforcing this Act, consistent \n     with Section 312 of the Congressional Budget Act. The \n     Congressional Budget Office will continue to provide \n     estimates to the Budget Committees.\n       It is the responsibility of the Budget Committee Chairmen \n     to ensure that statements of budgetary effects are submitted \n     for the Congressional Record in a timely manner, and that \n     they identify with specificity any previously submitted \n     statement for the same legislation that it supersedes. A \n     previous statement is no longer valid and is superseded when \n     that House adopts an amendment to a PAYGO Act after the \n     statement has been submitted. Any subsequent amendment, \n     regardless of its budgetary effects, will invalidate a \n     previously submitted estimate.\n       In the case of a conference report, a statement of \n     budgetary effects is not valid if it is first submitted for \n     printing in the Congressional Record after one House passes \n     the report. It is incumbent on both Houses to ensure that \n     prior to a vote in either House on PAYGO legislation leading \n     to enrollment and presentation to the President, there is an \n     unambiguous, fixed, and knowable statement of budgetary \n     effects.\n       3. Procedure in the Senate: It is in order in the Senate \n     for the Legislative Clerk to read the statement of budgetary \n     effects into the record of proceedings once it has been \n     submitted by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. \n     This reading provides an added assurance that all Senators \n     have been given notice of the Congressional estimate of the \n     budgetary effects prior to a vote on passage of legislation. \n     Notice to Senators will also be provided by printing the \n     estimate in the Congressional Record. As a practical matter, \n     votes on some legislation subject to PAYGO may be taken after \n     the statement has been submitted for the Congressional \n     Record, but before it has been printed. If the vote will be \n     taken after the statement has been printed, the Senate may \n     waive the reading of the estimate by unanimous consent.\n       4. Jurisdiction of the Budget Committees: When Congress \n     follows the procedure set forth in this section, the \n     designated legislation is not subject to a point of order \n     under section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act. (Section \n     306 generally bars the consideration of legislation dealing \n     with matters within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee \n     unless it has been reported by the committee, or the \n     committee has been discharged from further consideration.) \n     The inclusion of the statements specified in (1)(A), (B), and \n     (C)--without modification--in legislation subject to PAYGO \n     avoids a point of order under section 306. If different \n     language is used, for example, or if an authorizing committee \n     includes some other budgetary provision, a point of order \n     under section 306 would be in order. This is consistent with \n     Senate precedent that ``directed scoring'' language in \n     legislation is within the jurisdiction of the Budget \n     Committees.\n       (b) CBO PAYGO Estimates. Subsection (b) amends Section 308 \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish a \n     procedure by which Congress may request that CBO estimate the \n     budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation. Consistent with \n     section 312 of the Congressional Budget Act, and existing \n     Congressional practice and procedure, the Chairmen of the \n     Budget Committees are responsible for requesting estimates \n     from the Congressional Budget Office. CBO shall prepare its \n     estimates consistent with section 257 of BBEDCA, but shall \n     not count timing shifts as those are defined in section \n     3(8) of this Act. CBO estimates shall also be scored in \n     accordance with the scorekeeping guidelines determined \n     under section 252(d)(5) of BBEDCA.\n       (c) Current Policy Adjustments for Certain Legislation. \n     Section 4(c) establishes procedures for making adjustments to \n     the estimates of budgetary effects for legislation in four \n     policy areas: (1) physician payments under section 1848 of \n     the Social Security Act; (2) the Estate and Gift Tax; (3) the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax; and (4) certain middle class tax \n     cuts provided in EGTRRA and JGTRRA. The criteria for \n     determining whether legislation, or provisions of \n     legislation, qualify for current policy adjustments are set \n     forth in section 7.\n       1. In General: If the Chairman of either Budget Committee \n     determines that legislation meets the criteria set forth in \n     section 7 of this Act, that Chairman shall request that CBO \n     adjust its estimate of budgetary effects. If OMB estimates \n     the budgetary effects of legislation that meets the criteria \n     of section 7 because Congress has not provided a valid \n     estimate, then OMB shall adjust its estimate of budgetary \n     effects.\n       2. Adjustments: For qualifying legislation or provisions of \n     legislation, CBO or OMB, as applicable, shall exclude from \n     the estimate of budgetary effects no more than the amount of \n     the budgetary effects of that legislation or provision as \n     allowed in the applicable part of section 7. The amount that \n     may be excluded is determined with reference to the amounts \n     previously excluded pursuant to the same subsection of \n     section 7. In other words, if the cost of a particular \n     provision, when added to the costs or savings of all other \n     provisions that previously qualified for an adjustment under \n     that subsection of section 7 exceeds the maximum amount \n     allowable for the subsection, the excess costs shall not be \n     excluded from the estimate of budgetary effects. In \n     implementing these adjustments, CBO shall use CBO's baseline \n     estimates; this requirement is not intended to apply to \n     estimates prepared by OMB. If CBO makes an adjustment, its \n     estimate shall state the unadjusted and adjusted costs, and \n     an updated total of all costs previously excluded under the \n     same provisions of section 7.\n       3. Limitation on Availability of Excess Savings: The intent \n     of the current policy adjustment is to give Congress \n     flexibility to extend certain current policies with budgetary \n     effects over specified periods of time. Savings from the \n     extension of current policies with budgetary effects less \n     than allowed under section 7--in other words extensions that \n     generate savings in comparison with the extension of current \n     policy--cannot be used to offset costs of other legislation. \n     This paragraph establishes two rules that reinforce the \n     prohibition on the fungibility of savings relative to the \n     current policy extensions.\n       A. Excess savings cannot be used to offset the budgetary \n     effects of PAYGO legislation that would not otherwise qualify \n     for a current policy exemption under section 7. For example, \n     if Congress were to enact only a one-year fix for the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax, the difference in revenue generated \n     by a two-year and one-year fix of the AMT cannot be used to \n     offset the cost of a new entitlement program.\n       B. Excess savings in one of the policy areas specified in \n     section 7 cannot be used to offset the budgetary effects of a \n     more expensive policy extension in another policy area. For \n     example, if Congress were to enact only a one-year fix for \n     the Alternative Minimum Tax, the difference in revenue \n     generated by a two-year and one-year fix of the AMT cannot be \n     used to offset a reduction in the estate and gift tax that \n     costs more than is otherwise provided in section 7. In other \n     words, savings among the policies in sections 7(c), (d), (e), \n     and (f), and among the subparagraphs of section 7(f)(1), are \n     not fungible.\n       4. Further Guidance on Estimating Budgetary Effects: To \n     determine adjustments for the budgetary effects for \n     qualifying legislation, CBO or OMB, as applicable, shall use \n     the conventions concerning the stacking order of estimates of \n     the interactive effects of AMT relief and extension of the \n     middle class tax cuts set forth section 7(h).\n       5. Inclusion of Statement: Any adjustments for current \n     policy legislation shall be explained by the appropriate \n     Chairman of the Budget Committee in the statement ``Budgetary \n     Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' submitted for printing in the \n     Congressional Record.\n       (d) OMB PAYGO Scorecards. The subsection outlines OMB's \n     responsibilities under statutory PAYGO. OMB will maintain two \n     ``PAYGO scorecards,'' available to the public, that maintain \n     a running tally of the budgetary effects of enacted \n     legislation subject to PAYGO. In making entries onto the \n     scorecards, OMB will use the ``look-back'' and ``averaging'' \n     rules discussed below.\n       OMB will use the Congressional estimate of the budgetary \n     effects of a PAYGO Act if one was incorporated pursuant to \n     section (4)(a). If not, OMB will enter its own estimates on \n     the scorecards.\n       The scorekeeping and baseline rules for current policy \n     adjustments are the same as those that apply to CBO and OMB \n     for estimating all legislation subject to PAYGO. OMB \n     estimates must be consistent with the scorekeeping approaches \n     described in section 308 of the Congressional Budget Act, as \n     amended by section 4(b) of this Act, and the current policy \n     adjustments in section 7. In other words, OMB and CBO \n     estimates should be made using the same rules and \n     scorekeeping conventions. However, CBO will use the baseline \n     as defined by section 257 of the Congressional Budget Act, \n     while OMB will use the economic and technical assumptions \n     included in the latest budget submitted by the President.\n       OMB will maintain two PAYGO scorecards, one covering a \n     five-year period and the other covering a ten-year period \n     beginning in the budget year.\n       OMB shall not include on either PAYGO scorecard any net \n     savings generated by subsequently enacted legislation titled \n     ``Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act'' \n     (CLASS Act). The CLASS Act was included in the Senate- and \n     House-\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\n     passed health care reform bills and would establish a federal \n     insurance program for long-term care. OMB shall also not \n     include any net savings generated by subsequent amendments \n     to that Act, if enacted.\n       (e) Look-Back to Capture Current Year Effects. To take into \n     account any budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation in the \n     current year (i.e., the year of enactment if before October \n     1st), a ``look back'' rule is included. The rule provides \n     that budgetary effects in the current year are to be treated \n     as if they were budgetary effects in the budget year (which \n     is the year subsequent to the current year). This is why the \n     averaging provision described below actually sums eleven \n     years of costs (the current year, the budget year, and the \n     nine outyears) and divides the sum by ten. This look-back \n     provision similarly applies to the five-year scorecard.\n       (f) Averaging Used to Measure Compliance Over 5-Year and \n     10-Year Periods. For the budget year and the applicable four \n     or nine outyears, OMB is to enter the annual average \n     budgetary effect associated with PAYGO legislation. For \n     instance, a bill that pays for itself over ten years will \n     have a total, and thus average, score of zero, so zero would \n     be entered in each column of the ten-year PAYGO scorecard. If \n     a bill enacted in FY10 costs a net of $10 billion over \n     FY2010-FY2020, OMB would insert +$1 billion in each of the \n     ten columns on the PAYGO ledger (FY11 through FY20). The same \n     PAYGO legislation could well have different averages over \n     five years and over ten. For example, if a bill enacted this \n     session costs $2 billion through 2015 and $10 billion through \n     2020, the five-year scorecard would record entries of $0.4 \n     billion for each of 2011 through 2015, while the ten-year \n     scorecard would record entries of $1 billion for each of 2011 \n     through 2020.\n       (g) Emergency Legislation. If legislation subject to PAYGO \n     contains an emergency designation, the budgetary effects of \n     provisions that are designated as emergencies shall not be \n     placed on the PAYGO scorecards by OMB. The designation should \n     refer to subsection (g)(1) of this Act. The procedure for \n     challenging a statutory emergency designation for PAYGO \n     enforcement reflects the current practices for challenging \n     emergency designations under Congressional budget rules. In \n     the Senate, an emergency designation is subject to a point of \n     order that may be waived upon a vote of 3/5 of the members \n     duly chosen and sworn. If the Senate does not waive this \n     point of order, the emergency designation is struck from the \n     legislation.\n       Section 5--Annual Report and Sequestration Order: Section 5 \n     defines the timing of the annual PAYGO report and, if one is \n     needed, the sequestration order. OMB is to produce an annual \n     PAYGO report, which shall include up-to-date PAYGO scorecards \n     and a description of any sequestration if required. The \n     report is to be released no more than 14 days (excluding \n     weekends and legal holidays) after Congress adjourns to end a \n     session.\n       If the annual report shows a debit (i.e., net budgetary \n     cost) on either PAYGO scorecard for the budget year, the \n     President is required to issue an order sequestering \n     budgetary resources from non-exempt mandatory programs \n     sufficient to fully pay off that debit. If it shows a debit \n     on both the five-year and ten-year scorecards, the \n     sequestration must pay off the larger debit. If the President \n     issues this order, then the PAYGO annual report must contain \n     its details, including such information as the outlay \n     reductions that would occur in the budget year and the \n     subsequent fiscal year for each affected account.\n       Because the PAYGO statute creates a permanent law, the two \n     scorecards are permanent. In effect, they will record all \n     PAYGO legislation enacted from the date the bill becomes law. \n     The cost estimates of individual PAYGO bills, however, will \n     eventually slide off the scorecards since only the five-year \n     or ten-year costs are recorded on those scorecards. For \n     example, a PAYGO bill enacted later this year will show cost \n     or savings entries of the same size (the average amount \n     through 2015) for each fiscal year 2011 through 2015 on the \n     five-year scorecard. Next year, new PAYGO legislation will \n     add entries to the five-year scorecard covering years 2012-\n     2016. The entries made this year in the 2012-2015 columns of \n     that scorecard will remain on that scorecard, however. If \n     those entries are net savings, the savings will be available \n     to cover costs in new legislation, but if they are net \n     debits, avoiding a sequestration at the end of each of the \n     next four sessions of Congress will require that the net \n     debits be worked off by the enactment of new offsetting \n     savings. The same approach applies to the ten-year scorecard.\n       Section 6--Calculating a Sequestration: Section 6 describes \n     how sequestration is to be implemented if triggered. Many \n     mandatory programs, such as Social Security, veterans' \n     disability and other benefits, and major low-income \n     entitlements, such as Supplemental Security Income and \n     Medicaid, are totally exempt from sequestration. Only \n     programs in the unified budget are subject to sequestration.\n       With the exception of Medicare, non-exempt mandatory \n     programs would be cut by a uniform percent, such that the \n     outlay savings produced in the budget year and the subsequent \n     fiscal year would be sufficient to fully offset the budget-\n     year debit on the PAYGO ledger. Medicare can be cut by no \n     more than four percent. If a larger cut is needed to offset \n     the debit on the PAYGO ledger, the uniform percentage cut to \n     the other non-exempt mandatory programs would be increased so \n     that the sequester of Medicare and the other non-exempt \n     programs would together produce sufficient savings to offset \n     the budget-year debit. Sequestrations are temporary, not \n     permanent, and with a few exceptions occur only in the budget \n     year.\n       For most non-exempt mandatory programs, the uniform \n     sequestration percentage reduces budgetary resources by a \n     specified percent over the course of the entire fiscal year. \n     If a sequestration starts a month or more into the fiscal \n     year because Congress adjourns in November or December, then \n     the reduction during the remaining 9, 10, or 11 months of the \n     fiscal year will be larger than the uniform percentage so \n     that the average sequestration over the year equals the \n     required uniform percentage. In the case of Medicare, the \n     sequestration lasts for a full 12 months even if it takes \n     effect after the beginning of the fiscal year, in which \n     case it will run into the start of the next fiscal year. \n     This means the uniform percentage cut in payments to \n     providers or insurance plans will not be higher at any \n     time than the four-percent limit (or the calculated \n     uniform percentage, if lower).\n       In the case of price support payments for crops, the \n     sequestration for any given crop will start at the beginning \n     of the next crop year. As a consequence, sequestrations for \n     crops will not all be running concurrently, and some \n     sequestrations may occur partly in the following fiscal year.\n       Section 7--Adjustments for Certain Current Policies:\n       (a) Purpose. Section 7 establishes a temporary rule to \n     adjust the estimates of the budgetary effects of PAYGO \n     legislation in four policy areas: Medicare physician \n     payments, the estate tax, the Alternative Minimum Tax, and \n     the 2001 and 2003 income tax cuts for the middle class. In \n     each of these areas, current policies have either expired at \n     the end of 2009 or will expire by the end of 2010. This \n     section allows for an adjustment so that the cost of \n     extending specified individual policies for a defined period \n     (two years for estate tax and AMT, five years for Medicare \n     physician payments, and permanently for the middle-class tax \n     cuts) is not counted for statutory PAYGO purposes.\n       This scoring rule applies only for the purposes of \n     statutory PAYGO. For other purposes, including the \n     Congressional Budget Act and the congressional PAYGO rules, \n     existing scoring rules and points of order apply.\n       General approach. The statute authorizes a maximum \n     adjustment to the estimate of budgetary effects of PAYGO \n     legislation in the four specified policy areas equal to the \n     difference between:\n       The cost of continuing a specified policy under current law \n     as of December 31, 2009, consistent with baseline \n     calculations under section 257 of BBEDCA, which, for each of \n     the four policy areas, would assume that the specified policy \n     has expired (AMT and estate tax), or will expire by the end \n     of 2010 (all other policies); and\n       The projected cost of the specified policy assuming the \n     policy continues beyond its scheduled expiration date.\n       The cost of continuing these policies over the specified \n     period is larger than the cost of letting them expire, as \n     would happen under current law. The adjustment allows \n     Congress to address these policies without having the cost \n     added to the PAYGO scorecard. The difference between these \n     two estimated costs is the maximum adjustment that may be \n     used to offset the cost of legislation addressing each \n     specified policy for the purposes of PAYGO enforcement. If \n     the estimate of the legislation has a greater budgetary \n     effect than the maximum amount of the adjustment, then the \n     adjustment can be used to offset a portion of its cost. The \n     additional cost would be counted for statutory PAYGO \n     purposes. If a less costly policy is enacted, any remaining \n     amount in the adjustment cannot be used to offset the cost of \n     policies in other areas (as specified in Section 4(c)(3) of \n     the PAYGO statute).\n       In addition, the adjustments in each policy area are \n     further limited to prevent using the full amount of the \n     available adjustment to offset the cost of a more generous \n     policy for a shorter period. Under this limitation, the \n     amount of the adjustment is estimated consistent with the \n     time period covered by the eligible policy action.\n       (b) Duration. This section expires on December 31, 2011, so \n     any policies eligible for an adjustment must be enacted by \n     that time in order to receive the adjustment.\n       (c)-(f) Policy areas eligible for adjustment. For statutory \n     PAYGO purposes, legislation addressing four policy areas \n     qualifies for a current policy adjustment to the estimate of \n     that legislation's budgetary effects.\n       (c) Medicare Physician Payments. Under current law, the \n     Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula requires physician \n     payments under Medicare part B to be cut automatically by \n     over 21 percent after February 28, 2010. Section 7(c) \n     provides a maximum adjustment equal to the difference between \n     the cost of freezing through December 31, 2014, the Medicare \n     Part B payment rates to physicians at the 2009 rate, and the \n     cost of allowing the automatic cuts to occur after February \n     28, 2010. Legislation providing relief from the scheduled SGR \n     cut--including legislation that reforms or supersedes the SGR \n     formula--would only be scored for PAYGO purposes to the \n     extent that it costs more than this five-year freeze at 2009 \n     levels. If legislation to reform or supersede the SGR formula \n     through or beyond 2014 is enacted that costs less than a \n     five-year freeze in the\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\n     years through 2014, any remaining amount in the adjustment \n     could be used to offset costs of that policy after 2014, but \n     the total adjustment cannot exceed the maximum adjustment \n     amount of a five-year SGR freeze.\n       (d) Estate and gift tax. Under EGTRRA, the estate tax \n     exemption was gradually increased and the tax rate gradually \n     lowered so that by 2009, the exemption level was $3.5 million \n     for an individual, with amounts above the exemption level \n     taxed at a 45 percent rate. In 2010, the estate tax is \n     repealed, replaced with a new tax on inherited assets with \n     unrealized capital gains. In 2011, with the expiration of \n     EGTRRA, the estate tax will return, with the pre-2001 law \n     parameters of a $1 million exemption for an individual and a \n     top rate of 55 percent.\n       The maximum adjustment in section 7(d) is equal to the \n     difference between the revenues expected from continuing the \n     2009 estate tax policy, with the nominal exemption level \n     indexed for inflation, through December 31, 2011, and the \n     revenues expected under the 2010 repeal and 2011 return to \n     pre-2001 law. In other words, legislation restoring the \n     estate tax would be scored for PAYGO purposes only to the \n     extent that it costs more than implementing the 2009 policy \n     (indexed) in 2010 and 2011. Because the cost of estate tax \n     policy through 2011 will have budgetary effects beyond 2011, \n     this section clarifies that the adjustment is intended to \n     capture the full budgetary effects in all years resulting \n     from the two-year policy change.\n       (e) Alternative Minimum Tax. A ``patch'' for the AMT was \n     provided in the Recovery Act, increasing the 2009 AMT \n     exemption to $70,950 for couples and $46,700 for singles in \n     order to prevent the number of taxpayers affected by the AMT \n     from exploding from about four million to about 30 million. \n     This patch expired at the end of 2009.\n       Section 7(e) provides a maximum adjustment equal to the \n     difference between the revenues expected from adjusting the \n     the AMT exemption levels through 2011 in order to hold the \n     number of taxpayers affected by the AMT at 2008 levels (about \n     4.2 million), and the revenues expected assuming the \n     expiration of the 2009 AMT patch. Because the cost of AMT \n     relief through 2011 will have budgetary effects beyond 2011, \n     this section clarifies that the adjustment is intended to \n     capture the full budgetary effects in all years resulting \n     from the two-year policy change.\n       (f) 2001 and 2003 middle-class tax cuts. The 2001 and 2003 \n     income tax reductions enacted under EGTRRA and JGTRRA, as \n     subsequently amended through December 31, 2009, are scheduled \n     to expire at the end of 2010. Section 7(f) provides 12 \n     adjustments for policies benefiting the middle class as they \n     are in effect in 2010. The specific middle-class policies \n     are:\n       10 percent bracket;\n       Child Tax Credit, including the expansion in the Recovery \n     Act;\n       Marriage penalty relief, including the relevant EITC \n     expansion in the Recovery Act;\n       Adoption credit;\n       Dependent care credit;\n       Employer-provided child care credit;\n       Education tax benefits;\n       25 percent and 28 percent brackets;\n       33 percent bracket, but only for individuals with incomes \n     of $200,000 or less, and couples with incomes of $250,000 or \n     less;\n       Reduced rates on capital gains and dividends, but only for \n     individuals with incomes of $200,000 or less, and couples \n     with incomes of $250,000 or less;\n       Repeal of the personal exemption phase-out and the \n     limitation on itemized deductions, but only for individuals \n     with incomes of $200,000 or less, and couples with incomes of \n     $250,000 or less; and\n       Section 179 expensing for small businesses, allowing up to \n     $125,000 of qualified property to be expensed, phasing out \n     for property over $500,000.\n       The maximum adjustment for the policies in section 7(f) is \n     equal to the difference between the revenues expected if the \n     specified policy were in place after 2010 and the revenues \n     expected if the related provisions expired as scheduled.\n       (g) Indexing for Inflation. Amounts indexed for inflation \n     are done in accordance with the cost-of-living adjustment \n     rules in section 1(f)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986. That provision in the Code designates the Department of \n     Labor's Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers (usually \n     expressed as CPI-U) as the measuring standard. Amounts \n     indexed for inflation in this Act are the nominal exemption \n     amount under the estate tax, as well as the income thresholds \n     for income tax brackets, the rates for capital gains and \n     dividends, the personal exemption phase-out, and the \n     limitation on itemized deductions.\n       (h) Guidance on Estimates and Current Policy Adjustments. \n     Estimates of budgetary effects of certain tax policies can \n     vary depending on the order in which those policies are \n     enacted into law. The PAYGO statute lays out three rules for \n     addressing costs associated with the interaction of these \n     various provisions.\n       1. For the interaction between AMT relief and the middle-\n     class tax cuts, all interaction costs are scored as part of \n     AMT relief. Specifically, estimates for determining the AMT \n     adjustment must assume that all of the middle-class tax cuts \n     eligible for a PAYGO adjustment have been enacted, even if \n     these tax cuts have not yet been enacted.\n       2. Estimates for determining the adjustment for the middle-\n     class tax cuts must assume that AMT relief follows current \n     law as of the end of 2009--that is, they must assume that the \n     2009 AMT patch expired at the end of 2009, even if AMT relief \n     beyond 2009 has already been enacted.\n       3. To address the interaction between individual middle-\n     class tax provisions included in the same piece of \n     legislation, provisions must be scored in the order in which \n     they appear in the legislation.\n       Section 8--Application of BBEDCA: Section 8 specifies how \n     various provisions of BBEDCA, including the special \n     sequestration rules in section 256 of BBEDCA and the baseline \n     rules in section 257 of BBEDCA, apply to this new PAYGO \n     statute.\n       Section 9--Technical Corrections: Section 9 corrects \n     typographical errors in the text of BBEDCA.\n       Section 10--Conforming Amendments: Section 10 makes \n     conforming amendments to section 256 of BBEDCA. This section \n     establishes special rules for sequestration for certain \n     mandatory programs or updates the special rules to reflect \n     programs as they now exist.\n       Section 11--Exempt Programs and Activities: Section 11 \n     lists mandatory programs and activities that are exempt from \n     sequestration. Exemptions under this Act are consistent with \n     the exemption list that was first created in 1990.\n       That said, the exemption list has been updated to address \n     accounts that have had their account names or numbers changed \n     since 1990, or have been merged or divided. Further, new \n     accounts (since 1990) have been treated the same way that \n     analogous accounts were treated. For example, in the 1990 law \n     the major low-income programs such as Medicaid were \n     exempted from sequestration. The Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (CHIP), new since 1990, is in the same \n     category as Medicaid and also exempt.\n       The list has been expanded to clarify the treatment of \n     certain transportation programs, notably federal-aid highways \n     and grants-in-aid for airports. The budgetary treatment of \n     these programs is split. They receive mandatory contract \n     authority through authorization bills, but are treated as \n     discretionary programs because their annual spending is \n     controlled by obligation limitations in appropriations bills. \n     These programs are exempt from sequestration to the extent \n     they are controlled by obligation limitations. Remaining \n     mandatory resources in these programs are subject to \n     sequestration.\n       Finally, as noted in Section 6, non-exempt accounts are \n     subject to a single, uniform percentage cut if a \n     sequestration is required (except Medicare, where the cut is \n     limited to four percent). Under the 1990 law, if a small \n     sequestration was needed, four programs would have been the \n     first ones sequestered: special milk, vocational \n     rehabilitation state grants, student loans, and foster care / \n     adoption assistance. Because this PAYGO statute eliminated \n     this rule, the first three of those programs are treated as \n     any non-exempt account would be treated. But the foster care \n     account is included in the exempt list on the grounds that it \n     is like other low-income programs that were exempted from \n     sequestration in the 1990 law.\n       Section 12--Determinations and Points of Order: Section 12 \n     affirms that nothing in this Act is intended to limit the \n     authority of the Budget Committee Chairmen to make \n     determinations and estimates of the costs or savings of \n     legislation.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report:\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Ben S. \nBernanke, of New Jersey, to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we want to make sure that all Senators \nunderstand, we will be debating through the respective meetings the two \ncaucuses are having. It is important we get this done in the time \nallotted, so people will not be able to wait until after 3:20 to do \ntheir speeches.\n  On the Democratic side, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from South \nDakota, Tim Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise in support of the reconfirmation \nof Chairman Ben Bernanke to serve another term as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors. As the administration and Congress \ncontinue to look for ways to restore our Nation's financial stability, \npromote economic recovery, and work on legislation to ensure that \nanother economic crisis like the one we faced last year never happens \nagain, we need Chairman Bernanke's steady leadership.\n  While there has certainly been criticism of the Federal Reserve for \nnot doing enough to protect consumers and for the unprecedented actions \nit took during the financial crisis, there is also consensus that Mr. \nBernanke kept our Nation out of a depression and has kept inflation in \ncheck.\n  As our Nation recovers and faces additional challenges in the months \nahead, there is no doubt that having one of the world's foremost \nexperts on the Great Depression at the helm of the Fed is a benefit to \nour Nation.\n  But it cannot be business as usual for the Fed. Like the many banks \non Wall Street, the Fed must be more transparent and more accountable \nfor its actions. The Federal Reserve cannot just be the organization \nthat picks up after a financial institution fails while placing our \nentire economy at risk in doing so. The status quo at the Fed is not \nacceptable, and our Nation needs a central bank that is proactive in \naddressing concerns within financial institutions and the economy.\n  I believe Mr. Bernanke is committed to these goals, and I support Mr. \nBernanke's confirmation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to oppose--to oppose--the \nreappointment of Ben Bernanke for a second term as Chairman of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n  The principal reason for my opposition to this nomination is that I \nbelieve in accountability. In particular, I believe it is the duty of \nthis body; that is, the Senate, to hold accountable those regulators \nwhose poor oversight of our financial institutions and markets helped \nproduce the greatest economic crisis this country has experienced in \nsome 80 years.\n  Because the Federal Reserve, during Chairman Bernanke's tenure, \nfailed to take the steps to ensure that our financial institutions were \nproperly regulated and would not need Federal bailouts to survive, I do \nnot believe Mr. Bernanke should be confirmed for another term.\n  Prior to the recent financial crisis, as a member of the Board of \nGovernors, Dr. Bernanke advocated monetary policies that contributed to \nexcessive risk taking. Subsequently, as Board Chairman, he ignored or \ndownplayed serious emerging risks. He failed to use regulatory \nauthority available to the Fed to prevent housing speculation and \nunsound lending practices, often misjudged the nature of problems in \nmarkets, contributed to market turbulence by appearing to act \ninconsistently and in an ad hoc manner. He failed to ensure \ntransparency of actions and basically took actions damaging to the \npolitical independence of the Federal Reserve and of our Nation's \nmonetary policy.\n  I do not believe Chairman Bernanke has executed sound judgment and \noversight over the Fed's monetary policy, lender of last resort, and \nregulatory and supervisory functions. I will explain.\n  Chairman Bernanke advocated a policy of remarkably low interest rates \nfor an extended period of time following the 2001 recession, providing \nan environment that helped fuel a speculative bubble in real estate \nlending. Subsequently, in the face of rising home prices and risky \nmortgage underwriting practices, the Fed failed to act under Bernanke's \nwatch by choosing not to use its rulemaking authority over mortgages to \narrest the risky practices and address growing risks. Yet, amazingly, \ngiven a history of failure in supervision and regulation, Chairman \nBernanke now continues to actively campaign for maintaining and further \nexpanding the regulatory powers of the Federal Reserve.\n  The financial panic our markets experienced in 2008 was the most \nsevere, as I said, in modern memory. Its repercussions have resulted in \nour unemployment rate surging to more than 10 percent and the worst \neconomic growth in a generation. Our present economic problems, \nhowever, are no accident. In large measure, they stem directly from the \nactions of our financial regulators.\n  It is the responsibility of our financial regulators to ensure that \nour financial institutions are properly supervised and that they \npromote, rather than threaten, our national economy. Unfortunately, the \nrecent financial crisis demonstrated that our financial regulators did \nnot do their jobs. Our banks were undercapitalized, mortgage lending \nstandards were far too loose, and expectations of government bailouts \nwere too prevalent.\n  Dr. Bernanke's Federal Reserve played a key role in setting the stage \nfor the financial crisis we are in now.\n  First, under his leadership, the Federal Reserve failed to ensure \nthat our financial institutions were adequately capitalized, as I \nmentioned a minute ago. Indeed, the Federal Reserve, our Federal \nReserve, led the effort to reduce capital in our largest financial \ninstitutions through the adoption of the Basel II capital accords. The \nFed even considered abandoning the leverage ratio, which ensures that \nall banks maintain at least 4 percent of capital.\n  Think about it a minute. As a result, when the crisis struck, many of \nour financial institutions did not have the capital necessary to \nwithstand the downturn. Not surprisingly, the Federal Reserve then \nargued that a taxpayer bailout of the banks was the only way to prevent \nan economic collapse. But rather than do its job and ensure that our \nfinancial institutions were adequately capitalized, the Fed waited \nuntil the crisis was at hand and then rescued its banks with taxpayer \nfunds.\n  Think about it a minute. Ben Bernanke's Federal Reserve also failed \nto detect and address the decline in lending standards and growing use \nof subprime loans. At the core of our financial crisis is the fact that \nfar too many home loans were made that borrowers will be unable to pay, \nprobably ever.\n  The failure of Bear Stearns, Lehman, Washington Mutual, and AIG \nlargely stems from the sharp declines in mortgage values. Although \nCongress gave the Federal Reserve authority to address lending \nstandards and subprime loans when it passed the Home Ownership and \nEquity Protection Act in 1994, the Fed failed to enact strong \nregulations until 2008--more than 2 years into Chairman Bernanke's \nterm.\n  In addition, Ben Bernanke's Federal Reserve has failed to adequately \nsupervise many of our largest financial institutions, most notably \nCitigroup. For years, it has been no secret that the problems of \nCitigroup have been well known everywhere, but the Federal Reserve \nalways sought to look the other way rather than deal with its \ncomplicated problems.\n  By failing to address Citigroup during the good times, the Federal \nReserve left our largest financial institution at that time highly \nvulnerable to the next downturn. In the end, the Federal Government had \nto inject $40 billion and guarantee more than $300 billion of \nCitigroup's assets. The Fed's failure as a supervisor--the regulator--\nplaced U.S. taxpayers and our economy directly at risk.\n  Regardless of how Chairman Bernanke performed during the financial \ncrisis, the record of the Fed leading up to the crisis should not be \nignored by the Congress. A close examination of Chairman Bernanke's \nperformance during the financial crisis reveals that he was too slow to \nrecognize how serious the situation was, and\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\nwhen he did react, he acted in an ad hoc fashion that greatly \nexacerbated the crisis.\n  After the housing market bubble began to burst in 2006, Chairman \nBernanke was slow to entertain possible spillovers from housing into \nthe general economy and the financial system itself. Even after Bear \nStearns failed, Chairman Bernanke did little to prepare for additional \nfailures. In other words, Bernanke fiddled while our markets burned.\n  In the 6 months between the failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman, the \nFederal Reserve did very little to prevent either another taxpayer \nbailout or a sudden and disorderly collapse of Lehman, even though the \nproblems were well known to the Fed and to everybody else. As a result, \nwhen Lehman was ultimately allowed to fail, our markets responded \nsharply because they could not understand why the Fed let Lehman fail \nbut rescued Bear Stearns.\n  Markets need clarity about policy, especially in times of crisis. Yet \njust when our markets needed clarity about Fed policy, Chairman \nBernanke's ad hoc responses left our markets in the dark. Consequently, \nthe failure of Lehman was far more disruptive and damaging than it \nneeded to be.\n  Bernanke's response to the financial crisis also raises questions \nabout his judgment. In October 2008, he appeared before the Banking \nCommittee in the Senate to urge the passage of TARP. He testified that \nthe government purchase of toxic assets from banks was the best way to \nrespond to the financial crisis.\n  At the time, as a lot of you know, I opposed TARP because I did not \nbelieve purchasing toxic assets was a workable solution or we should \nbail out anybody. I argued that it risked making our financial problems \nworse by indirectly causing the failure of other financial \ninstitutions, and it did.\n  Despite Chairman Bernanke's urging that an asset purchase was the \nbest solution, just days after the passage of TARP, the Treasury \nDepartment and the Federal Reserve abandoned the very asset purchase \nplan that he judged to be the best course forward when he testified \nbefore Congress. Equity injections were employed because the asset \npurchase plan was proven to be unworkable, he said.\n  The full story of AIG is yet to be told. Unfortunately, the Fed and \nother regulators have gone out of their way to hide what really has \ngone on at AIG both before and after the bailout from Congress. What is \nclear, however, is that the Fed knew more about AIG's problems than it \nhas admitted so far.\n\n  The Fed has repeatedly stated that it did not learn of AIG's problems \nuntil the weekend of September 12, 2008, and that it was stunned to \nlearn of its problems. Really? Yet in his recent book, ``Too Big to \nFail,'' Andrew Ross Sorkin reports that the CEO of AIG met with then-\nNew York Fed President Tim Geithner about AIG's problems on at least \ntwo occasions prior to September 12, 2008.\n  On one occasion, AIG's CEO gave Mr. Geithner, at that time, documents \ndetailing AIG's financial condition and its exposures to other \nfinancial institutions. We still do not know what Treasury Secretary \nGeithner, at that time, did upon learning about the problems at AIG, or \nwhether Chairman Bernanke knew of AIG's meeting with the New York Fed \nat that time, Mr. Geithner.\n  The fact that the Fed may have known about the problems at AIG before \nits collapse raises serious questions about whether they ignored early \nwarnings and failed to take action before the situation became \nuntenable without massive taxpayer bailouts.\n  Many have said that if Chairman Bernanke is not reappointed, \nfinancial markets will be rattled. The notion seems to be that \ncontinuity of leadership will be valued more by markets than the \nassurance of responsible and accountable leadership at the Fed. I \nbelieve this perspective is short-sighted and wrong. I believe it is \nmore important to find the most competent person available for the job \nthan to simply adhere to the status quo.\n  It is also wrong to speculate as to what might happen should someone \nother than Mr. Bernanke serve as Chairman. I believe it is far more \nimportant to consider the facts surrounding Chairman Bernanke's record \nthan it is to speculate about the impact of his departure. The record \nclearly indicates that considerable economic devastation occurred as a \nresult of Chairman Bernanke's loose monetary policy and weak regulatory \noversight. Millions of people are now out of work in this country and \ntrillions of dollars in savings have been lost.\n\n  Those who try to frighten others with notions of what might happen \nare ignoring the hard reality of what already has happened. If we don't \nhold Chairman Bernanke accountable, what precedent are we setting for \nfuture regulators? What incentive will they have to take the tough \nsteps necessary to ensure that our financial institutions are \nadequately regulated? I fear that the prospects of a high-paying job on \nWall Street will diminish a lot of the incentives to be a good \nregulator unless they know Congress will hold them accountable if they \nfail to do their job. How can we ever expect our regulators to perform \nif, after the greatest financial crisis in living memory, not a single \nculpable regulator is held accountable?\n  Unfortunately, this is a theme that is repeated too often in \nWashington. Something terrible happens, and although Congress exposes \nboth institutional and individual failures, nobody is held accountable, \nand the only thing that ever seems to happen is the failed \ninstitutions, along with their failed leaders, get more authority and \nmore money. This needs to end.\n  The American people rightly believe that any one of us who neglects \nto do our job should be held to account, not rewarded. I intend to do \nmy job and vote no on a second term for Ben Bernanke.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me thank my distinguished \nchairman of the Banking Committee for yielding time.\n  I rise in support of a man whose position I do not envy. Chairman \nBernanke has faced some extraordinary economic circumstances and he has \nkept a steady hand on the tiller in a perfect economic storm that has \nthreatened this Nation's underlying financial stability. Faced with an \neconomy that was headed in a downward spiral, Chairman Bernanke and the \nFed had what appeared to be a set of Hobson's choices: Make tough \ndecisions or preside over a global economic meltdown. I think most of \nus agree that doing nothing was not an option.\n  Having said that, I do believe there was more the Fed could have done \nto mitigate the housing bubble, supervise the banks, enact muscular \nconsumer protections, and provide credit to small businesses. I \nbelieve--and Chairman Bernanke admitted himself--he could have done \nmore to mitigate risk and require higher capital standards.\n  In the future, I expect the Fed will be more responsive to the needs \nof Main Street, where there is small business innovating, selling \nsomething or creating the new jobs of the 21st century, and to the \nneeds of American families across this country. I expect it will be \nmore vigilant to prevent a repeat of the economic crisis we have \nexperienced and will get ahead of future challenges we will face, such \nas commercial loans and credit card defaults.\n  But despite these reservations, I will be voting in favor of \nconfirmation because it is my belief that history will show the \nrecession would have spiraled into a depression had Chairman Bernanke \nbeen timid or equivocal in his actions. I am voting yes because, in my \nview, Chairman Bernanke has proven his leadership and his value to this \nNation during this unprecedented crisis. To vote against confirmation \nwould unnerve investors and exacerbate economic uncertainty in an \neconomy that needs confidence and stability, not volatility.\n  I believe Chairman Bernanke is an astute scholar of the Great \nDepression and is now arguably the first and foremost expert on the \ngreat recession. At this moment in history, someone who has learned \nfrom two of the most devastating economic disasters in American history \nis certainly qualified to lead the Fed.\n  I will vote yes because, in my view, what we should not do is change \nleadership at the Fed at a time when what\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\nwe need most is a steady, experienced hand at what appears to be the \nvery beginning of an economic recovery. I will vote yes because, \nrecently, Chairman Bernanke has committed to more muscular regulatory \nreform that will corral the bulls on Wall Street. He has had the will \nto take politically unpopular strategic action, which history will show \nwas necessary under the economic circumstances created by the last 8 \nyears of runaway, laissez-faire financial regulatory policies. He \nunderstood the importance of keeping inflation low, forcing down \ninterest rates, and stabilizing the financial system. At this time, his \nwork is not yet done, and I believe we need the wisdom of patience. As \nElizabeth Barrett Browning said: ``Measure not the work until the day's \nout and the labor done.''\n  I will vote yes because Chairman Bernanke has vowed, in a letter to \nacting Comptroller General Gene Dodaro, to provide all records \nnecessary for a GAO audit of the Fed to give a clear understanding of \nhis and the Fed's actions in the $182.3 billion bailout of AIG. I will \nvote yes because I believe he understands the danger of exacerbating \nthe crisis by tightening monetary policy at the wrong time.\n  President Kennedy said: ``In knowledge's light we must think and not \nact only for the moment but for our time.''\n  He told the story of a man who asked his gardener to plant a tree, \nbut the gardener objected saying the tree was a very slow-growing tree \nand that it would not reach maturity for 100 years, to which the man \nreplied: In that case, there is no time to lose. Plant it this \nafternoon.\n  Let us not step back and succumb to the urge to act for the moment \nbut do what is right for our time. Solving our economic crisis surely \nwill not take 100 years, but the seeds of recovery that are taking \nplace right now need to be nurtured by an experienced hand.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to ensure confidence and \nstability at the Fed, not volatility; the type of confidence and \nstability that is necessary for our time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I have up to 30 minutes, but I don't think I will use that.\n  Four years ago, when Chairman Bernanke was first nominated to be \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, I was the only Senator to vote against \nhim. In fact, I was the only Senator to raise serious concerns about \nhis nomination. I opposed him because I knew he would continue the \nlegacy of Alan Greenspan, and I was right. But I did not know how right \nI would be, and I could not imagine how wrong he would be in the \nfollowing 4 years. From monetary policy to regulation, consumer \nprotection, transparency, and independence, Chairman Bernanke's time as \nFed Chairman has been a failure. We must put an end to his and the \nFed's failure, and there is no better time than now.\n  The Greenspan legacy on monetary policy was breaking from the Taylor \nrule to provide easy money and, thus, inflate bubbles. Not only did \nChairman Bernanke continue that policy when he took control of the Fed, \nbut he supported every Greenspan rate decision when he was a Fed \nGovernor before he became Chairman. Sometimes he even wanted to go \nfurther and provide more easy money than Chairman Greenspan. Yet, even \nto this day, Chairman Bernanke continues to deny that Fed actions \nplayed any role in inflating the housing bubble, despite overwhelming \nevidence and the consensus of economists to the contrary. In his \nefforts to keep filling the punchbowl--which is a term used by Chairman \nBernanke himself--he cranked up the printing presses to buy mortgage \nsecurities, Treasury securities, commercial paper, and other assets \nfrom Wall Street. Those purchases, by the way, led to some nice profits \nfor the Wall Street banks and dealers who sold them to the Fed.\n\n  On consumer protection, Chairman Bernanke went along with the \nGreenspan policy before he was Chairman and continued it after he was \npromoted. The most glaring example is it took him 2 years to finally \nregulate subprime mortgages, after the Fed had already done nothing for \nthe prior 12 years. Even then, he only acted after pressure from \nCongress and after it was clear subprime mortgages were at the heart of \nthe economic meltdown. On other consumer protection issues such as \ncredit cards, he only acted as the time approached for his confirmation \nto another term at the Fed.\n  As the economy started to slide and the housing bubble peaked and \nthen burst, Chairman Bernanke failed to notice the problems or do \nanything about them until it was too late. During that time, he made \nmany statements showing how much he did not understand what was going \non in the economy or how severe the crash would be. I wish to read a \nfew of those statements so everyone understands how wrong he has been.\n  In March of 2007, this is what Chairman Bernanke said:\n\n       The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of \n     the problems in the subprime markets seems likely to be \n     contained.\n\n  Then, in May of that year, he said:\n\n       We do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime \n     market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.\n\n  The following February he said:\n\n       Among the largest banks, the capital ratios remain good and \n     I don't expect any serious problems of that sort among the \n     large, internationally active banks that make up a very \n     substantial part of our banking system.\n\n  A few months later, in June of 2008, he said:\n\n       The risk that the economy has entered a substantial \n     downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or \n     so.\n\n  Then, in July of 2008, he said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are \n``adequately capitalized'' and ``in no danger of failing.''\n  Finally, in May of last year, speaking about the unemployment rate, \nhe said:\n\n       Currently, we don't think it will get to 10 percent.\n\n  Well, we all wish he had been right on that one.\n  I could read a few more quotes, but I think those are enough to show \nhow wrong he has been on major economic issues. Of course, everyone \nmakes mistakes, so I asked Chairman Bernanke about these errors in \nwritten questions I gave him after his confirmation hearing. His \nanswers did not make me feel any better. He said the Fed did not \nunderstand the relationships between financial firms, how the problems \nin the financial sector would move to the real economy or how severe \nthe financial crisis would be. That is in his written response to me. I \nthought those were the kinds of things regulators and the Fed, in \nparticular, were paid to understand and address. We shouldn't be paying \nFed Chairmen to learn on the job.\n  Just like with consumer protection, Chairman Bernanke did not take \nthe job of regulating the banks under the Fed's authority seriously. \nInstead of close supervision of the biggest and most dangerous banks, \nhe allowed them to grow their balance sheets and increase risk. The \nsame is true on derivatives. After taking over the Fed, he did not see \nany need for serious regulation of derivatives until it was clear we \nwere headed to a financial meltdown thanks, in part, to those products.\n  Even worse than the failures and flawed policies I just mentioned, \nChairman Bernanke destroyed the independence of the Fed. He bowed to \nthe political pressures of the Bush and Obama administrations and \nturned the Fed into an arm of the Treasury. Walking arm-in-arm with the \nTreasury, Chairman Bernanke bailed out all the large financial \ninstitutions, including many foreign banks. And he put the printing \npresses into overdrive to fund the government's spending and hand out \ncheap money to Wall Street. Instead of taking that money and lending to \nconsumers and cleaning up their balance sheets, the banks started to \npocket record profits and pay out billions of dollars in bonuses.\n  And now it appears that Chairman Bernanke is compromising the \nindependence of the Fed to get votes for his confirmation in the \nSenate. After a meeting with Chairman Bernanke, the majority leader \nissued a statement saying that he had expressed concerns to Chairman \nBernanke about things that the Fed was not doing and that Chairman \nBernanke committed to take action. The majority leader also went on to \nstate that his support for Chairman Bernanke was ``not unconditional''. \nI do not question the majority leader's intent or actions here, and I \ncertainly do not have a problem with a\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\nSenator telling the Fed Chairman about his concerns or urging him to \ntake actions. I have done so myself on many occasions. And it is not a \nproblem for the Fed Chairman to agree that he and the Fed need to \naddress concerns raised by a Senator. But what is not appropriate is \nthe Fed Chairman making commitments in order to secure votes for \nhimself. I hope that is not what happened in this case.\n  Now with great power goes the responsibility to use that power in an \nopen and transparent way. We have all heard Chairman Bernanke talk a \nlot about transparency, but his actions speak a lot louder than \nhis words. He promised Congress more transparency when he first became \nChairman, and he promised us more transparency when he came begging for \nTARP. While he has published some more information than before, those \nefforts fall short and he sill refuses to provide details on all of the \nFed's actions over the last 2 years.\n\n  After his confirmation hearing, I asked Chairman Bernanke for a list \nof documents for us to review, all of which are reasonable for Congress \nto see. For example, the list included documents about the bailouts of \nBear Stearns and AIG, information about the Fed's regulation of banks \nbefore and during the crisis, and transcripts of monetary policy \nmeetings that have not yet been made public. But his answer made it \nclear that he is not going to open up the Fed's actions to review by \nCongress or the taxpayers. Instead of providing those documents, what I \ngot in return was a folder full of paper they printed off the Fed's web \npage. That kind of response is not only disrespectful to the Senate, \nbut it raises the question of what they are hiding.\n  Following the markup of Chairman Bernanke's nomination, Chairman Dodd \ndid arrange for Banking Committee members and staff to review some of \nthe documents surrounding the AIG bailout. I thank him for doing that, \nand I took him up on the offer and went down to the Fed myself to look \nat them. In reviewing those documents, some interesting and useful \nfacts came to light that will be helpful as we craft banking reform \nlegislation. More important for what we are talking about today, some \nof those documents contain new information that raises serious \nquestions about Chairman Bernanke's judgment, leadership, and personal \nrole in the AIG bailout. Unfortunately, under the agreement with the \nFed to get access to those documents, I am not allowed to talk about \nthe details and I was not able to bring copies back to show to other \nSenators. I think that every Senator should be able to see these \ndocuments prior to voting, and I asked Chairman Dodd to subpoena them \nthis week, but that has not happened. Senators should be especially \nconcerned about voting now because last week Chairman Bernanke himself \nasked the GAO to conduct a review of these same documents, but that \nreview will not be completed and made public until after the vote has \nbeen taken here in the Senate.\n  While all of the reasons I just mentioned are enough to vote against \nChairman Bernanke, the simplest reason is that a vote for Ben Bernanke \nis a vote for bailouts. Chairman Bernanke has been in the middle of all \nof the financial bailouts during this crisis. It was his Fed that \nbailed out Bear Stearns in March of 2008. It was his Fed that bailed \nout AIG in September of 2008. And it was Chairman Bernanke along with \nSecretary Paulson who came to Congress begging for TARP. So if you like \nthose bailouts, by all means vote for Chairman Bernanke. But if you \nwant to put an end to bailouts and send a message to Wall Street this \nvote is your chance.\n  I urge you to vote no on the confirmation of Chairman Ben Bernanke \nfor another 4-year term as Fed chairman.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will address the Senate for 3 minutes, if \nI can, and then reserve the remainder of my time for later in this \ndebate.\n  Let me say to my friend and colleague from Kentucky, a member of our \ncommittee, and a worthwhile member of the committee, that while we \ndisagree on this nomination, I am appreciative and he raises good \nquestions with a great deal of passion and conviction on these matters. \nI appreciate his gracious comments about my efforts to try to \naccommodate his legitimate interests in learning as much as we can \nabout the matter affecting AIG, where $180 billion of taxpayer money \nwas involved.\n  There are a lot of investigations going on by the GAO, as well as by \nthe independent commission, as well as individual Senators getting \ninformation. While it may not be satisfactory to everyone, there is an \neffort being made to make sure people can be as informed as they \npossibly can about that matter. There is a hearing that went on on the \nHouse side on this issue.\n  The matter before us is obviously whether to confirm Mr. Bernanke as \nChairman of the Federal Reserve for a second term. I am a strong \nsupporter of this nomination. I will explain why briefly, and then I \nwill complete my remarks a little later in the debate.\n  I have yet to meet a nominee I have voted for that I was 100 percent \nfor. But when it comes to a nominee with a record that is not going to \nnecessarily be embraced by all 100 people here, the issue of certainly \nlooking back is important to do. But the most important issue relative \nto the questions of looking back or forward is--and I think most \nAmericans would agree--where are we today, and where are we going in \nthese matters. I believe over the last year--or a little more than a \nyear--the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke has, in no small measure, made \nit possible for this Nation to avoid a catastrophe that I think would \nhave looked maybe larger than the Great Depression did because of the \nglobal decisions that needed to be made. Had it not been for Ben \nBernanke, I think we would be looking at a very different America \ntoday.\n  It wasn't my choice that Mr. Bernanke become Chairman of the Federal \nReserve. The previous administration nominated Mr. Bernanke, and I \nvoted for him. When I became chairman of the Banking Committee in \nJanuary 2007 for the first time, I went through a very frustrating year \non that committee. On February 7 of 2007, I had my first hearings in \nthe issue of the mortgage crisis in the country. We had 12 such \nhearings in this committee over the remaining 10 months--almost 1 every \nmonth on this issue. Yet, I could not get the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve to pay as much attention as I thought he should have. Beginning \nin the latter part of 2007 and going forward, his leadership, in my \nview, was absolutely critical in avoiding the kinds of problems this \ncountry faced.\n  I will speak for a few more minutes later. I think we would make a \ngreat error indeed if we were to reject this nomination, if we do not \nterminate this filibuster and vote up or down on this nominee and \nprovide the confidence and stability our markets demand. This economy, \nas fragile as it is, will get back on its feet again. To do otherwise \nwould do great damage to our Nation at this critical moment.\n  I yield the floor and withhold the balance of my time.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to comment today on the \nnomination of Ben Bernanke for a second term at his critical post on \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  As our Nation continues to recover from the worst financial crisis \nsince Black Tuesday in 1929 and the deepest recession since the Great \nDepression, the chairman of the Federal Reserve is one of the most \nimportant positions in the Federal Government.\n  Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs--the Wall Street behemoth--\nannounced a bonus pool of $16.2 billion. JP Morgan recently handed out \na $9.3 billion set of bonus payments. The Wall Street Journal reports \nthat Bank of America is expected to match the bonus level that it paid \nin 2007--prior to the collapse of the financial bubble and the taxpayer \nbailout.\n  These bonuses make it clear that Wall Street has recovered from the \neconomic downturn--a recovery further indicated by the TED spread, \nwhich fell today to 0.17, signaling recovery for the banking system.\n  In contrast to the restored prosperity being enjoyed on Wall Street, \nAmericans on Main Street still struggle through the aftermath of the \nBush recession. Unemployment nationwide\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\nhovers around 10 percent. In some especially distressed areas, such as \nmy State of Rhode Island, the employment situation is even worse. Rhode \nIsland's official unemployment rate was 12.9 percent last month and the \nproportion of Rhode Islanders who are underemployed, working part time, \nor at jobs below their skill level is considerably worse than that.\n  Families in my State and across the Nation are struggling to pay for \ngroceries and to stave off foreclosure. The economic distress is so \nwidespread in places such as Rhode Island that hardly anyone remains \nuntouched, directly or indirectly. It is heartbreaking to drive around \nparts of Providence, where nearly every house on the block is boarded \nup, where families have been evicted from their homes, and the \nneighborhood is now in physical decay. The explosion of the housing \nbubble left wreckage across this Nation, which will take years, perhaps \neven decades, to clean up.\n  Ben Bernanke bears considerable responsibility for the lax regulation \nthat brought about the housing bubble. There is no mea culpa he can \nprofess that will erase that fact from history. And to make matters \nworse, a quick review of his public statements in the months leading up \nto the crisis demonstrates a troubling pattern of false confidence.\n  On February 27, 2008, months before the start of our great recession, \nChairman Bernanke said this:\n\n       The nonfinancial business sector remains in good financial \n     condition with strong profits, liquid balance sheets, and \n     corporate leverage near historic lows. . . . By 2010, our \n     most recent projections show output growth picking up to \n     rates close to or a little above its longer term trend, \n     and the unemployment rate edging lower.\n\n  Here we stand in 2010, and it could not be more clear that Mr. \nBernanke was wrong.\n  Regarding the housing crisis, on May 17, 2007, Chairman Bernanke \nsaid:\n\n       We do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime \n     market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.\n\n  Again, he could not have been more wrong.\n  Regarding the strength of our financial sector, on February 28, 2008, \nChairman Bernanke said:\n\n       Among the largest banks, the capital ratios remain good and \n     I don't expect any serious problems.\n\n  We need a Fed Chairman with the foresight to anticipate problems and \nto take action before they occur. Chairman Bernanke has clearly not \ndemonstrated this capability.\n  As the President of the United States noted in his State of the Union \nAddress last night, the bank bailout was about as popular as a root \ncanal. It appears Chairman Bernanke will be reconfirmed, but I want to \nexpress with my vote that the leaders of President Obama's economic \nteam must pivot from the necessary rescue of our major financial \ninstitutions to equally if not more necessary help to America's \nfamilies.\n  In prioritizing the recovery of Wall Street, I believe leaders at the \nFed and the Treasury made significant errors in several key areas:\n  First, failing to establish a due process mechanism to legally make \nadjustments to Wall Street pay, bonuses, and counterparty liabilities, \nso they all had to be paid 100 cents on the dollar.\n  Second, hoarding the TARP reserve for banks, long after banks were \nsecure, when families were desperate for help. But, no, they clung to \nthat reserve just in case the banks needed it, never mind the present \nneed of American families.\n  Third, allowing the banks to prevent families--and this Chamber \nfighting against it--access to bankruptcy courts to readjust their home \nmortgage debts the way any other debtor can do for any debt, including \nthe big banks themselves.\n  Fourth, giving banks and investment banks unlimited access to zero-\npercent loans at the Fed window to use for arbitrage, while profitable \nsmall businesses are desperate for credit to use for jobs. Other \nnations--the UK and France--have announced special taxes on banker \nbonuses to help pay for bailouts. Not here. If you are a scorekeeper of \nour recovery, it looks as if it can be summarized in a two-word phrase: \nbank wins. That is not a balanced score.\n  I will conclude by saying that whoever leads the Fed for the next 4 \nyears, I urge that we start prioritizing help for the middle class. The \nFed has enormous powers that could be used to help people. It can \nregulate credit card rates. It can force big banks to reduce principal \non underwater mortgages. It can provide credit to small businesses. If \nour Nation's central bank is to regain the confidence of the American \npeople, its priorities must serve the American people.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe my time is being yielded off of \nSenator Shelby's time.\n  I rise in support of the confirmation of Chairman Bernanke to another \nterm as head of the Fed. There are a lot of reasons. Let's begin with \nthe most obvious one because I think it is also one of the most \nimportant.\n  In the fall of 2008, we were looking over a precipice of massive \ndisaster to our financial structures in this Nation. We were at a point \nwhere it was a distinct possibility that the entire financial system of \nthis country was going to implode. What would have been the \nimplications of that had it occurred? What would have been the outcome \nof that had it occurred? Not only would we have lost the basic \nsuperstructure of our banking system in this country, which is at the \nessence of a strong economy, a good banking system, because credit, \nespecially in our capitalist system, is a critical element in order to \ncreate prosperity--people have to be able to get credit in order to \ntake risk and create jobs--but equally important, the implications to \neveryday Americans would have been overwhelming.\n  I understand it is difficult for people to appreciate how severe that \nwas because the event did not happen. But had it occurred, had the \nfinancial system collapsed, as I believe it probably would have, then \neverybody in this country would have found their lifestyle and their \nquality of life reduced, I suspect, because the capacity to just \nbasically operate a business would have been significantly constricted. \nJust getting money from your bank would have been a problem. The \nability to get loans would have disappeared for a while. It would have \ncreated a massive disruption in our economic structure which, it is \nprojected by some, would have led to unemployment rates of as high as \n25 percent. I don't know if that is true, but those are the projections \nfrom some realistic people.\n  This did not happen. Yes, we went into a very severe recession and, \nyes, that recession is still hurting Americans. There are still \nAmericans hurting as a result of it. But the massive collapse did not \noccur. It did not occur because a few people stood up and took very \naggressive action, much of which was totally new and out of the box in \nthe way it proceeded.\n  One of the two key players in this effort was the Secretary of the \nTreasury. The other key player was the Chairman of the Fed. Two \nSecretaries of the Treasury stood up and made the tough calls--Treasury \nSecretary Paulson and Treasury Secretary Geithner. But there was only \none Fed Chairman throughout this whole period. He took the Fed down a \npath which it had never been down before. He injected over $2 trillion \nof liquidity into the economy. He basically allowed the Fed to become \nthe lender of the Nation. Nobody had ever done that. The way he did it \nwas extraordinary in its creativity, and the results were that the \ncountry's financial system did not collapse. Many Americans' everyday \nlives were not fundamentally disrupted because of the actions of \nChairman Bernanke. He deserves credit for having been willing and \ncourageous enough to have made these types of decisions. That was the \ntype of leadership we needed--strong, definitive leadership at a moment \nof acute crisis. That is what Chairman Bernanke gave our Nation. He \ndeserves to be confirmed just for that action alone.\n  There is no question but you can Monday morning quarterback what he \ndid and you can analyze it and you can probably say he should have done \nthis better or that better. No question about that. But the fact is, \nthe results of what he did accomplished the goal,\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nwhich was to stabilize the financial institutions of this country. The \nway I describe it is as if you are coming to a bridge in a car with \nyour family in it and the superstructure of that bridge is about to \ncollapse. But somebody comes along and they fix the bridge just as you \nget on it. You drive over the bridge, and you did not even know it got \nfixed, but it was fixed. And if it had not been fixed, you would have \nhad a disaster. That is what Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretaries \nPaulson and Geithner did for our Nation. He deserves to be reconfirmed \nfor that reason.\n  The second reason he needs to be reconfirmed, in my opinion, is \nbecause as we look forward, we are still looking at some very tough \ntimes. The money, the liquidity that was required to be put into the \nsystem--this $2 trillion--as the system recovers becomes a risk for the \nsystem. We all know that. If that liquidity is allowed to play itself \nout and to multiply, we could end up with a fairly significant \ninflationary event. As we all know, inflation is the cruelest tax of \nall because it devalues people's savings and it undermines the \nproductivity of a nation.\n  How this liquidity comes out of the markets, how we get this $2 \ntrillion-plus, as it has been multiplied, out of the system is going to \nbe a very complicated but very important undertaking, and it is going \nto be primarily the responsibility of the Fed to do that. Chairman \nBernanke has outlined fairly clearly, and I think in a very positive \nway, how he intends to accomplish that, how the Federal Reserve will \nstart to draw down that liquidity. As far as I know, it is the only \nproposal out there that has any legitimacy, and it is an important \nproposal as we go prospectively. We need him in that spot not only out \nof respect because he did such a great job, an important job, and a \nsuccessful job in stabilizing the financial situation of the late 2008 \nand 2009 period but also because we need him to deal with the \nprospective problem. That is another reason to confirm him.\n\n  Some will argue that he should not be confirmed because for years he \nparticipated, along with Chairman Greenspan, in keeping the money \nsupply, the rates on interest too low.\n  That is a debatable point. I tend to think the rates were too low for \ntoo long. I think it is one of the reasons we ended up with this huge \nbubble in the real estate industry and it is one of the drivers, but I \ndon't think that was the primary driver of what caused this financial \ndownturn in this huge real estate bubble. The primary driver was a \ndecoupling of the responsibility to lend constructively from the people \nwho were actually doing the lending. We had a breakdown in underwriting \nstandards, to put it quite simply. Because we had all these different \npeople originating loans who had no real interest or vested interest in \nthe loans because they were selling them and because a lot of our \nbanking institutions had become lax in their underwriting standards, \nloans were being made to people who could not pay the loans back on \nassets which did not have the value to support the loan. People were \nnot looking at the loans; they were looking at the fees they were going \nto get, and then they were selling the loans. When loans got sold, they \ngot securitized, subdivided, and multiplied as to the implications. \nThat was not the Fed's failure. To some degree, in their oversight of \nbank holding companies, one can argue it was the Fed's failure. I tend \nto put that more on the bank supervisor as the authorities who were \nspecifically on the ground.\n  So, yes, interest rates were kept too low too long, in my opinion. \nBut is that a reason to reject him as Fed Chairman? I do not think so. \nThat, again, is Monday morning quarterbacking. The real test of his \nability to manage the money supply and to live up to the primary \ncommitment of the Fed, which is to have sound money and a strong \neconomy, was how he handled the crisis of late 2009 and, as a corollary \ninto that, how he intends to handle the impending problems with the \nliquidity that is in the market and needs to come out of the market.\n  As I said before, if I was looking around for someone to do this job, \nthis would be the person I would want to have because I think he is the \nbest person for the job. Is he perfect? No. Nobody is perfect anywhere. \nBut has he proven himself to be an extraordinarily talented and \naggressive leader who saw a crisis, managed it, and kept a lot of \nAmericans from having a much more severe impact on their lifestyle as a \nresult of his actions? Yes, he has, and I think that is the test.\n  I certainly hope my colleagues will vote for him. I understand there \nis this populist fervor around here now. Populism has always been a \nheavy strain in our body politic in America. I understand populism \nusually has to have an enemy, and usually it has to be an enemy that \ncan be hyperbolized into a conspiratorial group. And so the Fed, since \nit is separate from the formal government--intentionally so, and it has \nto be because we do not want the Congress managing our money supply. \nThat would be a disaster. Look at what we do with the fiscal house. \nThink what we would do with the money supply. The Fed is a separate \nentity, and it is insular to a significant degree, and therefore it \nbecomes an easy target for those who want to fire the flames of \npopulism, both on the left and the right.\n  I honestly regret that the President has joined in this exercise \nbecause I think he has thrown kerosene on the fire. Regrettably, the \nfire was blowing through his own Fed Chairman nominee. But it was a \nfoolish thing to do because you don't know where the fire is going to \ngo when populism gets ignited.\n  Populism usually involves exaggeration, and it almost always involves \nmisapplied purposes. The substance usually is very significantly \ndifferent than the actual description of what the events are, and in \nthis case that is true. The Fed is not some secretive institution which \nis trying to undermine the quality of life in America; just the \nopposite. The Fed is a very public institution that is audited, fairly \ncompletely, with the exception of the open market window, which \nshouldn't be audited because we don't want Congress managing money \nsupply, and an audit of that responsibility would put the Congress in \nthe business of managing the money supply.\n  Not only does it not undermine America's prosperity, it is the key to \nAmerica's prosperity--or one of the keys--because it maintains a sound \nmoney supply and because, in a time of crisis--such as we had in late \n2008--it is there to step up and make the tough decisions, independent \nof the political process, and it has proven it can do it.\n  I would hope we wouldn't allow all this fervor to find fault with \npeople to overwhelm an extremely talented nominee who deserves to be \nreconfirmed and whom we, quite honestly, need in that position--as \nChairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Ben \nBernanke as Chairman of the Fed. I do so as a member of the Banking \nCommittee who voted against his nomination in that committee because I \nresearched his record, and on that record I believe Ben Bernanke is not \nthe right person to lead the Fed. In short, Ben Bernanke's decisions \nover the last 8 years as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, as \nChairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and as Chairman of the \nFed helped set the fire that destroyed our economy.\n  Mr. Bernanke is a calm and unassuming man, responsive and thorough in \nhis explanations, and very likable. In addition, to keep the analogy, \nhe has done a good job with the firehose over the last year. He \nunderstood that tightening credit during a collapsing bubble in the \neconomy would be akin to turning off the fire hydrant in the middle of \na fire. He did keep the fire hydrant turned on, and I give him credit \nfor that. But now we need to rebuild our economic house. That takes an \narchitect, not a fireman; that takes a builder, not someone turning on \na fire hydrant. Based on his performance over the last 8 years, I do \nnot believe Ben Bernanke is the right architect to rebuild our economy, \nan economy that will work for working families.\n  Consider the following: Ben Bernanke failed to react to the enormous \ndanger from an interlocking web of derivatives that created high-speed \nchannels for massive financial contagion. Simply put: Derivatives turn \nour financial institutions into a set of dominoes in which, if one \nfalls, others fall, and Ben\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\nBernanke did not respond to the growing threat of derivatives.\n  Bernanke failed to respond to the increase of proprietary trading \nthat amplified risk in both depository lending institutions and our \nfinancial system as a whole. Again, let me put this more simply. \nGambling on stocks and bonds and derivatives is fundamentally \nincompatible with bank stability. But Bernanke did not respond. Ben \nBernanke supported and advocated for policies that reduced capital and \nincreased leverage in both commercial banks and investment banks, \ngreatly magnifying risk across the system.\n  He supported Greenspan's philosophy of deregulation and self-\nregulation. He advocated for Basel II. What was Basel II? Basel II was \nto say to the largest banks in America: You can set your own leverage \nratios. What did that result in? That resulted in banks going to a 30-\nto-1 leverage. If you invest money 30 to 1 in an up market, it is a \nkilling. You make all kinds of money. But when you are at a 30-to-1 \nleverage and the market turns down, you blow up immediately.\n  There is not an analyst in America who can tell you at any one moment \nwhen the market will go up and when the market will go down. But they \ncan tell you it will go up and down over a period of time. What goes up \nmust come down. There is never going to be a steady upward climb \nforever. So if you allow 30-to-1 leverage, you are going to make a lot \nof financial institutions very happy. They are going to make a lot of \nmoney, until the market turns down. Well, Ben Bernanke set loose the \nleverage requirements that paved the path, that set this fire, that \nburned down our economy.\n  Ben Bernanke ignored the housing bubble. He failed to protect \nhomeowners from deceptive practice committees. Why is this important? \nLet me explain what happened over those 8 years. Families went to their \nreal estate agent and the real estate agent followed a strict code of \nconduct--a strict code of ethics--and they arranged to buy a house. \nThey then went to a broker and assumed there would be a similar strict \ncode of ethics and they were going to get a loan for their house. The \nbroker said: You know what, home ownership has gotten very complicated; \nmortgages have gotten very complicated; I am going to be your adviser. \nI am going to be your adviser, trust me, and sign this loan right here. \nThis will be the best one for you.\n  What was wrong with that was the homeowner did not know the broker \nwas getting paid a large sum of money, called a yield spread premium, \nalso known as a steering payment because they were designed to steer \npeople into certain loans, also known as a kickback. The broker was \nreceiving those, and families who qualified for prime loans ended up in \nsubprime loans.\n  What institution was responsible for consumer protection on \nmortgages? The Fed was responsible. Ben Bernanke did not do a thing to \nprotect consumers from this gross conflict of interest that torpedoed \nthe financial prospects of millions of America's families for which he \nhad direct responsibility.\n  In the Fed, monetary policy has been in the penthouse, as it must be. \nThat is a primary responsibility--safety and soundness in the upper \nfloors and consumer protection in the basement. We cannot leave \nconsumer protection in the basement.\n  So I will close with this. Ben Bernanke was not alone in helping to \nset this fire. He had a lot of company. But over 8 years, he made \ncritical mistake after critical mistake that, in the short-term, large \nfinancial institutions loved, but it set the conditions for our economy \nto burn down. The consequences for families were extraordinary--loss of \njobs, loss of retirement, loss of savings. With the loss of a job came \nthe loss of health care. That is an extraordinary amount of damage. Now \nwe need someone to rebuild our economy, and Ben Bernanke is not that \nman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Departure of Robert Russell\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, Holmes had Watson, Mat Dillon had Chester, \neven Andy had Barney; for the past 20 years, I have had Bob Russell. \nBob has long been a trusted friend, and for the past 7 years he has \nbeen my great chief of staff, providing valuable counsel, know-how, and \nhumor. Bob is headed to the private sector, but I could not let him \nleave without thanking him for his public service in the Arkansas \nattorney general's office and in the Senate.\n  Bob was instrumental in assembling an exceptional team of talented \naides, many of whom are in the gallery today. Over the last 7 years, he \nled that team as we steered a number of legislative initiatives to \nsuccess, including legislation to improve children's safety, help \nmilitary families, and strengthen Arkansas communities. None of these \naccomplishments would have been possible without Bob's hard work, \nintegrity, and deliberation.\n  Bob believes in the ``do right'' rule. He came to the Senate to get \nthese done for Arkansas, and when he realized that partisanship was \ngetting in the way, he took action. Along with Tom Ingram, former chief \nof staff to Lamar Alexander, he formed the bipartisan chiefs of staff \ngroup. This informal group meets regularly to facilitate working \nrelationships across the aisle. These friendships translate into \nsolutions instead of barriers.\n  The so-called Gang of 14 is a prime example, where Bob and Tom \nrecognized early on that common ground on Federal judges was more \nfavorable than Senate gridlock. Just a few weeks later, 14 Senators, \nincluding myself, struck a deal that enabled the Senate to move forward \nwith the judicial nominations and conduct regular business. That is the \ntype of unseen influence Bob Russell has had on this place for the last \n7 years.\n  I love Bob and I trust him. He is a good family man and he is a good \nSouthern Baptist. On many Mondays, we would come in and say: Tell me \nabout your sermon on Sunday. I will miss his presence and his insights. \nHe has been a good mentor and adviser to me and to many on my staff and \nhas made many lifelong friendships here in Washington. He is more than \na chief of staff, he is my friend.\n  Frank Broyles is an Arkansas hero, well-loved for coaching the \nRazorbacks to a national championship and famous for developing \nassistant coaches. One of his players was Jimmy Johnson, who would \nlater coach as an assistant at Arkansas under Broyles. It is tough to \nlet an assistant coach go, but when he is that good, he deserves to go \nout and do great things on his own. I feel the same way about Bob, \nespecially since I know that Ecclesiastes says:\n\n       For everything there is a season, and a time for every \n     matter under Heaven.\n\n  Johnson went on to win a national championship and two Super Bowls. I \nknow Bob will go on to a highly successful career in his own right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of the Honorable Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n  I am somewhat conflicted about Dr. Bernanke's nomination for a second \nterm as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our Nation's economy is still \nreeling from a significant downturn, during which home values plummeted \nand foreclosures rapidly increased, wreaking havoc on our financial \nsystem. Markets tumbled, banks and businesses failed, and millions of \njobs were lost. Ultimately, the American people have borne the brunt of \nthis recession, watching jobs, homes, and life savings vanish, while \nseeing their hard-earned tax dollars bail out the bad actors that \ncaused it.\n  That being said, the financial crisis could have been worse. It could \nhave turned into a depression. So far, we are not there. I believe some \nof what Dr. Bernanke did was good. He is an expert on the Great \nDepression. He unleashed an arsenal of financial tools to combat the \nrecession, he tried to inject liquidity into the financial sector, and \ndid much to try to keep our markets afloat. While I commend him for \nthat, I am very concerned about some of the precedent that has been set \nin this crisis.\n  I am especially troubled by the continuing expansion of TARP. Almost \nimmediately after its passage, the Treasury Department deviated from \nthe intent of the program. Instead of\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\npurchasing troubled assets, which we were told would be the purpose, \nthe Treasury purchased equity stakes in over 300 of our Nation's \nfinancial institutions. It expanded the TARP to nonfinancial companies, \npouring billions into AIG, General Motors, and Chrysler.\n  We must begin the effort to wind down TARP. With banks paying back \ntheir TARP receipts, we need to unwind TARP and pay down the deficit. \nAlthough some have suggested TARP is a revolving fund, the legislation \nwas never sold as such--not ever. Americans are tired of excessive \nspending. If there is anything we ought to do right now, it is to stop \nspending TARP and stimulus funds that are not allocated and show the \nAmerican people we have heard the message in Washington.\n  TARP was designed as a one-time injection of assistance to prevent \nfinancial institutions from collapsing and taking down the larger \neconomy. Now that those financial institutions have gained their \nfooting, we should pay back the American taxpayer. In bailing out our \nNation's financial system and large banks, we have left the very real \nimpression that no bank is too big to fail. This policy has allowed \nthose who contributed to bringing our economy to its knees to right \ntheir ship at taxpayers' expense. It has helped these institutions \naccess cheap capital from the government, adversely affecting safe and \nsound institutions such as community banks.\n\n  I am also concerned about the path our country is on in our recovery. \nIn September, Chairman Bernanke said our recession was over. While our \neconomy may be recovering, many Americans do not see it. At 10 percent, \nour national unemployment is still extraordinarily high, despite huge \nspending measures such as the stimulus package, which was supposed to \ncreate jobs. The debt and deficits our Nation has incurred over the \npast 2 years has sent our Nation's debt on an unsustainable trajectory.\n  Our debt is at $12.394 trillion. Earlier today, the Senate voted to \nonce again raise the ceiling by an astonishing almost $2 trillion, the \nfifth time to do so in 18 months.\n  Under Chairman Bernanke's leadership, I do not think the Fed has paid \nenough attention to--nor has he talked enough about--the mounting debt \nand the immense burden it is going to place on our economy today and \ncertainly on our children and grandchildren.\n  Fiscal sustainability is not on the horizon. Instead, we see endless \nspending as far as the eye can see: health care reform, cap-and-trade \nenergy legislation, a possible second stimulus. All will be huge \ngovernment programs which will not only raise our government spending \nbut raise costs on individuals and businesses in the form of new taxes \nand mandates. I am concerned about the consequences this increase in \nspending will have on our economy.\n  I will not support Chairman Bernanke's nomination. I am conflicted, \nas some of the things he did were good, but his actions to save our \neconomy have helped set a very dangerous precedent for the future. The \nprecedent of massive spending is not the answer.\n  I will continue to examine the Fed's exit strategy and will most \ncertainly encourage further action from Chairman Bernanke on our debt \nand our Nation's finances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 4 minutes be taken from the \nDemocratic side's time?\n  Mr. DODD. That is fine. I know the Senator from North Dakota had \nasked to be heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thought I was next.\n  Mr. President, it was only a little over a year ago, with the \ncollapse of Lehman Brothers, that we faced a financial crisis the likes \nof which few have seen in our lifetime. We were truly standing on the \nedge and staring into the abyss. For all intents and purposes the \nfinancial system was on the cusp of a total breakdown. A Great \nDepression loomed.\n  Now, a year later, while we cannot diminish the very real and large \nproblems that remain in front of us, we did succeed in preventing the \ncatastrophe that seemed very possible if not probable in the fall of \n2000. Nobody was more important in preventing the collapse of the \nfinancial system and the rescue of the economy from what looked like \nimminent freefall than was Chairman Bernanke.\n  I was there at many of the meetings, and I saw his steady hand and \nguidance. That is why I am going to vote to reconfirm him as Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board.\n  The Fed certainly made mistakes in the runup to the financial crisis: \nfailing to use its regulatory authority to rein in a skyrocketing \ncredit boom, failing to adequately fulfill its responsibility to \nprotect consumers from predatory lending practices in mortgages and \nelsewhere, and allowing too risky activities with too little \nprotection.\n  While most of these policies began under the previous Chairmen, \nChairman Bernanke presided over the Fed and continued them. That is \nsomething I am sure he is not proud of, but he has acknowledged that he \nhas many lessons to learn from the crisis and he is working hard to \nmake sure the same mistakes are not repeated in the future.\n  I also want to say a word about the consequences of failing to \nreconfirm him. Our economy, while struggling to return to solid ground, \nremains fragile. Unemployment is way too high. We have yet to turn the \ncorner on sustained job growth. Businesses, small and large, are still \nhaving a hard time getting access to credit they need to expand and \ngrow, or even, in many cases, doing business as usual.\n  Singling out Chairman Bernanke and the Fed for punishment might be \ntemporarily satisfying for some, but it will not help a single business \nadd jobs. It will not prevent a single homeowner from being kicked out \nof his or her house. Instead, it will accomplish just the opposite. By \nsending a message that the Federal Reserve and its monetary policy \ndecisions are under the thumb of Congress, businesses will be faced \nwith the prospect that the Fed might not be able to do what is \nnecessary for the economy because of pressure from Congress.\n  Economists tell us one of the major things holding the economy back \nis uncertainty about the policies that Washington will pursue. This \nwould exacerbate that concern and create a very bad outcome for the \neconomy and the country. I have said it before, and I will say it \nagain: If you don't like monetary policy when the Fed does it, just \nwait until the politicians get their hands on it.\n  I am going to vote to reconfirm Chairman Bernanke as Fed chairman, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when I think of what a Federal Reserve \nChairman is supposed to do, I think of two key responsibilities: \nmaintaining stable prices and keeping our dollar strong. Unfortunately, \nChairman Bernanke's Federal Reserve has not performed well on either \ncount.\n  Consumer inflation, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nincreased 2.9 percent from June to December 2009.\n  Manufacturers' cost of production is up 4.4 percent versus last year; \nup 5 percent in the past 6 months; and up 9.5 percent in the past 3 \nmonths.\n  Other measures of inflation, such as the 5-year, 5-year forward, \nclearly show an accelerating trend. Inflation is the last thing our \neconomy needs right now.\n  As for the dollar, during the last year, its value dropped more than \n10 percent. Much of this weakness is attributable to the Federal \nReserve setting short-term interest rates at virtually zero.\n  As such, gold prices have surged, as investors worry that the dollar \nis no longer a reliable store of value.\n  OPEC has contemplated designating oil in a currency other than the \ndollar, and foreign economists have suggested that we issue our own \ngovernment debt in yen, euros, or yuan, rather than dollars.\n  While neither of these actions is likely, it is clear that the \nFederal Reserve needs to pay greater attention to the dollar's value \nwhen making monetary-policy decisions. The preeminence of the dollar is \nsynonymous with American prestige abroad. Nothing represents our \nNation's soft power more than its strength.\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n  Another chief concern of mine is that, during Chairman Bernanke's \ntenure, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators showed an \ninability to use bank examinations to distinguish between good and bad \nloans.\n  Before the housing crisis, banking regulators were permitting \nfinancial institutions to lend to individuals who obviously did not \nhave the ability to repay the money they borrowed. Had they been more \nvigilant, the crisis may have been less severe.\n  Now, however, in seeking to be more cautious, bank regulators are \nmaking another mistake: They have been telling institutions in my home \nState of Arizona, and throughout the country, not to make loans to even \nthe most creditworthy individuals and businesses.\n  I have heard numerous stories, from both lenders and borrowers in my \nState, about bank examiners deciding to downgrade a performing loan \nbecause, on paper, the underlying collateral was worth less than its \npurchase price.\n  As a result, the banks had to either raise more money, which is \nincredibly difficult, or else the borrower had to contribute more cash \nto keep from technically defaulting on the loan.\n  Why would we have policies that punish responsible borrowers? Why \nwould it be in our interest to force those who are current on their \nloans into a situation that could lead to bankruptcy? Doing so makes a \nbad situation worse and creates problems that ripple through our \neconomy.\n  I am also troubled that Chairman Bernanke refuses to take \nresponsibility for the housing bubble and disputes that the Federal \nReserve's lax monetary policy helped create it.\n  As the respected columnist Bob Robb of the Arizona Republic recently \nexplained:\n\n       [Chairman] Bernanke is intellectually shadow boxing. . . . \n     When a bubble occurs in a commodity which is almost \n     universally purchased using extensive borrowing, such as \n     homes, it's fatuous to claim that easy money doesn't play a \n     significant role.\n\n  Chairman Bernanke strongly supported this lax monetary policy, and he \nshould own up to its role in the financial crisis.\n  These are all reasons to oppose his renomination or confirmation. \nNonetheless, I must vote to reconfirm Chairman Bernanke, simply because \nI am concerned that another nominee chosen by President Obama would be \nless independent than Chairman Bernanke and would direct the Federal \nReserve's resources to support the administration's policy interests, \nand, therefore, bypass congressional approval for appropriated funds.\n  This administration has a history of nominating partisan, out-of-the \nmainstream individuals for key jobs, and replacing Chairman Bernanke \nwould be another opportunity for it to do so.\n  I would hope that if Chairman Bernanke is confirmed, he will take \naction to remedy the problems I have just addressed. They demand his \nattention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nMr. Bernanke to continue as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I do so, \nacknowledging that he contributed to the crisis, but also recognizing \nthat without his strong leadership the crisis might have become a \nconflagration.\n  How did we get to the brink of financial collapse? I might say to \nsome of my colleagues, they should look in the mirror because they, \ntoo, contributed to the forming of the bubble. How? An overly loose \nfiscal policy under the control of the Congress and the administration.\n  The previous administration ran up massive deficits, doubled the \ndebt. That is a loose fiscal policy. It was accompanied by a loose \nmonetary policy after 9/11.\n  After 9/11, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates very low, flooded \nthe system with money, and the combination of an overly loose fiscal \npolicy and an overly loose monetary policy created the seed bed for \nbubbles to form. Indeed they did.\n  We didn't just have a housing bubble, we had an energy bubble--oil \nprices went to $100 a barrel. We had a commodity bubble--wheat went to \nmore than $20 a bushel. These are examples and evidence of bubbles \nbeing formed. When you have an overly loose monetary policy and an \noverly loose fiscal policy, bubbles are going to form and ultimately \nbubbles burst. When they do, there is enormous economic wreckage. That \nis what has occurred here--all of it coupled with an era of \nderegulation.\n  Under the previous administration--and, yes, the Federal Reserve has \nresponsibility here as well--there was too little regulation of major \nfinancial institutions and of major financial instruments. Trillions of \ndollars of derivative instruments were floating around the world \nunregulated, even unrecorded. Of course there was danger there.\n  Warren Buffett warned that derivatives constituted a nuclear time \nbomb hanging over the global economy. Ultimately the bubbles burst, and \nultimately the economic wreckage built. Bernanke bears some \nresponsibility for that, without doubt. But once the crisis developed \nhe took charge in a way that is unprecedented. He took step after step \nto provide liquidity to this global economy to prevent and avert a \ncollapse.\n  I believe when the history of this period is written, in terms of the \nresponse to the dangerous cloud hanging over this global economy, \nBernanke will prove to have been one of the heroes of the piece. In \ninstance after instance, he took unprecedented action to avert a \ncollapse.\n  His academic study was the Great Depression.\n  He resolved as a young man to do everything he could to prevent any \nfuture collapse of that magnitude. He proved to be the right man at the \nright time. He deserves to be confirmed in this vote this afternoon. I \nask my colleagues to please be judicious. Let's recognize that he made \nserious mistakes. Let's also admit the Congress and the administration, \nthe previous administration, made very serious mistakes: overly loose \nfiscal policy, overly loose monetary policy, a lack of regulation, the \ncreation of bubbles, bubbles that burst that created enormous wreckage. \nBut Ben Bernanke helped avert a global financial collapse. I believe \nhistory will prove that is the truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the Senator from North \nDakota, in rising to support the confirmation of Chairman Ben Bernanke \nto a second term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. As has been \npointed out throughout the course of this debate, his position at the \nFederal Reserve prior to September 2008 gave him the opportunity and \nthe obligation to look carefully at a building crisis.\n  His response was not as perceptive or as adroit as we all in \nhindsight would wish to see. He did recognize, however, by August of \n2007 that this economy was slowing down, and he applied the traditional \nmacroeconomic tools by beginning to lower the interest rate.\n  By December of 2008, the interest rate was virtually zero, the \nFederal rate. That has helped, I think, keep the economy moving and has \nhelped us move forward. But the point that so many of my colleagues \nhave made is when it came to critical moments during the fall of 2008, \nChairman Bernanke understood the problem and was able to use \nextraordinary measures, first persuading the Federal Reserve to follow \nhis lead, and then using extraordinary measures to begin to blunt the \nworst effects of this economic crisis we faced, and continue to face, \nand his efforts to ensure that there was liquidity in the system--\nprecisely what was done incorrectly in 1929, 1930 through the early \n1930s, where the Federal Reserve pulled back, accelerating the \ndepression rather than cushioning the economy from further decline.\n  He took innovative steps that seem sort of esoteric, but helped \nrestore stability in capital markets. But he also took very decisive \nintervention with respect to the money market mutual funds, when the \nReserve Fund broke the buck, as they say, when its net asset value \ndropped below a dollar, there was a tremendous sense of not only \nuncertainty but potential chaos as everyone was plotting to withdraw \ntheir funds from money markets, which would have created huge problems \nand which would have affected every American in this country. But he \nmoved decisively and aggressively,\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\nalong with the Treasury Department, to provide stability and support. \nHe also helped create programs like the TALF program to restart markets \nfor auto, home, credit card, student loan, and small business loans, \nhis ability to interject liquidity into the system, gave us a break, if \nyou will, from a rapidly deteriorating situation.\n  I sense, and my colleagues have said, that in the future his \nreaction--calm, decisive, innovative, imaginative--was one of the \nthings that prevented this catastrophic situation from becoming even \nworse. That is an important aspect that we must consider in regards to \nhis renomination.\n  There is something else too. If the Chairman is not confirmed, there \nwill be a period of uncertainty as to who is leading the Federal \nReserve and what direction will it take. The last thing we need today \nis uncertainty in our economic future. If the ability of individuals \nand institutions to invest, to commit their capital and their effort \nand their work is put on hold, then the progress we have seen--and it \nis not sufficient but we have seen some--in fact, there are \nexpectations that the reports on gross domestic product tomorrow will \nshow significant increases rather than significant contractions, which \nis what is what we saw under the last administration.\n  But if we inject this uncertainty, if we go months and months with no \none clearly in charge at the Federal Reserve, it will have a very \ntangible, rapid, and unfortunate effect on our ability to move forward \nwith the economy.\n  There is another issue here I think that is important to note. That \nother issue is that, having done all of these remarkable innovative \nprograms to increase liquidity, to keep the engine of the economy \nrunning, albeit not at the level and speed and power we might want, but \nkeep it moving, at some point those programs have to be unraveled, \npulled back, because we will face another danger.\n  We face a danger, perhaps, in terms of inflation rate effects. We \nface a danger in terms of currency issues, in terms of value of the \ndollar. This is something we all recognize, this great pivot, as I call \nit, moving away from low interest rates and liquidity infusion, to \nhigher interest rates, the dismantling of some of these programs. For \nexample, the Fed already announced that it intends to begin to slowly \nget out of its support for the mortgage market in a few weeks.\n  All of that has to be as tacitly managed, as carefully understood, as \nthese programs were in the fall of 2008 and 2009 when the Chairman was \nmoving forward. As a result, I think we need someone who understands \nthese programs, and understands them not just theoretically but \nliterally from trial and error, from understanding what worked, what \ndid not work, what the consequences are.\n  No one has that type of knowledge and insight at this juncture other \nthan Chairman Bernanke. He is, of course, as an individual, a man of \nremarkable integrity and character who is committed to public service, \nand who is a pragmatist, not an ideologue, someone who will continue to \nprovide not only guidance but leadership at a place we sorely need it, \nat the Federal Reserve. From my talks with Chairman Bernanke, I think \nhe understands that people are hurting, and that his role in getting \nour country back to full employment is just as important as his role in \nmonetary policy. The engines of our economy are small businesses and \njobs, and this is what people in my state of Rhode Island expect from \nthe Federal Reserve. At this critical juncture, I hope that my \ncolleagues will support Chairman Bernanke for a second term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of Chairman Ben \nBernanke. Chairman Bernanke has demonstrated tremendous skill in \nhandling extraordinary economic challenges. We were very fortunate that \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors during the \neconomic chaos last fall was an individual whose area of academic \nexpertise is the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve took \nunprecedented emergency actions that helped stabilize the economy and \nprevent further collapse of the financial markets.\n  During my first meeting with the Chairman, he shared with me his \nexperience as a school board member of trying to improve the \navailability of financial education. I have always greatly appreciated \nChairman Bernanke's dedicated efforts to improve the financial literacy \nof students and consumers. The true costs of financial illiteracy have \nbeen made all too apparent by the financial crisis. One of the core \ncauses of the crisis was that families were steered into mortgages with \nrisks and costs they could not afford or even understand. Chairman \nBernanke and I share a firm commitment to trying to improve the lives \nof working families through improved consumer protections and financial \nliteracy.\n  Chairman Bernanke has led efforts at the Federal Reserve to better \nprotect and inform consumers. During Chairman Bernanke's tenure, the \nFederal Reserve has increased consumer protections in the subprime \nmortgage market and limited questionable practices in the broader \nmortgage market. Additionally, the board has proposed further \nlimitations on loan originators, brokers, and loan officers.\n  Also during Chairman Bernanke's tenure, the Federal Reserve developed \nimproved rules to restrict credit card practices, enhance overdraft fee \ndisclosures, strengthen student loan disclosures, and restrict gift \ncard fees.\n  I have also greatly appreciated the efforts of Chairman Bernanke and \nthe Federal Reserve to promote the use of financial institutions for \nlower cost remittances. Too often consumers fail to take advantage of \nlower cost remittance services found at banks and credit unions. \nRemittances can be helpful in providing opportunities for the unbanked \nto utilize mainstream financial institutions.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Bernanke and the \nFederal Reserve to better protect, educate, and empower consumers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have been asked by the President to \nconfirm Ben Bernanke to a second term as Chairman of the Federal \nReserve. Given the current state of the economy, and the nature of the \ncrisis that led to the recession from which we are struggling to \nrecover, this request has generated a great deal of controversy. I am \nconflicted by this nomination, and I want to explain my decision to \nsupport it.\n  The most striking feature of the economic crisis is that it was, to a \nlarge extent, a collective failure of financial regulation. It was not \na function of the normal waxing and waning of the economic cycle. \nInstead, our financial institutions engaged in ever-more complex, \nhighly dubious, and risky transactions, and when the risk was exposed, \nit set off a chain reaction that dragged down our entire economy.\n  The lack of adequate financial regulations was a major cause of the \ncrisis. We must reform that system on an urgent basis. Consumers' \nrights need to be protected.\n  But in addition to the failures of the system, part of the crisis was \nmade possible by collective failures of those entrusted to oversee the \nfinancial system. Chairman Bernanke was one of those people. He and \nothers should have been more forceful in reining in the greed-driven \nabuses and excesses of our financial sector.\n  Some of my colleagues who share this view believe that this fact \nalone should justify a ``no'' vote on Chairman Bernanke. But I believe \nthat we must weigh both Chairman Bernanke's role and actions before the \ncrisis, but also those since the crisis began. In other words, was he a \nbigger part of the problem or the solution?\n  First, while Chairman Bernanke should have acted more forcefully to \ntry to prevent the crisis, most of the abuses that brought it about \noccurred in areas outside the Federal Reserve's primary areas of \noversight. I also believe that Chairman Bernanke's and the Federal \nReserve's recent support for enhanced financial regulation are crucial \nto correcting some of the structural failures that lead to the crisis.\n  Second, the Federal Reserve's actions helped to prevent this tragic \nrecession from becoming a second Great Depression. This is no small \nthing. As bad as the last several months have been, they would have \nbeen even worse but for Chairman Bernanke's leadership.\n  Lastly, it is clear that Chairman Bernanke's role in preventing a \ndeeper crisis has earned him some confidence in our financial markets. \nA defeat of\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nhis renomination carries the risk of shaking these markets, at the very \nmoment we need them to operate in a stable fashion so as to help boost \nour fragile economic recovery.\n  When making the decision of whether to support this nomination, I end \nup believing that Chairman Bernanke's performance in addressing the \neconomic crisis and his current efforts to significantly enhance \nfinancial regulation to help prevent future crises, outweigh his past \nmistakes. On balance, I believe that Chairman Bernanke should be given \nthe opportunity to continue to help pull us through this difficult \nperiod, and I will vote in favor of his confirmation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to express my concern about the \nnomination of Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and \nexplain why I will vote against him when the Senate has the opportunity \nthis week.\n  I know many of my colleagues will support Mr. Bernanke because he was \na cocaptain of the U.S. economic recovery efforts in the last year and \na half. Appointed by President Bush, Mr. Bernanke undoubtedly has a \ndifficult job. Our Nation has been jolted by greed, corruption, fraud, \nand excessive risk-taking that led to the largest taxpayer bailout in \nhistory. Mr. Bernanke was holding the reigns, along with officials in \nthe Department of the Treasury, but steered us into an out-of-control \nspending frenzy with very little oversight by the American people.\n  Ben Bernanke has been wrong about the economy. He was wrong about the \nsubprime lending meltdown. He was apparently blind to the pitfalls of \ncredit default swaps. He misled the American public about the purpose \nand intent of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He recklessly spent \nbillions of dollars on a few renegade financial firms, picking winners \nand losers on Wall Street and justified these actions by saying Main \nStreet would be saved. Then, he stonewalled Congress from learning \nabout how the billions of dollars were spent. Ben Bernanke also opposed \ntransparency almost every step of the way.\n  Let me address these issues more in depth.\n  Whenever the Chairman of the Federal Reserve opines about the \neconomy, he understands that his words can be misunderstood or taken \nout of context and thus have an unintended impact on the market and \nday-to-day trading. However, Ben Bernanke has been saying that our \neconomy has been strong since the beginning of the decline. His \nanalysis of the situation and predictions for our future economic \ngrowth were far off.\n  Let's take the housing problems, for example. In 2006, Fed Chairman \nBernanke believed that the housing market had been strong but could \ncool slightly. He said, ``Our expectation is that the decline in \nactivity or the slowing in activity will be moderate, that house prices \nwill probably continue to rise, but not at the pace that they had been \nrising. So we expect the housing market to cool, but not to change very \nsharply.'' He didn't think the housing market would blow up, nor did he \nbelieve that the weakness in the market would spill over to other \nsectors of the economy. He was dead wrong.\n  He was wrong about unemployment. Most recently, in May of 2009 and in \nfront of the Joint Economic Committee, Fed Chairman Bernanke said: \n``Currently, we don't think [the unemployment rate] will get to 10 \npercent.'' In November the unemployment rate hit 10.2 percent.\n  We can go back to February 2006. As President Bush's Chairman of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, Mr. Bernanke was responsible for drafting \nthe Economic Report of the President which claimed the following: ``The \neconomy has shifted from recovery to sustained expansion. . . . The \nU.S. economy continues to be well positioned for long-term growth.'' In \nthis report, Bernanke projected the unemployment rate to be 5 percent \nfrom 2008 through 2011.\n  Even in 2007, the Fed Chairman believed that the labor market would \nstay healthy and incomes would continue to rise. In February of that \nyear, he said that ``the business sector remains in excellent financial \ncondition.'' Later in July of 2007, Mr. Bernanke said, ``Employment \nshould continue to expand. . . . The global economy continues to be \nstrong. . . . financial markets have remained supportive of economic \ngrowth.''\n  Then came the Bear Stearns debacle. Bear Stearns led the charge in \nthe securitization market. Because they had placed significant \nresources in mortgage-backed securities, the company was on the verge \nof collapse. In March of 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \nattempted to save the company through an emergency loan, but failed and \nmoved to force a sale to JPMorgan Chase.\n  Three months later, Fed Chairman Bernanke still did not acknowledge \nthe pending economic crisis. In fact, in June, he said, ``The risk that \nthe economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have \ndiminished over the past month or so.'' He couldn't have been more \nwrong. The economy melted down, and the Fed and Department of the \nTreasury had to come to the rescue of several failing firms.\n  The Federal Reserve Chairman only warned Congress about the financial \ncrisis when it was too late. Under his leadership, the Federal Reserve \ntook very little action to control the root causes that led us to \neconomic storm we have all had to endure. Instead, they urged Congress \nand the American people to swallow a plan that was ill conceived and \nrisked making the situation worse.\n  So another reason I cannot support his renomination as Chairman of \nthe Board is because of the disastrous implementation of the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, also known as TARP.\n  Chairman Bernanke came to Congress with former Treasury Secretary \nPaulson, selling a proposal that would direct taxpayer money to \npurchase ``toxic assets.'' The proposal would have allowed the Federal \nGovernment to take bad assets off the books of troubled firms to keep \ncredit flowing. We were told that the situation was dire. We were told \nthat the Fed and the Treasury Department had a plan in place. We were \ntold that taxpayers may even come out ahead. We were told to trust \nthem.\n  It wasn't long after the Emergency Economic Stability Act was passed \nin October 2008 that the Fed and the Treasury reversed course. Without \ninput from Congress, they took the authority they were given and went \ntheir own way. Chairman Bernanke was doling out funds for Bear Stearns \nand AIG while the Treasury was doling out funds to firms that were \ndestined for failure.\n  Today, the Troubled Assets Relief Program has been used as a slush \nfund to bail out firms on Wall Street and troubled automakers. Taxpayer \nmoney has been enabling these companies to continue in their misguided \nways. Corporate jets were being used to lobby Congress for billions of \ndollars, and CEOs resisted proposals to slim down the fat pockets of \ntheir cronies. The American people were misled, and Ben Bernanke should \nshare responsibility for that.\n  But, it wasn't just the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was used \nto funnel taxpayer money to failing firms. Chairman Bernanke led the \nFed on a spending spree, using a blank check to unilaterally direct \nmoney to AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n  Chairman Bernanke was AWOL as the Federal Reserve funneled billions \nof taxpayer dollars to AIG knowing that the money would go directly out \nthe back door to AIG counterparties like Goldman Sachs and foreign \nbanks. AIG's payment of 100 cents on the dollar for the counterparty \nsecurities meant Goldman actually received more than some other \ncounterparties, because Goldman's securities had a market value of 40 \ncents on the dollar while UBS Bank's securities, for example, were \nworth 71 cents on the dollar.\n  Chairman Bernanke was absent from the critical ``haircut'' \nnegotiations with the AIG counterparties, in stark contrast to the TARP \nCapital Purchase Program negotiations weeks earlier. As a consequence, \nno reductions in counterparty payments were obtained for the American \ntaxpayer. These negotiations failed despite the fact that some of the \nforeign counterparties offered to reopen negotiations. The Federal \nReserve failed to capitalize on this opportunity and investment bankers \nwere paid in full.\n  The AIG bailout was designed by the Fed in a manner that funneled \nbillions of dollars directly to the counterparties. No other outcome \nwas possible.\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\nThe effect was a ``backdoor bailout'' regardless of the Fed's now-\nstated intent merely to improve AIG's liquidity in order to avoid a \ncollapse.\n  Reasonable people can disagree about whether Chairman Bernanke made \nthe right decisions. Aside from the problems I have already outlined, I \nhave serious reservations about voting for him again given his \nresistance to transparency. For example, we have seen very little \ncooperation from the Federal Reserve to ensure that the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, has independent audit authority.\n  Last March, the GAO testified before the Finance Committee that the \nFederal Reserve was resisting its efforts to conduct oversight of the \nresponse to the financial crisis by citing provisions of law that were \nintended to maintain the independence of monetary policy.\n  Such restrictions could be defended when the Federal Reserve focused \nonly on monetary policy. However, since the financial crisis, the \nFederal Reserve has routinely exercised extraordinary emergency powers \nto subsidize financial firms far above the levels Congress is willing \nto authorize through legislation. The Federal Reserve took on enormous \namounts of risk in complicated and unprecedented ways. That risk is \nultimately borne by the American taxpayer. Congress authorized $700 \nbillion in funds under TARP. However, the total projected assistance in \nvarious initiatives by the Federal Reserve could be up to $3.4 trillion \nby GAO estimates.\n  Therefore, I introduced an amendment in May of last year that would \nhave guaranteed GAO the authority to audit all of the extraordinary \nemergency assistance from the Federal Reserve. Regrettably, due to \nobjections from the Federal Reserve, my amendment had to be watered-\ndown to ensure that GAO received at least some of the additional \nauthorities it needed.\n  Although I would have preferred to make all of the Fed's emergency \nactions under section 13(3) subject to GAO audit, I agreed to limit my \namendment to Fed actions aimed at specific companies like Bear Stearns \nand AIG. However, broader, more comprehensive oversight authority over \nthe Federal Reserve is needed to ensure the kind of transparency and \naccountability the American people expect. Unfortunately, when the \nopportunity to embrace that sort of oversight was presented, the \nFederal Reserve hid behind concerns about the independence of monetary \npolicy to maintain the secrecy of its operations.\n  Another example of the Federal Reserve resisting attempts to shine \nlight on their actions surrounds the ``back-door bailout'' of Goldman \nSachs and major foreign banks through the aid to AIG. The Federal \nReserve initially refused to disclose the identity of the banks to whom \nAIG paid out the vast majority of its Federal assistance. Federal \nReserve lawyers even opposed AIG disclosing details of its transactions \nin public filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nThe Federal Reserve argued that disclosing the identity of these \ncounterparties who engaged in exotic, risky transactions with AIG would \ndestabilize AIG, would harm the private business interests of the \ncounterparties, and could affect the stability of the markets as a \nwhole. However, following significant public and Congressional \npressure, the identities of the counterparties were released, and we \nlearned that French bank Society General and Goldman Sachs were among \nthe largest beneficiaries of the Federal bailout of AIG. None of the \nhorrible consequences the Federal Reserve used to oppose basic \ntransparency came to pass. The sky did not fall.\n  The Special Inspector General for TARP has launched an investigation \ninto whether there was misconduct at the Federal Reserve in regard to \nthe Fed's role in the failure of AIG to disclose billions of dollars in \ncounterparty payments to the SEC last year. And just this week, the \nSpecial Inspector General announced that it is investigating the \nFederal Reserve for withholding documents from the Special Inspector \nGeneral in connection with his audit in November 2009 of the AIG \ncounterparty payments. The Special Inspector General learned that they \ndid not receive all of the documents they requested from the Federal \nReserve when they saw the documents produced last week under subpoena \nto the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for the \nCommittee's January 27, 2010, hearing. This sort of stonewalling by the \nFederal Reserve is outrageous and cannot be tolerated.\n  So, I have had to ask myself, Is Ben Bernanke the man to lead us \nforward?\n  Chairman Bernanke didn't see the financial crisis coming. He never \nexpected our unemployment to reach 10 percent. He didn't foresee the \nsubprime housing market affecting the broader economy. He didn't expect \ncomplicated financial instruments like credit default swaps to pose a \nrisk to the economy, even though they were considered by some to be \n``financial weapons of mass destruction.'' In fact, Chairman Bernanke \ninsisted only well-informed and intelligent minds were using such \ninstruments and that government supervision wasn't necessary.\n  This lack of foresight makes me wonder if he is ready to lead our \neconomy down the path to a sustainable recovery.\n  I am afraid Ben Bernanke thinks everything is under control. He \nsteered our economy out of danger. But we still have a long road ahead \nof us. The Fed has to unwind its massive balance sheet. It has to \nremove the excess funds that were created to paper-over the financial \nsectors' unacknowledged losses without stoking the flames of inflation.\n  We need a Fed Chairman that is committed to a strong dollar and low \ninflation. We need a Fed Chairman that is committed to transparency.\n  I am afraid Ben Bernanke had a seat at the table during the \ndevelopment of our current economic and financial crisis. He has failed \nto learn its lessons. He has promoted a policy of easy money, inflating \nour way from a stock market bubble to a housing bubble. He neither \npredicted nor prepared for the inevitable results. Moreover, he seems \ndetermined to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support his nomination by President Obama \nto serve a second term as Chairman of the Fed.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to explain why I will vote \nagainst the confirmation of Ben Bernanke for a second term as Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve. Ben Bernanke is a brilliant and honorable man. \nHe deserves our Nation's thanks for his years of public service--\nespecially during the greatest financial crisis in decades. I agree \nwith Chairman Bernanke's supporters that some of his actions mitigated \nthat crisis--and that we might be in a much worse place today if not \nfor his leadership. Nevertheless, I believe the Federal Reserve needs a \nfresh start--with a new Chairman--for several important reasons.\n  First, Chairman Bernanke was a member of the Fed's Board of Governors \nwhere he strongly supported Chairman Greenspan's monetary policy that \nkept interest rates very low. In fact, the Federal funds target rate \nreached a low of 1 percent by mid-2003. Most economists agree that \nthese low interest rates were one of the factors--certainly not the \nonly factor--that contributed to the housing price bubble that expanded \nfor much of the previous decade. And when the housing bubble burst, our \nglobal financial crisis began. This isn't ancient history. Earlier this \nmonth, Chairman Bernanke delivered a remarkable speech to the American \nEconomic Association in Atlanta. In that speech he defended the Fed's \nactions before the crisis--and largely absolved himself of any \nresponsibility for it. Now I am willing to support a person who makes \ntough decisions--and learns from them when things don't go well. But \nunder Chairman Bernanke, the Federal Reserve missed the signals that \nthe economy was in trouble--such as the housing bubble, and unsettled \ncredit markets. The Fed missed the chance to take action sooner--action \nthat might have prevented the necessity of its massive intervention \nlater on. And today, Chairman Bernanke still does not recognize the \nmissed opportunities that occurred on his watch.\n  Second, Chairman Bernanke played a role in the passage of the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program--or TARP. It is important to remember \nwhat Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson were telling \nus before we all voted on TARP in October 2008. In public, their \ntestimony was alarming. On September 23, 2008, Secretary Paulson said \nthat Congress must act ``in order to avoid a continuing series\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\nof financial institution failures and frozen credit markets that \nthreaten . . . the very health of our economy.'' Chairman Bernanke was \none of those who told us--in effect--that we were perhaps days away \nfrom a complete meltdown of our financial system. So a lot of us did \nour patriotic duty. We trusted the experts and we authorized the TARP \nprogram. And almost immediately after we did so, the Treasury changed \nwhat they said they were going to do with the money. Only weeks after \nTARP was enacted, the Bush administration abandoned the goal of \npurchasing ``toxic assets.'' Instead, they funneled billions of \ntaxpayer dollars directly to many of the Nation's largest financial \ninstitutions. Soon the Federal Government was acquiring ownership \nstakes in banks, financial institutions and automakers--with the full \nsupport of the incoming Obama administration. In fact, the Obama \nadministration has gone even further, using its TARP leverage to set \nexecutive pay at several companies. And during the reorganization of \nGeneral Motors, the Obama administration used its leverage to benefit \nits union allies--over the rights of secured bondholders who had loaned \ntheir savings to the company. TARP may have also enabled public \ncorruption and criminal activity. According to the latest report from \nTARP's inspector general Neil Barofsky, there are 54 ongoing criminal \nand civil investigations into TARP related activities. These activities \ninclude: ``complex issues concerning suspected TARP fraud, accounting \nfraud, securities fraud, insider trading, bank fraud, mortgage fraud, \nmortgage servicer misconduct, fraudulent advance-fee schemes, public \ncorruption, false statements, obstruction of justice, money laundering, \nand tax-related investigations.'' President Obama and the Senate \nleadership have resisted our attempts to end the TARP program. Last \nweek, 45 Democrats voted down Senator Thune's amendment which needed a \n60-vote threshold to end the TARP program. And last night, President \nObama proposed using TARP to fund his new stimulus bill--in order to \nget around his own 3-year spending freeze. By the way, using TARP on \nnew spending would also break the promise that the President made when \nhe voted for TARP in this very Chamber. Then-Senator Obama said:\n\n       [I]f American taxpayers are financing this solution, then \n     they have to be treated like investors. They should get every \n     penny of their tax dollars back once the economy recovers.\n\n  Mr. President, TARP is a government credit card that should be \ncancelled. And Chairman Bernanke was one of the key enablers that led \nto its creation in the first place.\n  Third, I believe we need a Fed Chairman who demonstrates a greater \ncommitment to transparency. The Federal Reserve has been very resistant \nto giving the Government Accountability Office, GAO, independent audit \nauthority. In fact, the GAO told the Senate Finance Committee last year \nthat the Federal Reserve was resisting its investigation efforts in \nreviewing the response to the financial crisis by claiming that it \nwould impair the independent nature of monetary policy. I agree that \npolitics should not be involved in monetary policy. Yet since the \nbeginning of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has routinely \nexercised unprecedented, emergency powers that resulted in a $3.4 \ntrillion expansion of its balance sheet according to some estimates. \nThis is risk that will be borne by the American taxpayer and they \ndeserve to know what their government is doing. Another example of the \nFederal Reserve resisting transparency surrounds the assistance \nprovided to AIG. The Federal Reserve initially refused to disclose the \nidentity of the banks to whom AIG paid out the vast majority of its \nFederal assistance. They even opposed AIG disclosing details of its \ntransactions in public filings required by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. The Federal Reserve argued that disclosing the identity of \nthese counterparties who engaged in exotic, risky transactions with AIG \nwould destabilize AIG, would harm the counterparties, and could \ndestabilize the market as a whole. However, following significant \npublic and congressional pressure, the identities of the counterparties \nwere finally released and the market moved forward. The inspector \ngeneral for TARP is now investigating into whether there was misconduct \nat the Federal Reserve in regard to its role in the failure of AIG to \ndisclose billions of dollars in counterparty payments to the SEC last \nyear. And just yesterday at a hearing by the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform, the TARP inspector general announced \nthat additional documents and facts have come to light that have caused \nthem to initiate an investigation to review the extent of the Federal \nReserve's cooperation during the course of its audit of the AIG \ncounterparty payments. Clearly, the Fed needs more transparency, not \nless. That is why I am a cosponsor of the Federal Reserve Sunshine Act \nof 2009. This bill would require the GAO to conduct a comprehensive \naudit of the Federal Reserve System and its banks and report back to \nCongress by the end of 2010. But in addition to an audit, the Fed \nclearly needs a new Chairman--one more clearly committed to \ntransparency and accountability.\n  Supporters of Mr. Bernanke argue that to vote against him will \npoliticize the Federal Reserve. I could not disagree more. An up-or-\ndown vote is part of our responsibility as Senators to provide our \nadvice and consent. Some supporters also argue that we could wind up \nwith someone worse than Mr. Bernanke--and that any transition would \nunsettle financial markets. On this point, I would contend that the \ncurrent uncertainty job-creators face today is due to the policies \nbeing pushed by this administration; this is the main obstacle to \nbuilding confidence and growing jobs for Americans. But again, the \nSenate will have the opportunity to provide its advice and consent to \nany future nominee. And if Chairman Bernanke's term expires, Vice \nChairman Donald Kohn would immediately assume his duties. And Mr. \nBernanke would still remain on the Fed's Board of Governors. So the \nsupposed ``transaction costs'' of voting down this nomination are \noverstated, in my opinion. The simple truth is: No one person is \nindispensible in any public office. I believe the American people and \nour financial system will be better served by new leadership at the \nFed. And therefore I will vote against this nomination.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have decided to oppose the renomination \nof Chairman Ben Bernanke. I do so with reluctance because I admire his \nrecord of academic and professional achievements.\n  My sense of admiration and the fact that I like him has to be weighed \nin the broad context of his work as Chairman and what the American \npeople have a right to expect on results and accountability. The \nFederal Reserve is given great authority and commensurate \nresponsibility on regulation and oversight of our financial \ninstitutions. Accountability frequently is hard to pinpoint; but it can \nbe established in the upheaval of the financial institutions in the \npast months and years. The consequences of foreclosures ousting \nthousands from their homes, millions of job losses and billions of \nlosses in pension accounts weigh heavily on those responsible for \nregulation and oversight of U.S. financial institutions. These problems \nare traceable in large part to the national housing boom bubble.\n  The October 27, 2005, edition of the Washington Post reported \nChairman Bernanke's testimony that he was not concerned that the \nnational housing boom was a bubble that was about to burst. In \ntestimony before Congress's Joint Economic Committee, he testified that \nthe rise in U.S. house prices by nearly 25 percent over the past 2 \nyears largely reflected strong economic fundamentals such as growth in \njob incomes and the number of new houses. He did not agree with the \njudgment of many economists that house prices had risen too far too \nfast in many markets, forming a bubble that could rapidly collapse and \ntrigger an economic downturn.\n  The Washington Post December 21, 2009, edition reported the following \n:\n\n       In January 2005, National City's chief economist had \n     delivered a prescient warning to the Fed's board of \n     governors: An increasingly overvalued housing market posed a \n     threat to the broader economy, not to mention his own bank \n     and others deeply involved in writing mortgages. The message \n     wasn't well received. One board member expressed particular \n     skepticism--Ben Bernanke. ``Where do you think it will be the \n     worst?''\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\n     Bernanke asked, according to people who attended the meeting, \n     one in a series of sessions the Fed holds with economists. \n     ``I would have to say California,'' said the economist, \n     Richard Dekaser. ``They have been saying that about \n     California since I bought my first house in 1979,'' Bernanke \n     replied. This time the warnings were correct, and the \n     collapse of the California real estate market would bring \n     down the nation's fourth-largest bank, the largest casualty \n     of the financial crisis.\n\n  My opposition to Chairman Bernanke is also based on his role, along \nwith then-Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, in pressuring \nKenneth L. Lewis, CEO of Bank of America, to have the Bank of America \ncomplete its acquisition of Merrill Lynch despite the discovery of \nMerrill's losses without disclosing Merrill's financial problems to its \nshareholders prior to a proxy vote to approve the deal.\n  Chairman Bernanke has also not won the public's confidence with \nrespect to the Fed's commitment to job creation. No issue is more \nimportant in America today than job creation. The Fed Chairman must \nexplicitly target the full arsenal of the Fed at this pressing \npriority.\n  I have considered the concerns that Chairman Bernanke's rejection \nwould cause turmoil in the markets. While I regret opposing the \nPresident on this nomination, I believe that he will fill the position \nwith a capable replacement who will command wide respect. I also \nbelieve that his replacement and others with similar responsibility \nwill perform better with this insistence on success and accountability.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have given substantial deference to \nexecutive branch nominations made by Presidents of both parties. That \ndeference is greatest when the nomination is for a position closest to \nthe President, such as a position in the Cabinet, and at its lowest for \npositions with greater independence and distance from the President.\n  The position to which Benjamin Bernanke has been nominated, namely to \nserve another term as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, \nis among those for which appropriate deference is lower. The Federal \nReserve is famously independent.\n  A chief responsibility of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve is to \nensure a sound financial system. Under the watch of Ben Bernanke, the \nFederal Reserve permitted grossly irresponsible financial activities \nthat led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n  While Chairman Bernanke has certainly been instrumental in helping \nthe financial system recover from that crisis, we should not forget his \nrole in its creation. Under Chairman Bernanke's watch predatory \nmortgage lending flourished, and too big to fail financial giants were \npermitted to engage in activities that put our nation's economy at \nrisk. And as it responds to the crisis it helped to usher in, the \nFederal Reserve under Chairman Bernanke's leadership continues to \nresist appropriate efforts to review that response, how taxpayers' \nmoney was being used, and whether it acted appropriately.\n  For those reasons, I will vote against another term for Chairman \nBernanke.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will vote for President Obama's \nnomination of Benjamin Bernanke for a second term as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board.\n  Chairman Bernanke's nomination should be examined through the prism \nof how he performed during the recent financial crisis, and with full \nconsideration of the best interests of the American people and their \nstake in the Nation's economic recovery.\n  It is clear that prompt and decisive action by Federal officials like \nDr. Bernanke saved the country from another Great Depression. Since the \neconomic meltdown in the fall of 2008, the Federal government has \ncommitted its resources to quell the financial turmoil and stabilize \nthe economy. The Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Bernanke, played a \ncentral role in these efforts. They cut interest rates early and \naggressively, reducing the target for the Federal funds rate to nearly \nzero. They created targeted lending programs to restart the flow of \ncredit in critical markets. They worked with other agencies--like the \nTreasury Department, the FDIC, and overseas central banks--to ensure \nthat financial institutions worldwide had access to short-term funding.\n  I supported these efforts to respond to the financial crisis to \nprevent the country from sliding into an economic depression, which was \na very real possibility just a few months ago. Congress passed an \neconomic rescue bill that staved off a full market retreat, and it \nenacted an economic recovery plan that is beginning to turn things \naround. Through these efforts our economy has begun to show signs of \nprogress in recent months.\n  But much more is needed to jump-start our economy, and the Federal \nReserve needs to focus more on helping Main Street, not just Wall \nStreet. While I believe Chairman Bernanke acted wisely during the worst \nof the economic crisis, he now needs to concentrate his efforts on a \nbroader economic recovery by helping small businesses gain access to \naffordable capital to expand their markets and create more jobs. Small \nbusinesses are the backbone of Vermont's and the Nation's economy. \nDuring his second term, Chairman Bernanke must direct the Federal \nReserve to do more to support small business economic growth.\n  And with the Federal Reserve playing such a large role in the \nrecovery effort, the American people deserve greater transparency by \nknowing the full extent of the Fed's lending programs, which is why I \nhave cosponsored legislation introduced by Senator Sanders to provide \nfor a full audit of the funds released by the Federal Reserve.\n  The early stages of an economic recovery are fragile--all the more \nduring this recovery, as we inch back from a time, unprecedented in our \nlifetimes, when the United States and the world stood on the brink of \nfinancial collapse in the fall of 2008. Economic decisions and markets \nand ultimately our economy itself are unsettled by uncertainty, and the \nintended or unintended effects that a sudden turnover at the Federal \nReserve would have right now on the economic recovery should not and \nmust not be underestimated.\n  When considering who would best fill important positions like \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, the President and the Senate must \nensure that Federal agencies are led by qualified and competent \nofficials. Chairman Bernanke has helped to steer our financial and \neconomic system through the worst financial storm in nearly a century. \nWith much work remaining, I support his nomination for another term.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe reconfirmation of Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. Bernanke has been a steady hand at the Federal Reserve during the \nworst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Mr. Bernanke knows \nsomething about that: his scholarly work as an economics professor at \nPrinceton University focused on the Great Depression. At a time when \nour economy is climbing out of a deep recession, I believe Mr. \nBernanke's continued leadership will provide the stability that is \nessential to economic recovery.\n  Some blame Mr. Bernanke for the financial crisis and its severity. \nThey believe President Obama must set an example and break with the \npast by replacing him.\n  I do not agree.\n  It would be a big mistake, in my view, to jettison a man whose \nexpertise and experience have been crucial to rescuing our economy, and \nI believe President Obama made the right decision to keep Mr. Bernanke \nat the Fed.\n  In my opinion, he should be reconfirmed without delay, because his \nterm expires in 3 days. Failure to do so would send the wrong message \nto both the American people and global financial markets, at a time of \ncontinued economic uncertainty. It could roll back some significant \nprogress in restoring market confidence. For instance, under Chairman \nBernanke's leadership, the Dow Industrial Average rebounded \nsignificantly from a 12-year low of 6,547 on March 9, 2009 and reached \na high on January 19th when it closed at 10,725. This represents a gain \nof 4,178 points or nearly 64 percent over the course of 10 months. The \nS 500 has risen about 70 percent since the low in March and also \nreached its recent high on January 19, closing at 1,150.23. Retirement \naccounts were valued at $8.6 trillion in the third quarter of 2007. But \nfollowing the market's bottoming out in March of 2009, retirement \naccounts had lost $2.8 trillion--33 percent--of their peak value, \naccording to\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nRetirement Savings statistics from the Urban Institute in a January \n2010 report. Since then, retirement account balances have rebounded \nsharply. Accounts have gained roughly $1.3 trillion--23 percent--ending \nthe third quarter at around $7.1 trillion. Although assets remain 17 \npercent below their peak, they are still above their 2005 value and \nnear their 2006 value.\n  So we have clearly made some progress and there are positive signs, \nbut we still have a long way to go. Simply put, the gains on Wall \nStreet have not been felt by Main Street: The national unemployment \nrate is 10 percent, with 15 million Americans out of work; Small \nbusinesses are struggling, and many are going under. In my State, small \nbusiness bankruptcies increased by 81 percent last year alone, and \ncommercial corridors once teeming with business are now plagued by \nvacancies; consumer demand remains low as American workers struggle in \nthese tough times; and, retirement accounts are still down roughly $1.5 \ntrillion from their peak.\n  These are terrible statistics, and there is much more work to be done \nto increase our national prosperity.\n  But last week, uncertainty caused by news that Mr. Bernanke's \nreconfirmation was threatened in the Senate caused the Dow Jones to \nfall by 552 points, with a 216-point drop on Friday alone.\n  The point is clear: the situation is very volatile. President Obama \nhas clearly indicated that he believes Mr. Bernanke is the man for the \njob, and I also believe this is the case.\n  Let me tell you why.\n  First, Mr. Bernanke is an expert on the Great Depression, a scholar \nwho understands the causes of, and remedies for, dramatic economic \ndownturns like the one we experienced last year. There is no one better \nqualified to be at the helm of the Fed at this time, and he is \ndedicated to fulfilling its mission to restore prosperity, create jobs \nand keep prices stable.\n  Second, Mr. Bernanke played a key role in averting a much greater \nfinancial crisis.\n  He took critical steps to stop the economic freefall and restore \nstability. He aggressively cut interest rates early on, reducing the \ntarget Federal funds rate to nearly zero. It has remained at this level \nsince December 2008.\n  Under his leadership, the Fed played a central role in quelling last \nyear's financial turmoil. It launched joint efforts with other agencies \nand foreign authorities to avert a collapse of the global banking \nsystem. It ensured financial institutions adequate access to short-term \nfunding when private funding resources dried up.\n  It led the ``stress tests'' on large U.S. banks to ensure that these \ninstitutions had adequate capital and consumers would be confident that \ntheir bank deposits were safe.\n  The Fed, under Mr. Bernanke's leadership, also created targeted \nlending programs that helped ease the flow of credit to many \nbusinesses.\n  For example, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility has \nfinanced more than 3.4 million home loans, more than 100 million credit \ncard accounts, 480,000 loans to small businesses and 100,000 loans to \nlarge businesses.\n  We are starting to see the positive results of these bold moves.\n  There are undoubtedly legitimate critiques of Mr. Bernanke. I agree \nthat more transparency is needed at the Federal Reserve. And, I would \nhave liked to see more action taken to curb the abusive lending \npractices which have led to literally millions of foreclosures in my \nhome State of California.\n  Many gaps in regulation and oversight of our financial system still \nremain.\n  The administration just proposed the Volcker rules which I believe \nwould succeed in ending the rampant speculation and excessive size of \n``too big to fail'' institutions that led us to where we are today.\n  Congress must act swiftly to regulate the financial sector more \nprudently, and expand authority for the Fed, the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  We must intelligently close these gaps in regulation, not risk an \neconomic backslide by taking out our collective frustrations on Mr. \nBernanke.\n  Everyone is flawed, and there is more than enough blame to go around. \nBut we must also give credit where it is due, and Mr. Bernanke \nsuccessfully helped to pull this nation back from the brink.\n  His academic expertise on the Great Depression, coupled with his \nexperience in facing down the greatest economic turbulence since the \n1930s, makes him an unparalleled choice for leadership at the Fed right \nnow.\n  USA Today, in an editorial published yesterday, gave a forceful \ndefense of Mr. Bernanke's reconfirmation. I want to quote from it here, \nbecause I think it gives a very clear assessment of the situation:\n\n       The question facing the nation is, who do you want in \n     charge of this delicate task? Someone who has intimate \n     knowledge of what needs to be done, has learned from past \n     mistakes and has the confidence of the financial markets? Or \n     someone new who, in order to win congressional confirmation, \n     will be hamstrung by promises not to take difficult-but-\n     necessary steps, such as bumping up interest rates to keep \n     inflation in check?\n       Bernanke deserves considerable credit for helping stave off \n     economic collapse. For that reason, he also deserves another \n     term as chairman.\n\n  Mr. President, I couldn't agree more.\n  Mr. Bernanke deserves a chance to finish the enormous and historic \ntask at hand. He has done well thus far, and I intend to support him \nfor a second term as Chairman of the Fed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, people are angry and they are anxious. \nThey are worried their middle class way of life is slipping by. They \nare worried about their jobs. They are worried about their pensions. \nThey are worried about the cost of everything from health care to \nhousing to higher education. They have to make tough decisions. They \nare sitting at their kitchen tables balancing their checkbooks and \nbeing careful about spending. They want to know we are being careful \ntoo. They want an administration and a Congress that do two things: \ncreate jobs and spend money frugally and wisely.\n  I am angry too. I was told that TARP was needed to get money to Main \nStreet. I didn't care if every firm on Wall Street went bankrupt. But I \ndid care about jobs, small businesses, and families' mortgages. That's \nwhat I was told TARP was about. Instead--ungrateful bankers got an \nastonishing amount of money from taxpayers who used it to pay \nthemselves bonuses.\n  Chairman Bernanke made four big mistakes: he let banks take on too \nmany risks, he ignored the housing bubble, he failed to protect \nhomeowners, and he gave too much taxpayer money away for too little in \nreturn. It is not just Mr. Bernanke though. The entire economic policy \nteam for the last two administrations deserves blame\n  So I had questions about this nomination. I spoke with Maryland \nbusiness leaders, looked into Mr. Bernanke's record, and I met with him \nat the end of last year.\n  I let Mr. Bernanke know that I am focused on three things to get our \neconomy going again: creating jobs, getting more lending to the middle \neconomy and small businesses, and helping people get out from under the \nthreat of foreclosure.\n  I know that people's top priority is jobs. Mr. Bernanke needs to \nrealize that too. When Bernanke thought Wall Street was on the verge of \na crisis, he acted dramatically. He used new powers for new programs. \nWell, the job market is in a crisis now. But the Fed's response has \njust been tame and tepid. We need the same urgency from Mr. Bernanke to \njump-start the job market as he gave to Wall Street to jump-start the \nfinancial markets.\n  The Fed has pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system. \nCongress has approved billions more. Money went to the banks and \nbecause we thought they'd lend it out to help small businesses and help \ncommunity banks, and community pillars. But what I have heard since \nthen is that companies' credit is being withdrawn and responsible \napplicants are being rejected for reasonable loans. We need to try \nsomething different to make sure money goes where we want it to--and \ndoesn't get used by banks to pay bonuses.\n  I am also angry that economic policy-makers went all out to help Wall \nStreet and only halfway to help homeowners. In his second term Mr. \nBernanke needs to do much more to\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\nhelp them, and help communities ravaged by too many foreclosures.\n  Mr. Bernanke needs to realize that ``Crisis Averted'' doesn't mean \n``Mission Accomplished.'' There have been too many missed signals--\nmisplaced priorities. But I am voting to confirm Mr. Bernanke because \nhe is not a man of ideology and when we needed him most his expertise \nand level head probably helped stop a catastrophe. He didn't panic, and \nlearned from history, which he has studied closer than anyone else. No \none understands the risks the economy faces better than he does. That \ndoes not mean we shouldn't rock the boat. We need bold new approaches--\nand I'll fight for them.\n  I was advised that rejecting his nomination would cause markets to \nnose-dive--which would hurt retirees and families saving for their \nfuture. I am not enthusiastic in my support. But I think Mr. Bernanke \nunderstands the job that he still has to do. And that in his second \nterm he will focus better on jobs, getting lending going to the middle \neconomy, and mortgages. So I will vote to confirm him for a second \nterm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe there are some Members who are \ncoming. Absent someone walking in the door, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be equally allocated to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded \n5 minutes of time off the Democrats' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I will not \nsupport the nomination of Ben Bernanke for another term as Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve. But I also want to make it clear that I do not \nsupport a filibuster, because I believe he deserves to have a vote on \nhis nomination.\n  I have not met anyone who doubts that Chairman Bernanke is very \nbright, he is very dedicated, he is very conscientious, he is an expert \non the depression era. I am grateful for the work he did in those \ncritical weeks when the American system teetered on the verge of \ncollapse; that is, our economic system.\n  But I do think this is a moment to take stock, in many ways as \nPresident Obama did in his State of the Union Address: How did we get \nto this very difficult economic place? I think as we look at that, \npeople have to be held accountable for their actions along the way. \nThat means Chairman Bernanke must be held accountable for his record.\n  I asked my staff, could you get me the Charter of the Federal \nReserve, because I know it has many objectives that it needs to \nfulfill. Here are the four main objectives to the Federal Reserve:\n  One, conducting the Nation's monetary policy in pursuit of maximum \nemployment and stable prices.\n  Two, regulating the banking system to ensure the safety of the \nNation's financial system, and protecting the credit rights of \nconsumers.\n  Three, maintaining the stability of the financial system and \ncontaining systemic risk that might arise in the financial markets.\n  Those are three out of the four responsibilities we have to take a \ncloser look at. I look at those three responsibilities, and, frankly, I \ndon't see how the Fed met those responsibilities--remember, maximum \nemployment, safety of the Nation's financial system, protecting the \ncredit rights of consumers, maintaining the stability of the financial \nsystem, and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial \nmarkets.\n  Put on top of that the fact that in the 1990s, Congress gave the Fed \nthe very important responsibility of overseeing the housing market to \nstop predatory lending. That was an added specific responsibility. I \nhave to say that I think Chairman Bernanke vastly underestimated the \ndangers of the housing bubble and unconstrained subprime lending.\n  This is what he said in May of 2007:\n\n       We believe the effect of the troubles in the subprime \n     sector on the broader housing market will likely be limited, \n     and we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime \n     market to the rest of the economy . . . The vast majority of \n     mortgages, including subprime mortgages, continue to perform \n     well.\n\n  That was Mr. Bernanke in May 2007. That is hard for me to look at and \nsay that we should vote to confirm him. He failed to spot the dangerous \nbanking practices, in addition to the mortgage practices that led to \nthe crisis.\n  In February 2008, 7 months before the greatest financial collapse in \n80 years, he said:\n\n       Among the largest banks, the capital ratios remain good, \n     and I do not anticipate serious problems . . . among the \n     large internationally active banks.\n\n  So until the crisis occurred, Chairman Bernanke was a major advocate \nfor even more permissive banking regulation.\n  Now we see unemployment at 10 percent nationally and in my State a \nhorrific 12-plus percent.\n  The American people have the right to ask whether the Fed is truly \ncommitted to supporting Main Street's economy, not just Wall Street. \nThat is why I cannot support his reappointment. He sat by when \nPresident Bush put all the policies into place that led us to this \ncrisis. He was George Bush's choice. He sat there and said everything \nwas fine, everything was wonderful, everything was good, housing was \nOK.\n  If Mr. Bernanke is confirmed--and I expect he will be--I hope he will \nlisten to what a lot of us are saying and turn his full attention to \nMain Street, to the people who need his support. People out there need \nthe wind at their backs. They need somebody who understands what they \nare facing in terms of their housing problems, their unemployment \nproblems. Let's get this economy back on track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it is not often that I agree with the \nSenator from California, but I certainly appreciate her perspective on \nthis issue. A number of us from a broad spectrum in both parties are \nconcerned about this nomination.\n  I rise to oppose the nomination of Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve \nchairman. It is important that we look at this not just as a single \nnomination but as part of a much bigger picture we need to recognize. \nThe confirmation of Ben Bernanke is a confirmation of policies that \nbrought our economy down. If we ignore that, we are going to continue \nthese same policies and condemn ourselves, our country, and our fellow \nAmericans to high unemployment and much less prosperity in the future.\n  It is never fair to blame any one person for major problems such as \nwe have in this country. But it is important, when we have this kind of \nproblem, where millions of Americans have lost in total trillions of \ndollars and jobs have been lost and families have suffered greatly, \nthat we recognize the difference between the problems we are looking at \ntoday and the real causes of those problems, what we call in business \n``the root cause'' of problems. We learn, when we do strategic \nplanning--and I did this for years for companies--that if you go in and \nlook at the problems and try to solve them and never go back and \nunderstand the root causes, all you are doing is fixing symptoms which \nnever get fixed because you did not understand the cause of the \nproblems.\n  Today, we do have a difficult economic situation with high \nunemployment. We have debt at levels that everyone agrees is \nunsustainable. Countries all over the world are beginning to question \nwhether we can repay our debts. Some are beginning to question whether \nthey should lend us more money to fund our reckless spending.\n  Despite what we heard last night about a freeze on spending, everyone \nlaughed when we said that starts next year. Today, we voted to raise \nthe debt limit another $1.9 trillion. We are going to take that debt to \nover $14 trillion. There is no foreseeable way we can pay that back. \nThis is at a time when a large group of Americans called the baby \nboomers are going to retire and\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\nthe cost of Social Security and Medicare is going to skyrocket. These \nare promises we have to keep to seniors because they paid for it, but \nwe have no idea how we will keep those promises right now, particularly \nin light of the current economic situation.\n  As we look at where we are, we need to recognize how we got here. As \nI have talked to banks, businesses, foreign financial ministers from \nEurope who have come here, everyone agrees there are two major causes \nof the economic problems here and around the world. One is the high \nleverage or the high borrowing that went on because of the loose \nmonetary policy at the Federal Reserve. Easy money, cheap money \nencouraged companies and individuals to borrow more than they could \nafford to pay back because it was easy to get and cheap. The big banks \non Wall Street could more easily borrow money than raise capital. Those \nwere incentives created by the policies at the Federal Reserve.\n  The second problem is what we are calling toxic assets, which are \nsecuritized subprime mortgages, were facilitated by Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises that reflected the \npolitical policy of this Congress. It is our responsibility to oversee \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac and to make sure they are doing what is \nappropriate for our economy. But what happened is the criteria for \nlending went away. Local mortgage companies could make almost any loan \nthey wanted to, to anyone whether they could afford to pay it back, \nusing easy money from the Federal Reserve and low criteria for \nforgiving those loans. They sold them all to Fannie Mae. If Fannie Mae \nhad not been there to buy these loans, these irresponsible loans would \nnot have been made in the first place. But to make matters worse, \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac bundled these subprime mortgages up into \npackages we call securities and sold them, sold them to banks as \nassets, sold them all over the world. These are the toxic assets that \nbrought down the financial institutions once the housing bubble burst.\n  For the President, for Ben Bernanke, for Secretary Geithner to come \nin and indict the free market system and the greed of corporations and \nbanks misses the whole point of what caused this problem. Certainly, \nthese two causes created perverse incentives for the markets, the banks \nto practice irresponsible behavior. There is no question that went on. \nBut to say that was the cause of where we are today misses the point.\n\n  My problem with Ben Bernanke, the President, and Secretary Geithner \nis not that they made mistakes, because Congress certainly made \nmistakes in not overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and asking the \nright questions of the Federal Reserve, but the fact that despite the \nevidence being so clear of what really caused the problem, Mr. Bernanke \nstill does not recognize those as the causes. In fact, he continues the \nsame easy-money policy. He expresses no sense of urgency that we need \nto get the Federal Government out of owning AIG, Fannie Mae, General \nMotors, or Chrysler. When we bring him in for hearings, he seems to be \nmore of a command-and-control person than someone who believes in a \nfree market system that we need to have good laws and regulations to \nguide. But he and Secretary Geithner and the President indicate that \nthey can run this economy, that they can micromanage it.\n  To confirm Ben Bernanke is to confirm the continuation of easy-money \npolicies, high leverage, as well as the continuation of what Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac did to create these toxic assets. We are not asking the \nright questions. I contend that we cannot solve today's problems with \nthe same people who created them.\n  President Obama last night liked to blame George Bush for the \nproblems. Yet he is nominating his people. Secretary Geithner was \ninvolved with the Federal Reserve and was the architect of these \nbailouts. Ben Bernanke has been here for 4 years and was a key part of \nthe bailout, the easy-money policy, and has yet to say that was a \nproblem.\n  This is more than just another nomination. Everything we work for in \na material sense rests on the value of our dollar and the monetary \nsystem. The American economy, the worldwide economy rests on what the \nFederal Reserve does. This is the Federal Reserve that told us subprime \nmortgages would not cause an economic breakdown. Ben Bernanke told us \nFannie Mae was well capitalized a few months before its collapse. We \nhave to depend on the leadership at the Federal Reserve to tell us the \ntruth. If our monetary system crashes because of bad policy, everything \nAmerica has worked for, all our material wealth will be gone. This \ncountry will see a crisis the likes of which it has never seen.\n  This body is not taking this nomination seriously enough. We are \nmoving ahead quickly, when what we need to do is have a full audit of \nthe Federal Reserve, to look at what has been going on, look at their \ninvolvement with the current crisis, and to make sure they are on the \nright path.\n  The Constitution gives the Congress the responsibility to protect our \nmonetary system. Years ago, we delegated that to the Federal Reserve, \nbut that does not relieve us of our responsibility. To confirm Ben \nBernanke without even knowing what is going on at the Fed, without \nhearing them say what really caused the problem we have today, is to \ncondemn us to the same path that brought us to where we are.\n  Voting to confirm Ben Bernanke is a bad decision today. I ask all \ncolleagues to reconsider. This is probably the biggest mistake we will \nmake in a long time, to continue the same policy we started at the \nFederal Reserve, our monetary system, as well as what we have done here \nin Congress.\n  I again encourage my colleagues to reconsider their commitment to \nconfirm Ben Bernanke.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague from Vermont. \nHe has been very strong on this issue, and I want to give him as much \ntime as I can.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this is, in fact, an enormously important \nissue. The reality is that all over our country, hard-working, decent \npeople have lost their jobs. They have lost homes, their savings. They \nhave lost their ability to go to college. We are experiencing the \nhighest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. All of this \ndid not happen by accident. It happened because of the greed, the \nrecklessness, and the illegal behavior of Wall Street, of CEOs there \nwho converted our financial institutions into the largest gambling \ncasino in the history of the world.\n  One of the major functions of the Fed is to protect the safety and \nsoundness of our financial institutions. There can be no debate, Mr. \nBernanke, as Chairman of the Fed, failed at that important job, and \nthis country and the world almost saw a major financial collapse, and \nwe have seen in this country a horrendous recession.\n  I think average American citizens have a hard time understanding how \nwe reward failure, how we say to somebody who was asleep at the switch \nin terms of regulating our financial institutions: Congratulations. You \nfailed. There is a major recession. You are getting reappointed. I do \nnot think people understand why and how that should happen.\n  Second of all, when we talk about the bailout, it is not just the \n$700 billion that went to TARP. There were trillions of dollars in \nzero-interest loans, or almost zero-interest loans, that went to major \nfinancial institutions. It is incomprehensible to me the Chairman of \nthe Fed can lend out trillions of dollars, and when I asked him: Who \ngot the money? He said: Sorry, the American people don't have a right \nto know that--in so many words. I am not telling you.\n  How can you have confidence in the leadership of the Fed when there \nis virtually no transparency--trillions of dollars being lent out, and \nwe do not know who received it? That is not acceptable to me. We need a \nFed Chairman who believes in transparency, who is going to tell the \nAmerican people who has received those loans.\n  We are also today, importantly, not just talking about the past. We \nare talking about the future. We are talking about how we pull this \ncountry out of a recession in which 17 percent of our people are \nunemployed or underemployed. The fact is, the Fed today\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nhas the capability, the power to take significant action to protect the \nmiddle class and working families of this country. I say to the \nPresiding Officer, I do not know about Illinois, but I will tell you, \nin Vermont I get calls every week.\n  People are saying: Why did you help bail out these large banks, and \nnow they are charging me 25, 30 percent interest rates on my credit \ncard?\n  Mr. Bernanke and the Fed have the power today to lower interest rates \non credit cards. I want a Fed Chairman who is going to do that. Last \nnight we heard from President Obama, who appropriately pointed out very \nserious problems that small businesses all over this country are having \nin terms of getting the low-interest loans they need in order to create \nthe kind of jobs our economy desperately requires. The Chairman of the \nFed today has the power to provide low-interest loans to small- and \nmedium-sized businesses.\n  It is not just large financial institutions that can receive zero-\ninterest or low-interest loans. I know it is a great shock to the Fed, \nbut small- and medium-sized businesses--in a productive economy that \ncreates real jobs--can also receive those loans. I want a Fed Chairman \nwho will provide those loans.\n  It is hard to believe the largest financial institutions in this \ncountry that we bailed out because they were too big to fail--do you \nknow what. Three out of four of them are even bigger today. It is time \nto break up those financial institutions that are too big to fail. If \nthey are too big to fail, they are too big to exist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we need a new direction on Wall Street. \nWe need a new Fed Chairman.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I, too, would like to share my concerns \nin opposition to Mr. Bernanke's reappointment, and I think my \ncolleague, Senator DeMint, summed it up pretty well.\n  One of the debates has been, did the Central Bank, which is not a \nfree market activity, fail--or did as people say the market fail. I \nagree with him. I do not believe it is exactly correct to say that. The \nFed dabbles in the market in an attempt to manipulate the market. One \nof the debates has been that Mr. Bernanke allowed the interest rates in \n2002 through 2005 to remain too low, which caused the bubble and which \ncaused the burst and put us in this fix.\n  The complaint has been that he violated the Taylor rule, which is the \nrule that would advise how interest rates should be set by the Central \nBank. He made a speech in early January of this year that I think was \ndefensive and went to some length to say he did not violate the Taylor \nrule and that low-interest rates did not cause the bubble. So it is one \nthing to make a mistake; it is another thing to make a mistake and \nrefuse to acknowledge the mistake.\n  I will just say as background, the Wall Street Journal said the \nminutes of the Fed Board meetings prior to his becoming Chairman, when \nhe was merely a member of the Board, indicate he was the advocate for \nlower interest rates and actually warned of deflation during this \nperiod which was wrong.\n  Mr. Taylor responded in the Wall Street Journal. I will just quote \nwhat he said:\n\n       This rule--[the Taylor Rule] calls for central banks to \n     increase interest rates by a certain amount when price \n     inflation rises and to decrease interest rates by a certain \n     amount when the economy goes into a recession. My critique, \n     which I presented at the annual Jackson Hole conference for \n     central bankers in the summer of 2007 is based on the simple \n     observation that the Fed's target for the federal-funds \n     interest rate was well below what the Taylor rule would call \n     for in 2002-2005.\n\n  Mr. Taylor is the author of it. He warned of it in the summer of \n2007. Mr. Bernanke is insisting, just a few weeks before this, that he \ndid not violate the rule. A little later, Mr. Taylor goes on to say:\n\n       In his speech [on January 3], Mr. Bernanke's main response \n     to this critique was to propose alternatives to the standard \n     Taylor rule--and then to use the alternatives to \n     rationalize--\n\n  I would say to justify--\n\n       the Fed's policy in 2002-2005.\n\n  Mr. Taylor goes on to say:\n\n       In one alternative, which addresses what he describes as \n     his ``most significant concern regarding the use of the \n     standard Taylor rule,'' he puts the Fed's forecasts of future \n     inflation into the Taylor rule rather than actual measured \n     inflation. Because the Fed's inflation forecasts were lower \n     than current inflation during this period, this alternative \n     obviously gives a lower target interest rate and seems to \n     justify the Fed's decisions at the time.\n\n  So Mr. Bernanke is saying they took his rule and they altered it. \nThey did not use as the factor actual interest rates but what they \npredicted interest rates to be, and, of course, their prediction was \nwrong.\n  Mr. Taylor goes on to say:\n\n       There are other questionable points. Mr. Bernanke's speech \n     raises doubts about the Taylor rule by showing that another \n     version of the rule would have called for very high interest \n     rates in the first few months of 2008 [after the bubble \n     burst]. But using the standard Taylor rule, with the GDP \n     price index as the measure of inflation, interest rates would \n     not be so high--\n\n  As Mr. Bernanke was suggesting--\n\n       as I testified at the House Financial Services Committee in \n     February 2008.\n\n  That is Mr. Taylor's view.\n  Mr. Taylor goes on to say:\n\n       Mr. Bernanke also said that international evidence does not \n     show a statistically significant relationship between policy \n     deviations from the Taylor rule and housing booms.\n\n  Mr. Bernanke is defending himself still. He said international \nstudies do not show that our deviation from the Taylor rule had \nanything to do with this mess. But Mr. Taylor responds this way:\n\n       But his speech does not mention that research at the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in \n     March 2008 did find a statistically significant relationship.\n\n  Mr. Taylor goes on to say:\n\n       Mr. Bernanke claimed that ``Economists who have \n     investigated the issue have generally found that, based on \n     historical relationships, only a small portion of the \n     increase in house prices earlier this decade can be \n     attributed to the stance of . . . monetary policy.''\n\n  He is talking about the Fed policy, that they did not have anything \nto do with the increase in housing prices. Mr. Taylor calls Mr. \nBernanke's hand. Mr. Bernanke was not right in that statement. Mr. \nTaylor says this:\n\n       But two of the economists he cites--Frank Smets, director \n     of research at the European Central Bank, and his colleague \n     Marek Jarocinski reported in the July/August issue of the St. \n     Louis Fed Review--\n\n  That is the Federal Reserve publication in St. Louis--\n  They found--\n\n     evidence that monetary policy has significant effects on \n     housing investment and house prices and that easy monetary \n     policy designed to stave off perceived risks of deflation in \n     2002-2004 has contributed to the boom in the housing market \n     in 2004 and 2005.\n\n  Mr. Bernanke is saying economists around the world do not agree, and \nthat is not accurate. As a matter of fact, they found just the \nopposite. So remember, the Wall Street Journal said he was the easy \nmoney advocate at the Fed. Mr. Greenspan may have been Chairman, but \nduring the early part of the decade, Mr. Bernanke was advocating these \nlow interest rate policies; and they were wrong, and they did lead to a \nboom--at least it was a significant factor in the boom, and Mr. \nBernanke is not acknowledging that. I do not appreciate it.\n  I also am very disappointed he supported President Obama's form of a \nstimulus package, saying:\n\n       The incoming administration and the Congress are currently \n     discussing a substantial fiscal package that, if enacted, \n     could provide a significant boost to economic activity.\n\n  However, according to a CNN poll released just yesterday, 74 percent \nof Americans believe at least half of the stimulus package was wasted, \nand 63 percent believe the projects in the plan were included for \npurely political reasons and will have no economic benefit.\n  I will just say that this stimulus package--$800 billion, every penny \nof it going to our deficit and increasing our debt--could only be \njustified if it was the most carefully crafted package that created \njobs, but it was not. I knew it at the time, and so did many others, \nthat this was not a jobs-creating package. It was a political package \nput together by the President. It rewarded a lot of his supporters, but \nit was not the kind of jobs package we desperately needed. But Mr. \nBernanke supported it, and now we have $800 billion added to our debt \nand very little job creation.\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I will yield the floor and just conclude by saying \nthat I do not think this should be rewarded. I know a lot of people are \nworried that somebody else might be worse. But I have not seen from him \nthe kind of gravitas, the kind of stability of leadership, the kind of \nconsistent message to the American people about the severe plight we \nare in and about his plan to get us out of it.\n  Isn't that what he should be doing? Shouldn't we know what he, \nhopefully working with the President, would do to get us out of this \nmess? I have not seen it and, therefore, I do not believe we have any \nburden of maintaining him. In fact, I think this supports the argument \nthat he should not be maintained.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I think this is a healthy discussion we are having. We do not usually \ndiscuss much the Fed Chairman or the appointment or the nomination of a \nFed Chairman. Yet monetary policy affects all of us in a huge way and \ndramatically affects the world. This is, to me, the sort of debate we \nought to be having, and I am glad we have some differences of opinion.\n  For a long period of time it seemed as if everybody just treated \nmonetary policy as something that is in the theoretical world of \neconomists and mathematicians and central bankers, and they are the \nonly ones who understand the language; they are the only ones affected \nby it; therefore, they are the only ones who ought to discuss it. I am \nnot at all suggesting that Congress or the legislative branch ought to \nbe setting monetary policy; we shouldn't. But we ought to be discussing \nthe people and the principles that are involved and the people we \nappoint to these government positions and this government position, \nwhich is so critical and so important to all of us in this country and \naround the world.\n\n  So I am delighted we are having a discussion about the Fed Chairman, \nthe appointment of the Fed Chairman in this particular case. I think \nBen Bernanke is a bright gentleman. I have met with him. I have been \nthe ranking member on the Joint Economic Committee. I have had him in \nto testify. I find him quite interesting, bright, and a gentleman. \nHowever, I believe now it is time for us to break this sort of \nWashington-New York corridor that establishes monetary policy and bring \nsomebody in from outside that system to start at the Fed and in the Fed \nchairmanship and start looking more toward what Main Street needs in a \nmonetary policy rather than what Wall Street needs in a monetary \npolicy. I am not opposed to Wall Street, but they have dominated this \nposition, people from this Washington-New York corridor, for too long a \nperiod of time. It too dramatically affects all the rest of us, to \nsimply shut out the rest of the philosophy and thought from across the \ncountry. We need to get to Main Street.\n  I also have another concern that is taking place beyond the issue of \nus breaking out of this New York-Washington corridor for the Fed \nChairman and monetary policy. The second concern I have is I think we \nare headed for a huge government bubble. We have seen the dot-com \nbubble come, burst, and go. We have just gone through--and we are still \ngoing through--a housing bubble bigger than the dot-com bubble get big \nand blow up. Lots of fiscal and monetary policy to blame in both \nsituations. I think we can look back on the housing one and see both \nactions here or lack of actions toward Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to \npump up this housing bubble. I think we can see the monetary policy \npumping up this housing bubble that burst with huge impact; a number of \npeople say a near depression type of impact. Now we are heading \npossibly toward the biggest bubble of all, a huge government bubble, \nblown up by the Fed; huge amounts of money being put out in the system \nnow to try to prop up, to try to carry us on through this situation. If \nnot handled correctly, it could burst in a more profound and difficult \nway than the housing bubble. To me, it is just one of those \ndifficulties that is staring us right in the face. Now is the chance \nfor us to talk about a different direction, and I think we should do \nthat.\n  Yesterday, they had a vote of the FOMC, the money supply committee, \nand there was one dissenting vote. That dissenting vote was from Tom \nHoenig, who is the chairman of the Kansas City Fed. He believes--and he \nis hawkish on the money supply--that we have to start pulling the money \nsupply back and out of the system before the inflationary bubble takes \noff. When you put this much money into the system, you are bound to get \nan inflationary bubble and you have to start pulling it back before you \nstart feeling it. This is the time we have to start addressing those \nissues.\n  I think we ought to look at somebody such as a Tom Hoenig, hawkish on \nthe monetary supply, to get us into a stable, long-term position and \nget us ahead of a government bubble bursting on us; also, somebody from \noutside the system, somebody who is more focused on Main Street than \nWall Street, on monetary policy and monetary supply. Now is the time to \ndo it. This is a good chance to debate this. I don't suppose that is \ngoing to happen here. We are probably going to go ahead with Mr. \nBernanke, who is a fine man, but now is the time to break out of this \nbefore this bubble gets bigger, bursts on us, and causes more of a \nproblem than what we have even seen with the prior two bubbles. Let's \nget outside of that, and let's deal with that before it is on us.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I know we are getting close to the end of \nthe debate, and we will soon be voting on cloture. I wish to take a few \nmoments to read a few excerpts from editorials that ran in, of all \npublications, the Wall Street Journal, dealing with Chairman Bernanke, \nhis tenure in office, his misdeeds, and so forth. I also ask unanimous \nconsent at this time that the full text of the editorials, dated \nJanuary 25, 2010, December 3, 2009, and June 23, 2009, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal--June 23, 2009]\n\n                        Bernanke at the Creation\n\n       What the Fed Chairman said at the onset of the credit \n     bubble, and the lesson for today.\n       The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets today, \n     amid a debate over how and when to remove the flood of \n     liquidity it has poured into the economy in the last 18 \n     months. Fed officials say not to worry, they're as vigilant \n     about inflation as ever--which is itself a reason to worry. \n     We've all seen this movie before, when the Fed's failure to \n     act in time gave birth to the housing bubble and credit mania \n     that eventually led to panic and today's recession. Will it \n     make the same mistake now?\n       We remember that 2003 debate because it turns out we played \n     a part in it. The Fed recently released the transcripts of \n     its 2003 FOMC meetings, and what a surprise to find a Journal \n     editorial the subject of an insider rebuttal from none other \n     than Ben Bernanke, then a Fed Governor and now Chairman. We \n     had run an editorial on monetary policy on the same day as \n     the Dec. 9, 2003 FOMC meeting, and Mr. Bernanke clearly \n     didn't take well to our warning about ``Speed Demons at the \n     Fed.''\n       We reprint nearby both Mr. Bernanke's comments and our \n     editorial from that day. Readers can judge who got the better \n     of the argument, but far more important is what Mr. \n     Bernanke's reasoning tells us about the Fed today. Our guess \n     is that it won't reassure holders of dollar assets.\n       * * *\n       Recall that by the end of 2003 the economy was well into \n     recovery. Third quarter GDP growth had clocked in at 8.2% \n     (later restated to 7.5%), and growth in all of 2004 would be \n     3.6%. The Bush tax cuts had passed in late May, providing a \n     fiscal boost, and a month later the Fed had cut its fed funds \n     rate to 1% and would hold it there for a year. Yet by \n     December Mr. Bernanke was still giving speeches fretting \n     about ``deflation,'' even as commodity prices were rising and \n     growth was kicking into higher gear. Thus our Dec. 9 warning, \n     the first of many by us and others. \n       Mr. Bernanke's FOMC remarks that day are especially \n     revealing about how he thinks about monetary policy. In \n     particular, he dismisses any link between commodity price \n     increases and future inflation. He cites a study by a Fed \n     economist claiming to find little connection between \n     ``materials'' prices and overall inflation. Yet the price of \n     oil was already rising sharply at the time, and it would keep \n     rising as the Fed maintained negative real interest rates for \n     many more months. This was a bad mistake.\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\n       Rising gas and food prices didn't show up in the Fed's \n     ``core'' inflation measurements, but they sure did wallop \n     U.S. consumers this decade. It's one reason Americans never \n     felt great about the expansion. The soaring price of oil also \n     contributed to the housing bubble by transferring wealth from \n     U.S. consumers to oil exporters such as the Gulf States and \n     Russia, which in turn recycled those petrodollars into U.S. \n     Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. By ignoring \n     commodity prices, the Fed fueled the housing boom.\n       It's also striking how dismissive Mr. Bernanke is of the \n     declining dollar. We'd have thought the greenback's value \n     would be the Fed's paramount concern, given its mandate to \n     keep prices stable. Yet Mr. Bernanke declared that ``large \n     movements of the dollar against major currencies tend to \n     translate into smaller movements against the U.S. trade-\n     weighted basket of currencies and into still smaller effects \n     on import prices because of imperfect pass-throughs.'' \n     Translation: Exchange-rate fluctuations aren't the Fed's \n     problem, no matter how disruptive their effect on trade and \n     capital flows.\n       Instead of following these actual prices, Mr. Bernanke's \n     main monetary policy guide is something called ``the output \n     gap.'' This is the difference between actual GDP growth and \n     the level of ``potential output,'' or how fast the economy \n     can grow when it's at full capacity. The problem with this \n     guide is that it relies heavily on labor costs and the \n     jobless rate. And because job creation tends to lag economic \n     recovery, these signals tend to flash yellow long after price \n     pressures or asset bubbles have begun to build.\n       All of this is relevant today because there is no evidence \n     that Mr. Bernanke and his Fed colleagues have changed their \n     thinking. They still ignore a falling dollar and rising \n     commodity prices, even as oil has climbed to $70 a barrel \n     from $40 six months ago. They also continue to be slaves to \n     the output gap, which means they are unlikely even to begin \n     to tighten as long as the jobless rate remains high. With \n     that rate now at 9.4% and likely to rise, the monetary \n     spigots will probably remain wide open for a long time to \n     come.\n       We think the Fed made the right call last fall when it \n     eased dramatically in the heat of the panic. The financial \n     shock had caused a decline in the velocity of money, and the \n     Fed needed to boost the supply of money to prevent a genuine \n     deflation. The recession this time is far deeper than in \n     2001-2002, so there is also a case to be made for erring on \n     the side of being slower to tighten.\n       But this time the Fed has also gone to greater easing \n     lengths than it ever has, taking short-rates nearly to zero \n     and making direct purchases of mortgage securities and even \n     Treasuries. These are extraordinary acts that push the Fed \n     deeply into fiscal policy, credit allocation and directly \n     monetizing Treasury debt. Combined with the 2003-2005 \n     mistake, they have also raised grave doubts about the Fed's \n     credibility and independence.\n       * * *\n       Mr. Bernanke will need political courage that we haven't \n     seen since Paul Volcker was Chairman in order to exit from \n     all of these efforts in time to prevent another bubble or \n     broader inflation. It also wouldn't hurt if the Fed chief \n     looks back with some humility on his intellectual certainty, \n     circa 2003, and analyzes why he was so wrong.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal--Dec. 3, 2009]\n\n                          The Bernanke Record\n\n       Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke faces his Senate \n     renomination hearing today, amid signs that the confirmation \n     skids are greased. We nonetheless think someone should say \n     that, as a matter of accountability for the financial crisis \n     and looking at the hard monetary choices to come, the country \n     needs a new Fed chief.\n       We say this not because of Mr. Bernanke's performance \n     during the financial panic of 2008, for which he has been \n     widely and often deservedly praised. Like others in the \n     regulatory cockpit at the time, he had to make difficult \n     choices with imperfect information and when the markets were \n     shooting with real bullets.\n       He supplied ample liquidity when it was most needed last \n     autumn, and he has certainly been willing to pull out every \n     last page of the central banker playbook. If some of those \n     decisions were mistakes, the conditions the Fed faced were \n     extraordinary. Anyone at the helm would have made calls that \n     in hindsight he'd regret.\n       The real problem is Mr. Bernanke's record before the panic, \n     with its troubling implications for a second four years. When \n     George W. Bush nominated the Princeton economist four years \n     ago, we offered the backhanded compliment that at least he'd \n     have to clean up the mess that the Alan Greenspan Fed had \n     made. That mess turned out to be bigger than even we thought, \n     but we also didn't know then how complicit Mr. Bernanke was \n     in Mr. Greenspan's monetary decisions.\n       Now we do, thanks to the release of the Federal Open Market \n     Committee transcripts from 2003. They show (see ``Bernanke at \n     the Creation,'' June 23, 2009) that Mr. Bernanke was the \n     intellectual architect of the decision to keep monetary \n     policy exceptionally easy for far too long as the economy \n     grew rapidly from 2003-2005. He imagined a ``deflation'' that \n     never occurred, ignored the asset bubbles in commodities and \n     housing, dismissed concerns about dollar weakness, and in the \n     process stoked the credit mania that led to the financial \n     panic.\n       This, too, might be forgivable if Mr. Bernanke had made any \n     attempt in recent months to acknowledge the Fed's role in the \n     mania. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Dallas Fed President \n     Richard Fisher and others have conceded that monetary policy \n     was too loose. How central banks can minimize, if not \n     prevent, asset bubbles without inducing recessions would seem \n     to be a subject for candid Fed debate.\n       But Mr. Bernanke and Vice Chairman Don Kohn have formed an \n     intellectual moat around the Fed, blaming the credit bubble \n     on the ``global savings glut'' that they themselves helped to \n     create. They are the Edith Piafs of central banking, \n     regretting nothing.\n       All of this bears directly on how the Fed will operate over \n     the next four years. We are now in another period of \n     extraordinary monetary ease. Mr. Bernanke is assuring the \n     world that, this time, he knows how and when to start \n     removing this stimulus, even as he also promises that the Fed \n     will remain easy for months to come. The guideposts the Fed \n     claims to follow on policy--the jobless rate, ``resource \n     utilization''--also remain the same. Price signals, \n     especially the value of the dollar, count for much less in \n     this Fed's decision-making.\n       Earlier this decade, the Fed had 20 years of sound-money \n     history as a source of credibility. The world's investors \n     were willing to give the Greenspan Fed the benefit of the \n     doubt--too much doubt as it turned out. But now, after the \n     mania and panic, investors are unlikely to show such \n     forbearance. That's already clear in Asia, where the falling \n     dollar is creating monetary distortions, and investors are \n     bidding up assets and currencies on a bet that the dollar is \n     in for further declines. Sooner rather than later, Mr. \n     Bernanke will have to tighten money even if the U.S. jobless \n     rate remains higher than everyone would like.\n       The Fed chairman has shown he knows how to ease money, and \n     creatively so. But that is the easy part of his job. The hard \n     part, the time when central bankers earn their fame, is when \n     they have to take the money away. We see little in the \n     chairman's policy history or guideposts to suggest he will be \n     willing to endure the criticism that will come with \n     tightening money amid a lackluster recovery, if that is what \n     is required to protect the dollar or prevent an inflation \n     outbreak.\n       The political irony today is that even as Mr. Bernanke is \n     cruising toward confirmation, the Fed as an institution is \n     under its most sustained political attack in two generations. \n     The political class is especially riled about the Fed's \n     forays into fiscal policy. While that is understandable given \n     the last year, the response to this action should not be to \n     put the Fed under even greater political control from \n     Congress. That is the Argentinian solution.\n       The better response is to hold policy makers accountable \n     for their actions, including chairmen of the Federal Reserve. \n     At this monetary moment more than any since the late 1970s, \n     the Fed needs a hard-money chairman with the courage and \n     credibility to resist the temptation to escape from the \n     consequences of the last bubble by floating another one.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From Wall Street Journal Editorial, Jan. 25, 2010]\n\n                        The Bernanke Nomination\n\n       The politicians turn on a political central banker.\n       The White House said yesterday it has damped down a \n     political revolt against Ben Bernanke and now has the votes \n     to secure the Federal Reserve Chairman's second four-year \n     term. Whether or not Mr. Bernanke is confirmed, the lesson we \n     draw is that overly political central bankers will eventually \n     be undone by politics.\n       There's no doubt that some of this reconfirmation panic is \n     nothing but political opportunism. When we opposed Mr. \n     Bernanke's reconfirmation on December 3, the facile consensus \n     was that the Fed chief was a master of the universe who had \n     saved the world from depression. But after Scott Brown's \n     victory in Massachusetts last week, Senate Democrats are \n     suddenly looking for a financial political sacrifice. \n     President Obama doesn't look ready to throw over Treasury \n     Secretary Tim Geithner, so Mr. Bernanke is the designated \n     spear catcher.\n       The Democrats' loudest complaint, moreover, is that Mr. \n     Bernanke and the Fed haven't been easy enough in printing \n     money. Majority Leader Harry Reid declared his support for \n     Mr. Bernanke on Friday, but not before extracting what he \n     said were concessions about future Fed policy.\n       The Fed chief promised, said Mr. Reid, that he would \n     ``redouble his efforts'' to make credit available and that \n     Mr. Bernanke ``has assured me that he will soon outline plans \n     for making that happen, and I eagerly await them.''\n       Redouble? The Fed has already kept interest rates at near \n     zero for more than a year, and it is buying $1.25 trillion in \n     mortgage-backed securities to refloat the housing bubble, \n     among other interventions into fiscal policy and credit \n     allocation. Is the Fed going to buy another $1.25 trillion, \n     or promise to keep rates at zero for another 14 months?\n       Mr. Reid's declaration of a confirmation quid pro quo will \n     not reassure global investors who already fear that the Fed \n     lacks the political will to withdraw its historic post- \n     crisis liquidity binge soon enough to avoid new asset \n     bubbles.\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\n       Our own view is that Mr. Bernanke is already far too \n     susceptible to political pressure. As a Fed governor, he was \n     Alan Greenspan's intellectual co-pilot last decade when their \n     easy money policies created the housing mania. When Congress \n     later put political pressure on the Fed to direct credit \n     toward housing, and even to student loans, Mr. Bernanke (who \n     was then chairman) also quickly obliged.\n       More ominously for the next four years, Mr. Bernanke \n     continues to deny any Fed monetary culpability for creating \n     the mania. Shortly after the New Year, even with his \n     nomination pending, Mr. Bernanke issued an apologia that was \n     striking for its willingness to play to the Congressional \n     theory of the meltdown by blaming bankers and lax regulators. \n     We won't rehearse our decade-long monetary argument with Mr. \n     Bernanke today--see ``Bernanke at the Creation,'' June 23, \n     2009. But the chairman's refusal to acknowledge any mistakes \n     is one reason the dollar is so weak in global capital \n     markets. Investors are hedging their bets in commodities and \n     nondollar assets.\n       Yes, much of Wall Street wants to see Mr. Bernanke \n     confirmed. The Street is currently making a bundle off Fed \n     policy, as it borrows at near-zero rates and lends long, and \n     the banks don't want that to end. The banks also loved \n     negative real interest rates in the middle of the last \n     decade, and we know how that turned out. Wall Street always \n     loves easy money--until inflation returns, or the bubbles \n     pop.\n       Others argue that any alternative to Mr. Bernanke could be \n     worse, and that is certainly a risk. Mr. Geithner and White \n     House economic adviser Larry Summers couldn't be confirmed, \n     even in a Democratic Senate. In the short term if Mr. \n     Bernanke is defeated, Vice Chairman Donald Kohn might run the \n     Open Market Committee, and he shares Mr. Bernanke's contempt \n     for Fed critics. President Obama could also select San \n     Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen, but she thinks the Fed \n     should be even easier.\n       Still, we can think of current or former presidents of \n     regional Fed banks who have hard money credentials. They \n     would also not carry the baggage of whatever Harry Reid \n     extracted as a price of confirmation.\n       We agree that the Fed needed to ease money precipitously \n     when the financial markets suffered their heart attack in \n     late 2008, and we praised Mr. Bernanke for that at the time \n     and since. But the issue for the next four years is whether \n     the Fed can extricate itself from its historic interventions \n     before it creates a new round of boom and bust. We already \n     see signs that it has waited too long to move.\n       The Fed as an institution is also under political attack in \n     a way that it hasn't been since the early 1980s, and that was \n     when Paul Volcker was being excoriated for being too tight. \n     That criticism has rarely if ever been leveled at Mr. \n     Bernanke. The next Fed chairman is going to need the market \n     credibility, and the political support, to raise interest \n     rates when much of Congress and Wall Street will be telling \n     him to stay at zero. That is the real reason to oppose a \n     second term for Chairman Bernanke.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the first point the Wall Street Journal \neditorial highlights dealing with Chairman Bernanke's overt political \nactivities states:\n\n       Whether or not Mr. Bernanke is confirmed, the lesson we \n     draw--\n\n  This is the Journal editorial staff--\n\n     is that overly political Central bankers will eventually be \n     undone by politics.\n\n  They always are.\n  The Wall Street Journal goes on to conclude:\n\n       Our own view is that Mr. Bernanke is already far too \n     susceptible to political pressure. As a Fed governor, he was \n     Alan Greenspan's intellectual copilot last decade when their \n     easy money policies created the housing mania.\n\n  On Mr. Bernanke's loose money record, the Journal noted in these \neditorials:\n\n       Mr. Bernanke was the intellectual architect of the decision \n     to keep monetary policy exceptionally easy for far too long . \n     . . He imagined a deflation that never occurred, ignored the \n     asset bubbles in commodities and housing, dismissed concerns \n     about dollar weakness and in the process, stoked the credit \n     mania that led us to where we are today in the financial \n     panic.\n\n  Finally, the Wall Street Journal points out in regard to Chairman \nBernanke:\n\n       The Fed Chairman has shown he knows how to ease money . . . \n     But, that is the easy part of his job. The hard part, the \n     time when Central bankers earn their fame, is when they have \n     to take the money away. We see little at this point in the \n     Chairman's policy history or guideposts to suggest he will be \n     willing to endure the criticism that will come with \n     tightening money amid a lackluster recovery, if that is what \n     is required to protect the dollar or prevent an inflation \n     outbreak.\n\n  For these and other reasons, the Wall Street Journal, one of the most \nwidely recognized business publications in the world, opposes the \nnomination, as I do, of Chairman Bernanke.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes remain.\n  Mr. DODD. Totally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority party has 8\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I will use the 3 minutes, and I will inquire of my friend \nand colleague from Alabama, at what point are we going to conclude this \ndebate?\n  Mr. SHELBY. We are checking to see.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me go ahead. I will assume we will probably wrap up the \ndebate with 3 minutes remaining.\n  We have a diversity of opinions, including from Paul Krugman, who is \nknown as a more progressive economist, in favor of this nomination, \nalthough and albeit he has certain caveats he expressed about the \nnominee, Ben Bernanke; the Washington Post; and others as well. Warren \nBuffett was asked on CNBC about this nomination and he said: All I can \nsay is, if you are going to turn him down, let me know a day or two in \nadvance because I would like to sell off some stock. They asked him \nwhy, and he said because he believed the message to the markets would \nbe a devastating one.\n  The one thing about the Federal Reserve--and there are legitimate \ncomplaints about the Federal Reserve System--but what we don't need is \nfor short-term politics to become the vehicle by which we decide Fed \npolicy. The independence of the Fed has been a critical component for \nstability in our economy. I happen to believe--despite being the chair \nof the Banking Committee for all of 2007, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, I could not get the attention of the previous administration, \nincluding the Federal Reserve, about the mortgage crisis in our \ncountry. We had 12 hearings, the first of which was on February 7, \n2007, on this subject matter alone. So if I were going to decide my \nvote on this nominee on that basis, I would vote against Ben Bernanke \nbecause, frankly, it was a failure by the previous administration early \non not to understand the gravity of this situation.\n  But I can't make my decision solely on that. The fact is, as I said \nearlier, we have had a leader in the Federal Reserve over the last year \nand a half who virtually saved our economy from a predictable collapse \nhad he not been there. Beginning in the fall of last year, when a group \nof us were in the room of the Speaker of the House, Democrats and \nRepublicans, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve warned us, if we \nfailed to act in a number of days, the entire financial system in this \ncountry and a good part of the world would melt down, to give an exact \nquote. I don't need to tell my colleagues that was sort of the economic \nequivalence of a 9/11 moment, when we were warned by the most important \ncentral banker in the world what could happen if we didn't act.\n  As a result of Ben Bernanke's leadership, as well as others--people \nsuch as Judd Gregg, Bob Corker, Chuck Schumer, who worked on this, the \nleadership in the House--we were able to put together a terribly \nunpopular package, but 75 of us on that night in this Chamber voted for \nthat very difficult proposition, to avoid the kind of catastrophe that \nwould have happened. There are very few people I think who would have \nhad the ability, the creativity, the imagination, and the courage to \ncome up with these ideas. Ben Bernanke did. So as a result, we are in \nfar better shape today.\n  However, we are far from out of the woods. We have a foreclosure \nproblem that is still huge. We have commercial problems that are coming \nalong that are going to be massive. If we don't have a Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve but only an Acting Chairman, I don't know what that \nmeans--and particularly the individuals who helped to create the very \nimaginative vehicles that allowed us to come out of this problem. To \nhave him walk away and find the Federal Reserve, this important central \nbank, without leadership at this critical moment, I think would be \nbeyond shameful. It would be the height of irresponsibility.\n  As Democrats and Republicans, the previous administration offered \nthis nomination. Many of us supported it. We need to come together, at \nleast in moments such as this, not to abandon\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nour country over partisan politics or ideology and failing to \nunderstand that if there need to be reforms in the Fed, let's reform \nthem, but let's not walk away from an importantly critical individual \nwho has made a difference in our economy and our Nation. For that \nreason, I urge my colleagues to terminate this filibuster--vote to end \nthat--and then vote to confirm Ben Bernanke as the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve.\n  I have been told I can speak until 3:20, but I will not take up all \nthe time. As I said a moment ago, this is one of those moments where we \nneed to step back and recognize the danger of our actions. This is not \njust a free vote. I know some people would prefer--they have the right \nto vote--to vote against the guy but hope he gets confirmed. That may \nwork, but it is dangerously precarious. If we don't have 60 votes to \nend this filibuster, and if we don't produce the votes to confirm him, \nthen I think this Congress, this body, regretfully, will have to bear \nthe responsibility of abandoning the very people and situations we talk \nabout today--jobs, the housing market, getting our economy back on its \nfeet again--and anticipate the kind of reaction we will see in the \nmarkets and elsewhere, setting us back weeks, if not months or years, \nin our ability to get through this fragile period and allowing the \nhopes and aspirations and the confidence of the American people to \ngrow.\n  I know it is an awful lot to stake the future of all that on just a \nnomination, but this is not some Assistant Under Secretary of some \nother agency. It is the central bank Chairman of the most central bank \nin the world. It is a critically important component in us continuing \nour path of economic recovery. We will bear the collective \nresponsibility of failing to meet that obligation if we walk away from \nthis obligation by either continuing this filibuster or defeating this \nnominee.\n  So I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans--there is enough \nto battle about on how we are going to deal with these issues in the \ncoming weeks, but on this matter let us send a message to the American \npeople that we understand their frustrations, their worries, and we are \ndoing everything we can to get us back on track again. Witness the \nPresident's remarks last evening.\n  You have a laser-like focus on the economy and job creation in our \ncountry. Don't make that effort fail because we send a message to our \nmarkets and the world that we cannot confirm an individual who saved us \nfrom an economic catastrophe in our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the cloture motion to end debate and \nthen, of course, to confirm Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal \nReserve.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of the time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                            Cloture Motion.\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination \n     of Ben S. Bernanke, of New Jersey, to be Chairman of the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to recognize another great \nFederal employee. In the past year we have witnessed the most \nsignificant economic downturn since the Great Depression. In the 1930s, \nmillions of Americans lost everything and there was no social safety \nnet to catch those in the greatest need. Today we are fortunate that \nthe Federal Government coordinates vital programs, preventing millions \nof Americans from slipping into the kind of poverty experienced in \nthose days.\n  I think probably the most important agency involved in this effort is \nthe Social Security Administration. Its mission is to provide a stable \nincome for retired American workers and those who cannot work because \nof a disability.\n  In the words of the great revolutionary patriot Thomas Paine, ``it is \nnot charity but a right, not bounty but justice.''\n  He wrote those words in 1797, when he published an early proposal for \nsocial security. It was only in the midst of the Great Depression that \nsuch a system was finally established by the Social Security Act of \n1935.\n  Seventy-five years later, the SSA's important work continues. One of \nthe great Social Security employees is Anne Gallagher, who has made a \ncareer of Federal Government work.\n  Anne, who grew up in Wilmington, DE and still lives there, has worked \nfor Social Security for 8 years. As a child, Anne attended the \nWilmington Friends School, and she later received her undergraduate \ndegree from Mary Baldwin College. After pursuing further study in New \nYork, she worked for 2 years in the broadcasting industry.\n  In 1976, Anne began a lifetime of public service, working for then-\nSenator Bill Roth, who was then the senior Senator of Delaware, in his \nWilmington office. Her role as senior caseworker for constituent \nservices was to intercede on behalf of Delawareans with Federal \nagencies.\n  If you were a veteran who needed help accessing VA resources or \nbenefits, Anne was the staff member in Senator Roth's office who would \ncontact the VA for you. If you were trying to adopt a child from \noverseas but had an issue with the State Department that needed \nclearing up, Anne would clear it up.\n  It was during this time, when I was chief of staff to Delaware's \njunior Senator Joe Biden, that I first met Anne and witnessed firsthand \nher unmatched dedication and positive attitude. Joe Biden has wonderful \ncaseworkers. They all thought very highly of Anne. And the two offices \nworked together seamlessly to serve the people of Delaware.\n  Anne handled important casework for Senator Roth for 7 years before \ndeciding to take time off to raise her two daughters, who, by the way, \nboth share their mother's passion for serving the public. But the call \nto serve was strong, and after 3 years away from Senator Roth's office, \nAnne returned. She continued working as an advocate for Delawareans \nuntil Senator Roth left office in 2001. At the same time, she still \nserved as the legislative assistant for veterans affairs from 1994 to \n1997.\n  In 2001, Anne spent several months working as the director of a \nnonprofit helping American families adopt children from overseas.\n  In 2002, she returned to government service when she became a \nRegional Public Affairs Specialist for the Social Security \nAdministration. In this role, Anne serves as the Social Security \ncongressional liaison for five States and the District of Columbia, \nwhich include 10 Senate offices and 43 House districts. The reports \nissued by her office help Members of Congress as well as other Federal, \nState, and local officials understand the status of Social Security \ndistribution in their jurisdictions.\n  Throughout her work in Social Security and Senator Roth's office, \nAnne has earned a reputation for thoroughness, dedication, and a kind \nheart. I never met anyone who has dealt with Anne who did not like her, \nwas not impressed with her kindness, her intelligence, and her ability \nto get things done. Once, while working for Senator Roth, Anne received \na call from an elderly woman who had been in touch with her regarding a \ncasework issue. It was in the midst of a snowstorm, and the woman, who \nlived alone, could not get to the grocery store for herself. So 45 \nminutes later Anne and her husband pulled up to the woman's house with \na carful of groceries. Many of those she helped still keep in touch \nwith her, even after 20 years.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Anne Gallagher and \nthanking her for her service to the Nation and the State of Delaware. I \nalso hope all Americans will recognize the important contribution made \nby all who work for the Social Security Administration and all those \nwho work for the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S318-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BURRIS.

Madam President, last night, just down the hall from this \nChamber, my colleagues and I assembled with our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives to take part in a tradition as old as our Republic.\n  This is more than just a Presidential address.\n  It is mandated by the U.S. Constitution, and it is one of the great \nrituals of modern democracy, the practice of bringing the major \nofficers of our government together to assess our national priorities.\n  Last night, President Obama laid out a bold vision for the years \nahead, and a renewed commitment to the uniquely American ideals that \nmake this country great.\n  So today, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss a few of \nthe things we heard in yesterday's speech, and how our agenda will \nbenefit the people of Illinois.\n  I am glad the President recognizes that this is not a time to change \nour priorities it is a time to recommit ourselves to the values and the \nideas that the American people voted for in 2008.\n  The mandate for better policy could not have been more clear.\n  Voters want us to focus on job creation. They want us to help small \nbusinesses, repair our national economy, and invest in clean energy.\n  They want us to pass real health care reform, reduce the deficit, and \nkeep corporate money separate from politics.\n  Under President Obama's leadership, my colleagues and I have already \nmade significant progress on a number of these issues.\n  A year ago, we passed far-reaching economic recovery legislation that \nbrought us back from the brink of disaster.\n  We voted to extend unemployment benefits, and keep sending help to \nthe people who need it most during these difficult times.\n  Even today, we are poised to take up job creation and climate change \nbills, and are closer to passing comprehensive health reform than ever \nin our history.\n  We are examining ways to address the deficit, and in pursuit of that \ngoal I believe we need to keep all options on the table.\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\n  And in the wake of the recent Supreme Court ruling, which dealt a \nmajor blow to campaign finance reform, I believe we need to take steps \nto minimize the ability of giant corporations to influence elections. \nWe need to keep companies from overriding the voice of the people in \nCongress.\n  Our system is designed for incremental change, so none of these \nthings will come easily.\n  But the agenda set by this President, and the demands of this trying \nmoment in history, dictate that we must set aside our partisan \ndifferences and come together to solve big problems.\n  We have made gains over the last year, and we are continuing to make \ntangible strides almost every single day.\n  So I would like to talk about what this means for my home State of \nIllinois.\n  When Congress passed a sweeping economic recovery plan about a year \nago, this country was losing more than 700,000 jobs a month, and the \neconomy was in freefall.\n  Today, the economy is growing for the first time in 2 years, and job \nlosses have fallen to a tenth of what they were last year.\n  For ordinary Illinoisans, this has made a real difference.\n  In Danville, IL, recovery act funding created 20 jobs at the East \nCentral Illinois Community Agency. It put additional police officers on \nthe street and created 14 jobs at the local housing authority.\n  It created summer jobs that allowed local kids to help support their \nfamilies. It helped fund a Head Start program in neighboring Gibson \nCity, and it funded three local projects through the Illinois \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  This is the measurable impact our legislation has had on only one \ncommunity in Illinois.\n  But letters and phone calls and news stories have been pouring into \nmy office from across the State, and the message is always the same.\n  From Danville, to Chicago, to Rockford, to Elmwood Park, I have heard \nfrom Illinoisans who have felt the positive effects of our new economic \nfoundation.\n  We must not forget that America is still on the road to recovery. But \nour policies have already made a real difference in people's lives.\n  One Danville business owner even said: ``I was leery of the whole \nstimulus thing at first, but they got it right.''\n  That is why it is time to look ahead.\n  It is time to redouble our efforts and prove our commitment to the \nvalues the American people voted for in the last election.\n  The national economy is no longer in freefall, but there are still \nfar too many people without jobs and far too many families that are \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  We need to use the remaining recovery act funds to create more jobs \nin cities such as Danville, IL, and across America.\n  We need to provide tangible help to the small businesses that form \nthe backbone of our economy, and the local banks that are essential to \nour national prosperity.\n  As a former banker myself, I understand how important these \ninstitutions are to the communities they serve. And I know they are \nhurting badly right now.\n  I am grateful that the President shares my support for these \ninitiatives. And I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate and with the administration to take action.\n  Already, President Obama's speech is being analyzed by the media as a \npartisan rallying cry, a recap of the administration's record, and a \ndozen other things.\n  But as I sat on the House floor last night, I heard more than that.\n  I heard a bipartisan call to arms, a sober recognition of the current \nsituation, and a strong vision for job creation, continued economic \nrecovery, and healthcare reform in the coming year.\n  The truth is, the American people do not need politicians in \nWashington to tell them about the current State of the Union.\n  They are the Union. They know about the challenges we face, and the \ndistance we have yet to go.\n  They do not care about partisan politics, or electoral math, or which \nparty has the majority in Congress.\n  The American people are interested in the answer to one question: \nWhere do we go from here?\n  So, as we set out to tackle the ambitious agenda that was laid out \nlast night, we must approach these proposals with the same mindset.\n  We must draw our energy and our strength from the American people, \nand summon the principles and ideas that can make that vision a \nreality.\n  This is not about scoring political points or winning elections.\n  It is about how we move forward together as a Congress, as a nation, \nand as a people.\n  It is about making a difference for the hard-working people of \nIllinois, and every other State in the country.\n  This is a time to be thoughtful and reflective and forward-thinking, \nbut it is also a time to roll up our sleeves.\n  Colleagues, as President Obama reminded us last night, this is a time \nfor bold action.\n  So today, let us get to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S319-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S319-S322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BERNANKE NOMINATION\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to speak on the vote we had \nearlier on the nomination of Ben Bernanke to be the Federal Reserve \nChairman. While I did not support Mr. Bernanke's reconfirmation to that \npost, I would like to take the time now to talk about that vote and my \nconcerns and the challenges I think our country faces moving forward.\n  When I look at this issue, I know that not one administration or not \none Fed Chairman got us into the mess we are in. In fact, it is not \neven to be blamed on one party. What this is about is how we move \nforward with complete transparency and the proper regulation to give \ncertainty and predictability to our financial markets. I will do my \nbest to represent my constituents with the proper level of oversight on \nthese issues, but I heard loudly and clearly from my constituents in \nDecember that they are, as small business owners, at the end of their \nrope without access to capital and that community banks are not \nlending. So that is where I am spending my time and focus now, in \nurging both the Fed and Treasury to act, without passing legislation \nbut act now to get recovery programs specifically working for community \nbanks that need access to capital and for those small businesses that \nare the engine of economic growth for our economy.\n  While I know many of my colleagues think programs that came out of \nthe TARP funding, such as the original TALF Program or even the \nTreasury Secretary's announced program in December, are things that \nhave been in the works, I can tell my colleagues that my constituents \nstarted this debate in earnest with credit default swaps and the \nconcern about large banks but are having a hard time, as I am, \nunderstanding the logic and the strategy that one day closes one of the \nlargest banks in America and one of the largest banks in our State, \nWashington Mutual, wiping out 30,000 creditors and basically putting in \njeopardy the retirement of many employees, and then 4 days later we \npass a TARP bill. I believe the government picking winners and losers \nat that point in time was the wrong approach, and I advocated for an \nequity program.\n  But today my constituents want to know why it is that it was easy to \nfigure out how, with loans and assets and the credit activity of the \nFed, over $1 trillion could be pumped into AIG at 100 cents on the \ndollar and yet small business owners in the State of Washington--and my \nguess is around the country--basically had capital cut from right under \nthem.\n  When I think about what happened, it breaks my heart. To think about \na company such as Vancouver's Columbia Gem, where the Bank of Clark \nCounty was shut down and assets moved over to another bank across the \nriver, Umpqua Bank, that received TARP funds. But where was the help \nfor the small businesses that had performing lines of credit at that \nbank? What happened to them? I will tell you what happened to them. \nEven though they had performing lines of credit, their funds were cut \nout right from under them. In fact, it forced the owner\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\nof that company to try to fund the operation of that business out of \nhis own pocket.\n  Another business in that area, Beaches Restaurant, immediately their \nline of credit was frozen after the takeover.\n  Vancouver Iron and Steel was current on all its loans and even eked \nout a small profit in 2008 and never missed a bank payment. But \nVancouver Iron immediately lost its $1.5 million line of credit after \nthe FDIC took over.\n  How is it we can act immediately to save the AIGs but we can't act \nimmediately to save companies such as Vancouver Iron and Steel? I \nguarantee Vancouver Iron and Steel was not cooking up dark market \nderivatives, creating credit default swaps that destabilized our \neconomy. Nor is Vancouver Iron and Steel continuing to operate \nderivatives in dark markets. No, they have nothing to do with that. \nThey are manufacturing product for America and abroad and producing \njobs. The fact that we continue to make it hard for them to get access \nto capital is one of the reasons why I voted against Mr. Bernanke. The \nFed Chairman has to realize the urgency with which the big banks have \nbeen bailed out and saved. That urgency has to be applied to Main \nStreet. I know they are trying. I applaud the President for last night \nsaying he is going to put forth $30 billion to help with access to \ncapital for community banks. I urge him to do that within the \nadministration.\n  While I am sure my colleagues could give input, to basically spend \nanother 2 or 3 months waiting for small businesses to get access \nthrough community banks, more and more business bankruptcies will \nhappen. While that is a program to get right, it is very clear to \nAmericans that when we want to act with urgency, this government can \nact and the Fed can act and the Treasury can act to solve these \nproblems.\n  I urge the Fed now and the Treasury to give consideration to making \nthis their No. 1 priority, to get capital to these community banks as \nurgently as possible through an equity program that gives them the \ninfusion it will take to get capital back to Main Street.\n  There are other reasons why I did not support Mr. Bernanke. As I \nsaid, this is not one Fed Chairman's problem or one administration's \nproblem. This has been caused by policies over the last several \ndecades, prior to the repeal of Glass-Steagall, in which we continued \nto say deregulation of these markets was unimportant. The policies at \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other policies that \nallowed for this kind of dark market activity of derivatives to grow \ninto an international $56 trillion industry are the policies that have \nbrought us to this point. We now have to have the urgency and the \nleadership of everyone involved to think creatively about the urgency \nof getting capital to community banks and small businesses and the \nreforms that must be put in place now, not to check a box, not to say \nwe did reform, not to say we are responding to something that has \nhappened recently but to move our economy forward with the transparency \nand proper regulation that will provide for international stability.\n  When I see from some of the well-known economists and investors \nacross the globe that another bubble is forming, that this problem we \nthink somehow we have corrected by passing TARP and doing other things \nis going to be alleviated, these individuals are signalling that \nanother bubble in the exact same situation could happen again, I want \nto see the Fed and Treasury advocate on the Hill the policies that will \ngive us complete transparency and regulation to assure Americans and \nthose participating in financial markets around the world that they \nwill function with certainty and predictability, that they are not \ngoing to be inflated with something that has no real value behind it \nsuch as the credit default schemes or, should I say, naked credit \ndefault schemes that we are trying to outlaw on the Senate floor.\n  I know what has happened with the regulatory reform legislation so \nfar that has come through Congress. There have been many attempts to \nwater it down. I am not blind to what I think the challenges will be to \npass this legislation when it comes to the Senate. That is why I want \nto see a Fed Chairman and a Treasury Secretary who are leading the \ncharge for the principles of regulatory reform that will correct these \nproblems with the markets, not to be for a few policies that might \nsound good, such as: Let's reduce systemic risk--I am for reducing \nsystemic risk--or not to say: We want a consumer group. I am for a \nconsumer group. But the heart of this issue is whether we are going to \nproperly regulate derivatives, whether we are going to pass a law that \nsays: Manipulative devices or contrivances of these markets are a \nFederal crime. Not only will you pay a penalty, you will go to jail.\n  I get that many in the markets believe there is no way we can \npossibly control all the new tools and all the new financial terms \npeople can come up with to deviate from the standards that are set. But \nI know this: Setting a statute in place and going back to Glass-\nSteagall can separate the risk to the taxpayer of having their money \nand their capital used to continue to prop up dark market activities. I \ncertainly believe we have to have derivatives regulation. But the \ntactic of now saying we can have that by definition, by saying no \nproprietary trading on these companies, I guarantee you we will be \ndebating the meaning of the words ``proprietary trading.'' The \nconsequence will be there will be lots of money flowing into dark \nmarkets.\n  I believe in the financial wherewithal to raise capital in America. \nIt is one of the greatest things about our country. It is one of the \ngreatest things that makes us competitive, the fact that we can create \ncapital in such an inspiring way and that we can have, in an \ninformation age, the kind of public financing of ideas and creativity \nthat continues to have us lead the way. But I ask my colleagues to look \nat how many IPOs have been created lately. I ask them to look at how \nmuch money has gone into the small businesses and community banks \nloaning to small business juxtaposed to the amount of money that has \ngone into derivatives. The truth is, you make more money on \nderivatives. So why would you put your money into investing in IPOs? \nWhy would you put your money into the small businesses?\n  What is happening is more and more concentration into the large banks \nthat then thwart the opportunities for small community banks to truly \nbe competitive with them. Then what happens? Less and less capital, \nless and less opportunities for small business or, as I saw recently, \neven the fact that some of the small business newspapers in this \ncountry haven't been able to get access to capital. They are going to \nend up in the hands of bankers. I don't know if those are big banks or \nsmall banks, but I know this: Small businesses deserve to have a choice \nof lenders, a diversity of market-size banks, and a Fed chairman who \nwill pay attention to that issue. We live in a unique time, created by \nat least two decades of deregulation of markets that are now going to \ncreate another bubble.\n  My vote against the Fed Chairman has to do not with the past but with \nthe future, the future prevention of another bubble, of more \nbankruptcies of small businesses, of getting our regulatory policies \nand our transparency of markets in place so the United States can get \nback to both the innovation and job creation but financial markets that \nthe United States leads in around the world, that we are not 10 years \nfrom now seeing the kind of dark market activity around the globe that \nhas transpired here. Instead, the United States, as the President says, \nlearns from a teachable moment and leads the rest of the world on the \ntypes of markets and transparency we expect.\n  I hope the Fed Chairman will embrace this task of a more robust \nleadership on the policies and regulation that need to be put into \nplace to prevent another bubble and to helping immediately small \nbusinesses. I don't want to leave the American people with the thought \nthat somehow Wall Street is more important than Main Street. That is \nnot what sent me to Washington, and it is not what sent my colleagues. \nI hope we will work in earnest, as Republicans and Democrats, to urge \nthe administration and the Fed to immediately adopt and implement a \nprogram to give community banks and small businesses access to capital.\n  One of the people I met with is a small businessman whom I used to \nsee\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nwhile eating in his restaurant many times, particularly working late at \nnight, when I worked for a software company. When I was home in \nDecember, I found that after 55 years he was going out of business. \nAfter 55 years in his family, they were going out of business. The \ndownturn definitely took its toll. He wasn't getting access to capital. \nHe held on for an entire year, not laying off one employee, keeping \neverybody he could instead of cutting them. The end result, after that \nyear, without any more resources, without any more access to capital, \nhe had to close that business. Not only that, because he mortgaged his \nhouse, he was probably going to lose his house. He put his restaurant \nup for auction. He told me, if he was lucky, he would probably get \n$10,000 for it. Fifty-five years in business, weathering several \ndownturns, not laying off any employees, he wanted to know where his \nlifeline was during this crisis.\n  I am going to devote my time and energy, along with working with the \nPresident on his commitment, to making sure this program for community \nbanks and small businesses gets implemented as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me thank my colleague from the State \nof Washington. She has been tireless in trying to address these issues, \nboth in legislation and on the floor of the Senate during debate, and \nit is so important.\n  I, too, voted against Mr. Bernanke's nomination today, and I wish to \nexplain why. It is certainly not that I believe Mr. Bernanke is a bad \nguy. He is not. He is a well-respected economist. But I wish to talk a \nlittle about the issues that persuade me we need a change--a change in \nculture, a change in personnel--in some respects.\n  If ever there now is a bright line in America between those who are \ntoo big to fail and those who are too small to matter;--that is, the \ntoo big to fail are the biggest financial institutions in the country \nthat have been making a lot of money, paying large bonuses, and living \nhigh off the hog. The too small to matter are the folks on Main Street \nwho sink everything their family has into a business trying to run a \ngrocery store, maybe a drugstore, a gas station, a barbershop, a \nrestaurant, and then they discover they cannot make a go of it because \nthings turn against them, and they are told: Do you know what. That was \nyour risk. If you can't make a go of it, that is your problem. What you \ndo is you lock the door, somebody sells the inventory, and you are out \nof business.\n  By contrast, the biggest financial institutions that were engaged in \nwholesale gambling--everything but the Keno tables and the craps tables \nand the blackjack tables in their lobby, everything but that; it was \nthe same thing--and ran their company and their country into the \nground, they were told: Well, do you know what. You are so big, we \ncan't possibly let you fail, so we are going to give you a bailout. So \nthat is the too big to fail versus the too small to matter. Is it any \nwonder people are furious in this country about that kind of \nassessment, that kind of value system?\n  Well, Mr. Bernanke is a nice guy. So is my Uncle Harold, by the way. \nMr. Bernanke is an economist. My Uncle Harold is not. Mr. Bernanke has \nnow been the Chair of the Fed for a while. Before that, he was part of \nthe economics team in the previous administration that turned, by the \nway, a big budget surplus in the year 2000--the first budget surplus \nfor the Federal Government in a long, long time. The new administration \ncame in and turned that into the biggest deficits in history up until \nnow. So I am not impressed with the whole scheme of a fiscal policy \nthat turns the country from big budget surpluses to big budget \ndeficits.\n  But with respect to the Federal Reserve Board itself, the Federal \nReserve Board has had responsibilities. Those responsibilities, first \nby Alan Greenspan at the Fed--and by the way, while Alan Greenspan was \nat the Fed, Mr. Bernanke was at the Fed as well during part of that \ntime, and now it has been Mr. Bernanke's tenure at the Fed--the \nresponsibilities are to supervise the banks, to deal with predatory \nlending, to address some of the scandalous behavior of some of the \nbrokers in the subprime market. Yet they did nothing. All of this went \non under their noses. The question for me in dealing with Mr. Bernanke \nand others is, How many times do we have to learn the same lesson?\n  I have been here at a time when the savings and loans collapsed in \nthis country. The S collapse--it was not surprising why they \ncollapsed because we had a bunch of folks who used the savings and loan \nlike a big piggy bank. They were parking junk bonds at the savings and \nloans organizations. The savings and loans were actually gathering \ndeposits from around the country, and they were like Roman candles, \njust taking a small, little, sleepy savings and loan and turning it \ninto a big institution with lots of deposits overnight. Then guys like \nMr. Milken were parking junk bonds in the S, insured by the Federal \nGovernment; that is, the American taxpayers, and things collapsed, and \nit cost hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  The most perverse result was the American taxpayer got stuck with \njunk bonds in the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City. Think of that. How \ndid that happen? Well, Donald Trump builds a casino, and whoever it is \ndecides to take the junk bonds from the casino and park them in a \nsavings and loan. The savings and loan is guaranteed by the American \ntaxpayer. The savings and loan goes bankrupt. So the junk bonds in the \nsavings and loan are now at the Resolution Trust Corporation, and the \nAmerican people end up with junk bonds in a casino. Isn't that \nunbelievable? Do we have to learn that lesson again? Well, we did then.\n  We learned it a second time after the S collapse. We learned it \nwith the Enron Corporation, which in part was a criminal enterprise. \nThey were manipulating wholesale electric markets on the west coast--\nschemes such as Get Shorty, Fat Boy, just to name a couple--and then \nhaving people, in addition to these schemes, shut off and turn on \npowerplants in order to manipulate supply so they could fleece \ntaxpayers and fleece ratepayers on the west coast out of billions of \ndollars. It was one of the greatest robberies in the history of our \ncountry. I led the hearings. I chaired the hearings over in the \nCommerce Committee. Ken Lay came and raised his hand. We swore him in. \nHe took the fifth amendment. He is now dead. But he was on his way to \nprison. Mr. Jeff Skilling from Enron Corporation came and just talked \nand talked and talked. It turns out none of it was accurate. He is now \nin prison.\n  So we had to learn a second time about the fleecing of America--the \nbig S scandal that cost the American taxpayers an unbelievable amount \nof money; then the Enron scandal--a corporation that does not now exist \nthat became, in part, as I said, a criminal enterprise; and now this \nfinancial house of cards that collapsed on this country. It is not \nsurprising why it collapsed. What happened was we had some of the \nbiggest financial entrepreneurs in this country--some of the biggest \noperators, I should call them, not entrepreneurs--some of the biggest \nfinancial operators in this country who were engaged in full-scale \ngambling with their company money, the biggest financial companies in \nthis country.\n  My colleague talked about credit default swaps and CDOs and so on. We \nhad synthetic derivatives. Do you know what synthetic derivatives are? \nAt least a derivative is something you can reasonably explain because \nit has some value. It is connected to some value on each side of the \ntrade. Synthetic derivatives are simply an artificial device that \nallows you to place a wager on whether something will happen, unrelated \nto value on either side of the trade. It is as if to say: Take the \nbiggest investment banks in America and put a craps table in their \nlobbies and let them gamble from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. and let the \nAmerican taxpayer pay their losses. That is exactly what has happened.\n  Now, what is happening today? Well, this is Bloomberg News:\n\n       Wall Street is marketing derivatives last seen before \n     credit markets froze in 2007. . . .\n\n  Actually, I have it on a bigger chart here.\n\n       Wall Street is [now back] marketing derivatives last seen \n     before credit markets froze in 2007, as the record bond rally \n     prompts investors to take more risks to boost returns.\n       Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley are encouraging \n     clients to buy swaps\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\n     that pay higher yields for speculating on the extent of \n     losses in corporate defaults.\n\n  And again:\n\n       Banks Reviving Synthetic Bets as [Paul] Volcker Blasts \n     Default Swaps.\n\n  Bloomberg. So here we are. The financial system collapsed, steered \nthis economy right into a ditch. Millions and millions of Americans \nlost their jobs, lost their homes, lost hope, and are still struggling. \nThe biggest interests got bailed out and made whole and now are making \nrecord profits again and are prepared to pay $140 billion, I am told, \nin bonuses. And now we see they are back to trading synthetic \nderivatives--the very same firms.\n  How often do we have to learn this lesson--once, twice, three times, \nor ten times--before the Congress will decide: No more of it.\n  My point is, just like with kids, you say: Do you know what. You \nbetter hope your kids are running around in a good crowd. That is the \nsuccess, isn't it, having them run around in a good crowd as opposed to \na bad crowd? As I take a look at all these nominations and \nappointments, the question for me is, What kind of crowd do they run \naround in? And do you know what. There is a kind of insular crowd that \nall comes from the same locations, and they all believe the same thing, \nand the fact is none of them have the stomach or the interest or the \ncourage to decide to shut down what is essentially gambling on Wall \nStreet and firms that are too big to fail, which means it is no-fault \ncapitalism and the American people will pay the consequences. None of \nthem have the courage to do that. In fact, they have now been given a \nyear to organize to try to stop anything that is done here in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  I will say once again, it was 10 years ago when I stood on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate and was one of eight Senators to vote against the \npiece of legislation that created these big holding companies--the \nFinancial Services Modernization Act, it was called--to repeal the \nprotections that were put in place after the Great Depression.\n  I said, 10 years ago, I think that is going to set this country up \nfor massive taxpayer bailouts. No, I do not have a crystal ball, and I \ndo not necessarily prognosticate very well. But I knew that if we \nallowed those who wanted to do one-stop financial shopping--putting \ntogether securities with banking, investment banking with FDIC-insured \nbanking--we were headed directly toward a cliff. And 10 years later, it \nis the biggest financial scandal in the history of this country, and \nthis economy barely survived it. The American people lost $15 trillion \nin value as a result of this economic collapse--$15 trillion.\n  So who is accountable? Well, there have never been the kinds of \nhearings I think there should have been developing a master narrative \nof what happened and who was responsible and who was accountable and \nwhere the buck ought to stop. But we know some of it. We know who had \nsome responsibility: the Federal Reserve Board.\n  Mr. Greenspan has since come to Congress and apologized because he \nsaid he was mistaken. He thought self-regulation would be just fine. \nWell, that is not why we have regulators. We have regulators because we \nknow self-regulation does not work. The free market system is \nwonderful, but you need effective regulators who take a look at what is \ngoing on and call the fouls and blow the whistle when they see the \nfouls.\n  We went through a period where it was, ``Katy, bar the door,'' do \nanything you like, and that is what happened. The big banks took \nleverage from 10 times capital to 30 times capital. They began selling \nderivatives and credit default swaps and, pretty soon, synthetic \nderivatives, which were just instruments of gaming, and nobody seemed \nto care.\n  At the same time, in another area of financial enterprise, we began \nto see the development of this new, aggressive orgy in mortgage scams \nto say to people: If you can't afford to buy a home, we have a mortgage \nfor you. If you have bad credit, we have a mortgage for you. If you \nhave been bankrupt--slow pay, no pay--come to us; we will help you buy \na home. By the way, everybody was getting big fees. They wrapped it \ninto a security, sold the security from the mortgage bank to a hedge \nfund, to an investment bank, and everybody knew better. Pretty soon, \nthe whole thing collapsed, and the American people were told: Now you \npay the cost. You pay the cost to clean up this mess.\n  Well, at every step along the way, the Federal Reserve Board had a \nresponsibility. Bad behavior by brokers, bad behavior by mortgage \nbanks--they had a responsibility to oversee those things. And today we \nread that synthetic derivatives are now being pushed by Bank of America \nand Morgan Stanley. So what is the Federal Reserve Board doing about \nthat? What about that buildup of additional bubbles of risk? Does \nanybody care? Is there anybody who is going to do anything about that?\n  Mr. Bernanke is a good guy, but the fact is, he is part of the crowd \nthat I think helped cause these problems. I think--and I have said \ncandidly--during the darkest period, where there was the question of \nwhether this economy would completely collapse, Mr. Bernanke made some \nfine decisions. I do not think he is a bad person at all. But I do not \nthink he--by the way, this would apply to some others in areas of \nresponsibility--I do not think he comes from the culture to say that \nthis whole set of activities has to change and change now and change \naggressively.\n  Let me complete my thought by simply saying that I understand how \nimportant banking is. I understand how important investment banking is. \nI understand the financing system of our country is important and needs \nto be strong. I am not suggesting that somehow you can finance all the \nthings we want to do in our country out of somebody's garage. That is \nnot my point. My point is, however, there is the right way and the \nwrong way to construct a system of financing.\n  We have, over 200 years, seen this back-and-forth between those who \nproduce and those who finance production. Sometimes one has the edge in \nterms of strength and power, and sometimes the other does. In the last \n20 or 30 years, in my judgment, those who finance production have \nreally been pulling the strings in this country as opposed to those who \nproduce. That is why we have fewer good jobs in this country, and it is \nwhy we see more and more of the profits and more and more of the gross \nincomes that swell the paychecks of a lot of people at the top coming \nfrom investment banking and some of the biggest financial firms in the \ncountry. I do not think that is healthy for the country, as a matter of \nfact.\n  So I voted against Mr. Bernanke. I voted for cloture because I am not \nsomebody who wanted to prevent a vote on it. But I did decide long ago \nthat I was not going to be supportive.\n  Let me make one final point. That is this: Mr. Bernanke, during the \nheight of the crisis, opened, for the first time in history, the \nFederal Reserve Board to give direct loans to investment banks--\nthe first time ever they have given direct loans to commercial banks \nbut never before to investment banks. He opened the window to say we \nare going to give direct loans to investment banks. My guess is \ntrillions of dollars went out in direct loans. In my judgment, the \nAmerican people and the Congress have a responsibility to know who got \nthose loans, how much, and what were the terms. We have written to the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board--myself, Senator Grassley, and \neight others--to say: You now have a responsibility to tell us who got \nthat money and what were the terms. His answer to us was: I have no \nintention of telling you.\n\n  That is not acceptable to me and should not be acceptable to the \nCongress or to the American people, and that is another reason that I \nwould not advance this nomination.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that \na quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S322-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S322-S324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO FORMER SENATOR CHARLES ``MAC'' MATHIAS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to talk about former\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\nSenator Charles ``Mac'' Mathias who represented Maryland in the Senate \nfor three terms and whose passing on Monday was a real loss for \nMaryland and our Nation.\n  Mac Mathias was a true statesman in the best sense of the word. He \nbecame a voice for those who had no voice. He fought for better \nconditions for working people, and he took bold, principled stands that \nwere not always popular with the prevailing political sentiment.\n  Mac Mathias was one of my heroes, and I considered him a friend and \nadviser. He was first elected to Congress in 1960, and he lived through \nsome of the most turbulent times of the 20th century, including the \nstruggle for civil rights, the Vietnam war, and the Watergate scandal. \nMac's strong, principled stand garnered respect from both sides of the \naisle, prompting then-majority leader Mike Mansfield to characterize \nMac as ``the conscience of the Senate.''\n  Mac Mathias was often at odds with his own party. In 1970, for \ninstance, he denounced the U.S. military incursion into Laos, condemned \nthe Watergate scandal, and worked tirelessly for campaign finance \nreform. His outspokenness earned him a place on President Nixon's \nenemies list.\n  Mac was an important supporter of the civil rights movement, helping \nto craft an open housing law. In 1965 he traveled to Selma, AL, to \nvisit Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was then in jail. In 1986 at a \nfarewell party for Senator Mathias at the Baltimore Convention Center, \nBenjamin L. Hooks, the president of the NAACP said: ``I say thank God \nfor Mac Mathias.''\n  Mac was an outstanding advocate for Maryland in Congress. Proud of \nhis Frederick roots and committed to the environment, he proposed \nlegislation to protect the Chesapeake Bay, Antietam National \nBattlefield, and Assateague Island. He also was the primary sponsor of \nthe bill that created the C Canal National Historical Park.\n  Mac was a tireless advocate for fair elections. In the 110th \nCongress, he traveled to Washington to help lobby fellow Republicans \nfor a bill to combat election fraud. He was a leader for campaign \nfinance reform--a subject Congress will have to revisit in the wake of \nthe majority's decision last week in Citizens United v. Federal \nElection Commission.\n  He once remarked:\n\n       No problem confronting our nation today is greater than \n     that of our steadily eroding confidence in our political \n     system.\n\n  He was so right. He understood that democracy is dependent on \ninclusion and on citizens who participate in the process and who have \nconfidence that their views will be heard and fairly considered.\n  Today, I urge my colleagues to pause for a moment to remember a \ngentleman from Maryland who cared deeply for our Nation and understood \nthat our democracy depends on strong leaders who have courage, \nintelligence, and integrity. Mac Mathias was such a leader.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Cardin pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 2967 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                       AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN TRIP\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I recently returned from a trip to \nPakistan and Afghanistan with Senator Al Franken. We heard a great deal \nof troubling news out of Afghanistan over the past few months. \nCasualties have increased and the political situation has been \nunsettled. Based on what we saw and heard during our trip, I am \nsomewhat more optimistic that we will succeed in Afghanistan. I am a \nlot more optimistic now than after my last visit to Afghanistan in \nSeptember. Success, to me, is defined as preventing the Taliban from \nreturning to power at the same time we strengthen the Afghan security \nforces to take responsibility for Afghan security in order to ensure \nstability in Afghanistan.\n  Over the course of 3 days, we met with key civilian and military \nleaders in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n  In Pakistan, we met with Pakistan Prime Minister Gilani; Army Chief \nof Staff Kayani; and a leader from the opposition party, Ahsan Iqbal. \nPakistan has taken some steps to take on elements of the Pakistan \nTaliban and al-Qaida but has been for the most part unwilling to take \non the Afghan Taliban which uses Quetta in the south of Pakistan and \nNorth Waziristan in Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas as \nsafe havens and to attack Afghanistan.\n  In Afghanistan, we met with U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry; GEN \nStanley McChrystal, Commander of the NATO-led International Security \nAssistance Force, or ISAF; LTG David Rodriguez, Commander of the ISAF \nJoint Command; LTG William Caldwell, who leads the NATO Training \nMission in Afghanistan; and British MG Nick Carter, Commander of ISAF \nforces in Regional Command South. We also met with key Afghan \nofficials, in particular President Karzai, Minister of Defense Wardak; \nand Minister of the Interior Atmar. Outside Kabul, we traveled to bases \nin Kandahar province, where we met with Canadian and American ISAF \ntroops who are fully embedded in a partnership, i.e., living side-by-\nside with Afghan security forces.\n  Our men and women in uniform are performing magnificently. We visited \nwith our troops in the field in Kandahar, and they are living and \noperating in a difficult environment with only basic accommodations. \nYet their morale is high and they are eager to carry out their mission. \nAnd they have some of the best leadership our military has to offer in \nISAF Commander GEN Stanley McChrystal, Lieutenant General Rodriguez, \nand Lieutenant General Caldwell. On the civilian side, Ambassador Karl \nEikenberry and his team are putting in place the diplomatic and \ntechnical expertise in Kabul and the field to match our military \neffort.\n  One reason I am more optimistic now than when I visited Afghanistan \nin September is our counterinsurgency strategy is taking hold. Our \ntroops are comfortable with the new focus on securing the Afghan \npeople. This requires that our troops remain with the Afghan people and \nnot just clearing towns and villages of Taliban and then leaving the \nAfghans to fend for themselves when the Taliban return. Our troops \nunderstand and embrace this people-centered approach. As British MG \nNick Carter, Commander of the coalition forces in the south, said:\n\n       If we show confidence and mutual trust, the population will \n     look after us.\n\n  The Afghan people are more optimistic than they have been in the \nrecent past. A recent ABC News survey found that 70 percent of the \nAfghans polled said Afghanistan is headed in the right direction, a \nsignificant jump from a year ago. Over 60 percent of Afghans expect \ntheir children will have a better life. The Taliban remain extremely \nunpopular, and 68 percent of Afghans continue to support the presence \nof our troops in their country.\n  I have long been convinced that our principal mission in Afghanistan \nshould be training the Afghan security forces. That drove my belief \nthat we should not focus on adding more U.S. combat forces, except \nwhere we needed to train, equip, and support Afghan security forces.\n  As I put it when the President was considering additional combat \nforces, I supported a show of commitment but said commitment could be \nshown by additional trainers and support personnel, along with a flow \nof equipment to Afghan forces. I expressed then and believe now our \nmajor mission should be a surge of Afghan forces to take on the \nTaliban. Afghan security forces will ultimately win or lose the long \nbattle with the Taliban. Our support will help, but our growing \npresence has a downside: a growing footprint, which is the physical and \nrhetorical propaganda target for the Taliban.\n  We heard in our conversations that President Obama's West Point \nspeech in December has had a tangible, positive impact in ways that I \nbelieve are the most significant in Afghanistan. According to LTG Bill \nCaldwell, the head of our NATO training command, the number of new \nrecruits signing up for the Afghan Army has skyrocketed from 3,000 in \nNovember to over 11,000 recruits in training today. The training \ncommand has had to turn recruits back because they didn't have enough \ntrainers on hand. Lieutenant General Caldwell told us, forcefully and \nclearly, that what energized the Afghan leadership to call for and to \nreach out to new\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\nrecruits was the July 2011 date President Obama set for the beginning \nof reductions in U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Even more than the pay \nincrease, which was announced for Afghan troops, Lieutenant General \nCaldwell said setting that date by President Obama made clear to the \nAfghan Government and to the Afghan people that President Obama means \nbusiness when he says our presence in Afghanistan is not an open-ended \ncommitment. Afghan leaders became focused on planning for the shift in \nprincipal responsibility from coalition forces to their forces that is \nhighlighted by that July 2011 date, and they took urgent steps to \nincrease recruitment to the Afghan Army. While it is too early to \ndetermine if the surge in U.S. combat forces will have the effect \nPresident Obama and General McChrystal intend, it is not too early, in \nother words, to see a positive effect toward accomplishing the mission \nof strengthening and training the Afghan Army.\n  A key to the success of that mission will be partnering with the \nAfghan security forces. In Regional Command South's Kandahar area, \nwhich we visited, coalition and Afghan units are partnering on a one-\nto-one basis at all levels, from planning at the headquarters down to \noperations at the platoon level, and Afghans are taking the lead in \noperations. When I visited Helmand Province in the south in September, \nthere were about five U.S. marines for every one Afghan soldier. In the \ncoming months, additional Afghan forces will be arriving in Helmand so, \nby April, coalition and Afghan units will be partnered on a one-to-one \nbasis as they conduct the key mission of providing security in the \nHelmand River Valley. We were informed Afghan forces will be leading \nthat vital and dangerous mission.\n  Senator Franken and I saw up close how partnering of coalition and \nAfghan forces is being put into operation. This is not just about joint \noperations, though that is part of it. It is about Afghan and coalition \ntroops living together and integrating their daily lives. This \npartnering is at the heart of our troops' mission, which is to prepare \nAfghan security forces to take responsibility for their nation's \nsecurity. Some fully integrating partnering in the field is already \noccurring. General Rodriguez promised us he will get data on how many \nof the units in the field that are planning and operating with \ncoalition units are fully integrated and how often and how many Afghan \nunits are leading significant operations. While we didn't need more \ncombat troops for the partnering mission--the shortfall being in the \nnumber of Afghan troops--the increase in Afghan units partnering with \nus is a significant advance.\n  Our military leaders often describe our counterinsurgency doctrine as \nshape, clear, hold, and build. But this falls short by one key goal. To \nshape, clear, hold, and build must be added ``transition,'' meaning our \ngoal must be to transition responsibility for Afghanistan's security to \ntheir security forces. The commanders in the field we talked to get \nthis, and their fully integrated partnering with Afghan security forces \nis the key to this transition.\n  While I am pleased with the speed with which partnering is occurring \nin the field, I am disappointed with the shortfall in trainers needed \nfor the Afghan Army and police. Currently, only 37 percent of the \nrequired U.S. and NATO trainers for building the Afghan Army and police \nare on hand in Afghanistan or, numerically, 1,574 out of a requirement \nfor more than 4,235 trainers. Lieutenant General Caldwell's training \ncommand has been promised the first 1,000 of the 30,000 U.S. soldiers \nflowing into the theater with that surge, and 150 of that 1,000 have \nalready arrived. At the same time, NATO countries remain 90 percent \nshort of meeting the ISAF mission requirements for trainers with less \nthan 200 non-U.S. trainers deployed against a non-U.S. NATO commitment \nof about 2,000. Only 200 have arrived on the scene. Another 200 NATO \ntrainers were pledged by NATO members in December but without a \ntimeline for when those trainers would arrive in theater. That is \nsimply unacceptable. Those NATO countries that are either unwilling or \nunable to send additional combat troops into the fight in Afghanistan \nshould be able to help provide trainers for basic training who operate \naway from the frontlines. Lieutenant General Caldwell told us, any \nwell-trained U.S. or coalition soldier could instruct Afghan soldiers \nin the 8-week course of basic training. A top priority for our NATO \nallies at the London conference, which I believe is this week, needs to \nbe closing the gap in trainers for the Afghan Army and police.\n  Another area where there has been progress is on equipping the Afghan \nsecurity forces, and that is critical to accelerating the growth of the \nAfghan Army and police.\n  The training command reports that the equipment requirements for the \nArmy and police have been identified and listed, and actions are \nunderway to meet those needs, including with equipment coming out of \nIraq as U.S. forces draw down there. This month, equipment began to \nflow from the Iraq theater to Afghanistan, and Lieutenant General \nCaldwell's staff expects that over 250 of over 1,300 humvees from Iraq \nwill begin to arrive this month to meet the needs of the Afghan police. \nThis was made possible by the language in the Fiscal Year 2010 National \nDefense Authorization Act which authorizes the transfer of nonexcess as \nwell as excess defense equipment from Iraq to Afghanistan as U.S. \nforces draw down in Iraq.\n  Finally, relative to plans for the reintegration of lower level \nTaliban fighters, the Karzai government has been working closely with \nGeneral McChrystal's staff, under the leadership of a British major \ngeneral, to construct a plan offering incentives to low- and mid-level \nTaliban fighters who are willing to lay down their weapons and \nrecognize the Afghan Government's authority. Incentives would include \namnesty and jobs programs for reintegrating former fighters. President \nKarzai has said he will be ready to issue this plan within a month or \nso, and U.S. officials expect to be fully supportive. It will take a \nfew months after that to make the plan operational. While there is \napparently no progress to negotiate with higher level Taliban to end \nthe violence and become politically active, it does not reduce the need \nto chip away at that lower level Taliban group.\n  We read in the press today that progress is being made, as a matter \nof fact, with local leaders in Afghanistan in that endeavor.\n  In conclusion, we saw some signs of progress on our visit in a number \nof critical ways--in training and equipping Afghan security forces; in \npartnering closely in the field with the Afghan security forces; in a \nperception and reality of optimism among the military, civilian \nofficials, and the Afghan people; and in devising a plan for \nreintegrating Taliban fighters who lay down their arms. We have the \nright strategy and mission for stabilizing the security situation and \ntransitioning responsibility for Afghanistan's future to the Afghan \nArmy and people. While we are on the right track now, we have a long \nway to go before we can feel confident that the tide has turned.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S324-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S324-S332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMPREHENSIVE IRAN SANCTIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF \n                                  2009\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this has been a long time in coming--I \nthink 7 or 8 months--and I have had the distinguished Republican leader \ncontact me on more than one occasion asking when we were going to be \nable to move this bill. I appreciate his continuing to press to move \nthis bill forward. We are at a point now where we think we have an \nopportunity to complete this today.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to my friend from the class of \n1982 in the House of Representatives, John McCain, who has worked on \nthis as hard as anyone and has pushed this as much as anyone, for his \nunderstanding as to how we should move forward.\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 215, S. 2799; that the \nbill be\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I reserve the right to object, though I \nwill not object, but I just want to point out the importance of this \nlegislation. I think it deserves a rollcall vote. In discussions with \nthe majority leader and the Republican leader, we will hopefully get a \nrollcall vote on the conference report.\n  This situation in Iran is terrible, and it is worsening. People are \ndying in the streets of Iran as we speak. The amendment I had proposed \nand that I had hoped for--and maybe we can have the conferees include \nit--would have required the President to draw up a list of persons in \nIran who have committed human rights abuses or actions of violence \nagainst Iranian civilians engaging in peaceful political activity. The \namendment I would have proposed would require that the list be made \npublic so the enemies and oppressors of the Iranian people can't hide \nfrom their crimes--the world would know their names--and then we could \nimpose visa bans, asset freezes, financial and banking sanctions, et \ncetera.\n  In the streets of Iran today the Iranian students are chanting: \nObama, Obama, are you with us or are you with them? I appreciate the \nPresident's recent statements in support of democracy in Iran. I am \npleased to hear that. I am pleased to see articles, such as this one in \nNewsweek magazine--``Enough Is Enough''--and other support for serious \naction against Iran that some months ago did not support such action.\n  The time of the majority leader and the Republican leader is \nvaluable, so I would just summarize by saying: This is an important \nissue, Madam President. We have a country on the road to acquisition of \nnuclear weapons. We have brutality and oppression in the streets. We \nhave unspeakable brutality taking place in the prisons, and people have \nbeen killed. A young woman by the name of Neda bled to death on the \nstreet of Tehran before the entire world.\n  So I hope we will be able to impose these and other necessary actions \nagainst this tyrannical, oppressive, brutal regime in Iran that I think \nis coming apart. We want to be on their side, and we want the Iranian \npeople to know we are on their side.\n  I appreciate the accommodation of the majority leader as well as the \nRepublican leader, and I know they share my commitment, as does my \nesteemed and wonderful friend from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman.\n  So I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona has the assurance of the two \nleaders--Reid and McConnell--that there will be a vote when this matter \ncomes back from conference, and I am committed to getting it back just \nas quickly as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Obviously, I will not be objecting. I just want to \nassociate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Arizona and to \nthank him, as well as Senator Lieberman, for their involvement in this \nissue, as well as the majority leader, and just make one comment.\n  Frequently, these kinds of unilateral sanction measures make little \nor no difference. This measure, however, is crafted in such a way that \nit could actually become effective, with America alone not having to \ndepend on the cooperation of the other countries that tend to be less \nconcerned about whether Iran ultimately becomes armed with nuclear \nweapons.\n  So this is an important piece of legislation, as the majority leader \nsaid, as Senator McCain has said, and Senator Lieberman has said. It \ncan actually make a difference.\n  The time to act on this measure is long overdue.\n  A year ago, the administration came into office with the idea it \nwould try to engage Tehran diplomatically in order to get it to halt \nits uranium enrichment program. And yet the past year has shown us that \nthe Iranian regime is intent on acquiring the ability to develop a \nnuclear weapon. This is now abundantly clear.\n  Our straightforward proposal to provide Iran with nuclear fuel for \ncivilian purposes in exchange for its stockpile of low enriched uranium \nfailed to produce any concessions.\n  The Iranian regime has shown no interest in limiting its nuclear \nambitions. And an entire year was lost as Iran moved closer and closer \nto its goal.\n  Some recent highlights from that lost year:\n  In September, the world learned of Iran's covert uranium enrichment \nfacility in Qom.\n  That same month, Iran test fired a series of medium and longer range \nmissiles that put U.S. bases in the gulf and our ally, Israel, within \nrange.\n  In October, the U.N. Security Council and Germany offered to enrich \nIran's uranium abroad--an offer that was met by more delay and \nobfuscation by Tehran.\n  Deadlines came and went. And just a few days ago, the U.N. Security \nCouncil failed to agree on a new round of sanctions.\n  So here we are, a year later. And what has been the result of \ndiplomatic engagement?\n  Iran is closer to realizing its nuclear aspirations, and the U.S. has \nnothing to show for the outreach.\n  And here is what is at stake:\n  Standing by and permitting Tehran to satisfy its nuclear ambitions \nwould pose a grave threat to American interests in the Middle East and \nSouth Asia. The Iranian government is already a profoundly \ndestabilizing influence in the region. It supports proxies in Iraq and \nAfghanistan that have killed U.S. and allied troops. It has threatened \nto wipe one of our closest allies, Israel, off the map. It supports \nterrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas. It ruthlessly \nsuppresses its own citizens for peaceful demonstrations.\n  If the Obama administration will not take action against this regime, \nthen Congress must.\n  That is why we are proposing the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions \nAct.\n  This act would direct sanctions at one of Iran's biggest \nvulnerabilities: its low level refining capacity.\n  This is a point of leverage we must use sooner rather than later. \nTime is of the essence.\n  This legislation cleared the Republican side of the aisle several \nweeks ago.\n  We are eager for this measure to pass.\n  So I urge the Democratic leadership to call this legislation up \nimmediately.\n  We have lost a year already. We can't afford any further delay.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, today we consider important legislation to \nconfront a serious threat to the security of the U.S., of our close \nally Israel, and of our other allies in the Middle East and Europe--the \nprospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. This is one of the most serious \nforeign policy challenges facing the United States today.\n  Before we move forward on this measure, let me outline briefly where \nwe have been. In 2008, after careful consideration, the Banking \nCommittee reported out a bipartisan bill to put pressure on the Iranian \nregime to come clean on its nuclear program, and end its illicit \nnuclear activities. Unfortunately, that bill never was considered on \nthe Senate floor because of the obstruction of a handful of Senators.\n  In recent months, all of us have been deeply troubled to see the \nIranian regime violently punishing its own citizens for pressing for \nfair elections.\n  And we have watched with growing concern the activities of the \nleaders of this troubled regime, including the continuing repression of \ntheir people, their deception about the previously secret nuclear \nenrichment facility at Qom, and their more recent threats to expand \nsubstantially Iran's uranium enrichment activity, in defiance of the \ndemands of the international community and the U.N. Security Council.\n  Last fall, the committee held additional hearings, where we \nconsidered the views of a wide range of outside witnesses, and relevant \nadministration officials, on policy options toward Iran. Senator Shelby \nand I then worked with our committee colleagues to craft a \ncomprehensive, bipartisan bill that was reported out of the Banking \nCommittee unanimously in late October, by a vote of 23-0. The bill is \ncomprehensive, and includes tougher sanctions;\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\nprovisions which enable divestment by States and local governments from \nfirms working in Iran's energy sector; and measures to combat the black \nmarket diversion of sensitive technology to Iran. On December 15, the \nHouse acted to approve overwhelmingly a more limited package of \nsanctions. I am pleased we will be able to finally act today on this \ncomprehensive measure, also with the overwhelming support of this body.\n  Madam President, when he took office, President Obama adopted a two-\ntrack policy of engagement backed by the prospect of further sanctions, \nand I have supported his approach. He has worked tirelessly with our \nallies to try to bring Iran's leaders to the table to negotiate an end \nto their illicit nuclear activities or, failing that, to impose a range \nof new sanctions in hopes of changing Iran's behavior through more \ncoercive diplomatic efforts.\n  Our legislation strengthens what has come to be known as the \n``pressure track.'' Today we must send a clear signal to Iran's leaders \nthat if they continue to defy the will of the international community, \nour Nation and other nations are prepared to confront them with tough \nnew sanctions. I believe that the administration shares this conviction \nand applaud their work with our allies to develop multilateral \nagreements on a powerful new set of sanctions, should ongoing \ndiplomatic efforts toward Iran fall short.\n  We must convince Iran's leaders that they face a clear choice. They \ncan end the suppression of their people, come clean on their nuclear \nprogram, suspend enrichment, and stop supporting terrorists around the \nworld. Or they can face sustained, progressively intensifying \nmultilateral economic and diplomatic pressure--including tougher \nsanctions--and deepen their international isolation. And if they \ncontinue to refuse, they will then face the unilateral sanctions \ncontained in this bill.\n\n  Our approach acknowledges the gross human rights abuses that Iran's \npeople continue to suffer at the hands of Iran's security forces and \nthe widening chasm that has opened between the regime and the people of \nIran, as we witnessed again recently in the violent reaction of \nsecurity forces to peaceful demonstrations. It contains a number of \nimportant human rights provisions, including Senator Schumer's measure \nto impose a sweeping ban on U.S. Govemment contracts on companies which \nprovide communications monitoring or jamming technology to the \ngovernment of Iran. Iran has reportedly expanded its monitoring and \nsuppression activities, employing them widely again this month. This \nbill makes clear that those who help Iran's government to suppress the \neveryday speech and internet communications of its people will be \npunished. That same point was made in the resolution adopted by the \nSenate just before Christmas, which I cosponsored, expressing our \nsupport for the human rights of the Iranian people. Senator McCain has \nalso raised with me today the prospect of his offering some additional \nhuman rights language, and I intend to work with him as we move toward \nconference on that issue.\n  Our bill also takes direct aim at Iran's illicit nuclear activities. \nIt is clear that Iran's leaders are beginning to feel the heat of \nincreased international pressure and the specter of biting sanctions, \nbut more must be done. Following its public disclosure, Tehran has \nprovided international inspectors with access to the nuclear site at \nQum, but has taken other steps to limit cooperation with the IAEA. \nIran's government had committed to sending most of its low-enriched \nuranium abroad for processing for medical purposes in October, but now \nrejects that approach and has decided to further provoke the \ninternational community by expanding its enrichment activities.\n  I suspect that only the prospect of intensified, sustained pressure \nby a coalition of countries will prompt these leaders to reconsider \ntheir position.\n  In order to maximize that pressure, just as we did last year, we have \nincorporated a number of ideas from our Senate colleagues into one \ncommittee bill.\n  Senators Bayh, Lieberman, and Kyl proposed penalties on companies \nthat support Iran's import of refined petroleum products or bolster its \ndomestic capacity.\n  Senators Brownback and Casey proposed authorizing state and local \ngovernments to divest from companies involved in critical business with \nIran.\n  As I mentioned, Senator Schumer proposed banning government contracts \nto firms that provide technology used by the Iranian regime to monitor \nor disrupt communications of its citizens with one another and the \noutside world.\n  Senator Menendez proposed targeting sanctions against Iran's \nRevolutionary Guard Corps, its affiliates and front organizations for \nsupporting terrorism and contributing to proliferation, and Senator \nJohanns pressed for renewed targeting of Iran's proxy Hezbollah in the \nsame way. Senator Bunning urged tighter reporting requirements on \nsanctions.\n  In addition, we have incorporated our own proposals to tighten our \ntrade embargo, enhance Treasury's mandate to freeze assets tied to \nterrorism and proliferation, crack down on the black market export of \ntechnology to the regime, expand the scope of other sanctions, and take \nother measures.\n  Madam President, instead of finalizing the preliminary agreement on \nlow-enriched uranium struck between Iranian negotiators and the P5 + 1 \ngroup in October, Iran's leadership now appears to have definitively \nrejected that offer, and has continued a pattern of belligerent \nbehavior that is almost certain to result in tougher sanctions being \nimposed soon.\n  While some have argued that increased economic sanctions are unlikely \nto change the behavior of Iran's leaders, I believe a comprehensive \napproach coordinated with our allies--including the Europeans, moderate \nArab states throughout the Middle East, India, and Russia and China who \nhold great sway with Iran's leaders--must contain a tough sanctions \ncomponent if it is to succeed. I recognize that sanctions alone are not \nsufficient, and that multilateral sanctions are likely to be more \neffective than those we impose unilaterally.\n  Sanctions must be used as effective leverage, undertaken as part of a \ncoherent, coordinated, comprehensive diplomatic and political strategy \nwhich tips the scale such that it is more beneficial for Iran to \nforswear its nuclear weapons ambitions and other behaviors that are \nundermining regional peace and stability.\n  We have worked closely with administration officials as we developed \nand refined this measure. They support much of what is in the bill. \nEven so, I recognize there are still some lingering concerns. Before we \nleft for the holidays, the State Department sent a letter to Foreign \nRelations Committee Chairman Kerry, describing some of these concerns. \nThey sought a general exemption from sanctions for companies from \ncountries that are closely cooperating with the U.S. on multilateral \nefforts on Iran, a mechanism which could provide an additional \nincentive for certain countries to work with us on imposing tougher \nsanctions. I am open to discussing such an incentive mechanism as we \nmove toward conference, as long as it would contain strict criteria for \nthe President to make a determination about what, precisely, \nconstitutes ``close cooperation.'' There have been a number of \ndiscussions in recent weeks on how to craft such an exception, and we \nhave made some progress. There are diplomatic efforts underway, led by \nthe U.S. and others, to achieve a united approach at the U.N. Security \nCouncil on sanctions. I believe we can come to some agreement with the \nother body, and with the administration, on the remaining issues on \nthis bill. I know that the administration shares our belief that we \nmust augment current economic sanctions, and will continue to work with \nus on an appropriate mix of pressure tools as this process moves \nforward and the final version of the bill is developed.\n  Madam President, ultimately, I expect that different layers of \nadditional sanctions--from the U.N. Security Council, from a U.S.-led \ncoalition of like-minded allies, and unilaterally from the U.S.--may \nprove necessary if we are to actually have a powerful effect on Iran's \nbehavior. And even then there are no guarantees that they will be \npersuaded to reverse course. I hope our legislation will complement and \nreinforce ongoing diplomatic efforts, and send a clear signal to Iran's \nleaders of\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\nwhat is in store if they continue to flout the will of the \ninternational community.\n  I am grateful to Senator Shelby and all of my colleagues on the \nBanking Committee, and those off the committee who have worked so hard \nin recent months to ensure that ours is a smart, targeted, yet \ncomprehensive approach to Iran policy. Overwhelming Senate support for \npassage of this bill will send a clear signal of our resolve to bring \nan end to Iran's illicit nuclear activities, as the President continues \nto build a broad coalition of nations who share our concerns about \nIran, and who are willing to join with us in imposing a tough, \ncomprehensive regime of new sanctions. I know there are still some \ndifferences to be worked out with the House version, which is less \ncomprehensive, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \ndevelop a final version that will enjoy broad bipartisan support within \nboth bodies, and the support of the President, as soon as possible. I \nthank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of \n     Iran and its support for international terrorism represent \n     threats to the security of the United States, its strong ally \n     Israel, and other allies of the United States around the \n     world.\n       (2) The United States and other responsible countries have \n     a vital interest in working together to prevent the \n     Government of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \n     capability.\n       (3) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly \n     called attention to Iran's illicit nuclear activities and, as \n     a result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted a \n     range of sanctions designed to encourage the Government of \n     Iran to cease those activities and comply with its \n     obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, \n     and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the \n     ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'').\n       (4) The serious and urgent nature of the threat from Iran \n     demands that the United States work together with its allies \n     to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.\n       (5) The United States and its major European allies, \n     including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have \n     advocated that sanctions be strengthened should international \n     diplomatic efforts fail to achieve verifiable suspension of \n     Iran's uranium enrichment program and an end to its illicit \n     nuclear activities.\n       (6) There is an increasing interest by States, local \n     governments, educational institutions, and private \n     institutions to seek to disassociate themselves from \n     companies that conduct business activities in the energy \n     sector of Iran, since such business activities may directly \n     or indirectly support the efforts of the Government of Iran \n     to achieve a nuclear weapons capability.\n       (7) Black market proliferation networks continue to \n     flourish in the Middle East, allowing countries like Iran to \n     gain access to sensitive dual-use technologies.\n       (8) The Government of Iran continues to engage in serious, \n     systematic, and ongoing violations of human rights and \n     religious freedom, including illegitimate prolonged \n     detention, torture, and executions. Such violations have \n     increased in the aftermath of the presidential election in \n     Iran on June 12, 2009.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nbill was passed and to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate just passed \nS. 2799, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and \nDivestment Act of 2009 and I thank Senators Dodd, Kerry, Shelby, \nLieberman, Bayh, Kyl and many others who have worked so hard to get \nthis important legislation passed.\n  I believe that passing this legislation is critical to send Iran the \nmessage that the United States is serious about keeping Iran from \nacquiring nuclear weapons capability. This legislation would impose new \nsanctions on Iran's refined petroleum sector and tighten existing U.S. \nsanctions in an effort to create new pressure on the Iranian regime and \nhelp stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  We have all watched the Iranian regime oppress its own people on the \nstreets of Iran. And we have watched them continue to defy the \ninternational community on nuclear issues.\n  That is why it is so important that we move this legislation forward \nquickly. I know that a number of Senators had concerns, or changes they \nwanted to make to this legislation, including Senator McCain, who has \nan amendment he wanted to offer on human rights on Iran. I am committed \nto working with him, and others, as we move forward in conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S332-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S332-S333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CITIZENS UNITED CASE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, last night, the President spoke about \nmany things. I would like to focus for a moment on one of them: his \ncomments related to the Supreme Court's recent decision in Citizens \nUnited vs. Federal Election Commission. This is an issue to which I \nhave devoted a great deal of time over the years, so I think it is \nimportant to set the record straight as to what the court did and did \nnot do in this very important, and in my view, correct ruling.\n  Here's what the President said:\n\n       Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to \n     open the floodgates for special interests--including foreign \n     corporations--to spend without limit in our elections.\n\n  That is what the President said last night.\n  Here is why he is wrong.\n  According to title 2 of U.S.C. Section 441e:\n  Foreign nationals, specifically defined to include foreign \ncorporations, are prohibited from ``directly or indirectly'' making ``a \ncontribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make \nan express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in \nconnection with a Federal, State or local election.''\n  The statute goes on to prohibit foreign corporations from making any \ncontribution or donation to any committee of any political party. \nForeign corporations are also prohibited from making any ``expenditure, \nindependent expenditure, or disbursement for an electioneering \ncommunication.''\n  None of these prohibitions were at issue in the Citizens United case.\n  In other words, foreign corporations were prohibited from \nparticipating in U.S. elections before the Citizens United decisions \nand they still are--unambiguously.\n  Let me make that perfectly clear: Citizens United did not change one \nthing in current law regarding the prohibition on foreign corporations \nengaging in U.S. elections. That law remains unchanged.\n  Further, the Federal Election Commission whom has been very clear in \ndefining this what this prohibition means.\n  Here's what the FEC's regulation states:\n\n       A foreign national shall not direct, dictate, control, or \n     directly or indirectly participate in the decision making \n     process of any person, such as a corporation, labor \n     organization, political committee, or political organization \n     with regard to such person's Federal or non-Federal election-\n     related activities, such as decisions concerning the making \n     of contributions, donations, expenditures, or disbursements \n     in connection with elections for any Federal, State, or local \n     office or decisions concerning the administration of a \n     political committee.\n\n  So the law on this matter is crystal clear. Contrary to what the \nPresident, and some of his surrogates in Congress say, foreign persons, \ncorporations, partnerships, associations, organizations or other \ncombination of persons are strictly prohibited from any participation \nin U.S. elections, just as they were prohibited before the Supreme \nCourt's Citizens United decision.\n  I have explained what the ruling did not do. Now let me explain what \nthe ruling did do.\n  The Court ruled unconstitutional sections of Federal law that barred \ncorporations and unions from spending their own money to express their \nviews about issues and candidates.\n  This was the right decision because democracy depends upon free \nspeech, not just for some but for all. As Justice Kennedy, writing for \nthe majority, concluded:\n\n       Under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than \n     fiction for our Government to make political speech a crime.\n\n  In Citizens United the Court ended the suppression of corporate and \nunion speech.\n  Another way to look at it is prior to Citizens United, if you were a \ncorporation that owned a media company you could say anything you \nwanted to 365\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\ndays a year without government interference. But if you were a \ncorporation or union that did not own a media company, you couldn't. \nAll this decision did was to level the playing field and strike an \nimportant blow for the first amendment and for free speech in our \ncountry, a decision that should be applauded by all, but at the very \nleast not misinterpreted.\n  (Mr. BURRIS assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S333-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S333-S334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the fourth \nbudget scorekeeping report for the 2010 budget resolution. The report, \nwhich covers fiscal year 2010, was prepared by the Congressional Budget \nOffice pursuant to section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended.\n  The report shows the effects of Congressional action through January \n25, 2010, and includes the effects of legislation since I filed my last \nreport for fiscal year 2010 on August 4, 2009. The new legislation \nincludes:\n  P.L. 111-47, an act making supplemental appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2009 for the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Program;\n  P.L. 111-68, an act making appropriations for the Legislative Branch \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes;\n  P.L. 111-69, the Fiscal Year 2010 Federal Aviation Administration \nExtension Act;\n  P.L. 111-80, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010;\n  P.L. 111-83, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, \n2010;\n  P.L. 111-84, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2010;\n  P.L. 111-85, the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2010;\n  P.L. 111-88, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 2010 and Further Continuing \nAppropriations, 2010;\n  P.L. 111-92, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act \nof 2009;\n  P.L. 111-96, an act to allow the funding for the interoperable \nemergency communications grant program established under the Digital \nTelevision Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to remain available \nuntil expended through fiscal year 2012, and for other purposes;\n  P.L. 111-115, the No Social Security Benefits for Prisoners Act of \n2009;\n  P.L. 111-117, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010;\n  P.L. 111-118, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010;\n  P.L. 111-124, an act to extend the Generalized System of Preferences \nand the Andean Trade Preference Act, and for other purposes; and\n  P.L. 111-126, an act to accelerate the income tax benefits for \ncharitable cash contributions for the relief of victims of the \nearthquake in Haiti.\n  The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are \nconsistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. \n13, the 2010 budget resolution.\n  The estimates show that for fiscal year 2010 current level spending \nis $17.9 billion below the level provided for in the budget resolution \nfor budget authority, while it is $5.6 billion above it for outlays. \nFor revenues, current level shows that $18.6 billion in room remains \nrelative to the budget resolution level.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and accompanying tables from \nCBO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2010.\n     Hon.

Although ARRA was designated as an emergency requirement, it is\n  now included as part of the current level amounts.\n\\2\\ Pursuant to section 403 of S. Con.

The amounts so designated for fiscal year 2010, which are not included in the current level\n  totals, are as follows:\n\n\n\n \n                                                          Budget authority       Outlays            Revenues\n \n    Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-32)                 17              7,064                 -2\n    An act making supplemental appropriations for                        0              2,000                 -3\n     fiscal year 2009 for the Consumer Assistance to\n     Recycle and Save Program (P.L. 111-47)............\n    Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010                  12,025             11,976             -4,470\n     (Division B of P.L. 111-118)......................\n                                                        --------------------------------------------------------\n      Total, amounts designated as emergency...........             12,042             21,040             -4,475\n \n\\3\\ At the direction of the Senate Committee on the Budget, Division B of the Department of Defense\n  Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-118) is considered authorizing legislation.\n\\4\\ For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the budget resolution\n  does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level\n  excludes these items.\n\\5\\ The estimate for P.L. 111-46, an act to restore the Highway Trust Fund, and for other purposes, does not\n  change current level totals. P.L. 111-46 appropriated $7 billion to the Highway Trust Fund. The enactment of\n  this legislation followed an announcement by the Secretary of Transportation on June 24, 2009, of an interim\n  policy to slow down payments to states from the Highway Trust Fund.

Mr. President, nearly 2 weeks ago we first witnessed the \ndevastation that came about as a result of the massive earthquake in \nHaiti. As millions of Americans watched the heart-wrenching scenes on \ntelevision, we united as a people to send millions of dollars and tons \nof supplies to the Haitian people through dozens of established and \nrespected relief organizations. Nonetheless, tens of thousands of \nHaitians remain displaced, without food or shelter, and many are still \nin need of urgent medical attention. I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of Penobscot Bay Medical Center, a small hospital in my home \nState of Maine, to bring help to the people of Haiti in this time of \ntragedy.\n  The Penobscot Bay Medical Center got its start as an 11-bed hospital \nin 1901. Known then as the Knox County General Hospital, the small \nfacility was run at that time by nine doctors. Over the years, the \nhospital had undergone renovations and grown into its present full-\nservice, 109-bed location. Penobscot Bay employs a medical staff of \nover 85 physicians, allowing the hospital to offer its patients an \nextensive range of specialty and subspecialty services.\n  The hospital was named to the 2008 Harvard Pilgrim Health Care \nHospital Honor Roll for being among the top 25 percent of acute care \nhospitals evaluated nationally by the health plan. Additionally, the \nMaine State Employee Health Commission has repeatedly recognized \nPenobscot Bay Medical Center as a tier 1 hospital, and the Maine\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nHealth Management Coalition's Pathways to Excellence Hospital \nMeasurement and Reporting Initiative has given the facility multiple \nblue ribbon awards based on its performance in a number of critical \nsafety and clinical quality areas.\n  Through the generosity of the hospital, three doctors--general \nsurgeon Douglas Cole, urologist Lars Ellison, and orthopedist Kevin \nOlehnik--departed Maine en route to Haiti last Wednesday. Having been \nto the Caribbean nation in the past, as part of a Notre Dame Haiti \nProgram trip in 2008, the doctors are all familiar with the people and \nplaces of Haiti. The Notre Dame Haiti Program, which is led by Father \nTom Streit of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, is dedicated to \nfighting lymphatic filariasis, a parasitic disease caused by \nmicroscopic, thread-like worms spread through infected mosquitoes. More \nthan 26 percent of the Haitian population has the disease, which is \nprevalent in the subtropical regions of Asia and Africa, as well as \nparts of the Caribbean. In fact, the doctors were set to return to \nHaiti in February to help dozens more people through the Notre Dame \nHaiti Program. Yet after hearing about the earthquake, the doctors \ndecided to fly to Haiti as quickly as possible to help with the ongoing \nrelief efforts. They are in the country for a week or two, helping \npeople with broken bones and performing other general surgeries. Their \ngenerosity is overwhelming, and it is a true testament to the \nmagnanimous spirit of the resolute people of Maine.\n  We are defined as a people by what we do in times of tragedy, and I \nam proud to say that these three Mainers have gone above and beyond \ntheir Hippocratic Oath to willingly put their lives on hold in order to \nhelp the less fortunate in Haiti. They are extraordinary examples of \nhow the American people time and again respond so charitably to the \nmisfortunes of others. I commend Drs. Cole, Ellison, and Olehnik for \ntheir selfless service to others in this time of catastrophe, and I \nthank everyone at Penobscot Bay Medical Center for the remarkable work \nthey do day in and day out to keep Mainers healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S335-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAMELA GAVIN\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Pamela Gavin, \nwho retires this week after serving as Superintendant of the Senate \nOffice of Public Records for 24 years.\n  In her service to the Senate, Pam has had the enormous responsibility \nof maintaining disclosure records under numerous laws, including those \nunder the Federal Election Campaign Act, the Ethics in Government Act, \nand the Lobbying Disclosure Act. Tens of thousands of new records a \nyear must be archived, adding to the already massive papers in this \ncollection, and Pam's stewardship has been impeccable.\n  I especially want to pay tribute today to Pam's contributions to the \nimplementation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. As the Committee on \nHomeland Security worked to draft expansive changes to the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act, which were included in the Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act of 2007, Pam provided indispensible technical expertise. \nAnd after the act was signed into law, she worked tirelessly to make \nsure its implementation was smooth. She has been the driving force \nbehind the development of an electronic filing system, providing \nguidance to the lobbying community to assist it in complying with the \nlaw, and ensuring access to researchers, reporters and the public.\n  Pam is someone who understands that we can increase accountability \nthrough transparency, and in pursuit of that goal she has been a model \nnot only for the Senate but for the entire government.\n  Those who have worked closely with Pam will miss her cheerful smile, \nher enthusiasm, and warm consideration of all her colleagues. Although \nshe is retiring, she will always be a dear member of the Senate \ncommunity, and I wish her and her family the very best as she embarks \non this new stage of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S335-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, this week marks the 65th anniversary of \nthe liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi concentration camp. It \nwas 65 years ago this week when the Soviet army entered Auschwitz and \nliberated more than 7,000 prisoners. It is estimated that a minimum of \n1.1 million people were murdered in the camp as part of the Nazis' \ndeliberate and systematic campaign to exterminate as many as 6 million \nEuropean Jews and Roma. Winston Churchill called it a ``crime that has \nno name.''\n  Stories from the survivors are a chilling reminder of the unspeakable \nhorrors that can be perpetrated by evil men when the forces of good are \nslow to respond. Some of these personal testimonies are preserved in \nmuseums around our Nation, including the U.S. Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum.\n  In 1948, the United Nations pledged in the Genocide Convention that \nthe horrors of the Holocaust would ``never again'' be repeated. Sadly, \nthis pledge has not been upheld. In Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Sudan \npeople have been murdered solely on the basis of their national, ethnic \nand religious affiliations.\n  I urge my colleagues and members of the international community to \nrenew our commitment to ``never again'' allow genocide to take place. I \nalso call upon the Obama administration to continue upholding our \npledge to protecting the personal freedoms of individuals around the \nglobe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S335-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              TRIBUTE TO NORTH DAKOTA'S ELECTRICAL LINEMEN\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish honor the brave crews \nof electrical line workers who helped restore power to thousands of \nNorth Dakotans.\n  Within the last week, severe weather hit the southwestern part of my \nState. These storms brought fierce winds, freezing rains, and \neventually blizzard conditions. Ice coated miles of power lines, \ncausing them to fail under the extra weight. Thousands of homes and \nbusinesses were left without electricity.\n  Severe weather is nothing new to North Dakotans. But living in a home \nwithout electricity during the depths of winter is an alarming \nprospect.\n  Thankfully, dedicated repair linemen immediately went to work. While \nI know these crews would tell me they are just doing their jobs, I \nthink it is important to step back at a time like this and recognize \nthe importance of their work. Repairing high-voltage power lines while \nbattling subzero temperatures and strong prairie winds is a downright \ndangerous job. But these repair linemen work tirelessly in adverse \nconditions because they know their fellow North Dakotans depend on \nthem.\n  Many people in my State still do not have access to power, but I know \nNorth Dakotans have enormous confidence in the ability of the repair \nlinemen to restore power in a swift manner. They have shown tremendous \nresolve throughout this situation, and I am proud to commend their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S335-4", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S335-S336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING RICKI CHANDRINOS\n\n Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, it isn't very often that we \nencounter an angel walking among us. However, Ms. Ricki Chandrinos was \nmost certainly that. She was a tireless advocate working on behalf of \nveterans in our community, and her commitment to them will not soon be \nforgotten.\n  It wasn't until the love of her life, John Chandrinos, her husband of \n35 years, began battling a terminal illness that she became \npassionately involved with the inner workings of the Veterans Affairs \nmedical system. She muddled through the bureaucratic red tape to ensure \nthat he received the care and benefits that he so richly deserved after \ndefending the freedoms of our country for so many years. Tragically, \nher husband lost his battle, but her passion for America's heroes \nremained.\n  After moving to Las Vegas, following the death of her husband, she \nfound her calling late in life. Ricki became deeply involved with the \nveterans living within her neighborhood, Siena. It is estimated that \nshe personally assisted about 500 of our Nation's most heroic citizens, \nbut she undoubtedly touched more hearts than that during her lifetime.\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\n  This extraordinary woman educated herself on VA policy in order to \nprovide the best assistance to these men and women and went so far as \nto accompany many of them to the VA to ensure that they were served as \nthoroughly as possible. However, she knew that this wasn't enough for \nher and that she could serve these veterans even more.\n  Ricki arranged for speakers from the VA, American Legion, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, State of Nevada, and others to address the members \nof the Siena Veterans Club. Ricki knew that she would not rest until \nshe had served the needs of these veterans, and serve them she did.\n  Ricki left this Earth for a place much better, but her time on Earth \nwas heaven-sent for all those whose lives she touched. She began her \nadvocacy by her husband's side, and she has finished this tireless \ncrusade to be by his side once again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S336-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL HERBERT J. CARLISLE\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to LTG Herbert \nJ. Carlisle, former Director of Legislative Liaison for Office of the \nSecretary of the Air Force and the current Commander of 13th Air Force, \nHickam Air Force Base, HI. A command pilot with more than 3,400 flying \nhours in the T-38, AT-38, YF-110, YF-113, and F-15 Eagle, LTG ``Hawk'' \nCarlisle has commanded at the squadron, group, wing, and now Numbered \nAir Force levels. He has participated in Operations Restore Hope, \nProvide Comfort, and Noble Eagle, and his selection to lieutenant \ngeneral and commander of the Jungle Air Force is a testament to his \nexceptional airmanship, leadership, and judgment.\n  General Carlisle graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1978 \nand was selected to attend pilot training at Williams Air Force Base, \nAZ. He excelled in pilot training and was selected to fly the Air \nForce's premier air superiority fighter, the F-15 Eagle. Stationed at \nBittburg Air Base, Germany, with the 525th Fighter Squadron, the \nBulldogs, during the heart of the Cold War, then-Captain Carlisle again \nexcelled in the air and on the ground as a pilot, flight lead, \ninstructor pilot, and examiner pilot. His prowess in the air earned him \na selection to attend the Air Force's Fighter Weapons School, and upon \ncompletion of the course he joined an elite team of fighter weapons \nschool instructors. He became the chief of weapons and tactics at \nHolloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, only to be brought back to \nNellis Air Force Base to become part of a recently declassified Air \nForce training program in which he flew Soviet fighters as adversaries \nagainst U.S. pilots to increase their capability and survivability in \ncombat. Selected for promotion, Major Carlisle departed Nellis Air \nForce base for Maxwell Air Force Base, AL, to attend Air Command and \nStaff College and then deployed to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the chief \nof air operations, U.S. Central Command Forward from 1991 to 1993.\n  In 1993, now-Lieutenant Colonel Carlisle returned to the F-15 Eagle, \nas operations officer of the 19th Fighter Squadron and then commander \nof the 54th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. Following \ncommand, Lieutenant Colonel Carlisle attended Army War College in 1996, \nwas selected for promotion to colonel, and returned to the Pacific in \nthe F-15 Eagle as the Deputy Commander, 18th Operations Group at Kadena \nAir Base, Japan. Following Kadena, Colonel Carlisle was selected to \ncommand the 1st Operations Group at Langley Air Force Base, VA, then \nthe 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, and finally, after a \nshort staff tour, the 3rd Wing at Elmendorf Air Force Base.\n  General Carlisle has served several tours on the Air Staff to include \nchief of the plans and programs directorate, director of the \noperational planning, policy and strategy, deputy chief of staff for \nair, space and information operations, plans and requirements, and two \ntours in the Legislative Liaison Division, as deputy director and \ndirector. It was in these positions that I witnessed firsthand General \nCarlisle's adept ability to handle a myriad of complex issues that \ndirectly impacted our national security. General Carlisle's engagement \nwith Congress during his tenure as both deputy director and director of \nthe Legislative Liaison Division was faultless.\n  Under General Carlisle's leadership, the Air Force developed a \ncomprehensive congressional notification plan, ensuring timely and \naccurate passage of information on the Air Force's most difficult \nissues including the $40 billion KC-X acquisition program, creation of \nAir Force Cyber Command, force structure changes, and creation of Air \nForce Global Strike Command. General Carlisle prepared over 200 \nannouncements to the Hill, cleared of over 500 witness statements, \ntranscripts, inserts, and questions for the record through the Office \nof the Secretary of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget, \nand managed over 1,000 Congressional travel events to all 7 continents \nincluding 100 congressional Member visits to the Central Command Area \nof Responsibility. Finally, General Carlisle led the drive for what I \nconsider the Air Force's most pressing issue: recapitalization. Through \nGeneral Carlisle's leadership, the Air Force secured a budget of $1.7 \nbillion for bomber and air-to-ground weapons, yielded $8.2 billion for \nfighter and munitions programs, and laid the foundation for $200 \nmillion in supplemental munitions funding. The leadership, insight, and \ndedication of General Carlisle have been instrumental in building \nlasting and trusting relationships with the U.S. Congress, resulting in \nan overall increase in U.S. national security.\n  The breadth and depth of General Carlisle's assignments and the \nprofessionalism with which he has carried them out reflect a keen \nintellect and an unrivaled grasp of national security policies \ndeveloped through both personal experience and academic instruction. \nGeneral Carlisle earned a master's degree in business administration \nfrom Golden Gate University in San Francisco, attended the National \nSecurity Management Course at Syracuse University, the Seminar XXI--\nInternational Relations programs at Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, and the Executive Course on National and International \nSecurity at George Washington University. While he has received many \ndistinguished awards and decorations, it is General Carlisle's \ncommitment and sacrifice to this Nation that make him stand out among \nhis peers.\n  Today, General Carlisle is once again at the tip of the spear, \nleading our service men and women as commander of 13th Air Force, \ncommander of Joint Task Force--Support Forces Antarctica, Operation \nDeep Freeze, and the Pacific Command's Joint Forces Air Component \ncommander. On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I \nthank Lieutenant General Carlisle, his wife Gillian, and their daughter \nSummer for their continued commitment, sacrifice, and contribution to \nthis great Nation. I congratulate Lieutenant General Carlisle on his \nrecent promotion to lieutenant general and wish him Godspeed as he \nleads our military in protecting this great nation and its way of \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S336-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S336-S337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DAVE DEDRICK\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the life \nand career of Dave Dedrick, most well known for his role as Captain 11, \na children's television program in the upper Midwest. He passed away on \nJanuary 22 after a lifetime of bringing together South Dakotans of all \nages. Dave's welcoming spirit and warm heart touched children and \nadults alike.\n  The Captain 11 Show, broadcasted from 1955 through 1996, is the \nlongest running children's program ever. Dave, dressed in a blue and \nyellow pilot's uniform, led a program filled with cartoons and games. \nCaptain 11 had the ability to control time through his Time Converter \nand ended every show with Freezeburg, a dance the audience, and \neveryone watching at home, knew by heart. Dave always made children of \nall ages feel comfortable, and with his show, unified generations of \nSouth Dakotans.\n  Dave was inducted into the South Dakota Broadcasters Hall of Fame in \n1997 and the South Dakota Hall of Fame in 1999. His set is displayed in \nthe State Historical Museum in Pierre, representing the important role \nDave played in so many lives. On air and off, his friendly personality \nextended to all areas of his life, representing South Dakota values in \nall he did. I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to his family \non their loss.\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S337-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM OUELLETTE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nFederal service of William ``Will'' Ouellette of Rapid City, SD. Mr. \nOuellette is concluding a dozen years of service in South Dakota and is \ntransferring to Pennsylvania to continue his Federal service career, \nwhich now spans 34 years with the Social Security Administration.\n  Mr. Ouellette began his career with the agency in 1976 as a claims \nrepresentative in the Boston Region. Three years later, he moved to \nBillings, MT, where he served as a claims representative, field \nrepresentative, operations analyst and operations supervisor for the \nagency. He was promoted to manager of the Rapid City office in 1998 and \nhas continued in that position until the present time. He will soon \ntransfer to a similar position in the Pottsville, PA, agency office to \nbe closer to aging parents and a daughter.\n  I have appreciated the management work of Mr. Ouellette over his \ntenure in Rapid City.

Mr. President, the Office of Rural Development \nwithin the U.S. Department of Agriculture will say farewell to a \ndedicated colleague and friend later this week. Frank J. Tuma, Director \nof Community Programs for the Agency in Michigan, is retiring after 37 \ndedicated years of public service, and I am delighted to have an \nopportunity to recognize this significant milestone.\n  Frank began his Federal career with the Peace Corp and spent 2 years \nin the Philippines. He later accepted a position with the Farmers Home \nAdministration, which would become the Office of Rural Development, \nwhere he has served the interests of rural Michigan for 31 years as \npart of the Community Programs Division. Throughout Frank's 31 years, \nhe has consistently provided invaluable guidance and leadership on \ncountless issues and projects. During the past 5 years, Frank has \nserved as the Director of Community Programs, where he has led efforts \nto bring critical funding to rural communities across Michigan. \nCountless communities now have safe drinking water and efficient waste \nwater systems that protect the environment due to the efforts of Frank \nand his team.\n  Those who have worked with Frank describe him as devoted, loyal, and \npassionate about his work and the people with which he works, qualities \nthat will surely be missed by his colleagues and friends. Beyond his \npersonal qualities, he has distinguished himself through a number of \nimpressive accomplishments and has served as a mentor to many on his \nstaff. The Rural Development National Office has turned to Frank many \ntimes over the years for his input and recommendations on new processes \nand systems. He was instrumental in creating, testing, and implementing \nthe CPAP System, a computer program that compiles data and underwrites \nloans and grants for water and sewer projects.\n  I am proud to join citizens and communities across rural Michigan in \nthanking Frank Tuma for his dedication, focus, and persistent efforts \nas a Federal employee. Frank has forged a wonderful legacy, and I know \nhe and Connie are looking forward to many years together in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S337-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF DELTA TRUST BANK\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this year marks the 100th \nanniversary of a landmark institution in my home State of Arkansas. On \nFebruary 1, Delta Trust & Bank will celebrate 100 years of service in \nour State. In honor of this milestone, the towns of Parkdale, Hamburg, \nWilmot, Little Rock, and Bella Vista will proclaim Monday, February 1, \nas Delta Trust Day. At a time when many banks across our Nation are \nstruggling, Delta Trust represents a long history of financial strength \nand security in Arkansas.\n  Founded as The Bank of Parkdale in 1910, Delta Trust's origins lie in \nthe small town of Parkdale in Southern Arkansas. Parkdale is similar in \nmany ways to my hometown of Helena, where faith, community, and family \nare an integral part of rural life. These values have stayed with Delta \nTrust throughout its 100-year history.\n  Delta Trust touches every corner of our State, with branches in \nnorthwest Arkansas in Bella Vista and Fayetteville; in central Arkansas \nin the Little Rock neighborhoods of Hillcrest, Chenal, and Walton \nHeights; and in the southeast part of the state in Parkdale, Hamburg, \nEudora, and Wilmot.\n  Delta Trust's assets are impressive at $298 million. But this \ninstitution is about much more than assets or the bottom line. Delta \nTrust is known for its commitment to community service, not to mention \nits top-notch customer service. Integrity, privacy, and intelligent \nadvice are the trademarks of Delta Trust. Through its Women's Advisory \nCouncil, Delta Trust has committed to serving the banking needs of \nwomen, their families, and their businesses.\n  Mr. President, I salute the partners, associates, and employees of \nDelta Trust for their dedication to serving the people of Arkansas. I \nsend my best wishes for the next 100 years of service to \nArkansans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S337-4", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:36 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3726.

A bill to exempt aliens who are admitted as refugees or \ngranted asylum and are employed overseas by the Federal Government from \nthe 1-year physical presence requirement for adjustment of status to \nthat of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. \n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I introduce today the Refugee Opportunity \nAct, legislation that corrects an unfortunate limitation under current \nlaw. I thank Senator Lugar for joining me in support of this \nlegislation. The immigration statute requires a refugee who is \nresettled in the United States to remain on U.S. soil for a full year \nbefore adjusting to lawful permanent residence. For many, this \nrequirement offers no obstacles. The majority of resettled refugees \nimmediately begin to work, learn English, and contribute to their local \ncommunities. Yet the 1-year physical presence requirement poses a \nsignificant barrier to resettled refugees who are eager and willing to \nserve the U.S. Government overseas. If they do, they lose that \nsettlement. We can correct that.\n  One of the tragic legacies of the war in Iraq is the humanitarian \ncrisis that grew out of the conflict, in which millions of people have \nbeen displaced both internally and externally, and in which many others \nhave been killed in horrific acts of political and religious \npersecution. Violent reprisals, kidnappings, and bombings were \ncommitted during the insurgency that rose up after May 2003, when \nPresident Bush declared the end of major combat operations. Diplomatic \nand military efforts to quell the insurgency and bring order to Iraq \nwere aided by many brave Iraqi citizens, who, at great risk to \nthemselves and their families, assisted the United States as \ninterpreters or in other capacities. These individuals took such risks \nknowing the dangers they faced, and many lost their lives.\n  In 2007, I worked with Senator Ted Kennedy to enact legislation to \nprovide special visas for Iraqi interpreters who had assisted the \nUnited States in Iraq and who wished to resettle in the United States \nto escape the grave dangers they faced as a result of their cooperation \nwith our government. I was proud to join Senator Kennedy in that \neffort. The enactment of that legislation made clear our commitment to \naiding those who had assisted the United States with the critical \nmission in Iraq. It was the right thing to do.\n  In 2008, I joined Senator Schumer in sponsoring the Military \nPersonnel Citizenship Processing Act. This legislation removed \nbureaucratic barriers to becoming U.S. citizens for immigrants serving \nin our military. Congress enacted this legislation to recognize the \ncontributions of immigrants who serve the United States and to fulfill \nmany soldiers' dreams of becoming U.S. citizens. Also in 2008, I worked \nwith Senator Mikulski to enact the complementary Kendell Frederick \nCitizenship Assistance Act, a bill that made the pathway to citizenship \nfor immigrants serving in the military simpler and more efficient. \nCongress has spoken consistently in favor of recognizing the value of \nimmigrants and refugees who embrace the United States through service \nto their adopted Nation.\n  Today I introduce the Refugee Opportunity Act, legislation that \nbuilds upon this strong commitment by correcting an unfortunate \nlimitation under current law. I thank Senator Lugar for joining me in \nsupport of this legislation. The immigration statute requires a refugee \nwho is resettled in the United States to remain on U.S. soil for a full \nyear in order to adjust to lawful permanent residence. For many, this \nrequirement presents no obstacles. The majority of resettled refugees \nimmediately begin to work, learn English, and contribute to their local \ncommunities. The 1-year physical presence requirement poses a \nsignificant barrier to resettled refugees who are eager and willing to \nserve the U.S. Government overseas, whether as an engineer, a \ntranslator, or in some other meaningful capacity. Accepting such \nemployment will result in the delay of a refugee's ability to adjust \nhis or her status and fully integrate into our society. There is no \nlogical reason to deter these refugees from taking U.S.-affiliated \npositions overseas, especially when they seek to serve the government \nthat has offered them protection.\n  One example of such a case can be found in the story of Mr. Ahmed \nAlrais. Mr. Alrais came to the United States as a refugee with his \nfamily after he worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq. His \nwork for the Army led to threats against his life, and the United \nStates appropriately granted him refugee status. But then, after \nstruggling to find work in the Chicago area and wanting to provide for \nhis family, Mr. Alrais decided to again face the risks of working in \nIraq. He joined the staff of a U.S. Army contractor and began to work \non a military base in Iraq. Ironically, taking this risk has delayed \nhis ability to earn lawful permanent residence in the United States \nbecause the Department of Homeland Security will not give him credit \ntoward the 1 year physical presence requirement for the time he has \nspent working with the Army contractor in Iraq. If he had remained in \nthe United States for a full year unemployed, he would not have been \npenalized under the immigration law. By choosing to work, to support \nhis family, and serve our Nation's military effort in Iraq, he has \nsacrificed months toward obtaining a green card.\n  To recognize the past and future contributions of refugees like Mr. \nAlrais, this legislation proposes to create an exception in our \nimmigration law to waive the continuous presence requirement for any \nrefugee who, during their first year of residence in the United States, \naccepts employment overseas to aid the U.S. Government. This \nlegislation will not only recognize the commendable actions of refugees \nwho wish to honor the United States by working for our government \noverseas, it will also enrich our government's military and diplomatic \nmissions by drawing upon the professional and language skills of \nrefugees. Finally, this bill will encourage more refugees to assist the \nU.S. efforts abroad. These are goals we should all support.\n  Our refugee policies have long been a beacon of hope and promise to \nmany around the world. This legislation is the beginning of a renewed \neffort to improve and modernize our refugee policies to adapt to our \nchanging world. March 17 will mark the 30th anniversary of the \nenactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, a law originally introduced by \nSenator Kennedy, a champion of refugees and asylum seekers. I intend to \nintroduce legislation this year to mark that important anniversary. In \nthe coming weeks, I will introduce a bill to enhance protections by \nbringing our refugee and asylum laws up to date. This comprehensive \nrefugee package will also build on legislation I introduced in the \n106th and 107th Congresses, the Refugee Protection Act. I will speak in \ngreater detail on this comprehensive refugee protection package in the \ncoming weeks.\n  There is no reason to delay introduction of the bill I offer today, \nhowever. In 2007, Congress recognized the value and the bravery of \nthose refugees who assisted us in Iraq, and once we pledge American \nprotection, we must follow through with that promise. The circumstances \nof Mr. Alrais and his family demonstrate the grave inequity that \nresults from current law. They escaped from tyranny and won protection \nhere in the United States. They hope to build a safe and stable life in \nour country. They will contribute to our communities, educate their \nchildren, and become entwined in the fabric of the United States. And \nthe evidence of such dreams is already seen in the actions of this \nfamily. Mr. Alrais' wife, Nada Alkhaddar, helps other refugees adjust \nto life in Chicago under the auspices of a nonprofit community \norganization. Mr. Alrais' 17-year-old son plays football at his Chicago \nhigh school and recently told a reporter that he wants to become a \nChicago policeman the embodiment of the public servant ``for America,'' \nhe said.\n  I urge all Senators to join me in supporting the Refugee Opportunity \nAct, a sensible, appropriate, and overdue modification to our \nimmigration law.\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2962. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to apply \nan earnings test in determining the amount of monthly insurance \nbenefits for individuals entitled to disability insurance benefits \nbased on blindness; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator John McCain, to reintroduce legislation on an issue we have \nworked on together for over a decade. The Blind Persons Return to Work \nAct of 2010 will renove disincentives to work for blind individuals in \nthe Social Security Disability Insurance, SSDI, program. Removal of \nthese barriers will facilitate the transition of blind Americans from \nSSDI to income-earning, taxpaying, productive members of the American \nworkforce.\n  Today there are over 1.3 million Americans who are legally blind and \nan estimated 10 million Americans with visual impairments. The \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and advances in technology have \neliminated many barriers for blind individuals. Today blind individuals \nare employed in nearly every type of job and profession. They lead \nbusinesses and governments. Time and again, they have proven they are \nmore than capable. Yet, societal misperceptions, attitudes, and \nbarriers persist. Unfortunately, more than 70 percent of working-age \nblind individuals remain unemployed. This is an enormous untapped \nresource of skills and talents for our country, and it is simply \nunacceptable.\n  One thing is clear: blind individuals want to work. I don't know how \nyou put a price tag on the personal value of work. The dignity it \nprovides is priceless. There are many challenges to increasing the \nemployment rate of blind individuals. However, one common sense step we \nshould take is to correct unintended disincentives and barriers within \nour SSDI program.\n  Within the SSDI program are earnings limits for beneficiaries. \nHistorically, there was a longstanding linkage between the treatment of \nearnings for blind individuals and seniors. In 1996, Congress passed \nthe Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act. This legislation was adopted \nto encourage seniors to continue working later in life. While it \nsignificantly reduced restrictions on earnings for seniors, it created \ndisparities for individuals who are blind. My friend from Arizona and I \nhave worked tirelessly since then to correct this issue of fairness.\n  The Blind Persons Return to Work Act will replace the monthly \nearnings limit for individuals who are blind with a gradual phase-out, \nallowing blind individuals to systematically replace benefits with \nearned income. Under the current system, if a blind person earns just \none single dollar over the limit, they lose their entire SSDI benefit. \nClearly, this is a drastic reduction in income and disincentive to work \nand earn to the fullest potential. Instead of this ``cash cliff,'' our \nlegislation will gradually reduce benefits by $1 for every $3 earned \nover the limit. It also establishes annual versus monthly earnings \ntests and a standard deduction for impairment-related work expenses, \nchanges that will reduce administrative burdens for both blind \nindividuals and the Social Security Administration.\n  As we work to turn our economy around, the Federal Government should \ndo everything within its power to support all Americans in returning to \nwork. I urge my colleagues to join us in sponsoring this common sense \napproach of removing barriers to employment for blind Americans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague, \nSenator Dodd, in introducing an important piece of legislation that \nwill have an enormously positive impact on and improve the lives of \nblind Americans in the workforce. For too long, capable and talented \nblind Americans who have the desire and ability to fully participate in \nthe workforce have been discouraged from doing so because of outdated \nfederal disability laws.\n  Current law stifles earnings opportunities for blind individuals by \ncancelling all disability assistance for the first dollar of earnings \nover the government-set threshold. As a result, blind individuals \ncovered by Social Security Disability Insurance, SSDI, which was \ncreated to provide security and stability to blind workers during \nperiods of unemployment, are discouraged from expanding their \nemployment opportunities beyond the earnings limitation for fear of \nsuddenly losing their benefits.\n  Senator Dodd and I have been longtime supporters of legislation that \nwould increase the earnings limit for those covered by SSDI. A similar \npolicy was enacted for senior citizens with the adoption of the Senior \nCitizens Freedom to Work Act. The act eliminated the earnings limit for \ncertain seniors covered by Social Security and thereby encouraged more \nseniors to participate in the workforce.\n  The current proposal, the Blind Persons Return to Work Act, is an \nimprovement on past policy proposals focusing on modestly increasing \nthe earnings limit. Rather than simply increasing the earnings limit \nfor blind individuals, the act would allow for a gradual phase-out of \nFederal benefits for every $3 earned over the current limit, providing \nblind individuals the opportunity to increase their earnings as the \nSSDI benefit decreases.\n  The unemployment rate for working-age blind people is currently 70 \npercent. Many of these individuals are extremely talented and capable \nof fully contributing to the workforce, and we should provide them an \nincentive to reach their full potential while reducing the number of \nfederal beneficiaries. The proposal will ease the transition from \nrelying solely upon SSDI benefits to becoming active and productive \nmembers of the workforce.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Blind Americans \nReturn to Work Act, to treat blind individuals fairly and to allow them \nto achieve increased financial independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 2963. A bill to designate certain land in the State of Oregon as \nwilderness, to provide for the exchange of certain Federal land and \nnon-Federal land, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce new Wilderness \nlegislation to protect two of Oregon's natural treasures. But, this \nbill will do even more than that. It will also help Oregon's economy, \nbecause visitors from all over the world come to our State to \nexperience first-hand the unique scenic beauty of place like the lands \npreserved by this bill.\n  The legislation I introduce today with my colleague Senator Merkley--\nthe Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven Wilderness Act of 2010--will \nconsolidate what is currently a splintered ownership of land in this \narea and protect 16,477 acres of new Wilderness along the Lower John \nDay River. The fractured land ownership in this area makes it difficult \nfor visitors to fully appreciate these areas when they hike, fish or \nhunt there because of the scattered and misunderstood lines of private \nand public ownership. This bill will solve that problem and make these \nlands more inviting to visitors while giving the landowners more \ncontiguous property to call home.\n  The area in question is stunning. The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven \nWilderness proposals encompass dramatic basalt cliffs and rolling hills \nof juniper, sagebrush and native grasses. These new areas build on the \ndesert Spring Basin Wilderness that was established last year as a \nresult of legislation I introduced, and are located directly across the \nJohn Day River from Spring Basin.\n  With 500 miles of undammed waters, the John Day River is the second-\nlongest free-flowing river in the continental U.S. and is a place that \nis cherished by Oregonians. The Lower John Day Wild and Scenic River \noffers world-class opportunities for outdoor recreation as well as \ncrucial wildlife habitat for elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep and native \nfish such as salmon and steelhead trout. Through land consolidation \nbetween public and private landowners, this bill will allow for better \nmanagement and easier public access for this important natural \ntreasure. With the current fragmentation of public and private land \nownership in the area, river campsites are limited. Many federal lands \namong them can't be reached by the hikers, campers and other outdoors \nrecreationists who could most appreciate them. With the\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\nequal-value land exchanges included in this bill, public lands would be \nconsolidated into two new Wilderness areas. This would enhance public \nsafety, improve land management, and increase public access and \nrecreational opportunities. This solution will create an incredible, \nnew heritage for public lands recreationists who are an important \nfactor in keeping Oregon's economy healthy and thriving.\n  Rafters of the John Day River can attest to the need for more \ncampsites and public access to the Cathedral Rock area. Backcountry \nhunters will be able to scan the hillsides for elk, deer and game-birds \nwithout having to worry about accidentally trespassing on someone's \nprivate land. Anglers will be able to access nearly 5 miles of the John \nDay River that today are only reachable from privately owned lands. \nLikewise, such a solution ensures that local landowners can manage \ntheir lands effectively without running across unwitting trespassers.\n  One good example of the value of these land swaps is Young Life's \nWashington Family Ranch. This Ranch is home to a Christian youth camp \nthat welcomes over 20,000 kids to the lower John Day area each year. \nThis bill sets out private and public land boundaries that can clearly \nbe seen on the ground and create a safer area for campers on the Ranch; \nthis serves the children who visit the area well and ensures the \ncontinued viability of the Ranch, which, in turn, provides big economic \ndividends to the local community.\n  The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven Wilderness proposal is described \nas ``win-win-win'' by many stakeholders--nearly five miles of new river \naccess for the public and 18,000 acres of protected wild land for \noutdoor enthusiasts; better management for private landowners and \npublic agencies; and important habitat protections for sensitive and \nendangered species. This proposal is an example of the positive \nsolutions that can result when varied, bipartisan interests in a \ncommunity come together to craft solutions that will work for everyone. \nAll three of the counties involved in this legislation, Wheeler, Wasco \nand Jefferson, have endorsed this proposal as well as a number of user \nand recreation groups. I especially want to thank the Oregon Natural \nDesert Association, Young Life and Forrest Reinhardt, and Matt Smith \nfor their role in developing this collaborative solution that will \nbenefit all Oregonians.\n  Oregon's wildlands play an increasingly important role in the \neconomic development of our State, especially in traditionally rural \nareas east of the Cascades. Visitors come from thousands of miles away \nto hike, fish, raft and hunt in Oregon's desert Wilderness. Beyond \ntourism, the rich quality of life and the diverse natural amenities \nthat we enjoy as Oregonians are key to attracting new businesses to \nOregon. The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven Wilderness areas will help \nmake sure that this rural area will enjoy the benefits that permanently \nconnecting these disparate pieces of natural landscape will bring for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII, XIX, and XXI of the Social \nSecurity Act to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse under Medicare, \nMedicaid, and CHIP, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 2009 the Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP \nprograms accounted for over $800 billion of the $2.3 trillion spent on \nhealth care in the U.S. Together, these programs constitute around 35 \npercent of national health spending. With so much taxpayer money at \nstake, it is no surprise that all this spending brings crooks, scam \nartists and even organized crime out of the woodwork.\n  Low estimates are that fraudsters steal $60 billion from the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs every year. As Federal health care spending \ncontinues to skyrocket, so will the dollars lost to fraud, waste and \nabuse.\n  This is a crime against not only the taxpayer, but against each and \nevery beneficiary who depends on these programs for their health care. \nThe examples of fraud are all around us. In a 60 Minutes segment late \nlast year, we saw a medical supply company that billed Medicare $2 \nmillion last July--despite being empty and having apparently no staff.\n  One man interviewed said he was waking up every day making $20,000-\n$40,000. Every single day. He said it was like winning the lottery, and \nyou and me and every taxpayer were footing the bill. He was running a \nfake medical supply company that didn't actually sell any medical \nequipment to anyone. He says he stole at least $20 million from \nMedicare. He said it was, ``real easy.''\n  This must change.\n  I don't think Members on either side of the aisle dispute this. Back \nwhen health care reform was a bipartisan endeavor, I developed a set of \nlegislative proposals with Senator Baucus to combat fraud, waste and \nabuse. These proposals are in the bill that the Finance Committee \nreported as well as the health care reform bill that the Senate passed \nlate last year. And these provisions did not draw opposition from \neither side of the aisle. Tackling fraud, waste and abuse in health \ncare is one of the areas where there is widespread agreement.\n  That is why I am here today to introduce the Strengthening Program \nIntegrity and Accountability in Health Care Act. This legislation \nincludes the critical measures that I developed on a bipartisan basis. \nThis bill also includes legislation and amendments I have subsequently \nintroduced to strengthen these proposals to address fraud, waste and \nabuse.\n\n  They are designed to deter, detect and prevent those that would steal \nfrom Federal health care programs, to assist those tasked with catching \nthese criminals, and to protect taxpayer dollars. These commonsense \nchanges will go a long way in helping to make sure Medicare, Medicaid \nand CHIP dollars are going to bona fide providers, instead of \nfraudsters set on scamming the system.\n  This legislation would make it harder for fraudsters to enroll in \nFederal health programs as providers and bilk the system. This includes \nrequiring meaningful screening of health care providers and suppliers. \nAdditional tools would also be provided to prevent fraud, waste and \nabuse including enhanced oversight measures, disclosure requirements, \nauthority to impose enrollment moratoriums and requirements for \ndeveloping compliance programs.\n  This bill would impose additional requirements on providers and \nsuppliers to ensure that bona fide providers are billing Federal health \nprograms for bona fide items and services. This includes providing \ndocumentation or performing a face-to-face evaluation before certifying \na beneficiary's eligibility for an item or service.\n  It would also improve Federal monitoring for fraud, waste and abuse \nby requiring better data sharing and data\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\naccess across the Federal government. Government agencies would be able \nto share information with each other in an effort to identify crooks in \nthe system promptly. It would also create a national clearinghouse of \ninformation so we can better detect and prevent and thereby deter \nmedical identity theft. Again, this is about the Federal Government \nsharing information it already has in ways that protect the Taxpayer \nand work against those defrauding the system and hopefully deter those \nwho are thinking about stealing from you.\n  The legislation takes several steps to end the current ``pay and \nchase'' model of Federal health care spending. It takes the commonsense \napproach of allowing the government to withhold taxpayer dollars from \nthose under investigation for health care fraud.\n  It would change Federal laws that require Medicare to pay providers \nquickly, regardless of the risk of fraud, waste, or abuse. Under \ncurrent law, the government is required to make payment for a ``clean'' \nclaim within 14 to 30 days before interest accrues on the claim. That \nis not enough time for the limited number of Medicare auditors to \ndetermine if the claim is legitimate before the payment has to be made. \nThe result is that this ``prompt payment rule'' requires that Medicare \npay fraudsters first, and ask questions later.\n  This requirement doesn't make any sense. This bill would give the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services the authority to ask questions \nfirst and then and only then to make the payment if the health care \nprovider and the payment for services check out. The Secretary would \nalso be required to suspend payments pending the investigation of \ncredible allegations of fraud against the provider or supplier.\n  This legislation would also increase funding for those fighting \nhealth care fraud. Study after study has shown that every dollar spent \nfighting health care fraud is repaid multiple times over in funds \nrecovered and fraud prevented. This is a good investment for the \ntaxpayer and bad news for health care fraudsters.\n  This bill would provide powerful disincentives for those that would \nrob the taxpayer through health care fraud. It would better arm those \nfighting fraud with tools to catch and prosecute fraudsters. It also \nwould make the consequences for committing health care fraud more \nmeaningful by increasing civil monetary penalties and expanding the \ntypes of acts and omissions that would be subject to civil monetary \npenalties and exclusion from Federal health programs.\n  This legislation would also strengthen the government's most powerful \ntool for preventing and recovering taxpayer dollars lost to fraud, the \nFalse Claims Act. It also ensures that courageous whistleblowers that \ncome forward to speak up against fraud and file False Claims Act cases \nare protected from retaliation by their employers.\n  These changes would go a long way to deter those who would defraud \nour health care programs. It also would provide greater protections to \nthe taxpayer. In these difficult economic times, we have got to do \neverything we can to protect taxpayer dollars and the resources of \nhealth care programs on which so many Americans depend.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 2967. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable credit for small business job growth, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Boosting \nEntrepreneurship and New Jobs Act that I believe is desperately needed. \nI think it is very clear that our economy, which is coming out of the \nworst recession since the Great Depression, has turned a corner. But we \nneed to create more jobs in America. We know that. We know that 1 out \nof 10 Americans who wish to work cannot find jobs. Our first \nresponsibility must be to help create more jobs so our economy can \nrebound and grow. To do that, we need to invest in small businesses.\n  I was pleased to hear the President of the United States last night \ntalk about the importance of small business in our recovery. As we \ndevelop our policies, we need to focus on helping small businesses \ngrow. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we took action and \nincreased the loan limits under the Small Business Administration. We \nwere able to make it less expensive for businesses to borrow from the \nSmall Business Administration. These were good steps we took. I was \nproud of an amendment I offered to increase the surety bond limits so \nsmall construction companies could, in fact, get work in this economy. \nI was proud of the amendment that passed to increase the SBA's budget \nby about $180 million so they could have the capacity to help small \ncompanies with technical assistance in order to get government jobs. \nAll of that has happened.\n  We all know 99.7 percent of all firms in America are small \nbusinesses. That is the economic engine of America. Just over half of \nthe private sector employees work for small companies. We have to pay \nattention to small companies if we are going to grow out of this \neconomic problem. Forty-four percent of the total U.S. private payroll \ncomes from small employers. Sixty-four percent of the net new jobs over \nthe past 15 years came from small businesses. And 97.3 percent of all \nidentified exporters came from small companies. On a per-employee \nbasis, for those companies that applied for patents, small companies \nhave 13 times more patents per employee than larger companies. That is \nwhere innovation comes from in New Hampshire, and I can tell my \ncolleagues that in Maryland, I look at companies every day, small \ncompanies coming up with the innovations that will lead America into \nthe future. They come up with the new ways to deal with our problems. \nIt is the small companies that are the most prolific in providing that \ntype of innovation to our society, whether it is Maryland, New \nHampshire, or any of our States. So it is for that reason that I have \nintroduced this legislation.\n  This legislation would provide some additional tools to help small \nbusinesses create new jobs. We need new jobs. It establishes a \ntemporary 3-year refundable tax credit for new hires by small \nbusinesses. Businesses with up to 25 employees would be eligible for a \nrefundable tax credit equal to 15 percent of the first $20,000 of wages \nfor new hires. That is a strong incentive for a company to put on new \nemployees. It establishes a credit to help small companies deal with \nproviding health benefits for their employees.\n  The two issues I hear about most from small businesses is the \naffordability of health insurance and the availability of credit. Both \nare dealt with through this legislation by providing a way in which \nsmall companies can have more affordable health insurance and by \nproviding a way in which small companies can directly access SBA loans.\n  Following up on what the President said last night, this legislation \nwill set aside $30 billion from the TARP funds so that small companies \ncould directly get SBA loans. I think that is the way to do it because \nthere is a reluctance among banks to lend money to small businesses \neven though today 90 percent of that loan is guaranteed by the SBA. My \nlegislation would use the same standard for SBA to make direct loans--\nso basically 100 percent guaranteed by the Federal Government rather \nthan 90 percent. Then we know the loans will be made.\n  I can't tell my colleagues how many companies I have talked to in \nMaryland who are creditworthy. They are prepared to hire more workers. \nThey are prepared to believe in our economy and believe in our future. \nThe problem is they don't have a bank to partner with. If they have an \nexisting relationship with a community bank, they may be OK. But if \nthey don't, to try to establish a relationship today is very difficult.\n  The President recognized that last night when he talked about the \ncredit crunch affecting small businesses. We haven't eased that. This \nlegislation would provide for the SBA, using the same standards it uses \ntoday for their SBA loans, to make direct loans to small companies in \norder to get our economy back on track by helping small businesses. It \nwill create more jobs. It increases the SBA 7(a) program from $2 \nmillion to $5 million. It increases the microloan program from $35,000 \nto $50,000. It increases the SBA 504 loan program from $1.5 million to \n$5.5 million. These increases in loan limits are desperately needed if \nwe are going to be realistic in today's marketplace as the type of \nloans businesses need in order to expand jobs.\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\n  There are two more things this bill does that I wish to mention that \nare a direct help to small business. One is the sense of the Congress \nthat the SBA Administrator should be a Cabinet-level position. I think \nwe need to make sure an advocate for small business has the ear of our \nPresident. We know what happened in 2009. We know we had to bail out \nWall Street and we had to deal with the large banks in order to save \nour system from going off a cliff. We all understand that. But we also \nknow there were certain commitments made to help small businesses. Yet \nit never got into your community banks, into your States or to your \nsmall businesses. We need the advocate for small businesses to have a \ndirect line to the President. For that reason, I urge that the SBA \nAdministrator be a part of the Cabinet.\n  Another part of the bill expresses a sense of Congress that the \nfinancial institutions that have benefited from our bailout carry out \nwhat they said they would do; that is, loan money to small companies. \nThey say they are doing it, but the evidence shows the reverse, that \nthey are not making these types of loans. I think it would be \ninteresting to see exactly what types of loans these banks that relied \nupon the Federal Government are making to help our communities. I think \nwe all would be disappointed to see their lack of participation in \nsmall company financing which could create jobs in our communities.\n  The last provision of the bill provides for offsets to make sure it \nis fully paid. I don't believe we should add to the deficit. I think \nthis bill will help create jobs, help us deal with the economic growth \nof America, and deal with narrowing the budget deficit through economic \ngrowth. I think we all have a responsibility to make sure we have \nadequate offsets in the bill so we don't add further to the Federal \ndeficit. That is called budget discipline. We talked about that a \nlittle bit on the floor of the Senate today. This bill is fully paid \nfor through offsets.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we look in the weeks ahead at what we will \ncall a jobs bill, which will help put more Americans to work--and I \nfully support that--that we follow the leadership of our President. The \nfirst thing he mentioned in the State of the Union Address last night \nwas that we ought to pay attention to small businesses. I agree with \nthe President. I hope that is a major part of our jobs bill; that it \nwill be provisions that will provide tax credits for new job hires, \nhelp for small businesses dealing with health insurance and that it \nwill increase the SBA's capacity to make loans to small businesses and \nwill, indeed, provide a new avenue for opening credit to small \nbusinesses, putting the spotlight on the banking community so they do \nmore, as they should, to help small businesses grow so we can create \nnew jobs and grow our economy. That should be our first priority. I \npledge to work with my colleagues in the Senate and work with the \nadministration so we can get the job done in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/28/senate-section/article/S347-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S347-S348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 400--URGING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE \n                STRATEGY TO ADDRESS INSTABILITY IN YEMEN\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 400\n\n       Whereas al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups operating in \n     the Republic of Yemen are a threat to the national security \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas on October 12, 2000, an explosives-laden motorboat \n     detonated alongside the United States Navy destroyer USS Cole \n     while it was docked in the Yemeni port of Aden, killing 17 \n     members of the United States armed forces and wounding 39 \n     others in the deadliest terrorist attack against the United \n     States military since the 1983 attack on United States Marine \n     barracks in Beirut, Lebanon;\n       Whereas on September 17, 2008, after several previous \n     failed attacks, Yemeni militants attacked the entrance of the \n     United States Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen, killing 17 people, \n     including a United States citizen;\n       Whereas al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed \n     responsibility for the alleged attempt by a Nigerian \n     national, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, to detonate explosives \n     on board Northwest Airlines flight 253 bound for Detroit, \n     Michigan on Christmas Day 2009;\n       Whereas members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula have \n     used Yemeni territory as a base from which to launch attacks \n     against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including an August 2009 \n     assassination attempt that injured Deputy Interior Minister \n     for Security Affairs Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdul Aziz \n     al Saud;\n       Whereas the Government of Yemen, since December 17, 2009, \n     has undertaken a number of military operations against al \n     Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leadership;\n       Whereas stability in Yemen is threatened by rapid \n     population growth, endemic poverty, the inadequate provision \n     of basic services, widespread corruption, and natural \n     resource shortages stemming from extreme water scarcity and \n     dwindling oil production;\n       Whereas a tribal insurgency in northern Yemen being waged \n     by al-Houthi fighters and a southern secessionist movement \n     threaten the stability of Yemen;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Somalis and Ethiopians are \n     seeking asylum in Yemen to escape civil war, political \n     grievances, and poverty;\n       Whereas these refugees create significant additional \n     pressures on Yemen's limited resources and government \n     institutions;\n       Whereas the February 2009 Department of State report on \n     Human Rights in Yemen found that ``significant human rights \n     problems persisted,'' including ``reports of arbitrary and \n     unlawful killings by government forces, politically motivated \n     disappearances, and torture in many prisons'';\n       Whereas on January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton \n     remarked, ``The success of [United States Government \n     assistance to Yemen] depends upon Yemen's ability to make the \n     tough choices necessary to improve the capacity to govern, to \n     reform its economy, to protect human rights, to combat \n     corruption, and create a better environment for business and \n     investment.'';\n       Whereas the weakening of government institutions in Yemen \n     could contribute to the ability of al Qaeda-inspired and \n     affiliated militants to recruit, train, and plan terrorist \n     operations against United States targets in the Middle East \n     and in the United States;\n       Whereas potential large-scale population displacement and \n     migration from Yemen due to civil conflict, economic \n     collapse, or resource failure could jeopardize the stability \n     and security of the region;\n       Whereas al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda in East \n     Africa, and al-Shabab militants could take advantage of \n     instability in Somalia and Yemen to expand their reach and \n     effectiveness;\n       Whereas the United States recognizes the importance of \n     cooperating with Yemen to counter the al Qaeda threat, \n     promote economic development, and preserve Yemen's stability \n     as it seeks to expand good governance;\n       Whereas in September 2009, USAID and Yemen signed a 3-year \n     economic assistance agreement to fund development projects in \n     the fields of health, education, democracy and governance, \n     agriculture and economic development;\n       Whereas President Obama has significantly increased United \n     States military and economic assistance to Yemen, including--\n       (1) $66,800,000 in fiscal year 2009 to build the capacity \n     of the Yemeni military to conduct counterterrorist \n     operations; and\n       (2) $52,500,000 in fiscal year 2010 for economic assistance \n     administered by the Department of State;\n       Whereas Yemen aspires to join the Gulf Cooperation Council, \n     some of whose members pledged more than $4,000,000,000 to \n     support Yemen's economic development at a November 2006 \n     international donors conference in London;

The Subcommittee hearing will examine \nhow some politically powerful foreign officials, their relatives, or \nclose associates--referred to in international agreements as \n``Politically Exposed Persons'' or PEPs--have used the services of U.S. \nprofessionals and U.S. financial institutions to bring millions of \ndollars in suspect funds into the United States to advance their \ninterests. Four case histories will illustrate how some PEPs have used \nU.S. lawyers, realtors, escrow agents, lobbyists, bankers, and others \nto circumvent U.S. anti-money laundering and anti-corruption \nsafeguards. It will also look at how some U.S. professionals have \nactively helped PEPs avoid bank scrutiny or facilitated suspect \ntransactions with no questions asked. The hearing will also examine \nwhether U.S. policies and practices to combat foreign corruption and \nmoney laundering need strengthening.

Mr. President, legislation will facilitate trademark \nowners' maintenance of protection for their brands. I appreciate the \nSenate acting swiftly to pass this bill. Trademark protection is \ncritical both for businesses that have invested in creating a reliable \nproduct, and for consumers who trust a ``brand name'' product to be \nsafe and of high quality.\n  Last Congress, I authored legislation to provide our law enforcement \ncommunity with the tools, resources, and intragovernmental coordination \nnecessary to combat intellectual property theft. Theft of intellectual \nproperty harms our businesses, weakens our economy, and costs jobs. I \nam proud that the legislation, the Prioritizing Resources and \nOrganization of Intellectual Property, or PRO-IP, Act, was cosponsored \nby a bipartisan group of 21 Senators, and was signed into law.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has held numerous hearings in recent \nyears on the importance of intellectual property protection. In 2004, \nBurton Snowboards, a successful Vermont business, testified before the \nJudiciary Committee about how small businesses were being harmed by the \nrise in intellectual property theft. I am pleased that this \nadministration is taking intellectual property protection seriously, \nand that it recognizes that effective enforcement of our intellectual \nproperty laws is an important component of our economic recovery.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is focused on the process \nfor maintaining trademark protection. It is a targeted bill that will \nimprove the efficiency of the trademark maintenance system. \nInefficiencies cost businesses money, which can lead to higher prices \nfor consumers and can cost workers their jobs. When Congress has an \nopportunity to take waste out of a government process, it should do so \non a bipartisan basis. That is what we are doing today. This bill will \nharmonize the system for submitting maintenance filings to the United \nStates Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO. Maintenance filings are \nrequired for continuing the protection of a trademark. Our legislation \nwill also permit the Director of the USPTO to permit applicants to \ncorrect good faith and harmless errors and will make several technical \namendments within our trademark laws.\n  This legislation also requires a study of how the current system can \nbetter protect small businesses from abuses of the trademark system by \nlarger corporations. Congress provides strong enforcement tools to \nintellectual property owners, as we should, to deter infringing \nactivity and to remove counterfeit products from the market. I have \nbecome concerned, however, that large corporations are at times abusing \nthe substantial rights Congress has granted them in their intellectual \nproperty to the detriment of small businesses. In fact, we saw a high-\nprofile case like this in Vermont last year involving a spurious claim \nagainst Rock Art Brewery in Morrisville. When a corporation exaggerates \nthe scope of its rights far beyond a reasonable interpretation in an \nattempt to bully a small business out of the market, that is wrong. \nThis legislation therefore directs the Secretary of Commerce, in \ncoordination with the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, to \nconsider options for protecting small businesses from such harassing \nlitigation, while ensuring that legitimate trademark infringement \nactions are handled efficiently and expeditiously by the courts.\n  This is commonsense legislation, and I thank all Senators for \nsupporting it.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read three times and \npassed,\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table with no intervening \naction or debate, and any statements relating to this matter be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2968) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

All certificates of correction heretofore \n     issued in accordance with the rules of the United States \n     Patent and Trademark Office and the registrations to which \n     they are attached shall have the same force and effect as if \n     such certificates and their issue had been specifically \n     authorized by statute.''.\n       (b) Incontestability of Right to Use Mark Under Certain \n     Conditions.--Section 15 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 \n     U.S.C. 1065) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``right of the registrant'' and inserting \n     ``right of the owner'';\n       (2) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n       ``(1) there has been no final decision adverse to the \n     owner's claim of ownership of such mark for such goods or \n     services, or to the owner's right to register the same or to \n     keep the same on the register; and''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``United States'' before \n     ``Patent and Trademark Office''.\n       (c) Appeal to Courts.--Section 21 of the Trademark Act of \n     1946 (15 U.S.C. 1071) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``United States'' before ``Patent and \n     Trademark Office'' each place that term appears;\n       (2) in subsection (a)(1), by inserting ``or section 71'' \n     after ``section 8''; and\n       (3) in subsection (b)(4), by striking ``If there be'' and \n     inserting ``If there are''.\n       (d) Conforming Requirements for Affidavits.--\n       (1) Duration, affidavits and fees.--Section 8 of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1058) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 8.
