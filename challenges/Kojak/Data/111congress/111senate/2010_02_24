Mr. President, earlier this week, the White House \nunveiled its latest iteration of the Democrat plan for health care \nreform, and, to put it quite simply, it was a major disappointment.\n  It was our hope that when the administration called for a health care \nsummit at the White House, it would be an opportunity for both sides to \ncome together and start over. Now it is perfectly clear the \nadministration had something else in mind entirely.\n  The plan we saw Monday is hardly a starting off point for a \nbipartisan discussion on commonsense reforms. It is really just more of \nthe same: a massive government scheme with all the flaws of the \nprevious proposals that the American people have already seen and \nrejected. Changing the name and increasing the cost is not what \nAmericans have been asking for, and it is certainly not reform.\n  To make matters worse, even as lawmakers head down to the White House \nfor this health care summit tomorrow, Democrats on Capitol Hill are \nworking behind the scenes on a plan aimed at jamming this massive \nhealth spending bill through Congress against the clear wishes of an \nunsuspecting public. What they have in mind is a last ditch legislative \nsleight of hand called reconciliation that would enable them to impose \ngovernment-run health care for all on the American people, whether \nAmericans want it or not. And we know that Americans do not, in fact, \nwant it.\n  Americans have seen these proposals before. They do not want them. So \nthis is the height of legislative arrogance. If you did not like the \nCornhusker Kickback, get ready. This is the Cornhusker Kickback on \nsteroids.\n  In light of all these behind the scenes efforts to get around the \nwill of the people, it is hard to imagine what the purpose of \nThursday's summit is. If the White House wants real bipartisanship,\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nthen it needs to drop the proposal it posted Monday, which is no \ndifferent in its essentials than anything we have seen before, and \nstart over. And they need to take this last-ditch reconciliation effort \noff the table once and for all.\n  Then we can work on the kind of reform Americans really want, step by \nstep proposals that will actually get at the problem, which is cost. \nThat is what the American people have been asking us to do for a year. \nIf ever there were a time for the administration to show it is \nlistening, it is now. Reform is too important. We cannot let this \nopportunity pass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/24/senate-section/article/S718-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent that upon the completion of the \nremarks from the Senator from New York, I be recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the time will be equally divided, I \npresume?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on a more bipartisan note than the speech \nfrom the minority leader, we are now moving toward some legislation \nthat has two bits of good news for the American people; one, it will \nhelp create jobs and employ those who have been out of work for too \nlong a time; second, it is bipartisan. For the first time in a long \ntime, we have a bill that is supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. I would like to salute the five Republicans from the other \nside who joined us in moving the bill forward. I am very hopeful there \nwill be a large number of those from the other side of the aisle who \nwill join in this bipartisan measure that will show the American people \nthat, at least when it comes to jobs, we can--and must for their good--\nwork together.\n  First, let me discuss the proposal, the part of the proposal authored \nby Senator Hatch and myself. It is very simple. It is a holiday from \nthe payroll tax for any employer that hires a worker who has been out \nof work for 60 days.\n  Let me discuss why I think it will work. First, it is immediate. Most \nbusinesses, particularly small businesses, if you tell them they will \nget some kind of tax credit if they hire someone, but they will get \nthat credit a year from April, are not very interested. This occurs \nimmediately, the minute the worker is hired.\n  Second, it is simple. Again, you tell a businessperson, particularly \na small businessperson, they have to fill out 30 pages, maybe hire an \naccountant to get a tax credit for a new worker, that is not life. They \nare going to tell you to forget it.\n  But here all the new employee has to show is that he or she was out \nof work for 60 days. It is very easy to show 60 days of unemployment \ncompensation, and it immediately takes effect.\n  Third, it goes right to small business. So this is not a large \ngovernment program. The money goes right to small business and is cost \neffective, which is the fourth point. If 3 million people are hired by \nthis tax credit, it will cost $15 billion. That is a lot of money. But \ncompared to the stimulus of $880 billion, it is much smaller. The money \nis cost effective. It goes right to where it should.\n  Finally, my last point is, it is bipartisan. The country is asking us \nto come and work together. Obviously, there are diverse views, both \nwithin the parties and certainly between the parties. But that does not \nmean, on areas that are getting close to emergencies, we cannot work \ntogether.\n  This proposal, let it be the start. But let this proposal be the \nstart of a coming together on issues we can agree on. There are some \njob proposals my colleagues on this side of the aisle would support and \nmy colleagues on the other side would not and vice versa. There are \nsome they would support and we would not.\n  But there are a large number we can all agree on. We ought to \nendeavor to do them because what the American people want is not us \njust talking at one another and accomplishing nothing but us getting \nsomething done.\n  Finally, going back to the merits of this proposal, it should not be \nsold as a panacea. This is not a magic wand that is going to be waved \nand all our joblessness will decline.\n  But what it does do is harness the economic growth we have seen in \nthe last quarter, 5.7 percent, and translates it into the creation of \njobs. Let me explain. In the last quarter, there was economic growth, \n5.7 percent, but hardly a job was created. You cannot sustain an \neconomy and get an economy moving upward unless jobs are created.\n  But the growth gives us an opportunity--not every employer but a \nsignificant number of employers are getting new orders. They are \nthinking to themselves: Should I hire that new worker or should I just \nextend overtime or cut back somewhere else?\n  This job provision, a payroll tax holiday, says to the employer--to \nsome, not all but to many--I am going to take that gamble and hire that \nworker and hire them now so it will help jump-start our economy. It \nwill work for businesses, not those that see declining sales or flat \nsales but those that are beginning to see sales go up and will \ntranslate those increased sales into increased jobs, which will then, \nhopefully, create the virtuous cycle of more jobs, more money in the \neconomy, more jobs still, more money in the economy still, and we can \nget out of this awful recession.\n  In conclusion, I wish to save enough time for my friend from New \nHampshire. I traveled around my State this last Presidents week break. \nIn every corner of my State, I sat with the unemployed. It was \nheartbreaking. Think of those people and those faces, what they had to \nsay late at night.\n  A woman from Rochester had worked for 20 years for Xerox, lost her \nposition in human services up in Rochester. She has been looking for 2 \nyears, close to 2 years, for a job. She made a very good salary. She \ndid not have a family. Her job was her life. She has turned things \ninside out to try and find comparable work. She cannot.\n  I met a man who was a blue-collar worker. He had risen to the top of \nhis craft, tool and die. He thought he had a great life--worked hard, \nhad six children, a good marriage. A year ago he lost his job and is \nstill paying the mortgage. His wife cannot work to support him because \nof the six kids, one of whom was 2 years old, as I recall.\n  What is he going to do? You meet people like this again and again. \nYoung college students get out of college, bright-eyed and bushy-\ntailed, and cannot find work. How disillusioning at the beginning of \ntheir career.\n  So we have an imperative to do something. We have an imperative not \nto say: It has to be my way or no way. We have to put those people back \nto work.\n  That is what Senator Hatch and I attempted to do with our proposal. \nTo our leader, I wish to pay him a tremendous tribute. He was focused \non getting this done. He took brickbats left and right. But the \nultimate wisdom of what he did is now being seen as we move this bill \non the floor today.\n  Hopefully, it will go through the House and be on the President's \ndesk shortly. I thank Senator Hatch and all my colleagues who, \nhopefully, in a few minutes, will come together in a bipartisan way and \ntell the workers who are\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nunemployed: Yes, there is some hope. Tell the voters from \nMassachusetts: Yes, we have heard you. We are focusing on jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe the first obligation of a \ngovernment--or one of the obligations, especially of Congress--is to \nlive by its own words and live by its own rules. With great fanfare a \ncouple weeks ago, the Democratic leadership and its membership passed a \npay-go piece of legislation which says that when you bring spending \nlegislation to the floor, it should be paid for. There was great \nbreast-beating on the other side of the aisle about how this would \ndiscipline the government and make us fiscally responsible.\n  Now we see, as the first piece of legislation to come forward since \nthe pay-go resolution passed, a bill which violates that pay-go \nresolution. This bill spends $12 billion that is not paid for under the \npay-go rules over the next 5 years. It is in violation of the concepts \nand the rules which were put forward by the other side as the way we \nwould discipline spending.\n  I understand--and I think most of us understand--the issue of the \neconomy is critical, getting people back to work is critical, but I \ndon't think we get people back to work by loading more and more debt \nonto the next generation. Probably we create an atmosphere where folks \nwho are willing to go out and invest and create jobs are a little \nreticent to do so because they don't know how all that debt the Federal \nGovernment is putting on the books will be paid for. I presume that is \none of the reasons the pay-go legislation was brought forward a couple \nof weeks ago, to try to give some certainty to the markets and to the \nAmerican people who were upset with all the deficit and debt, that we \nwould discipline ourselves.\n  Now the first bill that comes forward violates the rules of the \nSenate by adding $12 billion of spending which is not paid for, which \nwill be deficit spending, and which will be added to the debt. I am not \nsure how you vote for this bill when it violates that rule which you \njust voted for 2 weeks ago. It seems a bit of inconsistency that is \nhard even for a political institution to justify.\n  On top of that, this bill has massive gamesmanship in the outyears. \nIt is a bill of $15 to $18 billion in spending, but actually, because \nof the games played in the highway accounts, it adds $140 billion of \nspending that is not paid for which will be added to the debt if this \nbill is passed. That is a hard number. That is a big number. That is a \nreal number.\n  The simple fact is, this bill, in the classic gamesmanship we see \nfrom the highway committee, spends money we don't have and then claims \nwe have the money. In the end, all that money has to be borrowed \nbecause there are no revenues to cover it.\n  If this bill is passed, there will be $140 billion in new debt put on \nour kids' backs as a result of this alleged small number. I forgot what \nthe number is they claim is actually in the bill. How does that happen? \nThis bit of gamesmanship ought to be explained because it keeps being \nundertaken by the highway committee in the most egregious way relative \nto proper fiscal management. In fact, if this were done in an \naccounting cycle that was subject to accounting rules, the people who \nclaim this sort of sleight of hand would go to jail. It is that simple. \nThey would go to jail because this is such a fraud on the American \ntaxpayer.\n  What they are claiming is that the highway fund, on which they have \ncommitted to spend much more money than is coming in, and they knew \nthey would spend more money than was coming in because they wanted to \nspend more money than was coming in, what they are claiming is that \nhighway fund lent the general fund money 10 years ago and that money \nshould have had interest paid on it. Of course, at the time, they \nactually waived the interest, assuming interest should have been paid \non that. That interest has been recouped a couple of times now, \nallegedly, even if it were owed. But what they claim is that because \nthe money is coming out of the general fund to fund the highway fund, \nthey are calling that an offset so it won't score.\n  Unfortunately, under the present rules with which we budget around \nhere, it doesn't score because it is built into the baseline. It adds \nup to $140 billion over the next 10 years, approximately, that is going \nto come out of the general fund to fund the highway fund because the \npeople who run the highway fund don't have the courage to fund what \nthey want to spend. So they are going to take it out of the general \nfund. Where does the general fund get its money? It borrows it from our \nchildren and grandchildren. It runs up debt. That is why, under any \nscenario, no matter what gamesmanship you play around here on naming \nthis event, it turns out to be the same thing: debt added to our \nchildren's burden.\n  Our children already have a fair amount of debt coming at them as a \nresult of this Congress's profligacy. Under the President's budget, the \ndeficit will double in the next 5 years and triple in the next 10 \nyears. We will add $11 trillion of new debt to the backs of our \nchildren over the next 10 years under the President's initiatives, \nevery year for the next 10 years. We will average deficits of $1 \ntrillion.\n  The American people intuitively understand that cannot continue; it \ncan't keep up. We are on an unsustainable course. We are running this \nNation into a ditch on the fiscal side of the ledger. We are putting \nthis Nation into financial bankruptcy because of the fact that we are \nrunning up deficits and debt far beyond our capacity to repay. In fact, \nif you look at these deficits and debt just in the context of what \nother industrialized nations do--for example, the European Union--they \ndon't allow their states to exceed deficits of 3 percent or a public \ndebt to GDP ratio of 60 percent. The way this works out, we are going \nto run deficits of about 5 percent every year for the next 10 years, we \nwill have a public debt situation of well over 60 percent next year, \nand we will get to 80 percent before the next 10 years are up. Those \nare numbers which lead to one conclusion--that we are in deep trouble. \nWe are in deep, deep trouble. Yet we come here today with a bill which \naggravates that situation relative to the pay-go rules by $12 billion \nand relative to the highway fund by $140 billion.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield for the purpose of a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nremarks of the Senator from New Hampshire, I be recognized for up to 3 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. What we have before us today is a bill which, first, \nviolates the pay-go rules which we just passed a couple of weeks ago to \nthe tune of $12 billion and, second, puts in place a glidepath, which \nshould be called a nosedive, toward $140 billion of new debt being put \non the backs of our children, with the alleged justification that it is \noffset when, in fact, the offset is superficial, Pyrrhic, and \nnonexistent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. We can not keep doing this. We cannot keep doing this to \nour children. We cannot keep coming out here and claiming we are being \nfiscally disciplined when we are doing just the opposite: spending \nmoney we don't have and passing the bill on to our kids.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when the Senator from New Hampshire talks \nabout what we can and can't do to our children, I remind my fellow \nSenators, I happen to be blessed with 20 kids and grandkids. I am \nprobably more concerned than anyone else here about future generations. \nLet me say, to redeem myself in advance, I am a conservative. I have \nbeen ranked No. 1 by the ACU, Man of the Year by Human Events. Yet I \nthink we are supposed to be doing something when we come here to \nWashington. I have always said, when I run for office, that the two \nmain things we are supposed to do are defend America and \ninfrastructure. Yes, I am the ranking member on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I was the sponsor of the bill in\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\n2005, and I am proud of it because we had to do something about \ninfrastructure. I don't know, maybe there aren't any roads in New \nHampshire, but I can tell you, don't buy into the argument that this is \nall debt. We are talking about $12 billion.\n  This bill actually does two things. It has some very good reductions \nin taxes. I remember so well that John Kennedy, when he was President, \nsaid we have to raise more revenue. The best way is to reduce marginal \nrates. From 1961 to 1968, it went from $94 billion to $153 billion. \nThat is in this thing. But the main thing here I am concerned about is \nwe keep doing nothing about roads and highways and infrastructure. That \nis what we are supposed to do.\n  I know the Senator is sincere when he comes up with this, but where \nwas his concern back when he voted to give an unelected bureaucrat $700 \nbillion? That wasn't offset. We can say that was a loan, but we all \nknow better.\n  There are some things we are supposed to be doing in America, and the \nsecond most important thing, in my view--I know others don't share this \nview--is to do something about infrastructure. This bill does it. This \ncarries it on to the end of the fiscal year, about 11 more months. If \nwe don't do it, it is costing about $1 billion a month by inaction. If \nwe try to do this by extending it month by month, each one of us in \nthis body is going to lose a lot of money that goes to roads and \nhighways and infrastructure.\n  Last week had a crumbling bridge in Oklahoma where no one was killed, \nbut it came very close to that. We saw what happened up in Minnesota. \nWe have to do something, instead of spending all of our money, as this \nadministration is doing, on social engineering. We need to start \nbuilding bridges and roads and repairing them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation document entitled ``Estimated Revenue Effects of \nthe Revenue Provisions Contained in Senate Amendment 3310, The `Hiring \nIncentives to Restore Employment Act,' under consideration by the \nSenate'' be printed in the Record.\n  In addition, the Record should reflect that the document entitled \n``Technical Explanation of the Revenue Provisions Contained in Senate \nAmendment 3310, The `Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act,' \nunder consideration by the Senate'' can be found on the Joint Committee \non Taxation website at http://jct.gov/\npublications.html?func=startdown= 3648. This document is a \ncontemporary explanation of the legislation that reflects the \nintentions of the Senate and its understanding of the legislative text.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24FE10.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24FE10.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the so-called jobs \nlegislation that is before the Senate this afternoon and to express my \ngrave concerns with the direction this bill has taken over the past few \nweeks.\n  Several of my Finance Committee colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nput a lot of time and effort into creating a compromise jobs bill that \nChairman Baucus and Senator Grassley were trying to move forward. \nIndeed, I had high hopes that we might help thaw the partisan freeze \nthat has gridlocked this chamber for far too long. Unfortunately, our \nefforts and hopes have been dashed by the majority leader's \ninexplicable decision to gut our bill and replace it with a piece of \nlegislation that replaces cooperation with contention.\n  Further exacerbating matters, the Democratic leadership has filled \nthe amendment tree, thus preventing anyone from being able to offer \namendments that would improve the underlying bill. So much for \ncompromise.\n  As a longtime public servant of this great deliberative body, I can't \nrecall a decision that exhibited as much raw political gamesmanship as \nthis one does. The Democratic leadership is stifling the first genuine \nattempt at cooperation on a major issue--a move that bodes ill for \nbipartisanship for the remainder of this Congress.\n  Given what is happening with this jobs bill, how can we in the \nminority have faith that we won't be excluded from debate on future \nlegislation such as health care and energy legislation? It is easy to \nlabel the Republicans as the ``Party of No'' when you completely \nexclude them from the legislative process. Unfortunately, the majority \nleaves us with little other option than to say ``no.''\n  But what puzzles me the most is what the majority has to gain from \nthis partisan maneuver. In my experience, the Senate operates best when \nthere is trust that agreements will be honored, but regrettably now \neven that is in question.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I sat in the House Chamber while the President \ngave his State of the Union Address in which he raised the importance \nof bipartisan cooperation, especially in the area of job creation. The \nfact that the President hit a nerve with this plea is evident by the \neffort to build such a bipartisan bill in the Finance Committee in the \nweeks that followed. However, it is obvious that many on the other side \ncannot stand the thought of working with our side when there might be \npolitical points to be scored by trying to embarrass us.\n  Here are a few of the things the President said about the need for \nbipartisanship in his State of the Union Address:\n\n       And what the American people hope--what they deserve--is \n     for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our \n     differences.\n       [Americans] are tired of the partisanship and the shouting \n     and the pettiness.\n       These aren't Republican values or Democratic values that \n     they're living by; business values or labor values. They're \n     American values.\n\n  The President went on to address the need to promote job growth by \nsaying:\n\n       Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will \n     always be America's businesses.\n       We should start where most new jobs do--in small \n     businesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a \n     chance on a dream, or a worker decides it's time she became \n     her own boss.\n\n  And finally:\n\n       [We should] Provide a tax incentive for all large \n     businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants \n     and equipment.\n\n  While these challenges and standards were set by the President, the \nleader of the Democratic Party, I believe most Republicans would agree \nwith him. The American people are suffering. Our unemployment rate is \nnear double digits. We owe it to the unemployed and underemployed to \nput aside partisan politics so that we can create jobs and make our \neconomy stronger.\n  Soon after President Obama addressed the Nation, Senate Democratic \nand Republican leaders went to work on a bipartisan solution to create \na jobs-growth bill. I worked with Senator Schumer to come up with a \npayroll tax holiday for companies that hired more employees. Under this \nincentive, the sooner a company hired an unemployed worker the more tax \nincentive the company would receive. I believe that this initiative is \na perfect example of the kind of bipartisanship the President talked \nabout during his State of the Union Address.\n  In addition, Senators Baucus and Grassley joined in this effort by \nincluding several other provisions aimed at job growth and to address \nthe symptoms of a failing economy. This was a compromise that included \nan extension of unemployment insurance, Build America Bonds, and \nexpired tax provisions.\n  Let me be clear. There is no doubt in my mind and in the mind of many \nof my colleagues that passing a jobs bill is crucial. We have seen our \nunemployment rate remain at about 10 percent since September. The \nAmerican people sent us here to do a job, and it is way past time we \ndid it.\n  This is why it was so disheartening on February 11, when the Senate \nmajority leader announced that he would scrap the compromise proposal \nonly hours after its unveiling and proceed instead with a stripped-down \nbill that would not extend any of the expiring tax proposals that are \nso vitally important to job growth. This decision not only pulled the \nrug out from Republicans, but it floored those Democrats who had been \nworking for weeks on a bipartisan solution.\n  Regrettably, because of this decision, it looks as though President \nObama's hope for a bipartisan solution to job creation only lasted 2 \nweeks. What a shame!\n  To illustrate the abruptness of and surprise caused by the majority \nleader's unexpected action, just look at the next-day's headlines:\n\n       ``Key Dem: Reid scrapped jobs bill because he did not trust \n     Republicans''--The Hill\n       ``Reid kills Baucus-Grassley jobs bill''--The Politico\n       ``Senate leader slashes jobs bill; Despite new support''--\n     LA Times\n\n  But it doesn't end there. The majority leader sent a pretty strong \nmessage when he said that he--and I quote--``dared Republicans to vote \nagainst his bill.''\n  Many Democratic Senators were quick to stand behind the majority \nleader's reversal, just seconds after supporting the bipartisan jobs \nbill. Some even stated that we Republicans were not interested in a \nbipartisan deal because we were more inclined to ``play rope-a-dope \nagain.'' They went on to characterize the tax extenders as only ``going \nto people who are making money, and they generally keep it.'' They even \nwent so far as to say that what the Democratic Caucus is taking to the \nfloor is something that is more focused on job creation than on tax \nbreaks.\n  What most surprised me is just how quickly many Democratic Senators \nwere to abandon these tax extenders, even though most of them support \nextending these very expiring tax provisions. In fact, the Democratic \nleadership has erroneously labeled the tax extenders as solely a \nRepublican-supported initiative. This is hardly the case, considering \nthe Democratic-led House has already passed nearly all of these tax \nextenders and the President called for them to be passed in his speech \nbefore Congress.\n  There is an array of expiring tax provisions contained in the tax \nextenders package. Here are a few that are included:\n  Also, many Democrats, including the majority leader, are cosponsors \nof legislation that would extend many of the expiring tax provisions. \nLook at the bill to extend the research tax credit, or the alternative \nfuels vehicle credit, or even the new markets tax credit. These are by \nno means solely Republican initiatives.\n  In fact, there are many business tax incentives included in the tax \nextenders package that are primarily supported by some of the Senators \nwho have been the most vocal against including the expired provisions \nin the jobs bill. These Democratic-supported business incentives \ninclude a mine rescue team training credit and special expensing rules \nfor certain film and television productions.\n  Therefore, to label the support of extending these expiring tax \nprovisions as part of a solely Republican agenda is misleading, unfair, \nand unwarranted. I believe that these statements were made only to \nsupport the majority leader, who appeared to have made a hasty and ill-\nconsidered decision.\n  Some have questioned how extending these expired tax provisions \nrelate to job creation. It is a fair question, but\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\none with easy answers. The extension of these expired tax provisions \nwould support proven growth of companies that are slowly beginning to \nsee the light at the end of the tunnel. Conversely, government funding \nwould only provide a false sense of job growth because once the \ngovernment funding is gone so will the jobs.\n  If we need proof that government spending isn't as effective as tax \nrelief, we only have to look to what the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid last year about the effects of the year-old economic stimulus \npackage:\n\n       The legislation would increase employment by 0.8 million to \n     2.3 million by the fourth quarter of 2009, by 1.2 million to \n     3.6 million by the fourth quarter of 2010, by 0.6 million to \n     1.9 million by the fourth quarter of 2011, and by declining \n     numbers in later years.\n\n  The reason for this drop in employment is because government spending \ndoes not create permanent jobs; only the private sector can. In \ncontrast to government spending, tax incentives would give the private \nsector a much-needed boost. If we had included more tax incentives for \nbusinesses in last year's stimulus bill, we would have created jobs \nthat will last far longer than the ones government spending has \ncreated.\n  Originally projected to cost $787 billion, the stimulus bill is now \nexpected to total $862 billion over 10 years, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. This does not include interest owed, which \nwould put the total cost in the trillions of dollars.\n  Thus far, only a third of the $862 billion stimulus package has been \nspent. Another third is expected to be spent in 2010, and the remaining \nthird after this year. Whatever happened to spending money on projects \ndeemed to be ``shovel ready?''\n  The administration has claimed the stimulus bill is responsible for \ncreating or saving 1 million jobs--a very misleading claim.\n  For example, it was reported that a construction company in Nevada \ncreated 20 jobs on a project that has yet to receive money. A school \ndistrict reported saving 665 jobs, even though it only employs roughly \n600 people. A town in Oregon reported creating eight jobs on a contract \nfor ``rattlesnake stewardship.''\n  In January 2009, President Obama's economic advisors predicted in a \nreport that with an $800 billion stimulus, the unemployment rate would \nnever go above 8 percent. As I stated previously, unemployment has been \nnear 10 percent since last September.\n  Moreover, the stimulus package was sold to the American people as an \nimmediate fix--a ``jolt'' to the economy. The President's chief \neconomic advisor, Larry Summers, said: ``You'll see effects \nimmediately.'' Christina Romer, the President's chair of Economic \nAdvisers, said: ``We'll start adding jobs rather than losing them.'' \nAnd House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, ``This will begin creating \njobs immediately.''\n  When pitching the stimulus bill, then-President-elect Obama said ``90 \npercent of these jobs will be created in the private sector--the \nremaining 10 percent are mainly public sector jobs.'' However, the Wall \nStreet Journal reported in a February 17 article that government data \nindicate most jobs supported by stimulus dollars belonged to government \nemployees at the State and local level. In fact, only 2 percent of the \nentire stimulus bill was dedicated toward tax relief for businesses.\n  We need to provide a foundation to allow the private sector to \nnourish and create better paying jobs. That is why many support \nincluding these tax extenders in a jobs bill.\n  For instance, it is estimated that that approximately 70 percent or \nmore of the research tax credit benefits are attributable to salaries \nof performing U.S.-based research. How can some Senators disregard the \neffectiveness of some of these tax extenders on job growth? And keep in \nmind that the research credit has traditionally received more \nDemocratic than Republican support in this body. In fact, there is a \nbill to extend the expiring research tax credit. Of the 18 cosponsors \nof this bill, 11 are Democrats. Furthermore, this bill was introduced \nby the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  As I stated earlier, the President set the tone at the beginning of \nthe year by calling on Congress to put forth a bipartisan solution to \ncreate jobs. In response, both Democrats and Republicans brought \ninnovative ideas to the table. Then, in a sudden change of events, many \nRepublican ideas were excluded from the jobs bill the majority leader \nhas brought to the floor. Finally, the majority leader is not allowing \nour side to offer any amendments.\n  If this is not an arrogance of power, then I do not know what is. I \nonly hope the majority leader heeds President Obama's plea for a \nbipartisan solution.\n  I think one Democrat, learning of the majority leader's action, said \nit best:\n\n       Most Americans don't honestly believe that a single \n     political party has all the good ideas. I hope the majority \n     leader will reconsider.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Oklahoma for 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have to object because the vote was set \nfor 9:55.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we have had so much partisan gridlock. \nToday we have a real opportunity to show that this new legislative year \ncan break through that with something meaningful to the American \npeople, a jobs bill. I am hopeful that many colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will join us. There has been great input from Senator \nInhofe and Senator Hatch. These are people who are conservative, have \ndifferent voting records than I, but they say we have to do something. \nI thank the new Senator from Massachusetts for leading the way and \nbreaking through the miasma. This is a good, focused bill. It is a \nmodest bill, but it will do some good for the hundreds of thousands and \nperhaps millions who are looking desperately for work. When they find \njobs, our economy begins to move forward. That is long overdue.\n  Both sides of the aisle can show the American people we have heard \nthem by overwhelmingly passing this well-crafted, well-honed, modest \npiece of legislation aimed at issue No. 1: jobs and the economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this Monday, I was honored to stand before \nthis Chamber and read George Washington's Farewell Address. This annual \ntradition invites Members of the Senate, as well as the American \npeople, to pause and reflect on the wisdom of our first President.\n  In this historic text, the father of our country lays out a unique \nview of the Nation he helped to create. It is a testament to the \nAmerican spirit and a tribute to the American people that this country \nhas come such a long way since the days of our ancestors.\n  Washington's vision was especially poignant to me, having traced my \npersonal ancestry back to the days of slavery.\n  As I looked out over this Chamber on Monday, I thought about the \nreasons we celebrate each February as Black History Month. This year, \nas Black History Month draws to a close, I cannot help but reflect that \nWashington's address reminds us that Black history and American history \nare inseparable from one another; that the American story cannot be \ndistilled into the Black experience and the White experience but that \nboth are essential components of the American experience.\n  The story of this country is a story of expanding equality and \nopportunity, of people and institutions grappling with social change \nand striving to live up to the promise of a single line in the \nDeclaration of Independence which laid out the creed that came to \ndefine this Nation:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal. . . .\n\n  With these simple words, a slave owner named Thomas Jefferson laid \nthe cornerstone of the free America we know today, even if the noble \nsentiment was not realized for all Americans until more than a century \nlater. Although we have seen such injustice--though our journey toward \nfreedom and equality is far from over--we can draw great strength from \nthe promise that was woven into the fabric of our Nation on the day we \ndeclared our independence.\n  Black History Month is a time to remember those who have taken part \nin every step of that ongoing journey and to celebrate the legacy they \nhave left behind for each of us.\n  At every moment in our past, African Americans have stood shoulder to \nshoulder with their countrymen from all races, backgrounds, and walks \nof life to help chart our course and define who we are to become: from \nthe slaves who laid the very foundation of this Capitol Building to the \nbusinessmen and entrepreneurs who helped build our modern economy; from \nthe ``King'' who dared to dream of an America he would never live to \nsee to the President who reached the mountaintop; from the man who was \nborn into the bonds of slavery to his great grandson who stands today \nbefore his peers in the Senate.\n  Each of these stories, however ordinary or remarkable, illustrates \nhow Black history is woven deeply into the broad canvas of American \nhistory and why the two are inseparable from one another.\n  For me, this reality was brought to life the moment I stood at the \nfront of this Chamber and began to read the words that our first \nPresident wrote to his countrymen more than two centuries ago. Yet it \nwas the visionary leadership and high ideals of men such as Washington \nand Jefferson which transcended the prejudice of their times and made \nit possible for later generations to tear those inequalities to the \nground.\n  All Americans have benefited from this profound legacy. We all have \nan interest in preserving the history we share.\n  In the closing days of this Black History Month, I urge my colleagues \nto reflect not only on the ways African Americans have contributed to \nAmerican history but also on the ways we can move forward together as \none Nation, just as Washington calls us to do in his Farewell Address.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

But we will wait until we hear from the Republicans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we have today taken a very strong, \npositive step forward in terms of responding to the No. 1 crisis in our \neconomy, and that is jobs for all of our people. Under Leader Reid's \nleadership, we were able to get a bill through, with a huge majority, \nand it signals, I hope, not only attention to jobs but also the \nwillingness and the ability to find common ground to serve the people \nof our country.\n  We are now on the travel promotion bill, which is another piece of \nlegislation designed to encourage job creation in the travel industry. \nAll of this is good news. The legislation we propose this morning \ncombines elements of tax breaks for small businesses so they can \nexpense their items, increase their cashflow, and hire more people with \ncredits for hiring people. There is a huge investment in our \ninfrastructure, which will put people to work in the building industry \nand in industries that supply all these infrastructure projects, and \nthere is also a significant commitment to Build America Bonds. These \nare good programs, and they are fully paid for.\n  We are now taking up the challenge to put people to work, to do it in \na responsible way, and to do so in a way that we can attract bipartisan \nsupport. But there is much more to do. There is the recognition that we \nhave to not only create jobs but for the foreseeable future deal with \nthose people who have been looking unsuccessfully for jobs and who are \nunemployed. In my home State of Rhode Island, the unemployment rate is \n12.9 percent. That is the official rate. Unofficially, it is much \nhigher, as many people have dropped out of the workforce. If you look \nat sectors in terms of ethnicity or age, the numbers are even more \nstartling. The bill we passed this morning is a good first step \nforward, but we have to do much more.\n\n  I think one of the first jobs we have to address is the extension of \nunemployment benefits. They will expire this Sunday. We have to \nrecognize that, despite many efforts here, there are millions of \nAmericans who are looking every day and not finding work. They need \nsupport.\n  All of the economists who have looked at these programs indicated \nthat not only do they support individuals and families, they provide a \ntremendous multiplier of economic activity for every dollar we commit \nto the program. There is, as they say, a big bang for the buck. People \nwho are without a job will take their benefits and invariably they will \nhave to support themselves in terms of going to the grocery store--\ndoing the things you have to do just to get by day by day. They are not \ntypically saving this money. That helps in the sense of increasing \ndemand in the economy overall, increasing our economic growth.\n  If Congress fails to act swiftly, 1,200 Rhode Islanders will start \nlosing their benefits each week. It is a small State\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\nand that is a big number. We have never before in our history, at least \npostwar history, ever terminated extended unemployment and emergency \nunemployment benefits until unemployment was at least 7.4 percent. At \nthat point it appears, in most cases, that there is a self-sustaining \neconomic growth that will itself begin to continue to lower the \nunemployment rate. We are far from 7.4 percent. As I said, in my State \nit is 12.9. The national average is hovering around 10.\n  We have to do this. Congress has acted eight times--1958, 1961, 1971, \n1974, 1982, 1991, 2002, 2008--to establish temporary federal \nunemployment benefit programs beyond regular unemployment compensation \nand extended benefits. Not to extend these benefits would essentially \nreject the consistent record of this Congress of helping Americans when \nthe unemployment rate has reached such extraordinary proportions as it \nis today, whether the majority is Republican or Democrat. Last \nNovember, we did approve, without opposition, an expansion of up to 20 \nweeks, but now we need to pass a further extension.\n  As I said before, this is not just about helping families and \nindividuals, it is also about helping the economy. For every $1 we \ninvest in our unemployment benefits, we see $1.90 in economic activity \noverall throughout the economy.\n  One of the reasons I heard to oppose this morning's legislation: \nThere is not enough demand to justify these tax incentives; they will \nnot be used.\n  One of the things that does generate demand, consumer demand \nparticularly, is the unemployment compensation program. It is not the \nway we want to do it. What we would like to see is a productive economy \nwith jobs where the demand comes not only from people working but their \nbeing compensated and also being able, with discretionary income, to \nmake consumption choices that today they cannot.\n  As I said before, we have to think about an agenda for jobs. We \npassed one piece of legislation today. We are discussing the travel \nlegislation at this moment. We have to then move to the legislation \nwith respect to unemployment compensation. We also have to think about \nsupporting the States with additional FMAP, that is, the funds for \nMedicaid, because, again, not only will that help our States, but \nwithout it you are going to see a contraction in our health care \nindustry in terms of hospitals being able to hire or willing to hire. \nSo we have many steps to go forward.\n  One aspect of this issue, which I would like to mention is that many \nof these programs we have talked about--for example, the tax credits \nfor hiring--are nationwide and they miss the point that there are some \nareas that are much more affected by unemployment than other areas. We \nhave States--and their good fortune is something we should be proud \nof--that have rates as low as 4.7 percent for unemployment. Yet they \nwill qualify for these general, generic programs.\n  As we go forward and start thinking about additional steps, I think \nwe also have to think about how we can target those programs to areas \nthat have critical unemployment situations. Rhode Island, at 12.9 \npercent, is one, but there are many others. If you look within States, \nthere are regions that have significant unemployment problems. Again, \nwe have taken steps to extend our benefits, but as we go forward, as we \nconsider additional legislation, let's also think seriously about how \nto make it more effective, more efficient, more targeted.\n  I again urge all my colleagues to continue the effort and spirit \nwhich resulted today in an overwhelming vote for a program that will \nhelp Americans and move our country and our economy forward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the legislation on the floor of the Senate \nat this point includes legislation that I have worked on with my \ncolleagues for about 3 years. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation \ncalled the Travel Promotion Act. I wish to talk just a bit about it \ntoday, but before I do, let me describe the reasons for its importance.\n  When we began to put this together--as I said, 3 years ago last \nmonth, working with a good number of sectors in our economy to try to \nevaluate how do we promote international tourism to the United States--\nwe were not in a very deep recession. We were in a period of economic \ngrowth. In the intervening period, our country has fallen into a very \nsignificant and deep recession. It makes the urgency all that much \ngreater to create new jobs and to do so as soon as possible.\n  Somewhere around 15 million to 17 million people, according to \nofficial estimates, woke up this morning in this country of ours \nwithout a job. They want a job. They want work. They have looked for \nwork, but they can't find a job in the United States of America.\n  Now, that number of 15 million to 17 million is ominous enough. Just \nthink of one person this morning who woke up not able to work because \nthey can't find a job, and then think of 15 million or 17 million, and \nthen fast-forward and think of perhaps 25 million to 26 million, which \nis what is estimated to be the total population of people who are \nunemployed in America, many of whom have stopped looking for work \nbecause they couldn't find work at all. This is a very big problem, and \nit affects our country in many ways. It affects the economy in a \ndevastating way. It is very hard on American families when they are not \nable to find work to be able to take care of themselves. It results in \nmore Federal spending for unemployment insurance and the other things. \nSo we are trying to find ways to put people back to work.\n  Earlier this week we passed, with the leadership of Senator Reid and \nmany others--work that I and Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, and many \nothers have done--a jobs bill that will begin putting people back to \nwork when it is signed by the President. The legislation that Senator \nReid brought to the floor today includes the Travel Promotion Act, \nwhich will also put people back to work. I wish to talk through this \nand explain why this is important.\n  Let me begin by saying that on 9/11/2001, we were the victims of a \ndevastating terrorist attack on our country. Thousands of Americans \nwere killed that day. As a result, since that period of time we have \nbeen engaged in an effort to prevent terrorism, to track down the \nterrorists and destroy the terrorist networks that would visit that \nkind of tragedy upon our country. But also during that period and \nfollowing, it became clear to the rest of the world that our country \nwas clamping down on visitation to our country. Many people believed: \nThe United States doesn't want us to visit them anymore. It is harder \nto get a visa to come to the United States. We are not welcome in the \nUnited States. So what happened was, there was a dramatic reduction in \nvisitation to our country by overseas travelers.\n  Why is that important? When you have millions of people who are \ntraveling around the world to go experience and see the sights and take \nvacations and so on, they are spending a fair amount of money on those \ntrips. They are creating jobs in many areas, not just hotels and cars \nand restaurants and so on but in many other areas as well. Our country, \nfor the last 6 to 8 years, has had the experience in which the rest of \nthe world has said: We are going to visit Italy, France, Japan, and \nIndia. But fewer of us are going to visit the United States of America.\n  In fact, we have seen a circumstance where after 9/11, we had fewer \nand fewer visitors coming to our country; that is, fewer than came \nbefore, and last year, in 2009, we had 2.4 million fewer people visit \nour country than visited our country in the year 2000. Let me say that \nagain because I think it is important. We had 2.4 million fewer people \ncome to the United States of America to visit as overseas travelers \nthan visited in the year 2000.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the State of New Mexico. It is a \nwonderful State, and I know it is a State that attracts a lot of \nvisitation not only from people in our country but from people\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\nwho come from outside of America to see the wonders of New Mexico. But \nit doesn't matter whether it is the wonders of New Mexico or Old \nFaithful in Yellowstone or Niagara Falls or you name it--the cities or \nthe wonders of our country, the great national parks--2.4 million fewer \npeople showed up last year to visit our country.\n  Let me explain why that has happened. Here are some headlines. The \nSydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, headline: ``Coming to America \nIsn't Easy.'' It describes the difficulty of getting visas and coming \nto America.\n  The Guardian in England says: ``America: More Hassle Than it's \nWorth?'' Again, difficulty coming to America.\n  The Sunday Times in London: ``Travel to America? No Thanks,'' says \nthe headline.\n  The newspaper says:\n\n       It is already a nightmare, but now they want to make entry \n     into the U.S. tougher, so let's not go.\n\n  Well, let me describe what is happening in other countries at the \nsame time we are taking leave on this issue. Other countries are very \nbusy advertising to the world to say: Are you traveling? Are you taking \na vacation? Are you seeing the world? Come to our country. Come to see \nwhat is happening.\n  The poster says: Looking for an experience to remember? Be part of an \nadventure you will never forget. Come and see Australia. See the \nwonders. It is true what they say: To find yourself sometimes you need \nto lose yourself. In Australia they call this ``going walkabout.'' So a \nbig campaign: If you are traveling, come to Australia. Come and see \nwhat we have to offer.\n  A campaign for the Emerald Isle: Go where Ireland takes you. If you \nare taking a trip, be sure and visit Ireland. Come to Ireland, it says. \nIt is an international campaign.\n  Japan says: Sweet secrets from Japan. With its many unique culinary \narts, they entice travelers; a stunning array of specialties, and on \nand on. Come to Japan. Thinking of traveling? Show up in Japan.\n  Are you taking a trip with your family? How about coming to the \nEiffel Tower. Come to France in 2009. Vive la France. So France and \nJapan and India and Ireland say: Come and see us.\n  Belgium's national campaign says: If you are traveling with your \nfamily, come to Belgium where fun is always in fashion.\n\n       Brussels, sophisticated simplicity, the capital of cool.\n\n  I think you get the point. This one says:\n\n       One special reason to visit India in 2009. Any time is a \n     good time to visit the land of Taj, but there is no time like \n     now.\n\n  So we have millions of people traveling around the world. On average, \noverseas travelers spend over $4,000. All of these countries are saying \nto those overseas travelers: Come to our country. See our country and \nthe wonders of what we have to offer the world.\n  In the United States of America, we have not done that. That is why, \nin my judgment, at least in part, we had 2.4 million fewer visitors \nlast year than we had in 2000. That is pretty unbelievable.\n  This proposition is simple. There is a problem. The number of people \nbetween the years 2000 and 2009 visiting other countries--overseas \ntravel--has increased by 31 percent. During the same period the number \nof overseas travelers coming to the United States has decreased nearly \n10 percent. So overseas travel is up, but travel to America is down.\n  There is another important point here. There has been a lot of \npolling done, and it is clear that to visit America is to have great \nrespect for and love for this country. There is almost no one who comes \nto this country and tours and travels and visits our country who \ndoesn't leave America with a special understanding of the wonders of \nthis great place. At a time when we want people to understand more \nabout our country, we ought to be inviting them here and saying: Come \nto America, see what we have to offer.\n  We ought to be engaged in this process, but we are not. This \nlegislation we are bringing to the floor of the Senate is legislation \nthat will actually increase jobs, we think, by close to 40,000 jobs, \naccording to the estimates. So you will increase 40,000 jobs and, in \naddition to that, the CBO says this will reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit by nearly $\\1/2\\ billion. How many pieces of legislation come \nto the floor of the Senate that will both create jobs and reduce the \nbudget deficit and also give us the opportunity to tell the rest of the \nworld what a wonderful and great place this country is?\n  That is the reason for this legislation. As we build, one step at a \ntime, opportunities to create additional jobs, this is part of it. The \nCongressional Budget Office has said that enacting S. 1023 would reduce \nthe budget deficit. I think it will do that and help our country.\n  The specifics of this legislation will encourage international travel \nto all parts of this country. I think it will provide economic growth \nto all parts of our country. This creates a corporation for travel \npromotion. That is what we create--an independent, nonprofit \ncorporation to be governed by an 11-member board of directors appointed \nby the Secretary of Commerce, and it creates the Office of Travel \nPromotion in the Department of Commerce--one that used to exist but no \nlonger does, and it hasn't for a long while.\n  The purpose of this is to engage in the kind of campaign that exists \nin most other countries in the world and to say to those traveling \naround the world: Come here. You are welcome here. We want you here. \nCome and understand and experience this country called the United \nStates of America.\n  Let me pay special attention to the work Senator Reid has done, and \nSenator Ensign who is a cosponsor and worked on this in the Commerce \nCommittee with me, Senator Inouye, Senator Vitter, and Senator \nKlobuchar. Let me say that Senator Klobuchar, in the Commerce Committee \nworking on tourism following my chairmanship of the tourism \nsubcommittee, has taken on this issue with gusto and is a very \nimportant part of getting this done. My hope is that when we finish \nthis, when the President signs this bill, all of us will understand \nthat at a time when there is so much partisanship, and when it appears \nto the American people that so little can be agreed upon and that so \nlittle gets done--there is all that notion out there--the fact is, this \nis bipartisan, good for the country, will reduce the budget deficit, \nand it will increase jobs and put people back to work.\n  If ever something had all of the things that are necessary to have \nmerit and to be worthy, this legislation surely does that.\n  My colleague from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, as I indicated, has \ndone yeoman's work with me and others to put this together. We hope, of \ncourse, those who would come to our country would especially visit \nNorth Dakota and Minnesota and stay for a very long period of time--\nyes, we all have parochial interests--and perhaps North Dakota even \nmore than Minnesota, I might say from my own perspective. I do think it \nis seldom that we can come to the floor and say here is a piece of \nlegislation that Republicans and Democrats support.\n  We had one vote on it already. It had 79 votes in support in the \nSenate. Seldom can we say here is a bill that is bipartisan that does a \nlot of good things for our country.\n  Thanks to the majority leader for putting this back on the floor. I \ncongratulate him for his work on it and my colleague Senator Klobuchar \nas well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dorgan for his great \nleadership. For so long, he has been working on this. I have a feeling \nthis is finally going to get done. It is true and we invite the \nPresiding Officer to visit North Dakota and Minnesota. I think he \nthinks the State of New Mexico is pretty cool, but he has never been to \nTeddy Roosevelt Park in North Dakota.\n  So often marketing campaigns for our country are done by specific \ncities such as Las Vegas and New York, which is important. But when you \nlook\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nat this country, marketing our country as a whole is going to mean \nsomething. We are competing against countries the world over that do \nthis all the time. That is why we have seen a 20-percent decrease in \ninternational visitors.\n  When I held a hearing on this issue, along with former Senator \nMartinez, this past year, there was a story in the Washington Post, in \ngood humor, about all the Senators hawking their own States and the \ndeals you could get--whether it was Senator Begich's $99 cruise in \nAlaska or the stuff I talked about with Duluth, MN. We were doing that \nbecause people need to know about the opportunities in America. Doing \nit at a Commerce Committee hearing is not going to be anything compared \nto what France, Indonesia, and other countries are doing. They are \nbringing in visitors. They spend thousands and thousands of dollars.\n  We are doing this jobs bill this week, and an important part of that \nis the travel industry because it employs one out of eight Americans.\n  What will this bill do? One, as Senator Dorgan mentioned, it will \ngive us the ability to market our country. Second, it will give us the \nfunds we need to better process the visas because it is expected to \nbring in--and this is the estimate of the nonpartisan organization--1.6 \nmillion new international visitors each year. They spend $4,500 on \naverage when they come here. You can do the math--1.6 million new \nvisitors times $4,500 every single year. There is some expectation that \nthe bill could generate $4 billion in new spending and $321 million in \nFederal tax revenue. In addition, the bill is estimated to create \n41,000 new jobs.\n  What is the cost to the taxpayer? I have been pushing on deficit \nreduction, but what is the cost to the taxpayer? Zero. I think that is \na great thing about this bill. We are doing something to create jobs. \nWe are doing it at zero cost. As you know, there is a small fee on \nforeign visitors to our country, like other countries do to our people \nwhen they visit--with Canada exempted.\n  What I found out is that the people who care about this bill are not \njust in the Halls of Congress and in our major cities. When I was in \nGrand Marais, International Falls, Bemidji, and the Brainerd Lakes \narea--home of the statue of Paul Bunion and Babe the Blue Ox--they were \nexcited about this because they have seen a decrease in visitors from \nCanada. They want to be able to market our country.\n  We have gotten so far behind. A lot of people living in, say, France \nare deciding where to go on their summer vacation. They are thinking: \nAm I going to go to America, where maybe it will take months to process \nmy visa, or am I going to spend my vacation in England, just across the \nchannel or maybe I will go to Mexico. That is what is happening. That \nis where we have lost 20 percent of the overseas travel.\n\n  Look at this chart. There were 48 million more global overseas \ntravelers in 2008 than in 2000. More people are traveling. We have seen \nthe marketing power across this world. There were 633,000 fewer who \nhave visited the United States than in 2000. So world travel is going \nup. You can see the big increase globally. But the number of people \ncoming to the United States has gone down. That means less jobs in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I believe we need to be on an equal playing field with \nthe rest of the world. If we want to compete in our goods that we want \nto produce and send overseas, we also have to compete in the tourism \nmarket. In Duluth, MN, it was hard times in the 1980s. It was so bad \nthat they put up a billboard that said:\n\n       Will the last person to leave turn off the lights.\n\n  They rebuilt because they were smart; the businesses were smart about \ntourism. They have beautiful Lake Superior right there. When we did a \ntourism hearing--a field hearing there--they were talking about, \nobviously, how in many areas of the country, with the recession, \nbusiness in convention centers had gone down nationally, and someone \nwhispered, ``Ours has gone up.'' People are looking for different \nthings, and maybe we will have our convention in Duluth, which is a \nlittle less expensive. They can look at Lake Superior instead of \nlooking at the Pacific Ocean.\n  We are proud of this country, and we want other people to visit. We \nwant them to spend their money in America and help create 41,000 new \njobs. That is what this bill is about. I am very hopeful that we are \ngoing to finally get this bill passed and support the tourism part of \nour economy, which employs one in eight Americans. Let's keep it strong \nand going.\n  I see that Senator Dorgan is back. I thank him so much for his \ntremendous leadership. I am proud that I got the opportunity to take \nover the subcommittee that deals with tourism. A lot of the work had \nbeen done on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I mentioned that there are incremental \nways to create jobs, which is important. Senator Reid has taken the \nlead to bring bills to the floor to do that with, earlier this week, \nthe jobs bill that was passed and, in addition, the Travel Promotion \nAct.\n  I want to mention as well that the majority leader indicated he \nintends to bring the FAA Preauthorization Act to the floor of the \nSenate, probably during this work period. It is also going to be job \ncreating. I chaired the Aviation Subcommittee in the Senate. It is very \nimportant that we reauthorize the FAA and pass the legislation called \nNextGen, to do the next generation of air traffic control systems. We \nhave an archaic system of ground-based radar that controls the \nairplanes in the American skies.\n  Most people are walking around with cell phones that have a much more \nsophisticated way of tracking anything--a GPS. Most kids have the \nopportunity to be able to track--if their friends want them to--the \nlocation of their friends at any moment. They can track up to 20 \nfriends.\n  Teenage kids can track their friends, but we cannot track an airplane \nin the sky with a GPS. More commercial airliners are not equipped. We \ndon't have the NextGen system that would modernize our air traffic \ncontrol system and allow them to fly more direct routes from place to \nplace, with less spacing, using less fuel, better for the environment. \nAll of those things will be capable when we modernize the air traffic \ncontrol system and go from a ground-based system to a GPS system for \naviation flights.\n  That is so very important. It is very job creating.\n  I appreciate the majority leader saying that needs to be a priority \nto bring to the floor, get to a conference with the House, and get a \nbill passed and signed by the President.\n  There are also safety issues we have to deal with in the FAA \nReauthorization Act. Tomorrow I will be chairing a hearing in the \nCommerce Subcommittee on Aviation on the Colgan crash in Buffalo, NY, \nthe tragedy that occurred on that winter icy evening, in which the Dash \n8 crashed and took the lives of so many wonderful people and took the \nlife of the pilot and copilot as well.\n  There are so many questions about that flight and the circumstances \nthat led to the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board will be \ntestifying tomorrow at my subcommittee. I will not go into all of the \nissues, but the issue of pilot fatigue, the issue of training--so many \ndifferent issues--the icing issue that occurred that evening. It will \nbe a very important hearing tomorrow.\n  The reason I raise it is the safety issue is so important. Yes, we \nhave a system in which we fly people all over this country and the \nworld. We have not had fatal accidents, by and large, in commercial \naviation. It has been enormously safe. The most recent accidents have \nbeen accidents that have been very substantially investigated. The \nColgan crash in Buffalo, NY, has been investigated now at great length, \nand we will have the results of that and a discussion of that at our \nsubcommittee hearing tomorrow. That will also give us a roadmap of what \nwe might need to address in the FAA reauthorization bill on the safety \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to speak just briefly about \ntoday's vote. Today, this body, in a rare but very welcome moment of at \nleast partial bipartisanship, voted to pass Leader Reid's jobs bill. \nWhile that bill does not include every provision I would like to see, \nit is certainly an important step, and I commend my colleagues from \nboth parties for supporting these provisions to put people back to \nwork.\n  As a Senator from Rhode Island, which currently faces one of the \nhighest unemployment rates in the Nation, at near 13 percent--I know \nthe help contained in this bill, which builds on the programs we passed \nlast year in the Recovery Act, cannot come soon enough. I hope the vote \nis a watershed.\n  Over the past few months, I have heard from hundreds of Rhode \nIslanders who are struggling just to find work. I have heard from \nCarole in North Providence, RI, who had worked all her life but was \nlaid off 2 years ago from her position as a construction project \nmanager. Carole has a bachelor's degree in business administration and \nan associate's degree in architecture and she has plenty of experience \nas a construction project manager. But for 2 years, she has been unable \nto find any work--talented, hard working, and unemployed.\n  I also heard from Nathaniel in Coventry, RI, who recently graduated \nfrom law school. That is a wonderful achievement and is ordinarily a \nbenchmark that kids pass through on the way to success--certainly to \nemployment. But Nathaniel is carrying $100,000 in student loans and \ncannot find a job.\n  I heard from Brian in Saunderstown, an unemployed construction worker \nwho has been unable to find a job for more than a year. He has been \nreceiving unemployment benefits, but he is justifiably concerned that \nthose, too, might soon run out. He loves to work. He doesn't want to be \non unemployment. But right now, in this economy, there is no other \noption for Brian and for his family.\n  Leader Reid's jobs bill--the HIRE Act--will help put Rhode Islanders \nback to work. The bill provides a payroll tax holiday for businesses to \nencourage hiring, increased cashflow for small businesses that can be \nused for investments and payroll expansion, and an expansion of the \nBuild America Bonds program to subsidize and encourage local \ninfrastructure projects. In addition, the HIRE Act extends Federal \nhighway funding through the end of the year, which will make a $225 \nmillion difference for Rhode Island alone in 2010.\n  This legislation will be a big help for my home State, but it is only \na first step toward restoring economic growth. It is certainly not the \nlast step we need to take in this work session. As I said, I hope the \nvote yesterday and today is a watershed. Outside in Washington, the \nheavy snows of February are melting away. Perhaps--just perhaps--the \nblockade that has stifled the Senate is melting away a little also.\n  We must now act to extend unemployment insurance and COBRA subsidies \nto make sure unemployed workers, such as Brian, and their families \ncontinue to be able to pay their bills and to maintain their family \nhealth insurance coverage. I hope we will soon thereafter turn to new \ninvestments in our failing transportation, water, and school \ninfrastructure.\n  We had a hearing in the Budget Committee this morning with \nTransportation Secretary LaHood, and he agreed very strongly that where \nyou have decrepit infrastructure--and everyone knows the United States \nof America has an enormous deficit of decrepit infrastructure--we are \ngoing to need to repair that sooner or later.\n  If we need to repair it sooner or later, why not do it now, while we \nneed the jobs? If we need to repair it sooner or later, repairing it \nnow does not add anything to our Nation's long-term liabilities. \nIndeed, under the old Yankee principle that a stitch in time saves \nnine, under the commonsense principle that when you get to maintenance \nand repair earlier rather than later, it costs less to do the \nmaintenance and repair, there is actually a very strong case to be made \nthat there are net savings from moving the repair of our decrepit \ninfrastructure forward. So it is really a win-win, as Secretary LaHood \nacknowledged.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues as we go \nforward past today's watershed votes and into the following votes to \nhelp restore our economy and meet the needs of Carole and Nathaniel and \nBrian and millions of Americans who are unemployed and need help now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Africa\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Last week I joined my colleague Senator Sherrod Brown of \nOhio on a trip to East Africa. It was an important trip that took us to \nTanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Sudan. We \nwent in to observe American development assistance, to look at programs \nthat help the victims of HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, child and \nmaternal mortality, victims of sexual violence, clean water, sanitation \nissues, democracy, governments, refugees.\n  In a matter of 6 days of traveling on the continent of Africa, \nSenator Brown and I did not have much time to ourselves, but we were \nnot planning any. We spent a lot of time meeting with people, meeting \nwith government officials, meeting with individuals who are part of the \ncurrent political environment of Africa, but also many of their lives \nare touched by programs in which the United States is involved.\n  I could not help but notice as I traveled the extraordinarily \ndedicated Americans who are in our Foreign Service. Many of them are \nposted in places around the world that are not glamorous by any means. \nTheir jobs are hard and sometimes dangerous, and they go to work every \nday without complaint. We need to tip our hats to them as Americans. \nLet me add in there Peace Corps volunteers, many who work for the \nnongovernment organizations, the NGOs. Many Americans serve our best \ninterests around the world every day without fanfare or praise.\n  We went to Tanzania. In Mwanza in Tanzania, we encountered a group of \nyoung Baylor University doctors who are doing part of their residency \nat a regional hospital, one that serves a population of several million \npeople. Can you imagine one hospital serving that many people? That is \nwhat the people are up against in Africa.\n  We met a representative from Abbot Labs from my home State of \nIllinois who was there helping to build a modern laboratory and train \nlocal staff for the hospital.\n  In a small rural village several hours down a dusty, bumpy road from \nthe nearest city, we witnessed a program by the nongovernmental \norganization CARE that helped build a rudimentary but critically \nimportant health clinic.\n  It is hard to describe this to an American, what an African would \ncall a health clinic. It is, in fact, a building without windows but \nwith openings for air to flow through. It is a building that is so \nbasic it does not have running water or electricity. But it is, in \nfact, a building where 168 babies were born last year.\n  When you see this and meet the people who are delivering the babies, \nyou realize that in many parts of Africa health care is very basic. The \nman who runs this clinic has about a year or two of education beyond \nhigh school. The woman who serves him is one who is gifted with not \nonly personal skills but a lot of human experience in delivering \nbabies.\n  What happens if there is a complication in the middle of this village \nin the middle of nowhere with no means of communication? Well, they try \nto get the message to the man who runs the ambulance. The ambulance in \nMwanza is a tricycle, a tricycle with a flat bed on the back. They take \na woman who is needing a Caesarean section, for example, put her on the \nback of this tricycle and take her off for a 4-hour trip to the closest \nhospital. That is maternal and\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\nchildcare in Africa, in Tanzania. We are trying to help through the \norganization CARE that I mentioned earlier.\n  With their help, they have not only brought them the money necessary \nfor their ambulance, this tricycle, they have helped the local \nresidents develop a savings and loan where their modest earnings they \nmake by selling agricultural produce are banked away for a better day. \nThey are allowed to borrow small units of money for buying sewing \nmachines, which can dramatically change a life in these poor villages, \nor livestock or to help to pay for their kids to go to school.\n  In Tanzania as a whole, the PEPFAR program, which is the United \nStates bilateral program for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and \nthe Global Fund Program, a much larger undertaking from many other \ncountries, have made real progress in HIV, TB, and malaria.\n  We also visited Ethiopia, a country I have been looking forward to \nseeing. It has the distinction in Africa of being the only country in \nAfrica that was never colonized. There was a period, a short period of \noccupation by the Italians. But they have been a kingdom under their \nown control, except for that period of time since the early parts of \nthe third and fourth century and maybe even before that. They are very \nproud of their own language, their own customs, their own history. They \nhave tremendous international efforts underway to help the Ethiopian \npeople, who are basically poor, struggling people. They are struggling \nagainst the economics of a poor nation, as well as HIV, AIDS, \ntuberculosis. They are resettling refugees from the war-torn \nneighboring state of Somalia. They are trying to build a health system.\n  One program, in particular, was provided by a nongovernmental \norganization called AMREF in the Kechene slum area of the capital of \nAddis Ababa. Senator Brown and I went to this area. It is a slum with \n380 people living there, that has basically had to carry in water for \nyears because there was no running water. But because of an AMREF \nproject, they were able to build 22 water kiosks in the country and one \nin this slum area. It seems like something so simple, but it has \nchanged their lives. They now have a source of safe drinking water. \nVery near the small little lean-tos they live in, they have two showers \nfor 380 people that they share and can use where they had none before. \nThey have basic sanitation and toilet facilities, which they did not \nhave at all.\n  We were greeted by two beautiful little girls who gave us flowers and \ninvited us to a coffee ceremony.\n  They couldn't help but beam with pride as we took a look at the \nsource of water and sanitation that did not exist before. So many \nthousands of people in Africa spend hours every day carrying water back \nand forth. Young girls are often denied the opportunity to go to school \nbecause they have work to do. They have to carry water. Something as \nbasic as water that we take for granted becomes a centerpiece in their \nlives every single day. Improvements are being made in Ethiopia and \nother places. I returned to Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt is in the eastern section of that country. The capital, Kinshasa, is \nfar west and removed not only physically but politically from many of \nthe things happening in eastern Congo.\n  I try to describe Goma to those who haven't been there. It is almost \nimpossible. Imagine one of the poorest places on Earth, where people \nare literally starving, where they are facing the scourge of disease, \nwhere malaria is the biggest killer of children. Imagine HIV/AIDS and \nthe problems they face with that. Then superimpose over that the \nmisfortune of an ongoing war that has been taking place in the eastern \npart of the Democratic Republic of Congo for years. There is an ongoing \ndebate about how many people have been killed in this war. The debate \nranges from the low number of about 2\\1/2\\ million to the high number \nof 6 million, and they debate very violently about whether it is 6 or \n2\\1/2\\ million. Regardless of which number, it is an outrage. It is a \ngenocide which is occurring in this section of Africa with little or no \nattention from anyone.\n  What has caused this? Their neighbor is Rwanda. If you recall, in \nRwanda, I believe the year was 1994, a terrible genocide killed 800,000 \npeople in the span of a matter of days. Those who were accused of the \ngenocidal acts, many of them escaped into the neighboring country of \nCongo and set up their armed militias. They continued their violence. \nNot only is Goma an area the surrounding towns and villages fought \nover, it also happens to be an area that is dominated by a volcano \nwhich erupted in 2002 and killed hundreds of people and destroyed \nthousands of basic shelters. It is also an area filled with minerals \nand timber, gold, diamonds, basic minerals needed for the cell phones \nwe take for granted every single day. There is money to be made, even \nif you just take out your shovel and dig into the hillside and find \nsome of these for sale. It is a rich area in mineral resources.\n  It is also rich in other resources. Dian Fossey has her operation \nthere for the silverback gorillas, which many of us have seen on \ntelevision. They are caught in the middle of the crossfire of the civil \nwar. I came back to Goma. I had been there several years ago. I was \nsurprised at how many people said they remembered I had been there and \nnever thought I would return because few people do; it is such a hard, \ndifficult place. We visited a hospital there called Heal Africa. We \nwere greeted by a lady with a British accent. As I came in, she said: \nWelcome back. I thought she made a mistake. She thinks I am somebody \nelse. It turns out that, in fact, I had visited her hospital 5 years \nago. It had changed so much, I didn't recognize it, but she was still \nthere.\n  Her name is Lynne Lucy. Her husband Joe is a Congolese surgeon and \nthey married years ago and decided to start a hospital for the poorest \npeople in that part of Congo. They focus on children with club feet and \ncleft palates. They focus on trauma victims, setting fractures, victims \nof fires, and other accidents that occur. Their major area of focus is \non the women who are the victims of the civil war. One of the most \nhorrible things about this war isn't only that people die, but they \nhave now built in hideous torture techniques as part of this civil war. \nWomen are raped and gang raped and children are mutilated in hideous, \nawful ways. They bring them into this hospital and try to rebuild their \nbodies and rebuild their lives. God bless them for doing it, Joe and \nLynne Lucy.\n  When I was there last, I worried because they only had a handful of \ndoctors. This time I walked into a classroom filled with doctors. \nStanding in front of them was a doctor from the University of \nWisconsin, right smack-dab in a part of the Midwest of which I am proud \nto be a part, training these doctors on how to treat these poor people. \nThere is evidence of the caring and compassionate people of the United \nStates all around the world. In this sad situation in Goma, certainly \nit is needed.\n  We have a 20,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force known as MONUC that \nhas been in the area for more than 10 years trying to bring peace. \nUnfortunately, rebel groups continue campaigns of brutal violence. \nKnown war criminals such as Jean Bosco Ntaganda continue to play a role \nin the violence, despite being wanted for awful war crimes. The \nCongolese military has tried to root out several groups but has \nembraced others. It is hard to figure out the good and bad people in \nthis conflict. But you can certainly figure out the victims because you \nsee them everywhere.\n  We went to what is known as an internally displaced persons camp just \nsouth of Goma. I find it hard to imagine how people live there. There \nare 1,800 people living there. Imagine that they are living on volcanic \nrock. It is hard to walk on it even with shoes because it is jagged and \nhurts your feet. They live on it. They pitch tents on it. They walk \ntheir kids to school on it. We went to a little health clinic there and \na baby was handed to me that was a heartbreaking situation, clearly \nmalnourished, who had just been brought in for a few days. They were \ntrying to rescue its life. Many of the children there struggle with \nbasic health needs. They have a school which is better than most would \nfind in their home villages and some security. But each of them told \nme: We don't have enough food. You look at their sources of water, they \nare limited. It is a tough situation. These people are there because \nthey were caught in the crossfire of a war that continues. They didn't \ndo\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\nanything wrong. Some of them are trying to rebuild their lives and stay \nsafe in a very difficult situation.\n  Finally, we had a chance to visit Sudan. I wished to go there because \nI have stood on the floor so many times and given speeches about Darfur \nand the genocide that occurred there. In addition to that troubled part \nof Sudan, there has been an ongoing battle between north and south \nSudan which appears to have resolved itself peacefully with an election \nthat will be held in the near future for the national legislature and \nthen early next year to decide if south Sudan will be a separate \ncountry. There are about 8 million people living in south Sudan. We \ntraveled on the only road in south Sudan. We met with the man who is \nVice President of Sudan now and would be President, I believe, of the \nnew south Sudan, Mr. Salva Kiir. He is a former rebel who fought in the \nbush for years, surrounded by Governors in south Sudan who went through \nthe same experience. In just a few months, they may need to build a \nnation. It is a daunting task.\n  I worry about it because when there is a power vacuum and a failed \nstate in Africa, people move in on it and use it for exploitive and \nterrorist purposes.\n  We then went to Khartoum, which is a legendary city in Africa, and \nmet with representatives of the government there, talking about many of \nthe issues they face and the status of Darfur today which, thank God, \nis more peaceful than in years gone by. One of the more interesting \nconversations we had in Khartoum was with one of the Ministers. I \nbrought up the issue of global warming, wondering if this man in the \nmiddle of Africa, near the Equator, felt there was a need for us to be \nconcerned about global warming.\n  He said: I can take you 300 meters from where we are meeting now. I \nwill show you the Nile River, and I will show you the impact of global \nwarming. We could walk out into stretches of land that used to be \nislands in the middle of the river. You can walk there now because the \nriver is so low. Many people in that part of Africa depend on the Nile \nfor irrigation. We believe in global warming.\n  If you want to know one of the causes of the genocide in Darfur, it \nwas because that area is becoming a desert, and people are fighting \nover what is left of land that can be cultivated. I think about debates \nwe have had on the floor of the Senate. In fact, there are Senators who \nproudly say there is no such thing as global warming. I wish they could \nhave been with me in Khartoum and spoken to this man about evidence he \nis seeing in that faraway place about changing climate and changes in \nlifestyle, genocide, and war that have followed global warming. It is \nnot just an environmental issue. It is a security issue.\n\n  There are frequent debates about the value of U.S. foreign \nassistance. When Americans are asked, how much do we spend in foreign \naid, the most common response is, about 25 percent of the Federal \nbudget. The fact is, it is just over 1 percent in foreign aid around \nthe world. We spend far less as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct than many nations. But the work we do is so absolutely \nessential for maintaining life, fighting disease, for making certain \nthat young people have a fighting chance.\n  President Obama recognizes that. I hope we can have bipartisan \nsupport to continue our help with foreign aid, even in this difficult \ntime.\n  The last issue I will discuss on this trip Senator Brown and I took \nis one I will save for a separate presentation. But without fail, in \nevery African nation, I would ask them the same question: What is the \npresence of China in your nation? Without fail, they would say: It is \ninteresting you would ask.\n  The Chinese are moving into Africa in a way we should not ignore. \nThey are providing capital assistance and loans to countries all over \nAfrica, which can provide them with minerals and resources for their \neconomy and, ultimately, with markets for their products. Leaders in \nAfrica, such as the President of Ethiopia, say to me: When the West \nwalked away from Africa, China stepped in.\n  The Chinese have a strategy and a goal. If we don't become sensitive \nto it and what it will mean to the next generation of people living in \neach of those countries, we will pay a heavy price. We have to \nunderstand that these people now may be in underdeveloped countries and \nstruggling, but tomorrow they will have a middle class, and they will \nbe purchasing goods and services. They will remember that their \nhighways and stadiums and schools were built with loans from the \nChinese. Incidentally, those loans come with strings attached. When the \nChinese loan money to a country such as Ethiopia, it is so a Chinese \nconstruction company can build the project using Chinese engineers, \ntechnicians, and workers. So they are providing work projects with the \nmoney they are loaning to each country and being repaid in local \nresources such as oil and minerals.\n  We can't ignore this reality. It is happening all over the world. The \nChinese have a plan. I am not sure America has a plan. We should.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/24/senate-section/article/S732-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S732-S736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HANDLING OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS\n\n  Mr. President, in recent weeks, my Republican colleagues have \ndirected a barrage of criticism at President Obama for his handling of \nterrorist cases, and I wish to respond.\n  Let's start with the recent case of Umar Faruk Abdulmutallab, the man \nwho tried to explode a bomb on a plane around Christmas when it was \nlanding in Detroit. My colleagues on the other side have been very \ncritical of the FBI's decision to give Miranda warnings to \nAbdulmutallab.\n  The Republican minority leader recently said, referring to \nAbdulmutallab:\n\n       He was given a 50 minute interrogation, probably Larry King \n     has interrogated people longer and better than that. After \n     which he was assigned a lawyer who told him to shut up.\n\n  That is what the minority leader said. But here are the facts. \nExperienced counterterrorism agents from the FBI interrogated \nAbdulmutallab when he arrived in Detroit. According to the Justice \nDepartment, during this initial interrogation, the FBI ``obtained \nintelligence that has already proved useful in the fight against Al \nQaeda.'' After the interrogation, Abdulmutallab refused to cooperate \nfurther with the FBI. Only then, after his refusal, did the FBI give \nhim a Miranda warning. What the FBI did in this case was nothing new. \nDuring the Bush administration, the FBI also gave Miranda warnings to \nterrorists detained in the United States.\n  I respect Senator McConnell, but I say, respectfully, that he got his \nfacts wrong as stated on the floor of the Senate. Frankly, this \nunfounded criticism of the FBI and their techniques should be \ncorrected. That is why I stand here today.\n  Attorney General Eric Holder recently sent a detailed, 5-page letter \nto Senator McConnell explaining what actually happened in this case.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing in reply to your \n     letter of January 26, 2010, inquiring about the decision to \n     charge Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab with federal crimes in \n     connection with the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines \n     Flight 253 near Detroit on December 25, 2009, rather than \n     detaining him under the law of war. An identical response is \n     being sent to the other Senators who joined in your letter.\n       The decision to charge Mr. Abdulmutallab in federal court, \n     and the methods used to interrogate him, are fully consistent \n     with the long-established and publicly known policies and \n     practices of the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the \n     United States Government as a whole, as implemented for many \n     years by Administrations of both parties. Those policies and \n     practices, which were not criticized when employed by \n     previous Administrations, have been and remain extremely \n     effective in protecting national security. They are among the \n     many powerful weapons this country can and should use to win \n     the war against al-Qaeda.\n       I am confident that, as a result of the hard work of the \n     FBI and our career federal prosecutors, we will be able to \n     successfully prosecute Mr. Abdulmutallab under the federal \n     criminal law. I am equally confident that the decision to \n     address Mr. Abdulmutallab's actions through our criminal \n     justice system has not, and will not, compromise our ability \n     to obtain information needed to detect and prevent future \n     attacks. There are many examples of successful terrorism \n     investigations\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\n     and prosecutions, both before and after September 11, 2001, \n     in which both of these important objectives have been \n     achieved--all in a manner consistent with our law and our \n     national security interests. Mr. Abdulmutallab was questioned \n     by experienced counterterrorism agents from the FBI in the \n     hours immediately after the failed bombing attempt and \n     provided intelligence, and more recently, he has provided \n     additional intelligence to the FBI that we are actively using \n     to help protect our country. We will continue to share the \n     information we develop with others in the intelligence \n     community and actively follow up on that information around \n     the world.\n       1. Detention. I made the decision to charge Mr. \n     Abdulmutallab with federal crimes, and to seek his detention \n     in connection with those charges, with the knowledge of, and \n     with no objection from, all other relevant departments of the \n     government. On the evening of December 25 and again on the \n     morning of December 26, the FBI informed its partners in the \n     Intelligence Community that Abdulmutallab would be charged \n     criminally, and no agency objected to this course of \n     action. In the days following December 25--including \n     during a meeting with the President and other senior \n     members of his national security team on January 5--high-\n     level discussions ensued within the Administration in \n     which the possibility of detaining Mr. Abdulmutallab under \n     the law of war was explicitly discussed. No agency \n     supported the use of law of war detention for \n     Abdulmutallab, and no agency has since advised the \n     Department of Justice that an alternative course of action \n     should have been, or should now be, pursued.\n       Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the practice of the \n     U.S. government, followed by prior and current \n     Administrations without a single exception, has been to \n     arrest and detain under federal criminal law all terrorist \n     suspects who are apprehended inside the United States. The \n     prior Administration adopted policies expressly endorsing \n     this approach. Under a policy directive issued by President \n     Bush in 2003, for example, ``the Attorney General has lead \n     responsibility for criminal investigations of terrorist acts \n     or terrorist threats by individuals or groups inside the \n     United States, or directed at United States citizens or \n     institutions abroad, where such acts are within the Federal \n     criminal jurisdiction or the United States, as well as for \n     related intelligence collection activities within the United \n     States.'' Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5, \n     February 28, 2003). The directive goes on to provide that \n     ``[f]ollowing a terrorist threat or an actual incident that \n     falls within the criminal jurisdiction of the United States, \n     the full capabilities of the United States shall be \n     dedicated, consistent with United States law and with \n     activities of other Federal departments and agencies to \n     protect our national security, to assisting the Attorney \n     General to identify the perpetrators and bring them to \n     justice.''\n       In keeping with this policy, the Bush Administration used \n     the criminal justice system to convict more than 300 \n     individuals on terrorism-related charges. For example, \n     Richard Reid, a British citizen, was arrested in December \n     2001 for attempting to ignite a shoe bomb while on a flight \n     from Paris to Miami carrying 184 passengers and 14 \n     crewmembers. He was advised of his right to remain silent and \n     to consult with an attorney within five minutes of being \n     removed from the aircraft (and was read or reminded of these \n     rights a total of four times within 48 hours), pled guilty in \n     October 2002, and is now serving a life sentence in federal \n     prison. In 2003, Iyman Faris, a U.S. citizen from Pakistan, \n     pled guilty to conspiracy and providing material support to \n     al-Qaeda for providing the terrorist organization with \n     information about possible U.S. targets for attack. Among \n     other things, he was tasked by al-Qaeda operatives overseas \n     to assess the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City as a possible \n     post-9/11 target of destruction. After initially providing \n     significant information and assistance to law enforcement \n     personnel, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 2002, \n     the ``Lackawanna Six'' were charged with conspiring, \n     providing, and attempting to provide material support to al-\n     Qaeda based upon their pre-9/11 travel to Afghanistan to \n     train in the Al Farooq camp operated by al-Qaeda. They pled \n     guilty, agreed to cooperate, and were sentenced to terms \n     ranging from seven to ten years in prison. There are many \n     other examples of successful terrorism prosecutions--ranging \n     from Zacarias Moussaoui (convicted in 2006 in connection with \n     the 9/11 attacks and sentenced to life in prison) to Ahmed \n     Omar Abu Ali (convicted in 2005 of conspiracy to assassinate \n     the President and other charges and sentenced to life in \n     prison) to Ahmed Ressam (convicted in 2001 for the Millenium \n     plot to bomb the Los Angeles airport and sentenced to 22 \n     years, a sentence recently reversed as too lenient and \n     remanded for resentencing)--which I am happy to provide upon \n     request.\n       In fact, two (and only two) persons apprehended in this \n     country in recent times have been held under the law of war. \n     Jose Padilla was arrested on a federal material witness \n     warrant in 2002, and was transferred to law of war custody \n     approximately one month later, after his court-appointed \n     counsel moved to vacate the warrant. Ali Saleh Kahlah Al-\n     Marri was also initially arrested on a material witness \n     warrant in 2001, was indicted on federal criminal charges \n     (unrelated to terrorism) in 2002, and then transferred to law \n     of war custody approximately eighteen months later. In both \n     of these cases, the transfer to law of war custody raised \n     serious statutory and constitutional questions in the courts \n     concerning the lawfulness of the government's actions and \n     spawned lengthy litigation. In Mr. Padilla's case, the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the \n     President did not have the authority to detain him under the \n     law of war. In Mr. Al-Marri's case, the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed a prior panel \n     decision and found in a fractured en banc opinion that the \n     President did have authority to detain Mr. Al-Marri, but that \n     he had not been afforded sufficient process to challenge his \n     designation as an enemy combatant. Ultimately, both Al-Marri \n     (in 2009) and Padilla (in 2006) were returned to law \n     enforcement custody, convicted of terrorism charges and \n     sentenced to prison.\n       When Flight 253 landed in Detroit, the men and women of the \n     FBI and the Department of Justice did precisely what they are \n     trained to do, what their policies require them to do, and \n     what this nation expects them to do. In the face of the \n     emergency, they acted quickly and decisively to ensure the \n     detention and incapacitation of the individual identified as \n     the would-be bomber. They did so by following the established \n     practice and policy of prior and current Administrations, and \n     detained Mr. Abdulmutallab for violations of federal criminal \n     law.\n       2. Interrogation. The interrogation of Abdulmutallab was \n     handled in accordance with FBI policy that has governed \n     interrogation of every suspected terrorist apprehended in the \n     United States for many years. Across many Administrations, \n     both before and after 9/11, the consistent, well-known, \n     lawful, and publicly-stated policy of the FBI has been to \n     provide Miranda warnings prior to any custodial interrogation \n     conducted inside the United States. The FBI's current Miranda \n     policy, adopted during the prior Administration, provides \n     explicitly that ``[w]ithin the United States, Miranda \n     warnings are required to be given prior to custodial \n     interviews. . . .'' In both terrorism and non-terrorism \n     cases, the widespread experience of law enforcement \n     agencies, including the FBI, is that many defendants will \n     talk and cooperate with law enforcement agents after being \n     informed of their right to remain silent and to consult \n     with an attorney. Examples include L'Houssaine Kherchtou, \n     who was advised of his Miranda rights, cooperated with the \n     government and provided critical intelligence on al-Qaeda, \n     including their interest in using piloted planes as \n     suicide bombers, and Nuradin Abdi, who provided \n     significant information after being repeatedly advised of \n     his Miranda rights over a two-week period. During an \n     international terrorism investigation regarding Operation \n     Crevice, law enforcement agents gained valuable \n     intelligence regarding al-Qaeda military commanders and \n     suspects involved in bombing plots in the U.K. from a \n     defendant who agreed to cooperate after being advised of, \n     and waiving his Miranda rights. Other terrorism subjects \n     cooperate voluntarily with law enforcement without the \n     need to provide Miranda warnings because of the non-\n     custodial nature of the interview or cooperate after their \n     arrest and agree to debriefings in thc presence of their \n     attorneys. Many of these subjects have provided vital \n     intelligence on al-Qaeda, including several members of the \n     Lackawanna Six, described above, who were arrested and \n     provided information about the Al Farooq training camp in \n     Afghanistan; and Mohammad Warsame, who voluntarily \n     submitted to interviews with the FBI and provided \n     intelligence on his contacts with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. \n     There are other examples which I am happy to provide upon \n     request. There are currently other terrorism suspects who \n     have cooperated and are providing valuable intelligence \n     information whose identities cannot be publicly disclosed.\n       The initial questioning of Abdulmutallab was conducted \n     without Miranda warnings under a public safety exception that \n     has been recognized by the courts. Subsequent questioning was \n     conducted with Miranda warnings, as required by FBI policy, \n     after consultation between FBI agents in the field and at FBI \n     Headquarters, and career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office and at the Department of Justice. Neither advising \n     Abdulmutallab of his Miranda rights nor granting him access \n     to counsel prevents us from obtaining intelligence from him, \n     however. On the contrary, history shows that the federal \n     justice system is an extremely effective tool for gathering \n     intelligence. The Department of Justice has a long track \n     record of using the prosecution and sentencing process as a \n     lever to obtain valuable intelligence, and we are actively \n     deploying those tools in this case as well.\n       Some have argued that had Abdulmutallab been declared an \n     enemy combatant, the government could have held him \n     indefinitely without providing him access to an attorney. But \n     the government's legal authority to do so is far from clear. \n     In fact, when the Bush administration attempted to deny Jose \n     Padilla access to an attorney, a federal judge in New York \n     rejected that position, ruling that Padilla must be allowed \n     to meet with his lawyer. Notably, the judge in that case was \n     Michael Mukasey, my predecessor as Attorney General. In fact, \n     there is no court-approved system currently in place in which \n     suspected terrorists captured inside the United States can be \n     detained and held without access to an attorney; nor is there \n     any known mechanism to persuade an uncooperative individual \n     to talk to the government\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\n     that has been proven more effective than the criminal justice \n     system. Moreover, while in some cases defense counsel may \n     advise their clients to remain silent, there are situations \n     in which they properly and wisely encourage cooperation \n     because it is in their client's best interest, given the \n     substantial sentences they might face.\n       3. The Criminal Justice System as a National Security Tool. \n     As President Obama has made clear repeatedly, we are at war \n     against a dangerous, intelligent, and adaptable enemy. Our \n     goal in this war, as in all others, is to win. Victory means \n     defeating the enemy without damaging the fundamental \n     principles on which our nation was founded. To do that, we \n     must use every weapon at our disposal. Those weapons include \n     direct military action, military justice, intelligence, \n     diplomacy, and civilian law enforcement. Each of these \n     weapons has virtues and strengths, and we use each of them in \n     the appropriate situations.\n       Over the past year, we have used the criminal justice \n     system to disrupt a number of plots, including one in New \n     York and Colorado that might have been the deadliest attack \n     on our country since September 11, 2001, had it been \n     successful. The backbone of that effort is the combined work \n     of thousands of FBI agents, state and local police officers, \n     career prosecutors, and intelligence officials around the \n     world who go to work every day to help prevent terrorist \n     attacks. I am immensely proud of their efforts. At the same \n     time, we have worked in concert with our partners in the \n     military and the Intelligence Community to support their \n     tremendous work to defeat the terrorists and with our \n     partners overseas who have great faith in our criminal \n     justice system.\n       The criminal justice system has proven to be one of the \n     most effective weapons available to our government for both \n     incapacitating terrorists and collecting intelligence from \n     them. Removing this highly effective weapon from our arsenal \n     would be as foolish as taking our military and intelligence \n     options off the table against al-Qaeda, and as dangerous. In \n     fact, only by using all of our instruments of national power \n     in concert can we be truly effective. As Attorney General, I \n     am guided not by partisanship or political considerations, \n     but by a commitment to using the most effective course of \n     action in each case, depending on the facts of each case, to \n     protect the American people, defeat our enemies, and ensure \n     the rule of law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Eric H. Holder, Jr.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Here is what General Holder said:\n\n       Across many administrations, both before and after 9/11, \n     the consistent, well-known, lawful, and publicly stated \n     policy of the FBI has been to provide Miranda warnings prior \n     to any custodial interrogation conducted inside the United \n     States.\n\n  In fact, the Bush administration adopted new policies for the FBI \nthat said ``Within the United States, Miranda warnings are required to \nbe given prior to custodial interviews.'' That was a requirement from \nthe Bush administration. Senator McConnell and others have tried to \npoliticize this issue when the facts tell us otherwise.\n  Let's take one example from the Bush administration. Richard Reid, \nthe shoe bomber, tried to detonate an explosive in his shoe on a flight \nfrom Paris to Miami in December 2001.\n  This was very similar to the attempted attack by Abdulmutallab, \nanother foreign terrorist who also tried to detonate a bomb on a plane. \nSo how does the Bush administration's handling of the shoe bomber, Mr. \nReid, compare with the Obama administration's handling of \nAbdulmutallab? The Bush administration detained and charged Reid as a \ncriminal. They gave Reid a Miranda warning within 5 minutes of being \nremoved from the airplane and they reminded him of his Miranda rights \nfour times within the first 48 hours he was detained.\n  Has America heard that side of the story, as we have heard all these \ncriticisms about Miranda warnings for Abdulmutallab?\n  The Republicans have been very critical of the Obama administration \nfor giving a Miranda warning to this Detroit, attempted, would-be \nbomber 9 hours after he was first detained, after a 50-minute \ninterrogation. But they did not criticize their own Republican \nPresident when his administration gave a Miranda warning to the shoe \nbomber 5 minutes after he was detained, and before he was interrogated \nat all.\n  How do they square this? How can they be so critical of President \nObama when a similar parallel case was treated so differently under the \nRepublican President?\n  In mid-January, Abdulmutallab began talking again to FBI \ninterrogators and providing valuable intelligence--after the Miranda \nwarnings. FBI Director Robert Mueller described it this way:\n\n       . . . over a period of time, we have been successful in \n     obtaining intelligence, not just on day one, but on day two, \n     day three, day four, and day five, down the road.\n\n  According to another law enforcement official:\n\n       The information has been active, useful, and we have been \n     following up. The intelligence is not stale.\n\n  How did this happen? The Obama administration convinced \nAbdulmutallab's family to come to the United States. Then he started \ntalking. And his family persuaded him to cooperate.\n  This is a very different approach than we saw in the previous \nadministration, when detainees who refused to talk were subjected to \ntorture techniques such as waterboarding.\n  Real life is not like the TV show ``24.'' On TV, when Jack Bauer \ntortures someone, the suspect immediately admits everything he knows. \nHere is what we learned during the Bush administration. In real life, \nwhen people are tortured, they will say anything to make the pain stop. \nSo they often provide false information, not valuable intelligence.\n  Richard Clarke was the senior counterterrorism adviser to President \nClinton and President George W. Bush. Here is what he said recently \nabout the Obama administration's approach:\n\n       The FBI is good at getting people to talk . . . they have \n     been much more successful than the previous attempts of \n     torturing people and trying to convince them to give \n     information that way.\n\n  Would Abdulmutallab's family have traveled to the United States and \npersuaded him to cooperate if they thought he was being tortured here? \nI do not think so. A senior Obama administration official said:\n\n       One of the principal reasons why his family came back is \n     that they had complete trust in the U.S. system of justice \n     and believed that [their son] would be treated fairly and \n     appropriately.\n\n  You do not hear that much. There is a belief that if you do not \nwaterboard a person or torture them, you are not going to get \ninformation. Exactly the opposite happened here. This man was treated \nrespectfully through our system of justice. He was not given special \nfavors. He was treated like the criminal who I believe he is, and yet \nhe was treated in such a manner that his family was willing to come to \nthe United States and beg him to cooperate with our government, which \nhe did at the end of the day.\n  So how do my Republican colleagues respond to this development? Did \nthey commend the Obama administration for successfully bringing his \nfamily over and getting more information? No. They now claim the \nintelligence from him was worthless. They have no basis for saying \nthat, but they do anyway.\n  During the previous administration, Republicans argued that detainees \nheld at Guantanamo were still providing valuable intelligence for years \nafter they were arrested. Now they are saying that days and weeks after \nAbdulmutallab was arrested his intelligence was worthless. They cannot \nhave it both ways.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that Abdulmutallab \nshould be held in military detention as an enemy combatant. But \nterrorists arrested in the United States have always been held under \nour criminal laws. Here is what Attorney General Eric Holder said in \nhis letter to Senator McConnell:\n\n       Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the practice of the \n     U.S. government, followed by prior and current \n     Administrations without a single exception, has been to \n     arrest and detain under federal criminal law all terrorist \n     suspects who are apprehended inside the United States.\n\n  Without exception. That was the standard under the Bush \nadministration.\n  The Bush administration did move two terror suspects out of the \ncriminal justice system after they were arrested. One of them was Jose \nPadilla. He was designated as an enemy combatant and transferred to \nmilitary detention. But then what happened? In a court filing, the Bush \nadministration admitted that Padilla had not talked to his \ninterrogators for 7 months. They said:\n\n       There are numerous examples of situations where \n     interrogators have been unable to obtain valuable \n     intelligence from a subject until months--or even years, \n     after the interrogation process began.\n\n  Two important points about the Padilla case: My Republican colleagues\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\ncriticize the Obama administration for holding Abdulmutallab under our \ncriminal laws. But Padilla was held in military detention and the Bush \nadministration acknowledged that he did not talk to his interrogators \nfor at least 7 months. Second, Republicans argue that intelligence from \nAbdulmutallab, after several weeks in detention, was stale and \nworthless, but the Bush administration argued that information gathered \nfrom Padilla after months--or even years--was still valuable.\n  There is no consistency in the position they have taken on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  In the end, the Bush administration changed course on Padilla. They \ntransferred him back to the criminal justice system for prosecution. He \nwas convicted. He is now serving a long sentence in a Federal supermax \nprison--convicted in our criminal courts.\n  What about the shoe bomber? Richard Reid was also prosecuted and \nconvicted in the criminal justice system. He is now serving a life \nsentence without parole in a Federal supermax prison, where he will \nnever again threaten an American life.\n  My Republican colleagues did not complain when the Bush \nadministration prosecuted Reid and Padilla in criminal courts. But now \nthey argue terrorists such as Abdulmutallab and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed \nshould be tried in military commissions only because Federal courts are \nnot well suited to prosecute terrorists.\n  Well, let's look at the numbers. Since 9/11, 195 terrorists have \nsuccessfully been prosecuted and convicted in our Federal court system. \nBesides Reid and Padilla, here are just a few of the terrorists who \nhave been convicted in our Federal court system and are now serving \nlong prison sentences: Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing; Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheikh; \nand the 20th 9/11 hijacker, Zacarias Moussaoui, who was tried across \nthe river in Virginia and now sits in a prison cell in Florence, CO.\n\n  Compare this with the track record of military commissions. Some \nwould have us believe that military commissions have been so much more \neffective in going after terrorists. So let's look at the record. Mr. \nPresident, 195 terrorists have been successfully prosecuted and \nconvicted in our criminal courts. How about military commissions? Since \n9/11, only three individuals have been convicted by military \ncommissions--that is 195 to 3--and two of those individuals spent less \nthan a year in prison and are now living freely in their home countries \nof Australia and Yemen.\n  GEN Colin Powell, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nSecretary of State under President Bush, supports prosecuting \nterrorists in Federal courts. Here is what he said about military \ncommissions last week:\n\n       The suggestion that somehow a military commission is the \n     way to go isn't borne out by the history of the military \n     commissions.\n\n  What would GEN Colin Powell know about the history of military \ncommissions? A heck of a lot, having given his life to the U.S. \nmilitary in dedication to his country. His opinion means a lot to me.\n  Military commissions are unproven venues, which ultimately may serve \nus well in some circumstances, but to say they are all good and courts \nare all bad is to ignore the obvious and ignore the evidence.\n  Just 2 days ago, there was more compelling evidence about the \neffectiveness of Federal courts. Attorney General Holder announced that \nNajibullah Zazi has pleaded guilty to plotting to bomb the New York \nsubway system. Zazi, who planned the bombing with al-Qaida while he was \nin Pakistan, could be sentenced to life in prison without parole--\nconvicted in the Federal criminal courts.\n  Here is what Attorney General Holder said about the subway bombing \nplot:\n\n       This is one of the most serious terrorist threats to our \n     nation since September 11th, 2001 . . . This attempted attack \n     on our homeland was real, it was in motion, and it would have \n     been deadly. . . . In this case as in so many others, the \n     criminal justice system has proved to be an invaluable weapon \n     for disrupting plots and incapacitating terrorists.\n\n  I hope all my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--will join me in \ncommending the Obama administration for their success in disrupting \nthis dangerous plot and bringing Zazi to justice. I sincerely hope this \ncase will cause some of the critics of trying terrorists in Federal \ncourts pause to at least reflect on the obvious. This was a successful \nprosecution--another one, 195 of them since 9/11.\n  There is a great irony here. For 8 long years, during the Bush-Cheney \nadministration, Republicans used to argue that we should not criticize \nthe administration's national security policies. Time and again, they \ntold us it was inappropriate--maybe even un-American, some of them \nsaid--for Congress to ask basic questions about the Bush \nadministration's policies on issues like Iraq, Guantanamo, torture, \nwarrantless wiretapping. Time and again, we were reminded there is only \none Commander-in-Chief. But now Republicans feel it is fair game to \nsecond-guess every decision President Obama makes in the area of \ncombating terrorism.\n  I think we have a right, an obligation, as Senators, to ask questions \nof all Presidents regardless of party. But I think we also have an \nobligation for fairness and balance, as one of the notorious networks \nsays. In this case, I think if you look at the evidence in a fair and \nbalanced fashion, you can see we are in a situation where the approach \nof using Federal criminal courts has worked. It has worked because we \nknow we have the very best in the FBI and the Department of Justice, \nand they have a track record of success. We have an obligation to get \nthe facts right when we either defend or criticize the President.\n  I am also concerned about the tone of some of the criticism we have \nheard. We can surely disagree with this administration, but when I hear \nthe President's critics suggest that he is soft on terrorism and he \ndoes not care about defending our country, that goes over the line, as \nfar as I am concerned.\n  Recently, Senator McConnell gave a speech to the Heritage Foundation, \na conservative think tank on Capitol Hill, and he said the Obama \nadministration ``has a pre-9/11 mindset'' and ``has a blind spot when \nit comes to prosecuting this war.'' I think those statements go too \nfar.\n  GEN Colin Powell has a different opinion, different than Senator \nMcConnell. Here is what he said last weekend:\n\n       To suggest that somehow we have become much less safe \n     because of the actions of the administration, I don't think \n     that's borne out by the facts.\n\n  What is the motivation for this criticism of the President? Well, as \nSenator McConnell said to the Heritage Foundation:\n\n       You can campaign on these issues anywhere in America.\n\n  I guess he is right. I guess there is always room for fear, and \npeddling fear is something that is going to appeal to a lot of people. \nIt is right that we be mindful of the threat of terrorism and we do \neverything in our power to stop it from ever occurring again. But \nliving and quivering in fear, is that what America should be all about?\n  Richard Clarke, the senior counterterrorism adviser to Presidents \nClinton and Bush, said:\n\n       Recent months have seen the party out of power picking \n     fights over the conduct of our efforts against Al Qaeda, \n     often with total disregard to the facts and frequently \n     blowing issues totally out of proportion, while ignoring the \n     more important challenges we face in defeating terrorists.\n\n  Mr. President, 9 years after 9/11, al-Qaida still is a serious threat \nto America. We know that terrorists are plotting to attack us even as \nwe speak. President Obama knows it as well. He understands as Commander \nin Chief that he has a special commitment to the American people to \nkeep us safe. Congress is a political body and this is an election \nyear, but this issue is too important to become a political football. \nDemocrats and Republicans should be united in supporting all of the \nefforts of all of the good men and women, including the President, in \ntrying to fight terrorism and keep America safe.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as usual, prior to coming to call off the \nquorum, I had a visit with my friend from Kentucky, who is someone for \nwhom I have the greatest respect. I am going to miss him so much, as I \nhave said publicly and privately. In the days of my youth, I, of \ncourse, wanted to be the baseball player that he turned out to be. But \nthat is another story. I didn't want to pitch. I wanted to be something \nelse--a catcher or a shortstop.\n  Mr. President, I regret that my friend has objected to this modest \nrequest. Earlier today, I was advised by the Republican leadership that \nthey needed to have an amendment to be offered on this bill. As noted \nabove, we agreed to that request. The items that we are proposing to \nextend in my substitute amendment include unemployment insurance, \nCOBRA, flood insurance, highway funding, small business loans, and \nsmall business provisions of the American Recovery Act, the Satellite \nHome View Act, SGR--the so-called doctor fix--and poverty guidelines. \nAll of these provisions will expire on Sunday, February 28. That is \nthis coming Sunday.\n  Agencies have been already sending out notices to unemployed \nworkers--agencies such as a number of transportation departments around \nthe country have sent out notices that their work had come to a stop, \nso they would not be getting benefits.\n  It is critical that these programs continue so that Americans who are \nalready struggling can continue to get this modest relief. Therefore, I \nregret the objection of my friend from Kentucky. I hope we can work \nthrough this objection and continue these important programs.\n  Mr. President, we have been told by the Congressional Budget Office \nthat the No. 1 stimulative to our struggling economy is to give people \nwho are out of work, and have been out of work for a long time, \nunemployment benefits. That money goes right into the economy--whether \nit is in Anchorage, Las Vegas, or Louisville.\n  COBRA--there are people who are losing their jobs and they need the \nability to buy insurance. Statutorily now they can do that, but this is \ngoing to expire. Highway funding--I have already talked about that. It \nis just a real shame, and I am sorry that we can't get this done by \nFebruary 28. But we can't. This month would give us the time we need to \ncomplete our work.\n  As far as unemployment benefits, notices have already gone out to \nthousands of Americans that their benefits are going to be terminated--\nthese unemployed workers. They are already crushed with all the \nproblems they have, and now they are not going to have unemployment \nbenefits. That is simply not right.\n  I say to my friend again, I regret that we weren't able to work this \nout today. I hope there is something we can do to work through this \nobjection. We need to continue these important programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 36, H.R. 1586; \nthat the amendment at the desk, which is the text of the Reid \nsubstitute, with an offset, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read \nthe third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, with the \nprovisions that we are seeking to be extended, there are some of them \nthat cost money.\n  They all cost a little bit, but there are three items here that cost \nmore than any of the others; that is, unemployment compensation, COBRA, \nand the SGR. If there were ever an emergency--ever--in this body, \ncertainly it would be unemployment compensation and COBRA moneys.\n  I came to the floor earlier this year--it could have been late last \nyear; time flies--to try to get a permanent fix, as we call it, for the \nSGR for 10 years. That did not get enough votes. That is unfortunate. \nAnd this is really unfortunate. This SGR, the Medicare payments that \nwill be allowed to doctors, is for more than doctors; it is for doctors \nwho will take Medicare patients. Many doctors in America today will not \ntake Medicare patients. If we do not get this extended, a lot more will \nnot take Medicare patients.\n  Our Medicaid programs throughout America are in deep trouble. I met \nMonday with 12 Governors. Everyone said they were in desperate shape \nfor a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is what has happened to \nMedicaid. Not only is it important to the doctors--and that is \nimportant--it is more important to the patients, and many programs to \nreimburse medical professionals--doctors--are based on what we have for \nMedicare reimbursement. If we do not get Medicare reimbursement, it is \na cyclical thing that winds up tearing down the whole system.\n  I say to my friend that I hope someone can come up with an idea \nduring the night that would allow us to get this done. We are going to \ntake up this bill, all these items permanently next week or at least \nmost of it is for a year or so. That will give us time to complete all \nthis business. Even though we passed the so-called jobs bill which \nextended the highway bill for a year, the House cannot get it done that \nquickly. They can move more quickly than we can, but they cannot move \nthat quickly.\n  Again, I hope we can work something out in the next 12 hours or so. \nTherefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was going to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. BUNNING.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to go back past the original \nbill we just passed for the extension for a year and explain what my \namendment did to the original text the leader was propounding. I paid \nfor it, and I paid for it out of stimulus money.\n  We passed in this body just last week a pay-go that is extended to \nall the bills that come through this body. We passed a bill earlier \nthis week on which we did not do pay-go. We did not pay for it--at \nleast $10 billion of it. The cost of these extensions is another $10 \nbillion. That means that $20 billion goes directly to the debt of this \ncountry.\n  We just extended the debt limit to over $14 trillion. The reason I \noffered the offset that the leader objected to was so that my 40 \ngrandkids don't have to pay the bill. We cannot keep shifting our \nspending to our kids and our grandkids.\n  Believe me, I want to extend those provisions just as badly as the \nleader does, but we need to pay for them. That is the reason I offered \nmy substitute to his original text.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say this: The bill we passed today is \nfully paid for. There is no deficit spending whatsoever. In fact, \neverything was paid for. Every part of that was paid for. In passing \nthat bill, there is not a cent of red ink.\n  It is my understanding that with this short extension we have tried \nto get done today, my friend from Kentucky believes it should be paid \nfor by taking money out of the stimulus funds----\n  Mr. BUNNING. Unspent stimulus funds.\n  Mr. REID. Yes--and pay for it that way. It is my understanding that \nwe are willing to have a vote on that. I say to my friend, I am pretty \nsure that is what your leader and I spoke about. I would be happy to \nhave a vote on that.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask for time to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I have been here 24 years, I say to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. We came together.\n  Mr. BUNNING. And I have been fooled by some things and some things \nhave gone past me and I woke up after it had already passed me. This is \nnot one of those things that was going to do that. Of course, we can \nhave a vote on it, and, of course, it can be defeated, and then, of \ncourse, we can pass the bill without the money. I am not willing to \nrisk that $10 billion being added to the deficit. I was not ready to \nrisk voting on a bill I knew would not get the amount of votes \nnecessary to pay for it. If the majority leader would have included it \nin his UC, I would have had no problems. But he did not include it in \nhis UC. So that was the reason I asked to pay for it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't want to delay this any longer than \nnecessary. I don't know how we could be more fair. I have not talked \nwith my Democratic Senators, but I think there may be some Senators on \nthis side of the aisle who agree with Senator Bunning. That is why we \nare here.\n  Right now, we are in a very difficult predicament. I think it would \nbe too bad if people whose unemployment insurance is being terminated--\nall we are asking for is a few weeks, and then after the extension it \nwill give us time to have this body and the other body make a decision \nby voting on it. We are asking for a short extension. My personal \nbelief is that the extension of unemployment insurance is truly an \nemergency, as I indicated earlier, as I feel about COBRA.\n  I understand where my friend is coming from. I have never been a part \nof trying to fool him in any way intentionally. As I understand it, we \nare willing to vote on this legislation. If we are not able to work \nthat out, I don't know what can be more democratic than that. We are \nall elected to make our choices here. I would be happy, as I told the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, if he came up with some way we \ncould proceed on this issue, to give every consideration to any \nproposal he would make.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, the last item of business considered on \nthe Senate floor was an effort to extend several provisions of law that \nwill expire either late Saturday night or Sunday. One of these \nprovisions is the extension of unemployment benefits. It is well known \nacross America that we have many people out of work. A lot of them have \nreached the point where their unemployment benefits are about to \nexpire. I have met with many of those people in my State--in \nSpringfield, in Chicago--and heard their stories, and they are sadly \nvery similar. Many of them have exhausted whatever savings they had to \ntry to keep their homes and their families together. They are literally \nliving on unemployment insurance benefits.\n  Come Saturday or Sunday, thousands of people in my State and \nliterally more than 1 million Americans will see their unemployment \nbenefits stop; 65,000 people in Illinois will lose their unemployment \ninsurance benefits if we do not extend this; 1.2 million Americans \nnationwide will lose their unemployment benefits.\n  It is all right for us to debate. It is certainly our job to offer \namendments if we believe something should be\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\namended. But at the end of the day I think we have to be sensitive and \nconscious of the fact that a lot of people will start to suffer in ways \nthat most of us cannot imagine. When they lose their unemployment \nbenefits and their savings are exhausted, they are about to lose their \nhomes. I have seen that happen, and it is going to continue to happen.\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's find a way through this difficulty. \nLet's try to find a reasonable way to resolve it. Let's not leave here \nand go to the comfort and happiness of our families with these people \ndisadvantaged.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/24/senate-section/article/S738-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last week, Clifford May, the president of the \nFoundation for the Defense of Democracies, wrote in the National Review \nthat the U.S. should renew its focus on the Iranian regime's influence \nin Iraq. He warned that the success of the surge in Iraq, which both \nthe President and Vice President opposed when they served in this body, \ncould be transformed into a ``bipartisan failure'' if we don't increase \npressure on the Iranian regime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the National Review]\n\n                           Who's Losing Iraq?\n\n\n                       And could Iran be winning?\n\n                          (By Clifford D. May)\n\n       ``I am very optimistic about--about Iraq. I mean, this \n     could be one of the great achievements of this \n     administration.''\n       Vice President Joseph Biden's comments to CNN's Larry King \n     sparked a brouhaha for an obvious reason: When they were \n     senators, Biden and Barack Obama opposed the ``surge'' that \n     averted America's defeat in Iraq. It takes chutzpah for them \n     to now claim credit for the fruits of that strategy.\n       But a less obvious and more significant point is being \n     missed: Iraq may, in the end, turn out to be nobody's \n     achievement. It may turn out to be a military success \n     transformed by politicians and diplomats into a bipartisan \n     failure. Recent developments in Iraq are ominous. The Obama \n     administration is not addressing them effectively. And \n     conservative critics of the Obama administration are \n     strangely silent.\n       Robert Dreyfus is a journalist of the left with whom I \n     seldom agree; he writes for The Nation, a publication of the \n     far left that usually makes my eyes roll. But in his Nation \n     blog, Dreyfus correctly notes that as the campaign gets \n     underway for Iraq's March 7 elections, close to 500 \n     candidates have been banned for alleged ties to the Baath \n     Party by the Justice and Accountability Council, ``an \n     unelected panel headed by an Iran-linked terrorist, Ali al-\n     Lami.''\n       Among those barred are ``the No. 2 and No. 3 candidates in \n     the main opposition bloc, the Iraqi Nationalist Movement, \n     which is led by former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi [a secular \n     Shia]. Already, two members of Allawi's party have been \n     assassinated while campaigning. . . . Allawi, who many \n     observers say had a credible chance of winning enough votes \n     to lead a governing coalition after the election, has \n     suspended his campaign. . . . Many Sunni leaders are talking \n     about a boycott.''\n       The most serious concern here is not that Iraqi democracy \n     is fledgling and flawed--we knew that. What's troubling is \n     the fact that Iran's militant jihadi rulers are apparently \n     manipulating the process--with impunity.\n       Most Iraqis do not want their country to be controlled by \n     Iran. Most do not want it to become an Iranian satrapy like \n     Syria, Iraq's neighbor to the west. Most Iraqis do not want \n     to live as Iranians have been living--under the thumb of \n     oppressive theocrats and thuggish Revolutionary Guards.\n       But Iraqis know that American troops--the ``strongest \n     tribe''--are leaving. The bullies in Tehran, by contrast, may \n     be staying right where they are. Iran's rulers can give you \n     money and weapons. Or they and their treacherous agents in \n     Iraq can have you eliminated.\n       The fact that Ali al-Lami is playing a central role in \n     determining who can and who cannot run for election is--or \n     should be--alarming. In 2008, he was detained by American \n     forces in connection with an Iranian-backed ``Special \n     Groups'' militia believed to have bombed a municipal \n     building, killing two State Department employees along with \n     six Iraqis. A ``senior U.S. military intelligence official'' \n     told the Associated Press there were ``multiple and \n     corroborating reports'' pointing to al-Lami's involvement.\n       Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, the general manager of al-Arabiya \n     television, writing in the international Arabic daily Asharq \n     Alawsat, recently called al-Lami ``the man to fear in Iraq. . \n     . . He shows his claws at anyone who dares oppose him and he \n     accuses his opponents of Baathism,'' including even Gen. \n     David Petraeus ``who has fought the Baathists the most and if \n     it weren't for him, al-Lami would not be able to reach his \n     home in one piece. Al-Lami accused Petraeus of Baathism \n     (nobody has ever spoken such nonsense) and said that if \n     General Petraeus was Iraqi he would have been charged under \n     the Debaathification law.''\n       In an interview with the Times (U.K.), Petraeus pointedly \n     noted that al-Lami's panel has been linked with Iran's \n     Revolutionary Guard. And on Tuesday, Gen. Ray Odierno, the \n     senior U.S. commander in Iraq, identified al-Lami as one of \n     two Iraqi politicians ``clearly . . . influenced by Iran.''\n       The ``surge'' implemented by Petraeus, Odierno, and their \n     troops was largely responsible for the defeat of al-Qaeda in \n     Iraq--the battlefield Osama bin Laden considered more \n     consequential than any other. But Iran's proxy militias \n     fought U.S. troops, too. And many Americans were killed by \n     explosive devices manufactured in Iran and sent to Iraq for \n     that purpose.\n       Yet Iran's contribution to the bloodshed in Iraq was \n     consistently downplayed. To highlight it would have led to \n     the question: ``So what are you going to do about it?'' And \n     the Bush administration did not want to do anything about \n     it--just as the Clinton administration did not want to do \n     anything about Iran's role in the slaughter of American \n     servicemen at Khobar Towers in 1996, just as the Reagan \n     administration did not want to do anything about Iran's \n     dispatching of Hezbollah suicide-bombers to kill Americans in \n     Beirut in 1983, and just as the Carter administration did not \n     want to do anything about the seizure of the American Embassy \n     in Tehran in 1979.\n       Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of Iran's 1979 \n     Islamic Revolution, concluded: ``America cannot do a damn \n     thing!'' The phrase has been repeated by Iranian rulers ever \n     since.\n       President Obama ought to break with this pattern of \n     fecklessness. He should show Iran that there are consequences \n     for facilitating the deaths of Americans, for sponsoring \n     terrorism, for building nuclear weapons, for ruthlessly \n     oppressing Iranians at home, and for undermining the election \n     process in Iraq. At the very least, Obama should slow down \n     the pace of American troop withdrawals in Iraq and impose \n     serious sanctions--the kind envisioned by the legislation \n     recently passed by both the House and the Senate.\n       But Biden said nothing about sanctions to Larry King. \n     Instead he told him (and any Iranians who might be \n     listening): ``You're going to see 90,000 American troops come \n     marching home by the end of the summer.'' The vice president \n     added: ``You're going to see a stable government in Iraq that \n     is actually moving toward a representative government. I \n     spent--I've been there 17 times now. I go about every two \n     months--three months. I know every one of the major players \n     in all the segments of that society. It's impressed me. I've \n     been impressed how they have been deciding to use the \n     political process rather than guns to settle their \n     differences.''\n       True: Biden has been a frequent flier to Iraq, where he has \n     argued against the banning of candidates who displease \n     Tehran. Also true: He might as well have been talking to a \n     wall.\n       Iraq remains what it has been: a pivotal nation in the \n     heart of the Middle East. Biden may think he and his \n     administration have achieved something there. Obama may see \n     Iraq as a distraction from the war against ``the real enemy'' \n     in Afghanistan. Conservatives may view Iraq as a success \n     Obama inherited from the Bush administration--and therefore \n     no longer their problem.\n       All these views are wrong. It would be a cruel irony--not \n     to mention a terrible defeat--if the sacrifices Americans \n     have made were, in the end, to produce an Iraq dominated by \n     Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinijad, enemies of Iraq, freedom, and democracy--enemies \n     sworn to bringing about a ``world without America.''\n       Why don't Biden and Obama recognize that? And why are their \n     critics not more vocal about the fact that they do not?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/24/senate-section/article/S738-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, each day we read too many stories of \nsmall businesses unable to weather the current economic storm. \nCountless small firms both in Maine and across the Nation have been \nunable to compete with large chain stores and have been literally \npriced out of the market. Thankfully, today I wish to tell an \ninspirational success story and recognize a local retailer in my home \nState of Maine that\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nhas met the challenges of this difficult economic climate head on and \ncontinues to grow and thrive.\n  Bull Moose is a small retail chain originally founded in Brunswick, \nME. The company initially focused on providing its customers solely \nwith music but has now branched out into many forms of entertainment \nand media, including movies, games, and books. Its founder and \npresident, Brett Wickard, characterizes Bull Moose as selling \n``inexpensive fun stuff.'' Twenty years ago, when Mr. Wickard was a \ncollege student at Brunswick's Bowdoin College, the local record store \nclosed down. Now many of us would have just found another place to buy \ncassettes or records, but this young Bowdoin entrepreneur had a \ndifferent idea. With just $7,000 of his own money and a small loan, \nBrett Wickard launched Bull Moose Music in the summer of 1989, and a \ntruly homegrown business success story began. Mr. Wickard arranged his \ncourse schedule around his new store hours and had friends work in the \nstore while he was in class.\n  The Bull Moose business plan began by looking up record distributors \nin the Yellow Pages and ordering one album by every artist and band \nthat had released at least two albums. The thought process was if you \nmade a second album, you must be a good band. In the first summer, Bull \nMoose Music had sales of barely $100 a day, and Brett was forced to use \nhis credit card as a tool to survive. But with dedication and \nperseverance, Bull Moose has grown from these humble beginnings in \nBrunswick to include 10 stores in both Maine and New Hampshire with \nover 100 employees. To keep up with the added demand, the company has \nnow produced its own software to analyze which albums and artists it \nshould carry based on the purchasing history of each of the store's \ncustomers. Mr. Wickard actually designed the Bull Moose purchasing \nsoftware as his senior project while still a Bowdoin student--quite an \nupgrade from scouring the Yellow Pages!\n  Bull Moose recently celebrated its 20th anniversary and is on track \nto have its best year ever despite the current recession. Nevertheless, \nit continues to face the challenges confronting many small businesses. \nBeyond the severity of the economic downturn, large chain stores make \nit increasingly difficult to compete, and digital downloads of music \nhave reduced the number of customers buying music in stores. As a \nresult of these overwhelming roadblocks, many small businesses have \nbeen forced to cut staff and eliminate bonuses. In contrast, Bull Moose \nhas tripled Christmas bonuses and continues to hire more staff, \nincluding a location in Bangor, ME, that has tripled in size. Mr. \nWickard credits Bull Moose's commitment to customer service and \nconvenience to their unprecedented success and growth.\n  It is indeed refreshing to see a superb small business overcome the \nmany obstacles it faces in today's market. Stories such as this should \nrenew our focus to help small entrepreneurs succeed because as small \nbusinesses like Bull Moose continue to grow, they provide a substantial \npositive impact on the health of the local community and our overall \neconomy. My home State of Maine has benefited greatly from Bull Moose's \nsuccess, and I wish Mr. Wickard and everyone at Bull Moose continued \nsuccess for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/24/senate-section/article/S739-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/24/senate-section/article/S739-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/24/senate-section/article/S739-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:37 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3695.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric hospital \nservices under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our country has recently taken great steps \nforward to support the principles of mental health parity. In 2008, \nCongress has enacted two important pieces of legislation to end \ndiscrimination against people suffering from mental illnesses.\n  Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health \nParity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, MHPAEA, to prohibit the \nestablishment of discriminatory benefit caps or cost-sharing \nrequirements for mental health and substance use disorders. That same \nyear Congress also passed the Medicare Improvements for Patients and \nProtections Act, MIPPA, which included legislation introduced by \nSenator Snowe, and myself, the Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity \nAct. This legislation prevented Medicare beneficiaries from being \ncharged higher copayments for outpatient mental health services than \nfor all other outpatient physician services.\n  Unfortunately, even with the passage of MIPPA, a serious mental \nhealth inequity remains in Medicare. Medicare beneficiaries are \ncurrently limited to only 190-days of inpatient psychiatric hospital \ncare in their lifetime. This lifetime limit directly impacts Medicare \nbeneficiaries' access to psychiatric hospitals, although it does not \napply to psychiatric units in general hospitals. This arbitrary cap on \nbenefits is discriminatory to the mentally ill as there is no such \nlifetime limit for any other Medicare specialty inpatient hospital \nservice. The 190-day lifetime limit is problematic for patients being \ntreated in psychiatric hospitals as they may easily exceed the 190-days \nif they have a chronic mental illness.\n  That is why Senator Snowe and I are working together once again to \naddress the last remaining mental health parity issue in Medicare. \nToday, we are introducing the Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity \nAct. Our legislation would eliminate the Medicare 190-day lifetime \nlimit for inpatient psychiatric hospital care. It would equalize \nMedicare mental health coverage with private health insurance coverage, \nexpand beneficiary choice of inpatient psychiatric care providers, \nincrease access for the seriously ill, and improve continuity of care.\n  This legislation is supported by 46 national organizations that \nrepresent hospital associations, seniors' organizations and the mental \nhealth community. I would like to thank a number of organizations who \nhave been integral to the development of the Medicare Mental Health \nInpatient Equity Act and who have endorsed our legislation today, \nincluding the AARP, the American Hospital Association, the National \nAssociation of Psychiatric Health Systems, and the American \nPsychological Association.\n  Congress has now acted to address mental health parity issues for \ngroup health plans and for outpatient Medicare services. It is time to \nend this outmoded law and ensure that beneficiaries with mental \nillnesses have access to a range of appropriate settings for their \ncare. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to \nachieve mental health parity in Medicare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 3031. A bill to authorize Drug Free Communities enhancement grants \nto address major emerging drug issues or local drug crises; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator \nGrassley to introduce the Drug Free Communities Enhancement Act of \n2010, a bill to authorize additional Drug Free Communities grants to \nhelp address major emerging drug issues and local drug crises. It is \ncrucial that communities around the country have the leadership and \nresources needed to respond to serious drug problems in a comprehensive \nand coordinated manner. Drug Free Community, DFC, coalitions have been \nproven to significantly lower substance abuse rates in our communities \nnationwide.\n  This legislation will allow current and former DFCs to apply for \ngrants of up to $75,000 per year to implement comprehensive, community-\nwide strategies to address emerging local drug issues or drug crises. \nThe funds may also be used for DFC members to obtain specialized \ntraining and technical assistance to improve the operation of their \ncoalitions. These grants, which must be matched dollar for dollar, \nwould be available to DFCs for up to 4 years.\n  The DFC program encourages local citizens to become directly involved \nin solving their community's drug issues through grassroots community \norganizing and data-driven planning and implementation. Research shows \nthat effective prevention hinges on the extent to which the entire \ncommunity works comprehensively and collaboratively to implement \neducation, prevention, enforcement, treatment, and recovery \ninitiatives. The DFC program strategically invests Federal anti-drug \nresources at the community level with those who have the most power to \nreduce the demand for drugs--namely parents, teachers, business \nleaders, the media, religious leaders, law enforcement officials, \nyouth, and others. Drug Free Communities grantees execute collaborative \nstrategies to address their communities' unique substance use and abuse \nissues. This is the optimal way to ensure that the entire community \nbenefits from prevention.\n  In Vermont, we have felt the presence of drug abuse and drug-related \ncrime in our communities. The myth persists that drug abuse and drug-\nrelated crime are only big-city problems, but rural America is also \ncoping with these issues. I have twice brought the Judiciary Committee \nto Vermont to examine these problems and gain perspectives to help \nshape solutions, and I hope to hold another field hearing in Vermont \nsoon. I know well that law enforcement alone is not the solution for \nour communities. I have long advocated an approach with equal attention \nto law enforcement, prevention and education, and treatment.\n  Perhaps the most important component in dealing with this crucial \nproblem is collaboration. Community anti-drug coalitions have a unique \nability to build on pre-existing relationships among parents, teachers, \nstudents, and law enforcement, which make them a critical component in \nreducing drug use. I have consistently supported funding for these \ncoalitions and was pleased that last year 14 Vermont coalitions were \nawarded Drug Free Community grants totaling $1.2 million.\n  Last week, I spoke with a number of Vermonters representing these \ncommunity partnerships and heard about the innovative frameworks they \nhave implemented to combat drug abuse in their communities, thanks in \nlarge part to DFC grants. This bill will enable many of them to secure \nsupplemental funding to continue the important work they do every day. \nIndeed, communities nationwide who are facing serious drug issues will \nbenefit from these enhancement grants.\n  The community coalition model has proven extremely effective, and has \nachieved impressive outcomes. We see significant results when we have \npeople working together at the local, state, and Federal levels, and in \nthe law enforcement, prevention, and treatment fields. We have seen \nthat success in Vermont and throughout the country, but there is more \nwork to be done. Drug abuse and drug-related crime is a persistent \nproblem in America, in major metropolitan areas and rural communities \nalike. I hope all Senators will support this bipartisan bill so that \ncommunities nationwide can sustain effective community coalitions to \nreduce youth drug use.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3031\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Free Communities \n     Enhancement Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The epidemiology of drug use indicates that emerging \n     drug trends increase over a\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\n     short period of time and tend to cluster in discrete \n     geographic areas. Historical evidence shows that emerging \n     local drug issues and crises can be stopped or mitigated \n     before they spread to other areas, if they are identified \n     quickly and addressed in a comprehensive multi-sector manner.\n       (2) Federal investments in drug prevention should not be \n     solely based on national data and trends, but must be \n     flexible enough to address emerging local problems and local \n     drug crises before they become national trends.\n       (3) Successful drug prevention must be based on local data \n     and involve multiple community sectors in planning and \n     implementing specifically targeted strategies that respond to \n     the unique drug problems of the community.\n       (4) Data and outcomes show that effective community \n     coalitions can markedly reduce local drug use rates for drugs \n     such as marijuana and inhalants among school-aged youth.\n       (5) Community coalitions are singularly situated to deal \n     with emerging drug issues and local drug crises, such as \n     methamphetamine, cheese (a mixture of black tar heroin and \n     Tylenol PM), and prescription and non-prescription drug abuse \n     because the community coalitions are organized, data driven, \n     and take a comprehensive, multi-sector approach to solving \n     and addressing locally identified drug problems.\n       (6) Providing enhancement grants to coalitions to address \n     emerging local drug issues or local drug crises is a cost \n     effective way to deal with these drug issues. This approach \n     builds on existing infrastructures with proven results that \n     include all of the relevant community sectors needed to \n     comprehensively address specific emerging drug issues and \n     crises, and guards against using Federal funding to create \n     duplicative community based infrastructures for substance \n     abuse prevention.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, in 1997 then-Senator Biden and I \nsponsored legislation to create the Drug Free Communities, DFC, grant \nprogram. At the time, I believed, as I still do today, that one of the \nmost effective ways the Federal Government can prevent drug abuse from \nflourishing is by supporting local community efforts to identify, \nprevent and eradicate the sources of abuse. Since the passage of the \nDrug Free Communities Act, hundreds of community anti-drug coalitions \nhave received Federal grants to further their efforts to halt the \nspread of drug abuse in their communities.\n  Despite the successes of the DFC program, drug abuse continues to \nchallenge our communities. More often than not, a community can rise up \nto meet this challenge head on and confront the abuse before it \nspreads. However, drug abuse is one challenge that can emerge in rapid \nfashion. In difficult economic times when States and communities \nstruggle to stay within their budgets without eliminating vital \nservices, it is important that community anti-drug coalitions do not \nsuffer from a lack of resources. This is why I am pleased to join my \ncolleague, Senator Leahy, in introducing the Drug Free Communities \nEnhancement Act, DFCEA, of 2010.\n  This legislation builds off the successful DFC grant program by \nallowing community coalitions to form a strategy that best fits their \ncommunity to confront a sudden or emerging drug threat without Federal \ninterference. The DFCEA authorizes $5 million to the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy to award supplemental grants of up to $75,000 to \ncurrent and past DFC grantees to address an emerging drug issue or \ncrisis. The grantee would be eligible to receive these supplemental \ngrants for up to a 4 year period if they document, using local data, \nrates of drug abuse higher than the national average.\n  In my home State of Iowa, communities face unique challenges in \nconfronting drug abuse. In Polk County, the home of the State capitol \nof Des Moines, 37 percent of 11th graders admitted to using marijuana \nin the 2008 Iowa Youth Survey. This is significantly higher than the \nstatewide average of 27 percent from the same survey. This number is \nalso 4 percent higher than the national average according to the 2009 \nMonitoring the Future survey of 12th graders. In Black Hawk County, the \nhome of Waterloo and Cedar Falls, 8 percent of 11th graders admitted to \nusing over-the-counter cold medicines to get high according to the Iowa \nYouth Survey. This is higher than the 6 percent of the Nation's 12th \ngraders who admitted to cold medicine abuse in the Monitoring the \nFuture survey. Communities like these would benefit under the DFCEA, \nbecause they would\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\nbe able to apply for a supplemental grant to put a strategy into action \nto reduce these use rates.\n  Community coalitions represent the front lines in the fight against \ndrug abuse. The DFCEA will help to ensure that community coalitions \nwill remain strong and vibrant no matter the economic or drug trend \nsituation in the community. Drug abuse flourishes when the problem is \nignored. If we are to overcome the challenges of drug abuse we must \nstand untied in the effort. I urge my colleagues to join us as we \ncontinue this fight to keep our communities drug free.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Harkin, and \n        Mr. Franken):\n  S. 3033.

Exception from automatic stay.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply over the \n     past year and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies \n     include several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in \n     history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job \n     preservation and retirement security are placed at greater \n     risk.\n       (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and \n     retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not \n     kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy \n     by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while \n     protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases \n     have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those \n     in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent \n     and are escaping adequate scrutiny.\n       (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently \n     needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more \n     complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses \n     and industries.\n\n        TITLE I--IMPROVING RECOVERIES FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES\n\n     SEC. 101. INCREASED WAGE PRIORITY.\n\n       Section 507(a) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting ``$20,000'';\n       (B) by striking ``within 180 days''; and\n       (C) by striking ``or the date of the cessation of the \n     debtor's business, whichever occurs first,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (5)(A), by striking--\n       (A) ``within 180 days''; and\n       (B) ``or the date of the cessation of the debtor's \n     business, whichever occurs first''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (5), by striking subparagraph (B) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(B) for each such plan, to the extent of the number of \n     employees covered by each such plan, multiplied by \n     $20,000.''.\n\n     SEC. 102. CLAIM FOR STOCK VALUE LOSSES IN DEFINED \n                   CONTRIBUTION PLANS.\n\n       Section 101(5) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``or'' after the \n     semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) right or interest in equity securities of the debtor, \n     or an affiliate of the debtor, held in a defined contribution \n     plan (within the meaning of section 3(34) of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002(34))) \n     for the benefit of an individual who is not an insider, a \n     senior executive officer, or any of the 20 next most highly \n     compensated employees of the debtor (if 1 or more are not \n     insiders), if such securities were attributable to either \n     employer contributions by the debtor or an affiliate of the \n     debtor, or elective deferrals (within the meaning of section \n     402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), and any \n     earnings thereon, if an employer or plan sponsor who has \n     commenced a case under this title has committed fraud with \n     respect to such plan or has otherwise breached a duty to the \n     participant that has proximately caused the loss of value.''.\n\n     SEC. 103. PRIORITY FOR SEVERANCE PAY.\n\n       Section 503(b) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (8), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(10) severance pay owed to employees of the debtor (other \n     than to an insider, other senior management, or a consultant \n     retained to provide services to the debtor), under a plan, \n     program, or policy generally applicable to employees of the \n     debtor (but not under an individual contract of employment), \n     or owed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, for \n     layoff or termination on or after the date of the filing of \n     the petition, which pay shall be deemed earned in full upon \n     such layoff or termination of employment.''.\n\n     SEC. 104. FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES.\n\n       Section 1129(a) of title 11, United States Code is \n     amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(17) The plan provides for recovery of damages payable \n     for the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement, or \n     for other financial returns as negotiated by the debtor and \n     the authorized representative under section 1113 (to the \n     extent that such returns are paid under, rather than outside \n     of, a plan).''; and\n       (2) by striking paragraph (13) and inserting the following:\n       ``(13) With respect to retiree benefits, as that term is \n     defined in section 1114(a), the plan--\n       ``(A) provides for the continuation after its effective \n     date of payment of all retiree benefits at the level \n     established pursuant to subsection (e)(1)(B) or (g) of \n     section 1114 at any time before the date of confirmation of \n     the plan, for the duration of the period for which the debtor \n     has obligated itself to provide such benefits, or if no \n     modifications are made before confirmation of the plan, the \n     continuation of all such retiree benefits maintained or \n     established in whole or in part by the debtor before the date \n     of the filing of the petition; and\n       ``(B) provides for recovery of claims arising from the \n     modification of retiree benefits or for other financial \n     returns, as negotiated by the debtor and the authorized \n     representative (to the extent that such returns are paid \n     under, rather than outside of, a plan).''.\n\n     SEC. 105.

Res. 28. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relating to contributions and \nexpenditures intended to affect elections; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a constitutional amendment \nI am introducing today, along with my colleague Senator Tom Udall, in \nthe wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent Citizens United v. Federal \nElection Commission decision. This proposed amendment would simply \nauthorize Congress to regulate the raising and spending of money for \nFederal political campaigns--including independent expenditures--and \nallow States to regulate such spending at their level. It would also \nprovide for implementation and enforcement of the amendment through \nappropriate legislation. I invite my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join us by cosponsoring the amendment.\n  Let me begin by noting that I am a firm believer in the sanctity of \nthe First Amendment. I believe we must continue to do all we can to \nprotect the free speech rights of all Americans. I do not suggest \nchanging the language of the First Amendment, which I revere. But I do \nnot believe that money is speech, nor do I believe that corporations \nshould be treated exactly the same as individual Americans when it \ncomes to protected, fundamental speech rights. That is what the Supreme \nCourt has effectively now held.\n  I recognize that amending the Constitution is a long-term \nundertaking, and that this effort will not likely bear fruit during my \nremaining time in this body. Reinhold Niebuhr said that nothing worth \ndoing is completed in our lifetime; I would add much less during a \nSenate term.' I hope that in the wake of this court decision we can \nbegin that comprehensive reform effort; I know that it would be worth \ndoing. The Constitution itself establishes a long and complex process \nfor its own amendment, including approval by Congress and the States, \nand I am proposing to use that process to save our democratic system of \ngovernment, and ultimately our republic, from the continued corrosion \nof special interest influence.\n  I am introducing the amendment because I believe that constitutional\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\nquestions deserve constitutional answers. While I intend to support \ninterim legislative steps to address urgently those issues that can be \naddressed in the wake of this decision, including increased disclosure \nrequirements, further limitations to prevent foreign corporations' \ninfluence on our elections, and other measures, I think the scope of \nsuch efforts is limited by the court's sweeping, even radical \nconclusions in this case.\n  Make no mistake, as much of the commentary surrounding it suggests, \nthe Citizens United case is one of the most radical decisions in the \ncourt's long history of campaign finance reform jurisprudence. It \noverturns 100 years of precedents to come to the unjustified conclusion \nthat corporations deserve the same free speech protections as \nindividual Americans. It opens the door to corporations spending vast \namounts of money directly from their treasuries to influence Federal \nelections, and thereby influence Federal officeholders and policy \ndecisions, in ways much more direct and concentrated than is the case \nnow through corporate and union political action committees. If you are \nconcerned now about the undue special interest influence of big banks, \nenergy companies, health insurance firms, pharmaceutical firms and \nother special interests on our political process, just wait until these \nentities can spend millions of dollars directly to elect or defeat \nofficeholders. If you are concerned about the special interest-\ngenerated paralysis of our legislative process, wait until you see the \nresults of this decision. As one distinguished Republican election \nlawyer who opposes the decision recently said, it will be the ``wild, \nwild west.''\n  Perhaps most radical is the court's conclusion that corporations are \nlegal ``persons'' seemingly deserving of the exact same free speech \nprotections as all Americans. This decision notwithstanding, \ncorporations are not people. A first-year law student will note that \ncorporations are basically a legal fiction, entities created with \ncertain limited legal rights designed to enable them to operate in the \nbusiness world: to enter into and enforce contracts, to conduct \ntransactions, and the like. They can't vote or think or speak or run \nfor office. They only make political and policy decisions through their \nofficers and shareholders, informed by their lobbyists and others. They \nshould not enjoy the same fundamental free speech protections that \nindividual Americans enjoy in our political discourse, or the ability \nto spend unlimited funds directly from large corporate treasuries for \nthat purpose. As others have observed, the framers could not have \nimagined, and would not have wanted, a system in which corporations \ncould pour literally billions of dollars into elections and thereby \nexercise grossly outsized influence over the fate of our elected \nrepresentatives. Such a system does not promote free speech; it mocks \nit.\n  I have worked for decades to reform our campaign finance laws, with \ncolleagues and former colleagues like Senators Boren, Mitchell, Byrd, \nDaschle, Feingold, Kerry, McCain, Dole, Cochran, and others. Time and \nagain we have developed comprehensive bipartisan efforts, only to have \nthem frustrated by a small minority of Senators, or in one case by a \nveto exercised by the first President Bush. I have served my party as \nhead of the Democratic National Committee, and so I have seen the \nproblems of our current campaign finance system from a variety of \nperspectives.\n  In previous debates I have rehearsed the problems with our current \nsystem. They include the exponentially increasing costs of campaigns. \nThe endless time we must spend to travel and make calls to raise money, \nwhich is then spent mostly on expensive and increasingly negative TV \nads in our states. The ways in which special interests buy access and \ninfluence, and how such influence erodes the trust and confidence of \nAmericans in our democracy. These problems are systemic, pervasive and \nfundamental. They require comprehensive, fundamental reforms. A \nconstitutional amendment would create the conditions for the \npossibility of real statutory reform that could then be adjusted as we \ngo along, to address new abuses and problems as they arise.\n  I attended the Supreme Court's oral arguments in this case, and I \nheard in the pointed questions of the Justices who composed this 5-4 \nmajority the portents of this radical decision. But even then I did not \nanticipate fully how breathtakingly far the court would reach.\n  That extended reach was not only unwise and unjustified, it was also \nunnecessary. This court majority, whose members have so forcefully \ndecried judicial activism, might have taken a less radical approach, \nand resolved the legal issue before them without drawing such sweeping \nconclusions. Instead, they chose to ride roughshod over decades of the \ncourt's own legal precedents and the principle of stare decisis. That \nis why I believe it is fair to say, as Justice Stevens did in his \nstinging dissent in this case, that this case was brought by the \nJustices themselves. I urge my colleagues to read Justice Stevens' \ndetailed, powerful and carefully reasoned dissent. In it, among other \nthings, he observes that the only thing that has really changed since \nthe Supreme Court made its rulings in the Austin, 1990, and McConnell, \n2003, decisions, upholding the corporate campaign spending ban, is the \ncomposition of the Supreme Court. Instead of deciding the case based on \nthe narrow issues before them, in a raw display of activist judicial \npower the majority in this sharply divided court took the rare step of \nasking for the case to be broadened and re-argued, and then issued this \nsweeping decision.\n  With this decision, I believe the court has seriously jeopardized its \nown integrity, already damaged by its hugely controversial decision in \nBush v. Gore, and done enormous harm to our democracy--harm which will \nonly become clearer to Americans in the next few years as close \nCongressional and state races are decided by the spending of corporate \ninterests.\n  The public reaction to this court decision has been swift and strong, \nI think because Americans intuitively recognize that it represents an \nenormous transfer of power away from citizens to wealthy corporations. \nI saw a poll recently which showed broad opposition to the decision \namong all Americans--Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike. The \npoll showed that it was opposed by 66 percent of Democrats, 63 percent \nof Republicans, and 72 percent of Independents. Americans intuitively \nrecognize the dangers of a decision to allow corporations to spend \nunlimited funds against candidates. They see this decision's potential \nto worsen the problem of special interest influence, and to further \nerode trust and confidence in that process. Though this hasn't been \ncommented on too broadly in the media reports following this decision, \nI also believe Americans recognize that the next logical step the \nSupreme Court could take in the wake of this decision is to go beyond \nthis decision which overturns the ban on corporate independent \nexpenditures in campaigns to allow direct corporate contributions to \ncandidates.\n  This constitutional amendment is a version of one passionately \nchampioned for years by Senator Hollings, and updated by Senator \nSchumer in the last Congress. I have decided to reintroduce it at this \npoint in our debate to emphasize that even though I support efforts to \ndo what we can in the interim to reform our campaign finance laws, \nultimately we must cut through the underbrush and go directly to the \nheart of the problem: the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley vs. Valeo \nand other subsequent decisions which conflate money with speech, and \nthis most recent decision in Citizens United which lifts the long-time \nban on direct corporate spending in campaigns.\n  In these decisions, the Supreme Court has basically made it \nimpossible for Americans to have what they have repeatedly said they \nwant: reasonable regulations of campaign contributions and expenditures \nwhich do not either directly or indirectly limit the ideas that may be \nexpressed in the public realm. I submit that such regulations would \nactually broaden the public debate on a number of issues by freeing it \nfrom the narrow confines dictated by special interest money. With its \ndecisions, the Supreme Court has effectively neutered comprehensive \nefforts to control the ever-spiraling money chase, and has forced \nlegislation intended to control the cancerous effects of money in \npolitics to be more complicated and convoluted than necessary. The \ncomplications we are\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\nforced to resort to, in turn, create new opportunities for abuse.\n  Even without a constitutional amendment, we can try to make some \nprogress. For example, I think we made some decent progress on the \nMcCain-Feingold legislation, even despite the Court's decisions since \n2002 narrowing the reach of that law. But we cannot enact truly \ncomprehensive legislation that will get to the heart of the problem \nunder current court rulings. I wish we could. I have long supported a \nclean elections system of public financing for Congressional campaigns \nwhich would integrate spending limits, citizen financing, and other \nbasic reforms. That is the way I think we should go. There are other \napproaches. But the fact is--and I am sorry for this--that unless the \nSupreme Court again reverses itself, we cannot get the comprehensive \nlegislation we really need unless we first adopt an amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  This amendment is neutral on what kind of regulation of campaigns \nwould be allowed. It simply authorizes such regulation, and leaves it \nto Congress and state legislatures to determine what might be \nappropriate. That is where such decisions should be made on these \nissues: by the people's representatives in Congress and in state \nlegislatures. That is why I think amending the Constitution and \nenabling Congress to make those decisions is the first step if we are \nto make real progress on this front.\n  Others will argue for a narrower constitutional amendment to focus \nprimarily on the issue of corporate expenditures. That is another way \nto address the issue, though I believe it would still leave many \nunanswered questions about Congress' ability to regulate broadly in \nthis area. We should have a full and robust debate about all of the \noptions.\n  Someday we may adopt this idea, if the situation continues to run out \nof hand. And we may look back to this court decision in 2010 and mark \nit as an historic watershed, a catalyst for major change. I sincerely \nhope that will be true, for the sake of this institution and our \ndemocratic process, and for the sake of our country. I commend the \namendment to my colleagues' attention, and urge them to consider \ncosponsoring it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.
