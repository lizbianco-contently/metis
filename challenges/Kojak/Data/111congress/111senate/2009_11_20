Mr. President, our good friends on the other side of \nthe aisle have spent 6 weeks behind closed doors putting together this \ntrillion-dollar experiment in health care that raises premiums, raises \ntaxes, and makes drastic cuts to Medicare. We have now had less than 48 \nhours to look through this 2,074-page bill, but there are 10 things we \nknow for sure that every American should begin to understand. There are \n10 things about this bill we can begin to convey to the American people \nwith certainty, starting this morning.\n\n[[Page S11826]]\n\n  The Democratic bill includes nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes that \nhit virtually every single American, including, most importantly, \nmiddle-class families who make less than $250,000 a year--almost $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion dollars in new taxes, a substantial part of it hitting middle-\nclass families who make under $250,000 a year.\n  The second thing we know about this massive 2074-page bill is it will \nraise insurance premiums for the 85 percent of Americans who already \nhave health insurance in our country. So we know buried in this 2,074-\npage bill are higher insurance premiums for all Americans.\n  The third thing we know about this massive 2,074-page bill is there \nwill be huge cuts in Medicare, $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts in Medicare over \n10 years, and it will limit many of the choices seniors now have.\n  Additionally, this monstrous 2,074-page bill, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, will not lower health care costs. My \nrecollection was that the principal reason we went down this path in \nthe first place was to do something about the cost increases that are \nhitting American businesses and individuals. So we go through passing, \npresumably--I hope we don't, but if we pass this 2,074-page bill, we \nwill actually increase costs. The true cost of this bill, which was not \nstated by the majority at the announcement of the bill--if you look at \nthe 10-year period when everything is implemented, the true cost of the \nbill is $2.5 trillion. Certain gimmicks were employed to try to make \nthe bill look like it actually was deficit neutral or even raised money \nfor the Government over 10 years. The way that was done was to delay \nthe implementation of parts of the bill. But once everything kicks in, \nif you look at a 10-year window after everything kicks in, in this \nmonstrous 2,074-page bill, it would actually cost $2.5 trillion, a \nmassive expansion of the Federal Government.\n  The sixth thing we know about this bill for sure is, if you like the \nhealth insurance you have, you may not be able to keep it. Buried in \nthis 2,074-page bill are provisions that clearly indicate that if you \nlike the health insurance you currently have, you may not be able to \nkeep it. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Democratic \nbill would force millions of Americans off the health insurance they \ncurrently have.\n  The seventh thing we know about this bill is it would let government \nbureaucrats dictate what kind of health plans Americans can buy. No \nlonger would they have the option to buy whatever health care plan \nmight make sense for their family. The Government will prescribe what \nkind of insurance plans Americans can buy and, thereby, of course, what \nbenefits they can receive. Some bureaucrat in Washington is going to \ndictate the plans that are available for the American people. I suspect \npeople who are young and healthy and have high deductibles may not have \nthat option anymore. Those are the kinds of Americans for whom the cost \nof insurance is going to go up dramatically.\n  What else do we know about this 2,074-page bill? It creates a \ngovernment plan that the Congressional Budget Office has said would \nbring about higher premiums. The majority has said the whole point of \nthe government plan, having the government, in effect, get into the \ninsurance business, is to offer a lower cost alternative, but the only \nway to do that is to subsidize costs, ration care, and undermine \nprivate insurance, which could lead to a government takeover of health \ncare.\n  In the Democratic plan, the Congressional Budget Office actually says \nthe government insurance company would have higher premiums. So, \nclearly, the only way it could have a positive impact on the cost of \ninsurance would be to subsidize costs, ration care, and undercut \nprivate insurers. Of course, that would be the first step toward what \nsome of the more candid liberals in the House have said is a single-\npayer system. They are actually disappointed this bill doesn't go far \nenough to create a government insurance company, which then leads to a \nsingle-payer, European-type system.\n  What else do we know about this bill? The Democratic bill, for the \nfirst time in history, would allow Federal programs to pay for elective \nabortions. How do people out in America who feel strongly about that \nissue--what do they say about it? According to an AP story just this \nmorning, a direct quote from the person with the Catholic bishops who \nwork with this legislative issue here on the Hill--here is what he had \nto say. This is a quote from this individual who works for the Catholic \nbishops on legislative issues. ``This is the worst bill we have seen so \nfar on the life issue.'' That is from a spokesman for the Catholic \nbishops on what is buried in this 2,074-page bill on the issue of \nwhether the government will, for the first time, allow Federal programs \nto pay for elective abortions.\n  Another observation he made about it--and this is a direct quote, two \nwords by the spokesman for the Catholic bishops: ``Completely \nunacceptable.'' Completely unacceptable, the abortion language in this \n2,074-page bill. That is how the Catholic bishops apparently feel about \nthis.\n  Finally, Americans should know this bill does not have the \ncommonsense reforms they have been asking for all along. There is \nnothing in this massive bill about getting rid of junk lawsuits against \ndoctors and hospitals that CBO said costs us $54 billion over a period \nof time. There is nothing in the bill about leveling the playing field \nwhen it comes to health care taxes. What the American people would like \nfor us to do is to, step by step, address the cost issue--to them. This \nbill doesn't do that in any way.\n  Americans would like to have health care reform, but higher premiums, \nhigher taxes, and cuts to Medicare that produce more government is not \nreform. Yet that is precisely what we would get were we to pass this \n2,074-page bill sitting here beside my desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11826-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be debate until 10 p.m., the time controlled in alternating 1-hour \nblocks, the majority controlling the first hour.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a few minutes about \nthe health care legislation that has now been proposed by the majority \nleader and that we will be hopefully proceeding to for serious \ndiscussion, deliberation, and opportunity for amendment. Let me talk \nfirst about where we are today without health care legislation.\n  What are the circumstances faced by the average American family \nwithout enactment of health care legislation? The cost of medical care \nis rising. In fact, it is unaffordable for many individuals and \nbusinesses. In addition, there are 46 million who are uninsured in the \ncountry. That number continues to grow. I have been in the Senate and \ncontinued to watch that number grow for the last decade at least. Those \nmost in need of health insurance often are denied coverage. Many others \nworry about whether they are one diagnosis away from financial ruin \nbecause of their lack of adequate coverage and their lack of ability to \nafford adequate coverage.\n  We are working in the Senate to craft a national health reform \nproposal that would remedy the situation and would do so by reducing \nthe growth in the cost of health care. Let me be clear. We are not \nsaying the cost of health care is going down substantially. We are \ntalking about the growth in the cost of health care. That is what we \nare trying to moderate as part of this legislation.\n  We are also providing insurance to everyone in the country, \nregardless of\n\n[[Page S11827]]\n\ntheir health status and medical condition. This health reform proposal \nis designed to lower health care costs, lower than what they otherwise \nwill be in the future. This health reform legislation caps what \ninsurance companies can force patients to pay in their out-of-pocket \nexpenses and in their deductibles. The legislation would let small \nbusinesses and individuals join purchasing pools and give them the \nlower costs that benefit larger groups today. I have heard from \nhundreds of small business owners in my State over the years who have \ncomplained that the cost of health care to them and their employees is \nso much higher than the cost of health care to large employers and \ntheir employees. We would solve that. We would create a system that \nhelps to prevent illness and disease instead of just treating it when \nit is too late and when the cost is excessive.\n  This health reform proposal will reduce health care fraud and waste \nand abuse and overpayment to insurance companies. It is estimated by \nmost experts to be in the range of $60 billion per year under the \ncurrent health care delivery system. This legislation would eliminate \nmost of the cost of uncompensated care. This is a substantial part of \nthe premium people with health insurance are required to pay. They are \nnot only paying for their own health care when they pay their premium, \nthey are paying for the uncompensated care that hospitals, physicians, \nand others are providing to people who don't have insurance. That is \nthe 46 million uninsured figure I mentioned before.\n  This legislation reduces the growth in the cost of public programs \nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid and helps to rein in the Federal deficit. \nWe have the unusual circumstance that many of the individuals who \nopposed the establishment of Medicare and claimed it was socialized \nmedicine are now resisting any effort to put it on a sounder financial \nfooting and doing so purportedly in the name of defending the \nbeneficiaries of Medicare. We need to speak the truth to the American \npeople and say: Medicare and Medicaid are going to continue. There are \ngoing to have to be reductions in the growth of those programs in the \nfuture, the growth of the cost of those programs, and some of those \nchanges are incorporated in this legislation. That is a good thing for \nMedicare beneficiaries. That is a good thing for people who are going \nto be dependent upon Medicare in the future. They will know Medicare is \nthere. They will know Medicare is solvent and will benefit accordingly.\n  Health reform will also ensure all Americans have access to quality \nand affordable insurance. We prevent insurance companies from the \ncurrent practices in which they are engaged. One of the worst of those \npractices is the practice of denying health coverage for preexisting \nmedical conditions. If one has a preexisting medical condition and is \nable to buy a policy, perhaps, the policy in its own language will \nexclude them from getting medical treatment that might result from that \npreexisting medical condition. This legislation would end that. It \nwould end the discrimination of charges that currently exist where the \ncharge for health care is based on one's health status or gender.\n  During the course of this year and the last few years, while we have \nbeen studying the health care delivery system, I have come to a new \nunderstanding of what the word ``underwriting'' means. I used to think \nI knew what the word ``underwriting'' meant in insurance. What I have \nfound it means is the screening out of people who might actually need \nthe insurance that is being sold. So much of the effort of the health \ninsurance industry today is not focused on assisting the patient or the \npolicyholder; it is focused on screening out those individuals who \nmight, in fact, wind up sick and might need health care. We try to end \nthat in this legislation, and we do so effectively.\n  The legislation provides tax credits to middle-class families to make \nsure they can afford quality coverage. There are many middle-class \nfamilies in my State who, frankly, cannot afford adequate and quality \ncoverage for the parents and the children.\n  This legislation strengthens employer-based health care by offering \nsmall businesses a tax credit so that employers can offer competitive, \naffordable rates to their employees, if they choose to do so.\n  It creates incentives that reward doctors for healthy outcomes, not \nonly for more and more procedures. We have the unfortunate circumstance \ntoday, for which this Congress and this administration and previous \nCongresses and previous administrations are responsible, where we have \nset up a system of payment, under Medicare in particular, where the \namount the health care provider receives depends on how many procedures \nthey perform, not on whether the patient gets better, not on whether \nthey have done the right thing to assist that patient. We are trying to \nbegin changing that with this legislation. This will result in better \nhealth care for all Americans.\n  Health reform is also designed to improve the choices people have \nwhen they go out to obtain coverage or to obtain health care itself. \nMost Americans get their insurance through an employer. Many are \nsatisfied with the plans they currently have. They are satisfied with \nthe physician or the doctor they currently have. It is clear in the \nlegislation we are considering that this legislation does not require \nthem to change that. This legislation says they can keep that policy. \nThey can renew that policy. They can add family members to that policy \nif they choose to do so. But this health reform also provides security \nthat ensures that families always will have guaranteed choices of \nquality, affordable health care. That is even when a person loses their \njob, when a person switches jobs, when a person gets sick, or a person \ndecides to move from one community to another. This legislation will \nensure that they have access to health care even in those \ncircumstances.\n  It creates a health insurance exchange. This exchange would be a \nplace where families and businesses could easily compare insurance \nplans and prices and make a judgment based on that comparison. This \nputs families, rather than insurance companies or government \nbureaucrats, in charge of their own health care. It helps people to \ndecide which quality, affordable insurance option is right for them and \nfor their family.\n  It keeps government and insurance bureaucrats, because there are \nbureaucrats working for insurance companies just as there are \nbureaucrats working for the government, both from coming between each \nindividual and his or her doctor by simplifying insurance paperwork, by \ncutting out the pages of fine print, by eliminating all of the \n``gotcha'' clauses people discover once they get sick. They find out \nthey were not covered for whatever it is that now afflicts them.\n  By promoting computerized medical records, this legislation will \ndramatically improve efficiency in our health care system and, through \nthat effort, also reduce cost.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the impact of this legislation on my \nState. I represent New Mexico. Frankly, this legislation is critically \nimportant to my State. This chart is a depiction of what is projected \nby the experts about the cost of health care in New Mexico. Without \nhealth care reform, my State is expected to experience the largest \nincrease in health insurance premiums of any State in the Union. For \nexample, the average employer-sponsored insurance premium for a family \nin New Mexico in the year 2000 was $6,000. By 2006, that had almost \ndoubled to $11,000 for a family of four. By 2016, the expected increase \ngoes to an astonishing $28,000.\n  In addition, this third chart highlights the health insurance \npremiums and the percentage those premiums represent of the income of \nthe average New Mexico family. It is higher in my State, unfortunately, \nthan in any other State in the Union. Today, 31 percent of a family's \nincome is going to pay for health care. That is for the folks who have \ncoverage today in New Mexico. That is expected to grow to an astounding \n56 percent. Over 56 percent of a family's income is expected to be \nconsumed just paying premiums for health care by 2016. That is totally \nunsustainable and unaffordable.\n  The health reform proposal that has been developed by the majority \nleader, based on the work of the Finance and HELP Committees, intends \nto slow the growth of health care costs around the Nation. The \nnonpartisan Congressional\n\n[[Page S11828]]\n\nBudget Office forecasts that the legislation would not add to the \nFederal deficit. In fact, it would reduce the deficit by $130 billion \nby 2019 and by more than $400 billion by 2029.\n  Most experts believe these reductions also will drive down the cost \nin the private health insurance market. Thus this legislation is \ncritically important to my State because it will help to curb increases \nin health care costs for all New Mexicans.\n  Let me show you a fourth chart. This one is a chart based on--I guess \nthis is data from the Census Bureau. It is a chart that was developed \nby the Commonwealth Fund. It is the percent of adults ages 18 to 64 who \nare uninsured by State. It has two maps shown on it. The first is for \n1999 through 2000 and the second is 2007 through 2008.\n  You can see what has happened just in that relatively short period. \nIn 1999 to 2000, there were two States that had more than 23 percent of \nits population uninsured, and those two States were Texas and New \nMexico. The only State in the Union that has a higher uninsured rate \nthan we do in New Mexico is Texas. That was the case then, in 1999 \nthrough 2000. It is still the case today, I would point out.\n  But what you can see from this map on the right of the chart for 2007 \nto 2008 is that many other States--particularly the States shown in \ndark blue across the South and California--many other States have \njoined the ranks of States that have over 23 percent of their \npopulation uninsured. Their aged 18-to-64 population was uninsured. \nThis is a very serious problem.\n  I think my State has the lowest rate of employer-sponsored insurance \nin the Nation. We also have the highest rate of uninsured among \nemployed individuals in the Nation.\n  Let me show you this next chart, this fifth chart I have in the \nChamber. This is a pie chart that shows what the current status of \nfolks in New Mexico is. I know it is difficult to read from a distance, \nbut let me explain what it is.\n  We generally think of most people having private health insurance \ncoverage. In New Mexico, 38 percent of our population has private \nhealth insurance coverage. So it is not a majority; it is 38 percent. \nWe have 14 percent who are covered by Medicare. We have 22 percent who \nare covered by Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. We \nhave 4 percent who are undocumented immigrants in our State, estimated \nat about 80,000 individuals. They do not have coverage today, and they \nwill not have coverage once this legislation becomes law, if we are \nable to pass this legislation and the President is able to sign it.\n  Then this large red area shown down here at the bottom of the chart \nis 22 percent, and that represents individuals who have no coverage, \nexcluding undocumented immigrants. So we have the undocumented \nimmigrants, at 4 percent. Then we have 22 percent without coverage. \nThese are folks who are here legally. Most of them are citizens. They \ndo not have coverage. This gets back to the point I was making before \nabout people's premiums today are covering not only the cost of their \nown health care needs, but they are covering the cost of the \nuncompensated care that is provided to this large red wedge of people \nshown down here on the chart. So it is a serious problem that needs \nattention.\n  New Mexico will benefit from this legislation in very important ways. \nThe legislation will provide new Federal tax credits for private \ninsurance, and it will also expand the Medicaid Program for individuals \nwith incomes of up to 133 percent of poverty.\n  This is a very important provision for my State: It is projected that \ninsurance market reform and Federal tax credits may reduce the cost of \ncoverage in the individual/private market for the average family in my \nState by as much as 40 percent. So this last chart tries to take the \nprevious information and say what would likely occur by 2019--10 years \nfrom now--if, in fact, we are able to enact this legislation.\n  You can see what the two biggest changes in the legislation are. The \ngreen wedge in the pie chart shows that we will have more people \ncovered by Medicaid and CHIP. We would have 29 percent rather than the \n22 percent we had before. It shows we will have many more people \ncovered by private insurance. I believe for the first time in the \nhistory of our State, we will have over 50 percent of our population--\nexactly 53 percent is what is estimated--who will be covered by private \ninsurance and have an insurance policy they can depend upon.\n  So this would still leave undocumented immigrants--which is still \nestimated to be 4 percent of the population--without any guaranteed \nsource of coverage. But we would have about 124,000 New Mexicans newly \neligible for Medicaid coverage, and covered by Medicaid, we would hope. \nWe would have an additional 238,000 New Mexicans who would be eligible \nfor private coverage through the exchange or from their employers if \ntheir employers chose to provide that coverage.\n  We will have a lot of opportunity over the next few weeks to debate \nparticular parts of this legislation. I look forward to that debate. I \nthink the more the American people understand what is in this \nlegislation, the more wholeheartedly they will support us moving ahead \nand enacting this legislation.\n  This debate has been a long time in coming. In the 27 years I have \nbeen in the Senate, we have not gotten to this point previously, where \nwe were beginning a serious debate that might actually result in the \npassage of legislation, major comprehensive reform legislation. But I \nthink we are to that point.\n  This is legislation that is currently available for anyone to review \non the Internet, and I encourage people to do that. I encourage people \nto study the issue and follow the debate. As I say, the more people do \nstudy the issue and follow the debate, the more people will conclude \nthis is worth doing, this is important to do.\n  So I very much urge my colleagues to rally around this effort. I \nhope, frankly, we will get some Republican support for this \nlegislation. I think it is very unfortunate we are going into this \ndebate with reports that all Republicans are agreeing to oppose health \ncare reform. That is not the way to move our country forward. If there \nare amendments they would like to offer, obviously, they will have \nevery opportunity to offer those, and some of them may prevail.\n  That certainly was the case in the Finance Committee when we marked \nup the legislation. That certainly was the case in the HELP Committee \nwhen we marked up the legislation. Amendments were offered from \nRepublican members, and some were adopted. But to just say no, to just \nsay: We are opposed to reform, is not a good option. I think the \nAmerican people deserve better than that. I hope we will have a \nserious, substantive discussion about what the elements of health care \nreform should be.\n  I compliment the majority leader for putting together a very credible \nproposal that will move this country very far toward meeting the health \ncare needs of all Americans. I hope by the end of this year we are able \nto enact that legislation or pass it through the Senate and go to \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague is in the Chamber to speak on this \nissue, and I will yield the floor at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate following Senator Bingaman. \nSenator Bingaman perhaps knows more about this issue than anybody in \nthe Senate. He was the only Democratic Senator to be on both committees \nthat wrote this bill and did such great work both in the Finance \nCommittee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  I would follow up his words by pointing out that this process--I was \non a C-SPAN show this morning, and I heard the previous Senator who was \non the show, a Republican, say this bill was written behind closed \ndoors and that it is a partisan bill.\n  I went through this process, as did the Acting President pro tempore \nfrom Oregon, and we sat through 11 days of markup in the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--all televised, all public, \nwith hundreds of amendments. We accepted 160 Republican-sponsored \namendments. The Senator from Oregon and I and Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Murray, also on that committee, voted for most of those 160 \namendments. This bill had a lot of bipartisanship.\n  But on the big issues, the issues such as the public option, such as \nissues on\n\n[[Page S11829]]\n\nhow we are going to pay for it--some of the big issues--there is a \nclear philosophical disagreement. We can go back to 1965, when Medicare \npassed. Republicans opposed it in those days because they had a \ndifferent view of the world. Their philosophy is government will never \ndo anything right. Our philosophy is Medicare has been a pretty darn \ngood program and has lifted a whole lot of seniors out of poverty, and \nso has Social Security. Medicare, in fact, has given people longer, \nhealthier lives as a result.\n  So this issue is not so much partisan--although my friends on the \nother side of the aisle made it that--it really is a difference in \nphilosophy. They wanted to continue--my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle pretty typically do the bidding of the insurance industry. We \ncannot have health care reform and do it the insurance companies' way \nor there will be no health care reform.\n  We stood on the Senate floor--Senator Merkley and I, and Senator \nKaufman and Senator Whitehouse and Senator Tom Udall and others--\ntalking about some of the things insurance companies have done, such as \nhaving preexisting condition exclusions, where someone who has an \nillness cannot get insurance.\n  When I was on the C-SPAN show today, a gentleman from Indiana called. \nHe is 63 years old. He has a preexisting condition, and he cannot get \ninsurance. He has 2 years to wait to get on Medicare. But he knows when \nhe is on Medicare, Medicare will not take away his coverage, exclude \nhis coverage because of a preexisting condition. Neither will the \npublic option exclude him from coverage because of a preexisting \ncondition.\n  But you know Cigna does, you know Aetna does, you know WellPoint \ndoes, you know Blue Cross--the insurance industry so often excludes \nthem because of a preexisting condition. That is why they can afford to \npay their CEO at Aetna $24 million a year. That is why insurance \ncompany profits have gone up 400 percent over the last 7 years--because \nthe insurance companies deny care for so many people, so they cannot \nget covered, they cannot get insurance. Then they turn down so many \nclaims. Thirty percent of insurance company claims are turned down \ninitially by the insurer. So even if you eventually appeal and get your \nclaim covered, get your claim paid for from the company that you have \npaid premiums to--if you ultimately get your claim paid for--why should \nyou have to get on the phone day after day and call your insurance \ncompany and complain and complain and cajole and persuade and finally \nget it paid? That is not how our reform will work. That is not how the \npublic option will work.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Murray is here to speak in a moment. I \njust want to, as I have done many times on the Senate floor in the last \n3 months, share three or four letters from Ohioans who have written me \nabout this health insurance bill. What has come through in these \nletters I have gotten is a couple things--or maybe three things.\n  No. 1, I have found that most of the people who have written these \nletters--if I met them a year ago and asked them: Are you satisfied \nwith your health insurance, most of them would have said: Yes. But then \nsomething happened. They lost their job or they got sick, and it was \nvery expensive and they lost their insurance because they got cancer or \nthey had a child born with a preexisting condition. They cannot get \ninsurance. So they once were happy with their insurance--until they \nneeded it. That has happened too many times.\n  The second thing I see over and over in these letters from the \npeople--similar to the man from Indiana I mentioned earlier--is people \nwho are 61, 62, 63 years old, maybe 59 years old, who are sick or they \nare not sure about their health and they cannot get insurance, they \njust say: I wish I was 65. I cannot wait until I am 65 so I can get \ncovered because I know Medicare is stable and will not cut me off their \nplan.\n  What kind of health care system do we have when a 61-year-old writes \na letter to their Senator saying: I cannot wait until I am 65 so I have \nhealth care protection, I have health care security? There is something \nwrong with that. We fix that too.\n  The third thing I hear in these letters--then I will read them \nbriefly--is people call for the public option because they know a \npublic option will help them, will help discipline insurance companies \nand make them behave, make them more honest. The public option will \nsave money because they will compete.\n  In southwest Ohio, Cincinnati--in Hamilton and the three adjoining \ncounties to Hamilton: Clermont, Warren, and Butler; those four \ncounties--two insurance companies in those four counties control 85 \npercent of the insurance policies. Obviously, with that lack of \ncompetition, the quality is low and the cost is high for that \ninsurance. Injecting a public option will inject confidence. The \nexistence of a public option will inject competition and make those \ninsurance companies work better.\n\n  This first letter is from Patricia from Hamilton County:\n\n       I am a senior who has been on Medicare for several years \n     now. I also have a supplemental insurance plan with \n     reasonable premiums and copays, but that has continued to \n     rise over the last two years. Therefore, I don't have any \n     problems accessing the care I need now. However, I have \n     multiple sclerosis and when I was younger and living in \n     another state, I was subjected to the preexisting condition \n     exclusion. Fortunately, I was employed by the state which \n     allowed me to obtain a reasonable health plan. But I know a \n     lot of people are not as fortunate as I am. It is our \n     responsibility as citizens to make sure all of our people \n     have good health care coverage. A public option is essential \n     to making sure this happens.\n\n  Patricia understands the public option will--again, whether you \nchoose Aetna, whether you choose the public option, or a not-for-profit \nin Ohio called Medical Mutual, you have that option, and the public \noption is, in fact, an option that will give people that opportunity.\n  Joyce from Lawrence County, sort of straight southern Ohio along the \nOhio River near the Ironton area of the State, writes:\n\n       I have been notified that any Medicare Part D monthly \n     premiums will increase 25 percent in 2010. I simply cannot \n     afford this increase and I need my medications. I am a \n     senior, live on fixed income, and suffer from multiple \n     sclerosis. I do not know how to handle this situation except \n     give up my drug therapy and live with frequent episodes that \n     require hospitalization. I support your efforts for health \n     reform that includes a public option.\n\n  One of the things that will happen under our health care bill is that \nthe doughnut hole that keeps people such as Joyce around Ohio and \naround the State and around the country who don't--it means people pay \nso much out of pocket for their prescription drugs coverage, we will \nclose--initially, we will close it by half, and we are going to offer \nsome four amendments to close the doughnut hole entirely so that people \ndon't get hit so hard by drug costs.\n  Karen from Morrow County up near where I grew up in the Mount Gillian \narea, sort of north-central Ohio--Karen writes:\n\n       Please vote for health care reform for all that includes a \n     public option. As a middle-aged female small business owner \n     in rural Ohio, I am tired of seeing my community ravaged by \n     the loss of affordable and accessible health care. With a \n     preexisting condition, I have no option but to stay with my \n     present provider and cross my fingers each year on my \n     birthday that I won't be dropped.\n\n  This is a small business owner.\n  One of the things we knew right away and that Senator Murray and \nSenator Merkley and I worked on in the HELP Committee was to make sure \nthere were good, strong incentives for small businesses to be able to \nafford health insurance for their employees. Whether it is in Olympia \nor Spokane or Portland or Eugene or Cleveland or Toledo, we have all \nbeen in similar situations where we have small business owners approach \nus all the time.\n\n       I have 20 employees. One of them got cancer. It costs so \n     much for this one employee that they are either dropping my \n     small business coverage or the cost has spiked so much that \n     we can no longer afford it. What are we going to do?\n\n  Our bill will bend the cost curve for them and will give them tax \ncredits so they can buy insurance and allow them to go into the \nexchange so they are in a larger pool. So 1 or 2 illnesses in a company \nof 20 or 30 people won't cause the price spikes that a larger pool of \ninsurance will be able to blunt.\n  The last letter--and then I will turn it over to Senator Murray--is \nfrom\n\n[[Page S11830]]\n\nGail from Belmont County, which is eastern Ohio near St. Clairsville, \nFlushing, that area of the State. Gail writes:\n\n       I am a teacher and my husband is retired. In March 2009 I \n     was diagnosed with cancer and began treatment soon after. I \n     had surgeries, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. I have an \n     employer based plan, but it doesn't cover the entire costs of \n     some of my expensive drugs which can cost thousands of \n     dollars. How does someone without insurance afford such \n     treatment? The fact is, they can't. I really didn't realize \n     how expensive health care had gotten until I got sick.\n\n  Which is kind of the situation with all of us.\n\n       One of my sons is a veteran and has coverage that way. One \n     son is in college and is still covered under my insurance. \n     But my third son works seasonally and is not covered at all. \n     He had an appendectomy several years ago and the resulting \n     medical bills destroyed his credit. I don't know what will \n     happen if he ever gets sick again. It is not right to leave \n     the poor to flounder without proper medical coverage. It is \n     time to end the greed of insurance and drug companies and \n     have them face fair competition.\n\n  That is really all we are saying here. We want to create a system \nwith consumer protections so that insurance companies can't drop people \nfor preexisting conditions; can't put a limit on their coverage so that \nwhen they get sick they lose their insurance; can't discriminate \nagainst women, whom they usually charge more for premium costs for \ntheir insurance policies than they charge men; can't discriminate based \non geography or disability. We want to give incentives to small \nbusinesses so they can insure more of their employees, and we want to \nbring competition into the system so insurance companies have to \ncompete better than they have, driving prices down. That is what this \nlegislation does, not to mention a lot in prevention and wellness. \nPrevention is in the bill, which really will help keep people out of \nhospitals and live longer and healthier lives. That is our mission.\n  This Congress has tried to do this for seven decades. Tomorrow will \nbe a historic moment when we vote in the evening to move this bill to \nthe floor of the Senate so we can begin this process. It is the most \nimportant thing professionally I have ever done in my life. I feel \nprivileged to have the opportunity to be a part of this and to fight \nfor 11 million Ohioans. I know this isn't a bill just for uninsured \nOhioans; it is a bill to make businesses more competitive, to help \nsmall businesses, to give consumer protections to those who are happy \nwith their insurance and want to keep it, and to help Medicare \nbeneficiaries by closing the doughnut hole and bringing some of their \nout-of-pocket costs down so they can live healthier, longer lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Ohio for \nsharing those stories. It tells the compelling reasons why tomorrow \nnight's vote to move to this bill is so important, and we are all \nhonored to be a part of that.\n  After a lot of hard work, it is amazing that our country really is \nnow closer than we have been in decades to passing a real health \ninsurance reform bill that will help provide our families and our \nbusinesses with affordable and stable health insurance coverage. There \nis a lot of debate and there is a lot of work still ahead of us, but it \nshould not go unnoticed that this is a big moment for our country, and \nyou know what. It couldn't come soon enough.\n  Our economy is hurting. Americans across the country are so worried \nabout keeping their jobs and making their mortgage payments. The last \nstress people need today is to worry about the cost of getting sick or \nbeing dropped from their insurance plan or opening the mail and seeing \nyet another premium increase.\n  Health insurance premiums for families in my home State of Washington \nhave more than doubled in the last 10 years, and they are rising at a \nrate that is five times faster than people's salaries. Families and \nsmall business owners are paying more and more for their coverage, and \noften they are getting less and less in return. These numbers \ndemonstrate clearly what families and small business owners across my \nState of Washington understand all too well. The status quo in the \nhealth insurance system is unsustainable and the cost of inaction is \njust too high for them to bear.\n  The news we got back from the Congressional Budget Office on \nWednesday is encouraging. It shows the American people that our bill, \nour legislation will save money while protecting Medicare, and it \nensures that families and businesses can take back control over their \nown health care choices.\n  If we do not pass this bill, health insurance premiums are going to \ncontinue to skyrocket. If we fail to act, health insurance companies \nwill continue to deny patients coverage simply because they are sick. \nAnd if we let another year go by without reform, more and more families \nare going to lose their coverage and more and more businesses are going \nto collapse under the growing burden of the cost of health insurance. \nIt doesn't have to be this way. We have been talking about reforming \nour health insurance system for a very long time here. Now we owe it to \nthe American people to give them more than just talk; to give them, \nfinally, the stability and security of a health insurance system that \nwill be there for them when they need it and that cannot be taken away \nfrom them if they get sick or if they lose their jobs.\n  Six months ago, I sent a letter to my constituents asking them for \ntheir stories and their thoughts on health insurance reform, and the \nresponse I got was overwhelming. I received over 10,000 letters and e-\nmails from people across Washington State sharing their health care \nstories with me. Those stories came from small business owners, from \nemployees, from moms and dads who told me how they are struggling with \nthe cost of care today. So many of them cannot afford the status quo \nand deserve health insurance reform that allows them to keep coverage \nif they like it, gives them additional options if they don't, makes \ntheir care more affordable, and guarantees, finally, stable coverage \nthat cannot be taken away when it is needed the most.\n  I have come to the floor many times over the last several months as \nwe have worked to put together our Senate bills and I have shared some \nof these stories on the floor. Now that we have a plan on the table, I \nwish to tell two of these stories once more to really demonstrate the \ndesperate need for us to move quickly and to get this bill passed.\n  Chris Brandt, from Spokane, WA, told me a story about his problems \nfinding coverage. Chris told me he is a healthy young man who works for \na small business that cannot afford to provide coverage to its \nemployees, so Chris, as do a lot of Americans, had to find coverage on \nhis own through the individual market. He told me that after paying his \nmortgage, his car payment, and his student loans, the only insurance he \ncould afford is a catastrophic plan that might keep him out of \nbankruptcy if he gets sick. But even the cost of that plan has \ndoubled--has more than doubled in the last 2 years.\n  So here is a man named Chris who wants insurance. He doesn't want to \nbe a burden to anybody else if he gets sick, but he cannot keep up with \nthe rising cost. We have to have a system that encourages people such \nas Chris to get high-quality insurance that covers preventive care so \nthat those small, inexpensive medical problems can be treated before \nthey become large, expensive medical problems. That is what will keep \nour families healthy, and it will save money in the system in the long \nrun.\n  I also received a very compelling story from a woman named Patricia \nJackson who lives in Woodinville, WA. Like a lot of working families, \nthe Jacksons told me they have insurance through their employer and \nthey pay their premiums each month directly through Patricia's \npaycheck. But also like a lot of our families, the burden of those \npremium payments is rising too quickly. Patricia told me that to care \nfor her family of four, she paid $840 a month in 2007--$840 a month. In \n2008, her payments jumped to $900 a month. This year, Patricia paid \n$1,186 a month. Now, before this year is even over, she got a new bill \nand her rates have been hiked to $1,400 a month. That is an increase of \nover 66 percent for her premiums in just 3 years.\n  Patricia, not surprisingly, told me she and her family can no longer \nafford to pay this, and she is not alone. Family health care coverage \nrose over 86\n\n[[Page S11831]]\n\npercent between 2000 and 2007. That is an increase in my State of over \n$5,600 per family. Wages during that time period only grew 16 percent.\n  The largest private insurance company in my State sent out a letter \nin August to all of the people who get insurance through them and told \nthem they were raising rates by 17 percent--17 percent. Some of my \nsmall business owners are telling me premium increases are going up 40 \npercent. This makes families and businesses have to make choices about \nwhat they can pay.\n  Families are really struggling today in this tough economic climate. \nIt is the worst since the Great Depression. They cannot afford these \ncost increases. So the bill we are about to bring to the floor will \nfinally--finally--make insurers compete for the business of the \nAmerican people. That is what families and small business owners in my \nState and across the country want and need, and it is what they \ndeserve.\n  The bill we are going to bring before the Senate will make health \ninsurance more stable. It will end the unfair and deceptive insurance \ncompany practices such as cherry-picking and cancelling coverage \nbecause of preexisting conditions. It is going to reward what works in \nthis system and change what doesn't. Finally, it will start reining in \nthose costs so that health care can become more affordable. It is going \nto allow people such as Chris to get high-quality coverage, and it is \ngoing to rein in the costs for people such as Patricia. This is more \nimportant now than ever before as our economy struggles and the cost of \nthat care continues to rise.\n  We have been talking about health insurance reform for a long time, \nand while we were talking, families and small businesses have suffered. \nIt is now time to end the politics and end the partisanship and come \ntogether to bring our families and our small business owners the health \ninsurance reforms they deserve.\n  As we move forward in this debate, I am going to be working very hard \nto make sure that the needs and priorities of Washington State families \nand businesses are preserved and that we move forward in a way that \nensures that the future health of our families and the strength of our \neconomy is there. So I urge all of our colleagues to work with us now \nin a very constructive way over the next several weeks as we debate \nthis bill. and to rise above the partisanship. Let's make health \ninsurance work for our families, our economy, and for our country. That \nis what this debate is about.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we gather on the floor today at a time \nthat is historic. It is hard to imagine, to put it in the appropriate \ncontext, but this debate over health care reform is remarkably similar \nto the national debate over the creation of Social Security, or the \ncreation of Medicare. It is that historic. It affects that many \nAmericans and their futures. That is why it is important that all of us \ncome forward to understand what this debate is about, the important \nissues that are before us.\n  The starting place for those who want to get into it is, of course, a \nWeb site in today's technology and reality. The Web site is \ndemocrats.senate.gov/reform. If you visit that Web site, you will be \nable to see the bill that will be before Congress in its entirety. You \nwill have your chance to read it, though it will be challenging. It is \ndifficult not having all of the Federal statutes before you. But most \nof it is fairly clear in terms of what we are trying to achieve.\n  There have been critics of the bill who have come to the floor and \nargued that this bill should be defeated because it is too long, too \nmany pages. They bring to the floor more than a copy of the Senate \nbill; they bring the House bill and the Senate bill and stack them up \nhere to say how long this is. Well, of course, we are not going to vote \non the House bill; it is the Senate bill. That is a bit of an \nexaggeration, but it is a long bill, over 2,000 pages. I won't talk \nabout whether it is small or large print, but it is 2,000 pages plus.\n  You may ask, why does it take so many words to address this? But wait \na minute, this is about health care in America. One out of every six \ndollars in our economy is spent on health care. It affects every single \nAmerican citizen, and it will be challenged in court by the health \ninsurance companies that want to stop this health care reform. We have \nto make sure this is carefully and well written, perhaps erring on the \nside of adding more language so there is no question as to our intent. \nBut that is it.\n  The obvious question I ask back to the critics on the Republican side \nof the aisle, who say we should vote against this bill because there \nare too many pages in it, is: Where is your bill? Where is the \nRepublican health care reform bill?\n  I know that in a few moments--in about 10 minutes--Republican \nSenators will come to the floor to talk about this important issue. I \nwelcome that. I wish we could come to the floor at the same time. We \nmight get close to something called ``debate,'' which would be an \ninteresting phenomenon in the Senate, as it is something we have gotten \naway from. When they come to the floor, I hope the first Senator who \nstands up will do what I did. I hope the first Republican Senator will \nread a Web site where the American people can go to to read the \nRepublican health care reform proposal. Again, ours is \ndemocrats.senate.gov/reform. What is the Republican Web site? Where can \nwe find the Republican bill? I know the answer. There is no Web site \nwhere you can find the Republican health care reform bill--at least not \ntoday. I hope it will come soon. They have spent their time criticizing \nour efforts to change this system. That is healthy in a political \nsystem like ours, but at some point criticizing isn't enough. Stand and \ntell us what you are for, what you are going to propose.\n  If we start moving on this, as we expect to tomorrow, the procedures \nwill take us to the consideration of the Senate Democratic amendment \noffered by Senator Harry Reid. I want to suggest and heartily recommend \nto the Republican side of the aisle--I see my friend, Senator John \nBarrasso, of Wyoming, who is here. He is a medical doctor, an \northopedic surgeon. We are friends. We may disagree on this issue, but \nwe agree on many other issues. I hope he will encourage his leadership \nto produce a bill, show us what they believe. It would even be good if \nthey send it to the CBO, as we did, and let us know what it would cost \nfor the Republican plan for health care reform.\n  I will tell you what we have received from the Republican side of the \naisle. It is three pages long. If you are looking for brevity, it is a \nvery brief analysis of the health care reform issue in America. It is a \npress release from Senator Mitch McConnell, where, as of yesterday, \nSenator McConnell laid out everything--maybe not everything but most of \nthe things he thought were wrong in the Senate Democratic approach. It \nis all negative. There is not one positive in here in terms of what the \nRepublicans would do. Are they sensitive to the reality of health care \nin America today? Do they know the cost of health care insurance \npremiums have gone up three times faster than wages, that fewer \nbusinesses are offering health insurance coverage to their employees, \nand that more and more Americans have no health insurance protection \nbecause of unemployment and because of the cost of health insurance \ntoday? Are they aware that two out of three people filing for \nbankruptcy today are doing so because of medical bills--two out of \nthree--and that 75 percent of them have health insurance that isn't any \ngood? And they are in bankruptcy court. Are they aware of this cost \nchallenge? If so, what will the Republicans do about it?\n  They will show us a stack of paper that Senator Barrasso will show \nwhen he speaks, but they won't show us the Republican alternative. What \nis it? How much does it cost? How many people will it cover?\n  I hope my friend from Wyoming is the first Republican Senator who \nwill come to the floor and join us in at least saying there is one \nthing we agree on--that health insurance companies are running \nroughshod over consumers and\n\n[[Page S11832]]\n\nfamilies of America. I hope this Senator from Wyoming, and other \nRepublican Senators, will say there is one thing we can agree on with \nthe Democrats: We should stop these abuses by health insurance \ncompanies. We should not allow these health insurance companies to turn \nyou down for a preexisting condition when you get sick. We should \ndemand that the health insurance companies cover our children beyond \nthe age of 23.\n  My wife and I have been through this with our kids, and a lot of \nothers have, too. Here comes your son or daughter, fresh out of college \nand looking for a job--oops, he or she is 23 years old, so now they \nneed their own health insurance. Our bill moves that age to 26. Could \nthe Republicans endorse that idea? It would be great if they did.\n  Would they endorse the idea that your health insurance would stay \nwith you if you lose your job, and that we should not put caps on the \ncoverage of a catastrophic illness so it won't wipe out a family? I \nhope they will join us in health care reform.\n  Of all the criticisms, I have yet to hear the first Republican \nSenator take on the health insurance companies. That is what this \nbattle is about. Who will win? Will it be the American people or the \nhealth insurance companies? I hope our friends on the Republican side \nof the aisle will join us in saying that it is clear it will be the \nAmerican people.\n  Finally, this bill will expand coverage to 30 million more Americans. \nHow many more Americans will be covered by the Republican health care \nreform plan? I am sorry to say I can't tell you. No one can tell you, \nbecause they have not produced a plan. We don't know what they are \nplanning on doing.\n  This bill we are bringing before the Senate tomorrow for a procedural \nvote and to start the debate is a bill that is not perfect. I would \nhave written it a lot differently. But it is a bill that we are working \ntoward a working majority on. That means concessions. Some of these \nconcessions are painful, from my personal point of view, but they are \nnecessary. It would be great to have one Republican Senator cross the \naisle tomorrow night and say, all right, I may not agree with \neverything in your bill, but I do believe this is an important national \nissue; the Senate should debate it, and this Republican Senator will \njoin the Democrats in saying let's proceed to the issue, proceed to the \ndebate. I don't think that is too much to ask. In fact, I think most \nAmericans would say: Why wouldn't they want to debate it? Tomorrow \nnight, they will have a chance to vote on that cloture motion on the \nmotion to proceed to that debate. I hope they will join us at that \npoint.\n\n  I will address one particular issue raised by one Republican Senator \nyesterday. Senator Coburn of Oklahoma, a medical doctor, said of the \nDemocratic health care reform bill that there is a 5-percent tax on \ncosmetic surgery. He went on to say that this bill would cover breast \nreconstruction surgery after a mastectomy--in other words, imposing a \ntax on a surgery for breast reconstruction. I want to respond to him \nand say he is wrong and inaccurate. I want to make sure the record is \nclear. The bill we are proposing says the surgery is not a cosmetic \nsurgery if it is ``necessary to ameliorate a deformity arising from, or \ndirectly related to . . . disfiguring disease.'' That is in the bill.\n  The bill points to the current definition for deductible medical \nexpenses for the interpretation of this language. The IRS has already \ndealt with this. IRS publication 502 specifically states that breast \nreconstruction surgery following a mastectomy for cancer is deductible. \nIt is clearly not taxable under our bill.\n  That statement on the floor by Senator Coburn was inaccurate. I \nwanted to make that clear. The Senator was mistaken. Breast \nreconstruction surgery is not elective cosmetic surgery for the purpose \nof this bill and is not subject to the bill's 5 percent excise tax on \nelective surgery.\n  I know we have a limited amount of time before the other side of the \naisle has a chance to speak. I will save my remarks I had planned \nrelating to some people in my home area back in Illinois, who are \nbattling health insurance companies. On the Senate floor, I told the \nstory of Danny Callahan, a baseball coach at Southern Illinois \nUniversity who is fighting cancer. WellPoint has turned down the drug \nhe was using, which his doctor recommended, to fight cancer and said \nthey won't pay for it. It is a good drug for him, but it is expensive. \nIt stopped the spread of cancer. His doctor said this drug works, but \nthe health insurance company won't pay for it. The drug costs $12,000 a \nmonth. Danny Callahan cannot afford that. He will get a couple more \ntreatments, but that is it. At the first of the year, the health \ninsurance company is cutting him off from this lifesaving drug that is \nattacking the cancer in his body. They made that decision. His doctor \nsaid it was the wrong decision. He is another of many Americans who are \nat the mercy of the health insurance companies when you need help the \nmost.\n  Can we change this? Can we give the American people a fighting chance \nwhen it comes to these situations? I think we can. But we won't do it \nby saying no. That is what we have heard from the other side of the \naisle--no to everything. I hope that after 11 o'clock today, on Friday, \nNovember 20, the first Republican speaker will say: Here is the \nRepublican health care reform bill. You can find it on the Web site. \nYou can read it and compare it to the Democrats' bill. Again, the \nDemocratic version is available at democrats.senate.gov/reform. Read \nit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am looking forward to reading their \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Republican \nSenators, during their hour, be permitted to engage in a colloquy with \nfellow Republican colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the health care reform \nbill. This country needs health care reform. The status quo in health \ncare is unacceptable. Health care costs are skyrocketing, insurance \npremiums are increasing, and too many small businesses can no longer \nafford to offer health insurance to their workers. No one on either \nside of the aisle denies we need health care reform.\n  We need to enact reforms to bring down costs so everyone will have \naccess to quality, affordable health care. We need to take a step-by-\nstep approach to reduce health care costs and lower insurance premiums \nfor individuals and employers. We need to eliminate discrimination \nbased on preexisting conditions and ensure that people can take their \ninsurance with them from job to job. I support commonsense reforms that \nwould achieve all these goals.\n  Unfortunately, this 2,074-page Reid bill fails to address these \nissues. Instead, this bill would raise taxes by $493 billion. It would \ncut another $464 billion from the Medicare Program. The bill would \nreduce wages and eliminate the jobs of millions of Americans. It would \nactually drive up health insurance premiums for many more Americans and \nstill leave 24 million people without insurance coverage. We need to do \nbetter than that, and I think we can.\n  Our country currently faces one of the worst economies in a \ngeneration. Our unemployment rate is 10.2 percent, which means there \nare 15.7 million Americans without jobs.\n  At the same time, the bill we are debating, or will be debating when \nwe actually get to the real thing, would impose $28 billion in new \ntaxes on employers. This new tax will eliminate millions of American \njobs and reduce wages for millions of American workers.\n  When employers struggle with extra costs, workers and their families \nfeel the impact. American workers depend on a strong economy to create \njobs that help them feed their families and build their dreams. \nUnfortunately, the policies being pushed by the majority will only make \nit more difficult for America's businesses to hire workers or pay \ncurrent employees more.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, health researchers, and nationally \nrecognized economists all agree that Senator Reid's new job-killing, \nemployer tax will mean one thing: More Americans will be out of work if \nthis bill becomes law.\n\n[[Page S11833]]\n\n  As I mentioned, this bill will raise taxes by $\\1/2\\ trillion--$\\1/2\\ \ntrillion. The authors of the bill truly believe the greatest problem in \nour health care system is that we do not pay enough taxes for our \nhealth care.\n  Under this flawed bill, if you take a prescription drug, you will pay \na new tax. If you use any medical devices or equipment, ranging from \nwalkers to wheelchairs, you will pay a new tax. If you do not have \nhealth insurance, you will pay a new tax. If you do have health \ninsurance, you will also pay a new tax. If the government decides your \nhealth insurance is too expensive, there will be a new tax for that as \nwell.\n  The problem with our current health system is not that we don't pay \nenough taxes. Americans actually want to lower their health care \ncosts--that is the message--not just pay more taxes to the Federal \nGovernment. All these taxes will only increase costs, making health \ncare even more unaffordable.\n  The third major problem with this bill is it will actually increase \nthe cost of health insurance for millions of Americans. The bill \nmandates that insurance premiums for younger, healthier workers be \ntightly tied to the costs for older, sicker individuals. This will \nimmediately drive up costs for the young, healthy individuals who, \ncoincidentally, make up a significant portion of our current uninsured \npopulation.\n  The bill also eliminates consumer choices, requiring Americans to buy \nricher types of plans that cover more of the deductibles and cover more \nout-of-pocket expenses. These plans typically have much higher \npremiums.\n  Taken together, these insurance changes will increase costs for \nmillions of Americans. In looking at more modest provisions included in \nthe Senate Finance bill, nationally recognized accounting and business \nconsulting firms found these changes would increase insurance premiums \nby 20 to 50 percent.\n  The practical effect of this bill is, Washington could dictate to \nevery single American, even those who have insurance they now like, the \ncoverage they would need to purchase. Washington will tell you what is \ngood enough coverage. The bill does not give people affordable options, \nand it penalizes those who do not purchase high-end, expensive plans, \nregardless of what they want, need or can afford.\n  Before I was a Senator, I was a small businessman. My wife and I \nowned three shoe stores. When I was showing someone a shoe and he said \nhe did didn't like it or couldn't afford it, I didn't try another sales \npitch. I knew it was time to find another shoe, one he liked and could \nafford. If the customer is complaining, get something else to show. The \ncustomers are complaining. The voices of August are still out there, \nand they know this bill is just more of the same.\n  There is a lesson in that story when it comes to reforming health \ncare. It is time to listen to our customers and find an alternative \nthey want and can afford. The intensity of the country's disapproval is \napparent in townhall meetings, letters to newspaper editors, citizen \nprotests, constituent calls, and letters from all across the Nation. I \nreceived some of those that said: My Senator is not listening but you \nare.\n  I wish to find solutions. Ask most of my colleagues and they will \ntell you, time and time again, I have been known to work across the \naisle on commonsense reforms on all kinds of issues. I have fought for \nyears to enact commonsense reforms that will help slow health care cost \ngrowth and make the insurance market work better for small businesses.\n  I worked closely with Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska on a bill that \nwould allow small businesses to combine their purchasing power across \nState lines, even nationwide, and collaboratively buy health insurance \nat discounted rates.\n  I worked closely with the late Senator Ted Kennedy on a bill to \nreform the drug approval process at the Food and Drug Administration.\n  I worked closely with then-Senator Clinton on a bill to save lives \nand decrease costs by promoting greater use of electronic medical \nrecords.\n  Time after time, I have advocated that we set partisan differences \naside and work on the 80 percent of the issue that will make a \ndifference for most people.\n  Unfortunately, rather than working with Republicans to develop a \ncommonsense solution, the majority drafted a flawed bill that spends \ntoo much, does too little to cut health care costs, and puts seniors' \nbenefits on the chopping block.\n  The White House and Democratic leaders should have responded to these \nconcerns with alternative ideas that actually address the health care \nissues that most Americans care about--their cost. Unfortunately, they \ndecided to simply try a more aggressive sales pitch. As a result, \nopposition to it will only continue to grow.\n  If this bill continues to move forward, in spite of what most \nAmericans are telling us, I am going to keep offering amendments geared \nto bringing down health care costs for American families, scaling back \ntotal health care spending, and protecting seniors.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Wyoming who has copies of the \nbills.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, in joining my colleague from Wyoming, he \nand I had a townhall meeting together in Gillette, WY, his hometown, a \nwonderful community. I was just there last week for a Veterans Day \nparade. What Senator Enzi knows and I know is when we talk to the \npeople of Wyoming, they want commonsense solutions.\n  As I am here with the House-passed bill and the Senate bill we are \nnow looking at, people of Wyoming are astonished at the amount of pages \nin this sort of thing, how to deal with this, how to comprehend it. \nWhat does it mean? What if I like something on page 208 but don't like \nsomething on page 1,200?\n  We ought to be using a step-by-step process. My colleague has a \nwonderful program, a 10-point plan to improve our health care, and any \none of those would be a positive step to actually helping American \nfamilies, helping them get the health care they would like and they \nneed. But not these bills--one through the House, one through the \nSenate.\n  I don't know if my colleague wants to join me in discussing the \ntownhall meetings, where people said: We want health care reform; we \nwant things that are going to make life better but to help keep down \nour premiums, help keep down the cost of our care. Eighty-five percent \nof Americans have health care coverage. They are just not happy with \nthe cost. What I heard for the last hour from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle is we need to cover more people; we need to \ncover more people. That is only part of it. We need to keep down the \ncost of care for the 85 percent of people who like the care they have.\n  That is what happens when we get together with groups of people from \naround the State of Wyoming who come out for our townhall meetings to \ndiscuss the issues, to listen. We are there mostly to listen; they are \nthere mostly to talk.\n  I ask my colleague, is that not exactly what we heard: We need \nchanges but not this?\n  Mr. ENZI. Absolutely and not just townhall meetings. That is how the \nletters, e-mails, and phone calls are coming in, greatly in response to \nwhat they anticipated they were going to get, which was going to be \nlower costs. They don't mind helping other people to have insurance and \nsubsidizing that insurance or in some cases providing it for free. But \nthey expected to get something out of it themselves. We miss the mark \non this. You can tell they missed the mark. The bill that has been \nbrought up to be voted on is just a little 2-page bill. Why didn't they \nput up the House bill? Because they couldn't get 60 votes for the House \nbill. They know that is wrong. This is a whole lot different from the \nHouse bill. It is different. I give them some credit for that. They \ncouldn't put this bill up because they can't get 60 votes, and they \nhave to get 60 votes to move on to debate.\n  They brought up the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of 2009, \nwhich is actually two pages and a summary. So there is not much to that \nbill. Their hope is they can get the 60 votes and people will not \nconcentrate on the fact of what is in this bill.\n  I appreciate all the efforts of the Senator from Wyoming. He has been \ninvolved in the health care industry as a provider for a long time and \na real student of what is in these bills. He has\n\n[[Page S11834]]\n\nlooked at these bills in detail, so he knows a lot of the flaws. I \nappreciate him taking the time to point those out.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, there are a lot of flaws in these bills \nbecause what Senator Enzi and I both hear when we go to townhall \nmeetings--but also I had a telephone townhall meeting the other day--\nis: Don't cut my Medicare. Yet when we take a look at the details of \nthese bills, it is going to cut $500 billion--$500 billion--from our \nseniors who depend on Medicare for their health care.\n  They also say: Don't raise my taxes. But taxes are going to go up \nacross the board. Every family is going to notice an increase in their \ncosts, whether through taxes, premiums, an increase in the cost of \ntheir lives in terms of how it is going to impact the care they are \ngoing to receive. They say: Don't make my family pay more for health \ncare. But across the board, people look at this and say they are going \nto end up having to pay more.\n  When Senator Reid brought this bill out, he said: Of all the bills I \nhave seen, it is the best. To me, it is the best of the worst bills I \ncould ever see. It raises taxes. It is not just me speaking. If you \nread what the people who had a chance to read the bill say--the \nAssociated Press, the Washington Post, the New York Times, others \nthroughout the country, our e-mails from home--there are higher payroll \ntaxes, companies would pay a fee, rely primarily on new taxes, new \nfees, and then cuts in Medicare. It is beyond me that this Senate--that \nthis Senate, the Senate of the United States--is ready to tell the \nseniors of this country they are going to cut $500 billion from the \ncare these seniors get from Medicare. That is a growing number of \npeople. Year after year, more people are on Medicare but yet the cuts \nare going to be there.\n  The gimmicks, the budget gimmicks are astonishing. The advertised \npricetag is an astonishingly large number, over $800 billion. To get \ndown to that astonishingly high number, they have used quite a few \ngimmicks. You get taxes, you get Medicare cuts, and then you get the \ngimmicks.\n  I visited with Senator Gregg from the Budget Committee earlier today. \nHe is going to be on the floor to discuss the gimmicks. One of the \nthings they have done is basically hidden the true cost of the bill. \nThe true cost of the bill is going to be close to $2.5 trillion over a \n10-year span. They have done it by putting in a whole new program \ncalled the Community Living Assistant Services and Support Act. It is a \nnew Federal long-term care program.\n  What happens in these long-term care programs? They take in the money \nearly on and then they do not spend it until many years later. But in \nthe way they count money around here--they do kind of a 10-year score, \nthey call it. For the first 10 years they are going to be taking in all \nof this money, and then when it is time to pay the money out, that \nmoney is not going to be there anymore because they will have spent it \non the increased cost of medical care because these bills do nothing to \nget the cost of care down.\n  Kent Conrad, Democratic Senator from North Dakota, do you know what \nhe called this part of the bill, the Democratic bill on which we are \ngoing to be asked to vote? He called it a Ponzi scheme of the first \norder. He said it is the kind of thing that Bernie Madoff would be \nproud of. That is a Democrat talking about what is in this bill.\n  What has the Washington Post said? ``It's a gimmick. These are not \nsavings that can honestly be counted on the balance sheet of reform.''\n  Do we need reform? Yes. Do we need health care reform? Do we need to \nchange the system? Absolutely. But this is not the way to go.\n  Senator Enzi is here. He has done a remarkable job as a member of \nboth the Finance Committee and the HELP committee, and he has been part \nof the markups for both of the bills. He has focused relentlessly on \ntrying to get the costs down so the premiums for the American people \nwill not go up, and he has offered amendment after amendment, and they \nhave been rejected time and time again.\n  Then Senator Reid gets these two bills--one from the HELP committee, \none from the Finance Committee--tries to stitch them together behind \nclosed doors, and there is an amendment that Senator Enzi had put into \nthe bill, one of the bills--it was voted on and approved--and then it \nmagically disappeared without the knowledge of any members of the \ncommittee. It was something intended to help the American people, but \nthat got taken out and thrown away in the dead of night.\n  I don't know if Senator Enzi would like to comment on that, but this \nis a Senator who was working to improve the lives and health and \npocketbooks of the American people, and his great idea is thrown away.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to comment on that, in some way, unprecedented \naction by a committee. We agreed in committee on some amendments. Then \nwhen the bill was actually printed, which was not done for 2 months--\nwhich was, I think, so people couldn't actually look at it during the \nAugust recess, during that 2 months--when it was finally printed, some \nof the things that were agreed to were left out. One of the big ones \nwas an actual wellness program, one that worked for Safeway, that \nhelped cut their cost in the first year by 8 percent.\n  Have you heard of anybody cutting their costs in health care? Their \nprogram did. Since that time it has been held level because of what \nthey were able to do with wellness programs. We got that wellness \nprogram approved. We didn't get much approved when we were doing that \nbill, but we got that approved.\n  But when the bill was printed, that was left out. Staff, without \ntalking to any one of the Members, had taken it out. I think that is \nunprecedented around here. But that was not the only instance either. I \nwould like to direct the attention of Senators to the costs on this \nbill, which the Senator from Wyoming has mentioned. As an accountant, I \nlook at those. They say they are going to reduce the deficit in the \nfirst 10 years and even more in the second 10 years. There are two ways \nthey can do that. One of them is to raise taxes. The other is to steal \nmoney from other people, which is what they are doing from Medicare. \nThat, maybe, means they are overtaxing? So that might mean they want to \nstick in some other things that will be spending. Is there anybody out \nthere who thinks you can do a $1 trillion new program and it will not \ncost a dime?\n  I hope people are taking a look at matters such as the Wednesday \neditorial by the president of Harvard who made some comments about how \nthings are working. I hope everybody reads that. This is a good way for \nour Nation to go broke. We are not in very good shape right now, but \nthat is a good way to go broke, and there are a lot of gimmicks in this \nbill too.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Wyoming pointing that out, and I assume \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, who is the chairman--ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee now--and has a handle on a lot of these gimmicks \nwill share some of those too.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could join this colloquy with my colleagues from \nWyoming--what a great State to have two such exceptional Senators. \nFirst off, I want to make this point: Obviously, a lot of folks are \npointing at this bill which I have right here--the Senator from Wyoming \nhas one, and the other Senator from Wyoming has one--because it is \nreal. Up until now most of the debate that has been occurring around \nhere has been media. A lot of it has been theater. Some of it has been \ngood theater, I hope, but it has been theater to a large degree.\n  Now we are dealing with something that is extremely real. Every page \nof this 2,074-page bill will have an impact on Americans. Every page of \nthis bill will make a decision and direct a policy that will affect the \nhealth care of every American everywhere.\n  It is an extraordinarily intrusive and expensive bill. The Senators \nfrom Wyoming have been alluding to this, but it really is historic. The \ncolleagues on the other side say this is a historic bill. It is \nhistoric. Never in my experience, and I don't think in any experience, \nhas the Congress taken up a bill which is essentially going to \nrestructure and fundamentally change the way that 16 to 20 percent of \nthe national economy is going to be affected in such an immediate and \nintrusive way.\n  Essentially, the Federal Government will affect every decision that \nhas to do\n\n[[Page S11835]]\n\nwith health care as a result of this legislation, every decision that \nhas to do with health care.\n  The cost this is going to create in the area of increasing the size \nof the government is astronomical. We have heard this number, that this \nis a $890 billion bill. That is pretty big. I suspect that would run \nthe State of Wyoming for a few years, maybe a century. I think the \nState of New Hampshire would probably run for pretty close to a \ncentury--in fact, more than a century, to be honest with you. I don't \nthink our budget is $8 billion yet. So that is a lot of money, $800 \nbillion plus. But that is not the real number. That is a phony number. \nThat is a bait-and-switch number.\n  That number is arrived at by claiming, over a 10-year period, that \nthe programs that are initiated in this bill--which is a massive new \nentitlement--will not start until the fourth and fifth year. In fact, \nthe House bill was at least a little more honest than the Senate bill. \nIt started in the fourth year. The Senate bill starts in the fifth year \nwith most of the spending. But the taxes which the Senator from \nWyoming, the senior Senator from Wyoming was just talking about, and \nthe fees and the reductions in Medicare, they start pretty much in the \nfirst year.\n  So they have taken 10 years of taxes, fees, and cuts in Medicare, and \nthey have matched them against 4 or 5 years of actual spending and \nclaimed that they are in budget balance and that the bill only costs \n$890 billion--only.\n  In fact, CBO has scored this over the real period, when all the \nprograms are in place. Over that period, over that 10-year window when \nall the programs are functioning that are created under this bill--all \nof them being Federal programs, brandnew entitlements, extraordinarily \nexpensive initiatives--when that occurs, this bill costs, by CBO's \nestimate, $2.5 trillion. In order to pay for that we would have to cut \nMedicare by over $1 trillion. In order to pay for that we would have to \nraise taxes, fees, by over $1.5 trillion. This is a massive increase in \nthe size of government, a massive increase in tax burden, a massive \neffect on Medicare.\n  The Senator from Wyoming mentioned there are a few gimmicks in here \non top of the huge gimmick, that it is a bait-and-switch, that this is \na $800 billion bill when in fact it is a $2.5 trillion bill. There are \na lot of other games in here that deal with budgeting. I found one of \nthe more entertaining ones: the fact they take credit in this bill for \ncreating a new program, the CLASS Act, a massive new program, a long-\nterm care program. They take credit in this bill as that being a budget \nsurplus item. How do they figure that out? Because on a long-term care \nprogram, basically people in their twenties, their thirties, their \nforties, even into their fifties, pay into it. It is like buying \ninsurance under this plan, so that money comes into the Federal \nTreasury.\n\n  What they do not account for is when those folks go into their long-\nterm care facility and the money goes out, the money goes out at an \nincredibly fast rate, and the program balloons radically in its costs. \nThey do not account for that. They just account for the years when \npeople are paying in, and they claim that as surplus money they apply \nto try to reduce the cost of the bill. So they spend the money.\n  This is classic. First, they take in the money and claim it as an \nadjustment against the debt they are running up, and then they spend it \nso it will not even be available to pay for the program they claim they \nare going to fund with it. It is just inconceivable.\n  Bernie Madoff is in jail. Whoever thought up this program and scored \nit in this bill, Bernie Madoff would be proud of that person. He would \nsay: My type of guy. That is the way you do accounting--fake it.\n  It is unbelievable. There are a whole series of these types of games \nin here. The States are going to be taken to the cleaners by this bill. \nThe allegation that we are going to expand Medicaid by 20 to 30 million \npeople, and the States are not going to end up paying a huge bill as a \nresult of that? Absurd on its face. It is absolutely absurd on its \nface.\n  More importantly, when we expand Medicaid by 20 or 30 million people, \nthe doctor will tell you, back here, the reason Medicaid is in such \ndire straits is because doctors will not see Medicaid patients. Why? \nBecause they are reimbursed at 60 percent of the costs. Who pays the \nother 40 percent, by the way, for the present Medicaid recipients? Who \npays the other 40 percent? I will tell you who pays. Mary and Joe \nJones, who are working down at the local restaurant who have health \ninsurance, they pay it with their premium. Bob and Marie Black, who are \nworking over at the local software company, they pay it with their \nhealth care premium. The 40 percent of Medicaid that is not paid for by \nthe government is paid for by people who are in private insurance. \nTheir insurance premiums go up because they are subsidizing Medicaid \nreimbursements because the hospitals have to get paid for the cost, and \nthey are only getting 60 percent of it from the government and the \nother 40 percent is being picked up by the private sector.\n  When we expand Medicaid by another 20 or 30 million people, we are \ninevitably going to drive up the costs of private insurance again. So \nthe private insurance policies go up. What does that do? It does what \nthis bill is basically intended to do: it will force employers to drop \nprivate insurance and move people over on to the public plan. That, \nwhen you get down to it, is what this is all about. This is an exercise \nin having the Federal Government get control over all health care. It \nis being done in an incremental way. They are setting up a scenario \nthat will not be immediately apparent to people. But as we move through \nthe years it will become apparent because what will happen is the costs \nof private health care will go up so much that private employers will \nstart to drop their health care. They will take the penalty, which is \nnot that high in this bill compared to what they have to pay in health \ncare costs, and move their people, and say: Sorry, I am not going to \ngive health care anymore--or never did--and go get this government \nplan.\n  Then down the road Congress will change this government plan a little \nbit, and they will start to put price controls in, just like they want \nto do in Medicaid. Basically, that will mean people will get fewer \nproducts because as you put price controls in you will have less \ninnovation, fewer drugs. Fewer devices will be developed because people \nwill not be getting a return on their investments because these will be \nprice-controlled events.\n  You will find delays because that is what happens when you move to a \ngovernment program that controls costs. The government can only control \ncost by controlling price. That creates delays in access which is what \nhappens in England and Canada. So the quality of the health care system \ngoes down.\n  I ask my colleague from Wyoming, who is uniquely qualified to comment \non this because he is a doctor and he has experienced the problems of \ndealing with Medicaid, is this not a reasonably accurate reflection of \nwhat will happen if we move another 20 or 30 million people into the \nMedicaid Program? Doesn't that mean that private insurance policies \nhave to go up, fewer doctors will see fewer people, and inevitably we \nwill end up with a cost shift which forces private insurers to drop \ninsurance?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, that is exactly what is going to happen. \nNo. 1, we will get this huge push of an unfunded government mandate \nonto the States, a mandate that both Republican and Democratic \nGovernors have called the mother of unfunded mandates, and they are \nacross the board opposed. This is the way that Washington, with its \nwisdom, will say: We keep the price down, but what we will do is make \nthe American people pay for it in a roundabout way. The more people you \nhave on Medicaid, the program to aid the poor--and we have seen this in \nMassachusetts with their health care plan; there are not enough doctors \nto take care of everyone so the system is swamped, which is why it is \ntaking now up to 9 weeks to get an appointment to see a doctor in \nMassachusetts, but also about 40 percent of doctors do not see Medicaid \npatients because the reimbursement rate is so low.\n  What you said, 60 percent of the cost, that is exactly right. It \ndoesn't cover the cost of seeing the patient. We are talking about \nhiring a nurse, turning the lights on, paying the rent on the office, \ndoing all of those things, the medical charts, the liability insurance, \nthe whole list of the costs of having an\n\n[[Page S11836]]\n\noffice opened. You cannot keep the office open if all of your patients \nare Medicaid patients. As a result, physicians--and I saw every \nMedicaid patient who wanted to see me. My partners and I have the same \nprogram where anyone can call and get an appointment, regardless of the \nability to pay. But we know 40 percent of the doctors don't see \npatients on Medicaid.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may ask a question on that point, this is an \nimportant point. As a practicing physician, if all your patients had \nbeen Medicaid, would you have been able to pay your bills?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The answer is no. Doctors' offices cannot stay open at \nthe rate that Medicaid reimburses, and no hospital in the country can \nstay open if they are getting paid across the board at Medicaid rates. \nYou have to have other people who are paying more to make up for the \nunderpayment by the government on Medicaid.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I might follow up, doesn't that inevitably mean that \nthe people who are paying more are in the private sector, which means \npremiums for people in the private sector go up, which means fewer \npeople are willing to give that type of coverage because the cost is \ntoo high for the business to cover; right?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The people who have private insurance end up paying \nmore for their insurance premiums to help make up the difference \nbecause the government has across the board been the greatest deadbeat \npayer. Washington is a deadbeat when it comes to paying for health care \ncosts, both for Medicare as well as Medicaid across the board. That has \nbeen the long tradition of Washington and health care. The other people \nwho are penalized under this situation are people who have no health \ninsurance, because they are being charged at a higher rate. The person \nwho works hard and says, I will kind of self-insure in case something \nhappens, I get sick and I have to pay the full bill, they pay the full \nbill to cover themselves as well as more to help for the underpayment \ndone by Washington.\n  That is how, when you have more and more people on the Medicaid \nrolls, more and more people forced onto that through Washington's \nwisdom, it is going to be harder on people who have insurance through \ntheir jobs. Insurance premiums, for people who have insurance and like \ntheir insurance, those rates are going to go up. It is going to make it \nharder for American families and for small businesses that want to hire \nsomeone, because the rates of insurance will go higher. It will make it \nharder for small businesses to provide health insurance for their \nworkers, and those who continue to provide health insurance will not be \nable to give raises because the costs are going to go up.\n  This whole approach to health care reform was supposed to be designed \nto help keep the cost of care down. That is what the President and the \nSenate promised all through the year. But it does not. It drives prices \nup.\n  When I hear my colleague from New Hampshire talk about all of the \ngimmicks being used in an effort to claim this is a good bill, I refer \nto this morning's column ``Health Bill Hoax.'' Only Bernie Madoff could \nbelieve the Senate's health care bill will expand coverage to 31 \nmillion while cutting the deficit by $127 billion over 10 years. It \nwould be the first profitable entitlement. Kind of like when the \nPresident of the Senate, at an AARP townhall meeting this year, said: \nWe have to spend money to keep from going bankrupt. On its face, we \nknow how absolutely ridiculous that sounds. You can't do that. This is \nan incredible expense: taxes galore, all over the place. The word \n``tax'' is used in the Senate bill 183 times; ``taxable,'' 164 times; \n``taxes,'' 17 times; ``fee,'' 152 times; ``penalty,'' 115 times.\n  For people who believe this will keep down the cost of care, it will \nnot. As my colleague from Wyoming said earlier, I advise Members to \ntake a look at an editorial by the dean of Harvard Medical School, \nliving in a State where they have the Massachusetts health care plan, \nwhich is government-forced insurance, government-mandated care, \ngovernment-run care. According to the dean of Harvard Medical School in \nan editorial this week, the health debate deserves a failing grade. The \nplan is wrong and those who support it are living in collective denial. \nThis is what is wrong with this. This will markedly accelerate national \nhealth care spending rather than restrain it. It will do nothing or \nlittle to improve the quality of care.\n  That is what we started with at the beginning--to improve quality, \nimprove access, and lessen the cost. What we have is a bill which, if \npassed into law and signed by the President, will decrease quality, \nincrease cost, and lessen the access of Americans to health care \nproviders.\n  I appreciate my colleague's comments. The numbers are so high. These \nare staggering figures. How do you communicate to the folks back home \nhow astonishingly large these numbers are? Because people say: We do \nwant you to fix things, but don't cut Medicare, don't raise our taxes. \nDrive down the cost of medical care. Improve access to providers. \nCreate more choices. As I look at this, to me this is going to mean \nhigher health insurance costs, higher taxes, Medicare cuts and then, \nunfortunately, more government control over health care decisions.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. He has a unique \nperspective which we should listen to, as a practicing physician for \nhow many years?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I have 24 years practicing orthopedic surgery, taking \ncare of the families of Wyoming.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is impressive. He understands this whole issue and \nthe point on cost. It is very hard to conceptualize that this is a $2.5 \ntrillion bill when honestly scored. When honestly scored, it is a $2.5 \ntrillion bill.\n  This page right here, page No. 1, cost the American people $2 \nbillion. You could pick almost any page in this bill. And I don't think \nthey are worth $2 billion a page. This page here, what does that say? I \ndon't know. I am just picking this out: Transfer to the Secretary of \nTreasury a list of individuals who are issued a certification under \nsubparagraph (h), including the name and taxpayer identification number \nfor each individual, the name and taxpayer identification number of \neach individual who was an employee of an employer but who was \ndetermined to be eligible for the premium tax credit under section \n36(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 because, A, the employer did \nnot provide essential coverage, and B, the employer provided such \nminimum essential coverage, but it was determined under section--and on \nit goes--section 36 (b)(c)(2)(c).\n\n  I don't understand what that said. We now will have about 72 hours to \nfigure it out. But I know this much: When a bill costs $2 billion a \npage and when it includes language such as that, it is something we \nshould spend some time on. This bill is being rushed. It should not be \nrushed. This vote that will occur tomorrow at 8 o'clock at night, after \nhaving this size of a bill on our desks for less than 2, 3 days, is \nvery serious. We are firing real bullets here. This is no longer \ntheater. It is no longer political media. This is the passage of a \npiece of legislation, the potential passage of a piece of legislation. \nTomorrow's vote is a critical vote because it basically will mean we \nare on the road to passage. In fact, 97 percent of the bills that come \nto the floor of the Senate under a motion to proceed pass.\n  So this piece of legislation is serious. It is real bullets at $2 \nbillion a page. Tomorrow's vote is something we need to look at as a \nvote that is not some sort of a procedural vote. It is a substantive \nvote on whether we are going to fundamentally change the way health \ncare is delivered, cause the size of this government to grow by \ntrillions and trillions of dollars, and put the Federal Government \nvirtually into every decision that has anything to do with health care. \nWith the way you choose a doctor, the way you get your insurance, with \nthe type of procedures you get, with the type of drugs you can obtain--\nthe Federal Government will be involved. How much it costs, the Federal \nGovernment will be involved. And with the type of debt that will be \npassed on to our children. This bill will play a major role.\n  Remember something about the Federal Government: Once you give the \nFederal Government power, you don't get it back. This bill is all about \nmoving power here to Washington. That is what this legislation is \nabout, about centralizing the decision process, the national decision \nprocess on health care. In the end, the goal, as openly stated by some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and I appreciate the \nfact that they are forthright--is to\n\n[[Page S11837]]\n\nhave a single-payer system where the government essentially runs health \ncare top to bottom, much as it does in Canada and England. I believe \nthat fundamentally undermines quality and is fundamentally \nunaffordable. It passes on debt to our kids which we obviously don't \nwant. In the process, it will take Medicare, which is already in \nserious trouble--there is already a $55 trillion unfunded liability in \nMedicare--it will take Medicare's problems and aggravate them \ndramatically. To the extent savings are taken out of Medicare and used \nto create this new entitlement, which has nothing to do with Medicare \nor Medicare recipients but is going to be funded by Medicare both on \nthe tax side with the HI tax in here and in the cuts in Medicare \nbenefits with the elimination basically of Medicare Advantage, all of \nthat is Medicare money that should be going, if you are going to do \nthose things, to making Medicare more solvent for seniors, not to \ncreating a new entitlement.\n  I see the Senator from North Carolina wants to jump in here.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank my colleagues from New Hampshire and Wyoming. Let \nme say on the same note, an $800 billion-plus bill, when you ask \nanybody in America, do you think this will increase the deficit, \neverybody's hand goes up. But the claim is that this is deficit \nneutral, that there is no no continuation of increasing the debt. Let \nme pick three areas, one you were just talking about, Medicare. This \nbill proposes that we shift $464 billion over 10 years to pay for this \nnew program.\n  Mr. GREGG. Fully phased in, it is a trillion dollars.\n  Mr. BURR. But in that 10-year period, if you took Medicare, the \nproposal to shift over, if you face the reality that we will not cut \ndoctor reimbursements 23 percent, which is another $246 billion worth \nof revenue, and the creation of a new program called the CLASS Act \nactually has people paying in for 20 years before the first person \nmight take out a benefit, those three items alone come to $700 billion \nof the $800 billion we are paying for it with. Most Members would agree \nthere are cuts that probably will never happen. On the face, it says it \nis going to contribute to the deficit. It will continue to add to the \ndeficit at greater numbers, as the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee has stated.\n\n  But let me try to point out something I know my colleagues \nunderstand. This is a bill about coverage expansion. This is not a bill \nabout health care reform. There are very few reforms, if any, in this \nbill. The Senator from Wyoming was talking earlier about Medicaid. One \nof the fundamental reforms that has to be made in health care is that \nwe have to eliminate cost shifting where an individual who is uninsured \ngoes in, receives a service, does not pay, and the cost is shifted to \nthe private side, with people who pay out of pocket, people who have \ninsurance. For the underinsured, the person goes in and receives a \nservice, but the reimbursement is less than the cost of the service, \nand what is left over is shifted. Usually that is where the debate \nstops.\n  But under Medicaid, the current system, we reimburse 72 cents of \nevery $1 provided, meaning 28 cents is shifted to the private pay side, \nout-of-pocket and insured side. In this reform package, we are \nincreasing the rolls of Medicaid by 15 million Americans. We are taking \na program today where, if the attempt is to eliminate cost shift--which \nit should be in health care reform--we would be eliminating Medicaid \nand we would be putting the Medicaid beneficiaries in a program that \nactually provided them a medical home, provided them an opportunity at \nprevention, wellness, and chronic disease management.\n  But, no, we are keeping Medicaid intact. And in the bill it says to \nthe States: You cannot change your program. You have a maintenance of \neffort. You may find a more efficient way to do it, but if that \nefficiency means you are cutting any benefit, you are asking them to \nselect where they choose health care differently, you cannot do that, \nStates. We are locking you in for 10 years. And we are going to \nincrease the rolls in Medicaid by 15 million Americans. We are actually \nexacerbating the problem we are trying to solve, which is, either \nshifting from people who do not pay or where there are reimbursements \nthat underreimburse for a service. We are increasing the rolls by 15 \nmillion Americans.\n  Forget the fact, as the good doctor from Wyoming knows, that when you \nlock them into Medicaid, you have locked them out of having a medical \nhome. You have locked them into a system that is there to treat them \nwhen they get sick and not to spend a dime on trying to keep them well. \nThe truth is, health care reform, in large measure, is about our \nability to change the lifestyles of the American people so we make \nhealthier choices.\n  In part, you do that by creating a medical home. It is the reason \nmost of us, if not all of us, have argued that everybody should be \ncovered in some fashion. Health care should be accessible and \naffordable. The debate is over: where and what type. And, more \nimportantly, should the American people have the ability to have \nchoice? Should the American people have the ability to construct a \nhealth care plan that meets their age, their income, and their health \nconditions?\n  What we are doing is, we are taking on a one-size-fits-all government \napproach to say: If you do not like what is out there, we are not going \nto let what is out there change. We will give you an option, and it is \nto be insured and to be managed and to be run by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I am not sure how others in other States have found it. In North \nCarolina, it has been overwhelmingly rejected by the population. I \ndaresay, I think we have the greatest health care delivery system in \nNorth Carolina, both public and private, some based in academia. I \nthink what North Carolina says is: Do not hurt my quality of care. If \nwe are going to talk about reforms, let's talk about how we increase \nthe quality of care, not decrease it.\n  Unfortunately, this misses the boat on reform. It is the most \nexpensive approach to coverage expansion that anybody could ever \nimagine. The question is, if we took some time, if we worked in a \nbipartisan way, could we find a way to do this more efficiently and \nmore effectively for quality of care, where the outcome was different?\n  This is a town obsessed with process, as my colleagues know. This is \na product where we should be focused on outcome, not process. Because \nat the end of the day, there is an American family who is going to be \nthe recipient of the rules, the regulations, and also the outcome of \nwhat this produces.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator has made a very good point, which is how you \ndo health care correctly. You do not create a massive new Federal \nentitlement. You do not spend $2.5 trillion we do not have. There are a \ncouple things you could do, though, on a step-by-step basis.\n  One of them--and I would be interested to know if the Senator \nunderstands why it is not in here--one of them is to correct lawsuit \nabuse. It is estimated $250 billion a year of medical expenditure is \ndefensive medicine which doctors order and hospitals undertake simply \nto avoid the potential of a lawsuit being filed. CBO estimates it would \nbe a $50 billion savings if we would adopt the proposals they use in \nTexas, California. That is one approach.\n  Another approach would be to allow employers to pay employees more \nwho live healthy lifestyles, such as employees who stop smoking or \nemployees who get the tests they need--whether it is mammograms or \ncolonoscopies--when they should have them or employers who live healthy \nlifestyles and lose weight. Under the bill that is not allowed, other \nthan what present law is, which is very restrictive. That would save a \nlot of money, by the way.\n  The first proposal, as I understand, was opposed by the trial \nlawyers. Do you think that is why it is not in this bill--saving $54 \nbillion on abusive lawsuits?\n  The second proposal--allowing employers to pay a differential and pay \nemployees who are living a healthy lifestyle more--is opposed by the \nbig labor unions here in Washington. Do you think that is why it is not \nin this bill?\n  I wonder whether maybe the Senator from North Carolina has some \nthoughts on those two approaches as to whether they would help the \nhealth care system in this country, and why they did not find their way \ninto a 2,000-page bill, since we seem to have a lot of room in this \nbill for things.\n\n[[Page S11838]]\n\n  Mr. BURR. I think the Senator makes a good point. I think many in the \nCongress who have worked on health care for a period of time have seen \nprivate businesses across this country reach new efficiencies in health \ncare. Why? Because they have self-insured their employees. Where have \nthey focused? They have focused on exactly what the Senator has talked \nabout: prevention, wellness, chronic disease management, paying \nemployees to enroll in chronic disease management courses, working with \ndietitians to make sure they lose weight, having cessation programs \nthat are offered for free.\n  The things we have seen in private companies across the country that \nhave brought down health care costs are absent in this piece of \nlegislation. It is as though they have come to Washington and shared \ntheir tremendous experience, and we have ignored it when we sat down to \nwrite the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is because we would have to change something called \nHIPAA.\n  Mr. BURR. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is a technical term, but it basically allows companies \nto pay an employee who lives a healthy lifestyle more than other \nemployees, and that is opposed, as I understand it. It was originally \nin one draft, and it got dropped somewhere.\n  Mr. BURR. Well, the Senator makes a tremendous point about the \nrational, reasonable reforms that the American people are looking for, \nand saying: Why can't we purchase insurance across State lines if that \ncreates competition? Why can't we have insurance reform that allows us \nto construct the products? Why does the Federal Government have to \nmandate: Here is what the structure is?\n  Many Americans have chosen over the past several years to have \nflexible spending accounts, to have the ability to put their money in \nto take care of their health care needs. What does this bill do? It \nbasically reduces the ability to fund flexible spending accounts at the \namounts that are sufficient to let them continue to access their health \ncare, in many cases with their own money. In fact, that is going \nbackwards from what we have learned.\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned earlier this shift of money \nfrom Medicare to this new program. Think about our Nation's seniors, \nthose who are relying on Medicare for their health care, and the next \ngeneration that is getting ready to go in--some of us in this room. \nWell, when you shift $464 billion, you are shifting $1,063 per senior \nper year. Over the 10-year life of this score, we are going to shift \n$10,363 per senior, per beneficiary on Medicare today.\n  Is that fair to our country's seniors who have paid a lifetime of \npremiums into Medicare to receive a benefit, that because of fiscal \nirresponsibility that benefit may be cut in the future or the premium \nmay go up for the next generation? And, thank goodness, the current \nbeneficiaries in Medicare are screaming as loud as anybody because they \nunderstand the ramifications of what we are getting ready to do.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire said, this is all going to happen \ntomorrow. This is going to happen at 8 o'clock Saturday night. People \nare going to come to the floor and they are going to vote on a bill, \n2,074 pages--one that, at best, takes a team of people reading and a \ncomputer searching words in hopes you can identify everything of \nimportance that is in the bill.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The Senator from North Carolina, who has been a \nchampion of early detection, early treatment, and prevention of \ndisease, did see a preview of rationing this past week when this \nPreventive Services Task Force made a decision and recommendation about \nbreast cancer.\n  The Senator talked about our seniors. I worry about rationing of \ncare, delaying care, denying care. They said for women under 50 they \nshould not have mammograms anymore. They should not do a breast self-\nexam. They said for women over 75, they should not have a mammogram \nanymore.\n  I will tell you that my wife is a breast cancer survivor, and she was \ndiagnosed by a mammogram under the age of 50. And they cannot say that \nmammograms are not helpful. What they are saying is that the number of \nmammograms done per life saved is not cost effective.\n  I know both of the Senators who are on the floor, from New Hampshire \nas well as from North Carolina, have talked about early detection, \nearly treatment, not using cost as the issue on comparative \neffectiveness research. We say let's use some clinical judgment. Let's \nsee what we can learn. But, no, because for women under 50, they have \nto do 1,900 mammograms to save a life. For women over 50, it drops down \nto 1,300 mammograms to save a life. So that is what they are putting \nthe cost of a life at: a 600-mammogram difference.\n  But for my wife--who is alive today, after three operations, and two \nfull bouts of chemotherapy, and is now 6 years cancer free--having that \nmammogram under the age of 50 meant the difference between life and \ndeath.\n  That is what this bill has to do with. It is the difference between \nlife and death for people. If you get into rationing care, delayed \ncare--that is why people come to the United States for their care. It \nis the best care in the world. That is why Canadians and Europeans come \nhere, because they have to wait too long. That is why our techniques \nand our treatments and our survival for cancer is so much better in the \nUnited States than these other countries. Because the Senator from \nNorth Carolina knows it is that early treatment that makes a big \ndifference.\n  Mr. BURR. I think the Senator from Wyoming, being a medical \nprofessional, would probably agree with this: that every disease that \ncan be detected at an early stage provides, one, more treatment \noptions, greater survivability and, in the long run, less expensive \ncost to treat that disease.\n  It troubles me we have these determinations being made on cost that \nare not true costs because they are not putting into the calculation \nthe treatment cost. But, more importantly, incorporated in this bill we \nare putting fees on medical device companies, we are putting fees on \npharmaceutical companies, we are putting fees on health care equipment \ncompanies. Why? Because they have to pay for them.\n  We are replicating the same thing. We are disregarding the fact that \nwhen an innovative drug comes off the research bench, there is a \nlikelihood we could cure disease versus maintaining, that we might have \na new treatment option that cuts down on the cost.\n  As the Senator knows, even though he is an orthopedic surgeon, we \nhave cholesterol-busting drugs that now people take who would have been \nin line for bypass surgery. And after that, we got stents that we put \nin, in place of bypass surgery, and that bypasses the last resort.\n  Sure, the creation of those blockbuster drugs was expensive. As they \ngo off patent, generic competition comes in, and they become very \ninexpensive. But when compared to the $70,000-plus of bypass surgery, \nthose drugs all of a sudden look inexpensive. But, more importantly, \nwhen you look at the quality of the care, where a patient did not have \ntheir chest cracked, they did not have rehab time, they did not have a \nhospital cost, we save a tremendous amount of money in the health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could jump in at this point.\n  I think the Senator has touched on something that is important; that \nis, when you start putting these major fees on things such as medical \ndevices and drugs, you reduce the willingness of people to invest in \ncreating the next device, and not only do you end up with a device \nbeing priced out of the market or maybe not being produced, but----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we be allowed to speak for an \nadditional minute each, so we may wrap up our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. My point is, this bill fundamentally undermines \ninnovation, and innovation has been at the essence of what has made \nAmerican medicine better than the rest of the medicine in the world. We \nare the most innovative country in the world in the areas of drugs and \nmedical devices and procedures. I think this bill undermines that.\n\n[[Page S11839]]\n\n  Mr. BURR. I might add, that level of innovation is what makes the \nU.S. health care system unique to the rest of the world. We may not do \nprimary care very well, and I think we have all admitted that, but if \nyou get sick, where do you want to be treated? Right here in the United \nStates of America because of the innovation that takes place.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, there are improvements that need to be \ndone to the system. There are simple things we can do to keep down the \ncost of care, such as allowing people to buy insurance across State \nlines as well as giving individuals the same tax breaks big companies \nget, ending lawsuit abuse and dealing with what is needed to be done in \nterms of incentives to help people stay healthy so they have \nopportunities to save money themselves, and allowing small businesses \nto join together.\n  The bill we are looking at here is going to raise premiums for people \nwho already have insurance. It is going to raise taxes on all \nAmericans. It is going to cut Medicare--cut Medicare--for our seniors \nwho depend upon Medicare for their health care needs. And while they \nare doing it, they are going to fund a whole new program rather than \nsave Medicare--a system we know is going to go bankrupt.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am very proud to be here with \ncolleagues of mine who have today joined me on the floor. Senator \nMerkley from Oregon and Senator Mark Begich from Alaska are such \nstrong, passionate voices for people in this health care debate, for \nwhat we need to do to stop the insurance abuses and to save lives and \nsave money. I am so pleased they are both here with me. Let me take a \nmoment before turning it over to them to talk about what this is really \nall about for us.\n  Right now, the bill in front of us basically saves lives and saves \nmoney. We save lives through making sure that the 47,000 people who \nlost their lives last year because they couldn't find affordable health \ninsurance to be able to see a doctor--making sure we change that; by \nfocusing on prevention, also, so people have early detection and people \ncan find out earlier when they have cancer and get the treatments they \nneed to save their lives. There are so many ways in which this bill in \nfront of us literally will save lives.\n  We save money. We save money for individuals and small businesses \nthat are currently having a difficult time finding affordable \ninsurance. If you have your insurance through an employer, as do about \n60 percent of the people in my State, and if you are a large employer, \nthen you can get a better rate because you have a large group plan. If \nyou are a small business, you don't get that same treatment today. If \nyou are an individual, if you are, like many people today, operating \nout of your home as a businessperson, a single entrepreneur, or maybe \nyou are creating that next great invention in your garage and you are \ntrying to find health insurance as a single individual for yourself and \nyour family, you can't do that right now in a very affordable way.\n  So we want to fill in the gaps in a system that has worked well for \nmany people with employer insurance and certainly for people in \nMedicare and our veterans with the VA and our military personnel and \nothers. But we have a little less than 20 percent of the public right \nnow that is left out there without a way to get affordable insurance, \nso we want to bring down their costs. We want to bring down the costs \nfor our bigger businesses as well.\n  We want to make sure we are stopping people from using emergency \nrooms inappropriately and raising the cost on everybody with insurance \nand instead give everyone the opportunity to see their own doctor, \ntheir family doctor, and make sure their children and their families \nget the care they deserve.\n  We know this also saves money for the Federal Government, for States, \nfor our economy as a whole, and we know what the numbers are in terms \nof inaction, the fact that we need to bring down costs across the \nboard.\n  This bill protects Medicare. We know we would not have the AARP \nendorsing the House plan and hopefully supporting ours as well--I know \nthey are still looking through the specifics, but they certainly \nsupport health care reform, and we welcome their support. They want \nhealth care reform. They have said certain things that I think are very \nimportant that debunk what we have heard from the other side of the \naisle.\n  We have heard over and over that health care reform will hurt \nMedicare. The AARP Web site has up on its site: Myth: Health care \nreform will hurt Medicare. And then it says--not from us but from the \nAARP, a champion for senior citizens in this country--Fact: None of the \nhealth care reform proposals being considered by Congress would cut \nMedicare benefits or increase your out-of-pocket costs for Medicare \nservices. None of the proposals we have introduced as the Democratic \nmajority, supported by President Obama, would do that.\n  Fact: Health care reform will lower prescription drug costs for \npeople in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or what has now been dubbed \nthe ``doughnut hole,'' so that they can get the better, affordable \ndrugs they need.\n  Fact: Rather than weaken Medicare, health care reform will strengthen \nthe financial status of the Medicare Program--strengthen it for the \nfuture.\n  We know Medicare has been a great American success story, and we want \nto make sure it is on strong financial footing to go forward for all of \nus who are baby boomers and beyond, to our children. This comes from \nthe AARP Web site. So we strengthen Medicare. We protect Medicare.\n  Then we focus like a laser on stopping insurance abuses. We have \nheard so many times, unfortunately, story after story about families \nwho cannot find insurance because someone in the family has a \npreexisting condition of some kind--a child who has leukemia, someone \nwho is a diabetic. Even for women, pregnancy has been used as a \npreexisting condition. We want to make sure all Americans have the \nopportunity to find affordable insurance. We want to make sure that if \nyou have insurance you have paid for your whole life, you have paid the \npremiums, you feel confident that because you have health insurance, \nwhen somebody in the family gets sick, the companies can't drop you on \na technicality.\n  So we have a number of areas in which we want to stop abuses and, \nfrankly, strengthen the system. We want your children to be able to \nstay on your policy until age 26 if they need that. That is something I \nhave often said that I wish had been in place a couple of years ago \nbecause I know what it is like to have a son or daughter come out of \ncollege and that first job doesn't have health insurance.\n  We want to make sure early retirees get the health care they need and \nare able to afford their health insurance with the Federal reinsurance \nplan, to help businesses keep costs down for people who--frankly, many \nhave been forced to retire at age 55 or age 60 and don't yet qualify \nfor Medicare.\n  So this is the bottom line: We are saving lives, we are saving money, \nwe protect Medicare, and we stop insurance abuses.\n  I wish to focus for a moment on something else we are doing that is \nabsolutely critical to me and, I know, to colleagues across the \ncountry, because this plan will also save jobs. Folks have said to us: \nWell, don't talk about health care; let's talk about jobs. Lowering the \ncost of health care is about jobs. It is about jobs. We lose jobs \noverseas to other countries that have lower health care costs than we \ndo. We have seen plants--in fact, in Michigan--go across a river that \nyou could swim across, the Detroit River, from Michigan into Canada, \neverything else being equal--a unionized labor force, environmental \nstandards--everything else equal but one thing: the health care costs \nare less. So this is about jobs, and it is about keeping jobs in \nAmerica.\n  We know our plan will allow big employers to save $9 billion over the \nnext 10 years--$9 billion. What will they do with that? They will put \nthat back in,\n\n[[Page S11840]]\n\nreinvesting in equipment, building other plants, hiring more people.\n  Health care reform is about jobs.\n  Small businesses are estimated to save 25 percent in their costs over \nthe next 10 years with the tax credits we have in the bill--the ways we \ncreate the ability to buy through a large pool, to be able to lower \ncosts, and with the tax cuts in the bill to small business. There are \ntax credits to help all the companies that don't have insurance to be \nable to find affordable insurance.\n  The bottom line is, it is estimated that if we do nothing, the costs \nto businesses will double, and we will lose 3.5 million jobs. We can \nturn this ship around and begin to bring down costs. It is estimated we \ncan save 3.5 million jobs.\n  People in America understand we have to focus on jobs and the \neconomy. They also know the one-two punch is that when you lose your \njob, you lose your health care. So in our bill, we specifically create \npolicies that make sure that if you lose your job, you don't lose your \nhealth care.\n  We want businesses, large and small, to be able to redirect the \nspending on ballooning health care costs and premiums, to be able to \nredirect that on hiring people and doing what we know how to do best, \nwhich is making things in America and putting people to work.\n  This is about jobs. It is saving lives and saving money and saving \njobs in this country. I will conclude by saying that what are we \nhearing from our colleagues on the other side is the same kind of \ntactics that were argued in the 1960s before Medicare. You can take \nsome of the same arguments and lift them right from the pages of the \nCongressional Record and you would think it was today's debate, but it \nwas actually back in 1964, 1965, with Medicare. We know the arguments \nthey used then about destroying the economy, about costs going up, \nabout people losing access to doctors, and about how this would hurt \nbusinesses--it didn't happen then. We know it will not happen now. But \nwhat we are hearing is: Just wait, wait, wait, wait--that is all we \nheard in the Finance Committee. Don't do it now. What is the rush?\n  Well, if you are not getting those premium increases in the mail, \nmaybe you don't feel the rush. If you are not losing your job and \nhealth care, maybe you don't feel the rush. But we have been talking \nabout this for 100 years. We are tired of waiting. The American people \nare tired of waiting. They are saying business as usual for insurance \ncompanies: Let the insurance companies decide whether we are going to \nhave maternity care covered under basic insurance. That is not \nnecessary. It is an option. Let them decide whether we are going to \nfocus on prenatal care.\n  We are 29th in the world in the number of babies who live through the \nfirst year of life--below Third World countries. Right now, 70 percent \nof the insurance companies in the individual market don't offer \nmaternity care as basic health care. They say let the insurance \ncompanies decide. Let them be the ones between you and your doctor. \nWhen a doctor says what he wants to do when you are sick, what is the \nfirst call they make? To the insurance company. They say that is OK, \nlet the insurance companies be the ones deciding what you are going to \npay or get, whether you are going to be able to find coverage. Let them \nstand between you and your doctor. We say: No, we have had enough of \nthat.\n  Finally, they say higher costs for middle-class families and small \nbusinesses are OK. Higher costs are OK because they are willing to \nallow this craziness to continue. Mr. President, we are not.\n  Let me emphasize, again, the bottom line: This is about saving lives, \nabout saving money, and it is about protecting Medicare and stopping \ninsurance abuses. We are committed to doing those things, getting \nthrough all the misinformation. All those who make so much money off \nthe current system are just flailing and saying anything right now to \ntry to stop us from getting control of the system and bringing costs \ndown and making health care available. We are committed to getting this \ndone for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow for her \nleadership. Last night, I had the honor of presiding while she spoke. I \nheard her first comment after she heard the other side describe the \nbill, saying it is so big they cannot read it, but they had great \ndetail, for some reason. She even said she wouldn't support a bill as \nthey described it. I agree with her. After hearing the last hour and \nwhat they described, I wouldn't support it either.\n  But that is not what this bill is about. This bill is about saving \nlives and saving money, protecting Medicare and stopping insurance \ncompanies and their abuse. I sat here for a few days--and I preside \nquite a bit, and I enjoy the opportunity to watch. I see the props \nbrought out by our opponents. They always bring out the bill. It is \nalmost always taller than they are. It is interesting that the prop is \nnot realistic. The American public should know that. They make it look \nlike it is such a large bill that they are incapable of studying it and \nreading it in a fashion--something that drives one-sixth of our \neconomy. I learned one thing. In the last 11 months, I have gotten so \nmany different books on different issues, and it is amazing. I took the \nbill--one of the pages out, page 114, and I was curious and thought, if \nwe converted this into a regular book page similar to the ones we read \non a regular basis--or all the books I get that people want me to \nread--I said, how big would it be? Well, it is just about as big as the \nbook I have here. It is not hard. If you want to do it--and former \nSenator Martinez, who left us recently, I took his book, and it is an \neasy read. Maybe you would have to read it twice. It is not as they \ndescribe--like it is some complicated, huge document that is bigger and \ntaller than they are. It is not a fair representation of what we are \ndoing.\n  As you know, we have lots of pages here who work hard every day. I \nknow they were surprised when I grabbed one of their textbooks for just \none subject matter that they are required to study in order to be \nproficient. If you converted it into bill language, it would be four \ntimes the size of that document that they stack next to them. We ask \nour young people to be well educated, to learn the topics, and \nunderstand what they are referring to when they are tested. It is a \nsimple thing.\n  I encourage our colleagues on the other side to not be so extreme in \nthe way they display the bill. It is not accurate. I think it is \nimportant to recognize that. This book is short. Probably people cannot \nsee this book because it is so low on this table.\n  The other thing, as a new Member, I am learning the elements of the \nprocess here. I heard some colleagues on the other side talk about the \nprocess. The motion to proceed is a simple issue. It is an issue of are \nwe going to debate this in earnest. Are we going to put ideas on the \ntable rather than just talk about it and talk about it? We tried this a \nfew weeks ago on the Medicare fix. The idea was a motion to proceed so \nwe could move forward and debate how we were going to pay for it. The \nMedicare fix is critical to Alaskans. We have Alaskan seniors who want \nto make sure the reimbursement rate is the right one to ensure long-\nterm coverage. But they didn't want to move on the motion to proceed. \nTherefore, we never debated how to pay for it. We couldn't get there \nwith the amendments that many of my colleagues on the Democratic side \nwere anxious to put forward. That is where it is.\n  To the American public and for folks listening to this forum here, it \nis important we keep to the facts, and they are very simple. This bill \nsaves lives, money, protects Medicare, and stops insurance abuses. It \nis proconsumer, pro-patient. It creates more affordable access to \nhealth care. It strengthens Medicare, as I said. It is fiscally \nresponsible. We have a long way to go. I hear, again, my colleagues on \nthe other side say rush, rush, rush or, as the Senator from Michigan \nsaid, they always want to wait, wait, wait. The fact is, we are going \nto have weeks of debate, and there are items I will bring forward to \nimprove this, similar to many of my colleagues on both sides who will \nbring forth amendments. That is what we should let happen in the \nprocess--debate it, discuss it, and end up with a product that will \nimprove the health care system of this country. That is the goal.\n\n[[Page S11841]]\n\n  When I hear, on the other side, that somehow this bill will be \nrationing, delaying, and denying care--I don't know about you, but I \nget letters every single day about people who have been denied care by \ntheir insurance company, who have been rationed out because they have \npreexisting conditions. They cannot get coverage because of the delay \nof the private insurance companies and the techniques being utilized.\n  It is important to know the debate on this side of the aisle on this \nbill is about ensuring that we will no longer have insurance companies \ndenying or dropping coverage. We are asking insurance companies in this \nbill not to place limits on your coverage and ration your care. As I \nsaid, there will be no discrimination for preexisting conditions, and \nthere will be preventive care, making sure people can access their \nhealth care and their insurance.\n\n  As was said by Senator Stabenow, who clearly understands the job \nissues because of the struggle in her State, there is a report--I will \ncite a few things, and I know Senator Merkley from Oregon has many \nitems, because as we have sat here as freshmen talking about health \ncare, I know he has more to share from the small business perspective.\n  My wife has been a small businessperson for many decades. A report \nwas done by the Small Business Majority, working with MIT. Here is the \nbasic data. The largest employers in this country are small \nbusinesspeople. Small businesses will pay $2.4 trillion over the next \n10 years for health care costs for their workers. With minor reform, I \nbelieve that is what we are offering, at minimum. It will save them as \nmuch as $855 billion. That is not me or a bunch of politicians coming \nup with this; it is people in the small business community working with \nfolks to do the research who determined this. That means more small \nbusiness can employ people and raise capital, expand employment, create \nnew jobs. As described earlier, it saves real money for small \nbusinesspeople.\n  I can tell you my brother-in-law who owns and manages one of my \nwife's operations has diabetes, a preexisting condition, and he has a \n$15,000 deductible. He pays an enormous amount each month, with no \npreventive care or chronic maintenance. It is a program that will not \ndo much for him until he ends up in a hospital in a severe condition.\n  This bill is not just about making sure the insurance companies are \nheld accountable and do the right thing for people who buy and have \ninsurance today; it is also about creating jobs and making sure the \nprivate sector continues to grow.\n  The last thing I will mention right now--and we talked about this--is \nprotecting Medicare. This bill protects Medicare. Why I know this is \nbecause I have looked at that component of the bill and, most recently, \nI had to explain this to my mother who is on Medicare; she is 71 years \nold. She discussed this with me just this week, as I visited her at her \nhome in Carson City, NV. She described her sister, my Aunt Audrey, who \nhas a disease. She is in the doughnut hole, where she has to pay for \nprescription drugs that she had no idea she would have to pay for. \nToday, this bill is trying to rectify and fix that problem and make \nsure seniors who are struggling out there don't end up having enormous \nout-of-pocket expenses. This issue around Medicare is not real. What we \nare trying to do is solve the problem and make sure to extend its \nlength of stability but making sure seniors get more. They have earned \nit and they deserve it. This bill moves it forward.\n  Again, I wish to reemphasize the point that this bill reduces the \ndeficit. It has a positive impact for this generation and \nfuture generations--$127 billion in the first 10 years, $650 billion in \nthe next 10 years. That is what it does.\n\n  You will hear all kinds of numbers--and I am sure people who watch \nthis get confused, as I do at times, listening to all these numbers \nthey throw out. But that is the fact. That is not decided by us as \nDemocrats or Republicans; that is the independent office of CBO that \nmade that determination. They determined that is the positive impact to \nthe deficit.\n  We need to push aside all the debate and rhetoric that is out there \nthat is not factual and focus on what is right. Again, as we move \nforward on health care and insurance reform, there will be a lot of \nstuff put on the table. There will be items I will put on the table to \nwork to improve health care and to protect Alaskans--yes, I will be \nparochial at times--but also look to the greater picture for America. \nThis will be a great debate. It won't end Saturday at 8 o'clock; it \nwill continue on and on, probably to some folks' dismay because it will \nbe longer than people want.\n  The fact is, we will debate this issue. We will struggle with it. We \nwill struggle with it within our own caucus of what the right decision \nis. But when done, our focus is the American people, improving the \nsystem--the status quo is not acceptable--and ensuring that we save \nlives, save money, improve Medicare, and hold our insurance companies \naccountable for their actions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to listen to the \ncomments of my colleagues from Michigan and Alaska, Senators Stabenow \nand Begich.\n  The bill before us saves lives, saves money, saves jobs, strengthens \nMedicare, and ends insurance abuse. You wouldn't have known that is the \ncase if you were tuning in earlier to the Republican discussion in the \nlast hour because what we had were a series of interesting arguments \nranging from the plain silly to the flat wrong.\n  On the plain-silly end, we had a stack of paper about the complexity \nof a bill that addresses one-sixth of our economy and quality of life \nfor every single American. My friend from Alaska has pointed out that \nif you put it in a normal size print, that is about equal to a normal \nbook. I think we ought to realize that with a topic as serious as \nhealth care reform, which is touching the lives of every American, you \nare going to want to be thoughtful enough to address it in that detail.\n  We also had in the last hour a conversation about how much does the \nbill cost per page. Senator Gregg from New Hampshire said the bill is \ngoing to cost $2 trillion and there are 2,000 pages, so it costs $2 \nbillion a page. Last I checked with my schoolchildren, 2 divided by 2 \nis 1, not 2 divided by 2 is 2. But that is not the point. The point is, \nhealth care reform is not an issue to be played with hysterics, to be \nplayed with phony visuals, to be played with phony math. This is about \nour future, a future in which our businesses can compete around the \nworld and in which our small businesses are able to provide health \ncare. In fact, this is about quality of life for every single American.\n  In the course of my colleagues from across the aisle discussing the \nbill, they actually made a pretty good case for it. Let me start with \nSenator Burr.\n  Senator Burr said health care reform should be about choice but this \nbill takes one-size-fits-all. Boy, I thought, he is absolutely right. \nHealth care reform should be about choice, and this bill before us is \nabout choice.\n  Right now in America, we have one dominant player in most major \nhealth care markets. Even if we have more than one, we have antitrust \nexemptions that enable the health care companies to collaborate and \ncooperate. So you don't have real choice in the marketplace today.\n  What does this bill do? This bill says we are going to give every \nAmerican the same type of choice Federal employees have. I became a \nFederal employee in January after I was elected and sworn in. I was \ntold to go to a Web site and look at all the choices I had. My wife and \nI sat down and looked at the situation facing our family, and we chose \nthe health care plan we thought would be best for us. We had that \nchoice. What this bill does is it creates a health care exchange or \nhealth care marketplace that creates those choices and puts them in \nfront of every family.\n  I will tell you that right now it is very hard for an insurance \ncompany to go into a new market. Why is that the case? Because in \nhealth care, unlike in life insurance, you have to do contracts with \nthe providers. You cannot sell health insurance if you don't have \narrangements with the hospitals and the doctors. It is very expensive \nto do. You don't yet have any customers. So it is very hard to break \ninto a new market. But now, if you have a computer marketplace that \ncitizens who go to the exchange are going to see and have a\n\n[[Page S11842]]\n\nchance to change plans every year, you have automatic access to the \ncustomers and you can then afford to make contracts with the hospitals \nand physicians. It encourages competition across State lines. Take \nOregon. You may have a company operating in Washington, Idaho, or \nCalifornia now say: Yes, we want to be on that exchange in Oregon.\n  I say to my colleague from North Carolina, he is right, reform should \nbe about choice, and this bill is about choice.\n  My colleague, Senator Barrasso, told a poignant story. He told a \nstory about his wife having breast cancer and how fortunate he was and \nshe was and their family was that it was detected by a mammogram and \nhow important that type of preventive care is. I couldn't agree with \nhim more. But millions of Americans--45 million, 47 million, one report \nsays 50 million--do not have health care, and therefore they cannot get \nthose preventive tests. They cannot get that mammogram if they are a \nwoman. They cannot get that prostate checked if they are a man.\n  Senator Barrasso makes a very good point about why we need to expand \nhealth care coverage throughout this Nation. The bill Senator Reid has \nput before us will reach between 94 to 98 percent of all Americans.\n  The question came up: Why not 100 percent? Because Americans move a \nlot. Americans have crises and may not be paying attention when they \nare supposed to sign up. There will always be a small part of the \npopulation that is not signed up for health care. That is why it is a \nfew percentage points. Let's put it this way: 100 percent of Americans \nwill have the opportunity to have affordable, accessible health care. \nThat is what this bill is about.\n\n  Returning to my colleague from North Carolina, he made the point that \nthe bill before us is not about reform and that it should be about \nreform, about insurance reform. I have good news, good tidings for my \ncolleague from North Carolina. Embedded in this bill are all kinds of \nreforms that are important for every person who has insurance in the \nUnited States of America.\n  First of all, guaranteed issue. You cannot be turned down because you \nhave a preexisting condition if we pass this bill. I cannot tell you \nhow many Oregonians--and I am sure it is true in North Carolina--have \nbeen turned down for health care insurance because of some health care \nproblem they had in the past, maybe in the far past of their life.\n  This bill says you cannot have a lifetime limit. What kind of \ninsurance do you really have if you have a $50,000 or $100,000 lifetime \nlimit? After 20 years of paying your premiums, you get sick and, as you \nall know, you can wipe out $50,000 or $100,000 in a week or two. And \nnow you are informed--you paid health care insurance for 20 years, you \nhave been in the hospital for 2 weeks--sorry, you are on your own now. \nWhat kind of insurance is that when it is not there when you need it? \nThis bill reforms that.\n  This bill adds nondiscrimination for gender, which is a fundamental \nvalue I think all Americans share.\n  This bill says you cannot be dumped off your insurance when you get \nsick or you have an accident. How many Americans have paid health care \ninsurance premiums for years, paid those premiums month after month, \nare very healthy, rarely go to the hospital, rarely go to the doctor, \nbut then they have a car accident and are seriously injured or they \nhave bad news and have gotten a serious disease and they get that \nletter from their insurance company saying: Sorry, we are not renewing \nyour insurance; you are on your own. So now, because preexisting \nconditions are not allowed, they cannot get insurance from anybody else \neither. They truly are on their own. This bill reforms that.\n  I am glad to let my colleague from North Carolina know that this bill \nis about reform.\n  Senator Enzi noted the story of selling shoes, that he had three \nshoestores and that when a customer came in and he showed him a shoe \nand that customer said that shoe is too expensive, he knew he shouldn't \nkeep pushing the same shoe, he should not keep trying to sell it. No, \nhe should show him a different shoe. That is exactly what the public \noption does in this bill.\n  Those who are in support of the status quo and don't want reform, \nthey want to keep sending the same shoe, keep saying: Americans, you \nhave only one choice or maybe a couple choices. But within a situation \nwhere there are no antitrust provisions, you just have to keep going \nback to that private company--no new shoe for you; no different product \nfor you. But this bill says: No, if you are not happy with that, there \nis another alternative. In fact, this bill not only gives you one new \nshoe, it gives you two. Nonprofit co-ops can be set up--a provision \nthat came to us through the Finance Committee--and it gives you a \nstrong public option, a plan dedicated to healing, not dedicated to \nprofits. So if you are not satisfied with the insurance you have, you \nhave some alternative choices.\n  I think my colleagues across the aisle made a very good case--maybe \nbetter than the case I could make--for the fact that we need health \ncare reform. We need it for large businesses so they can compete around \nthe world, and we need it for our small businesses so they can afford \nto provide health care to their employees. We need it for our families \nbecause health care is about the biggest stress families face in \nAmerica. If you have health care, you are worried about losing it, and \nif you don't have it, you are worried about getting sick. We need \nhealth care reform today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments and \ncontinue this discussion and then turn it over to the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Udall. We are so pleased to have him. We \nserved together in the House. We are pleased to have him as a colleague \nin the Senate. They are a terrific team of people who are so smart, who \ncare so much and have such great experience. Our previous speaker, \ncoming from Oregon as the leader in the State legislature, and Senator \nBegich, as a leader, as a mayor--we bring a wealth of experience of \npeople who have been serving, problem-solving, trying to make \ngovernment work, make the right decisions at various levels of \ngovernment. It is wonderful to be working with them today.\n  I wish to take a moment because I understand that the Republican \nleadership, our colleagues, are currently holding a press conference \ntalking about what we are doing is somehow rationing care. This is the \nsame argument, by the way, used back in the sixties with Medicare. \nSomehow seniors would not be able to get care, it would be rationed, \nwhich, of course, is the exact opposite of what happened.\n  Now people hold their breath if they retire early and don't have \ninsurance, just waiting to turn 65 so they can get Medicare and they \ncan see whatever doctor they want, not the one the insurance company \nsays they can see but the doctor they believe they need to see, the \nspecialist they believe they need to see.\n  We know that for too many people in this country, there is the \nultimate in rationing. Over 45,000 people lost their lives last year \nbecause of the ultimate rationing. They couldn't find affordable health \ninsurance. They couldn't see a doctor. They couldn't get the care they \nneeded. Mr. President, 45,000 people in the greatest country in the \nworld paid the ultimate price. Shame on us. We want to stop that. This \nlegislation will head us in the direction to stop that, to say as a \nmatter of principle in this country that it is not acceptable that any \nAmerican would lose their life, any mom or dad would lose their child \nbecause they could not find affordable insurance in this great country.\n  We also know that every year we push as hard as we can to increase \nthe amount of money going to the National Institutes of Health to \ngather information, to do research to save lives--to save lives through \nresearch, through information. In this legislation we want to make sure \nas the NIH is doing more research, as we are looking at better \nprescription drugs or new cures, that we are giving physicians and \npatients the very best information.\n  I am not scared of information. I want information for my family, for \nmyself. I have been in a situation--I am sure that we all have--talking \nto\n\n[[Page S11843]]\n\nmy physicians, where they said according to the latest data we now \nthink a little bit differently about a particular procedure or a \nparticular medicine. And they make a different recommendation. I want \nmy doctor to have that information. That is not rationing. In fact, we \nspecifically say in this bill, we specifically prohibit the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services from denying coverage of treatment solely \nbased on research, solely based on information. But we certainly want \nthe information.\n  I think it is kind of silly to even argue about whether we want \nmedical research and information so our doctors have the very best \ninformation to be able to treat us. Right now, less than 1 percent of \nour health care spending goes to examining what treatments are most \neffective. We want to make sure the information is there for \nphysicians. Physicians support that, by the way. This is something in \nthe House bill, endorsed by the AMA, endorsed by medical professionals \nall across the country. We want our doctors to have more information to \ndo a better job for us, not less.\n  We are hearing, over and over, scare tactics. We know we are going to \ncontinue to hear that until we get to the end and pass this bill. But \nnone of the groups--doctors, nurses, family groups, consumer groups, \nbusiness groups--none of those who currently support this legislation \nwould be doing so if they thought it was in fact doing the things the \nother side is claiming it is doing, and certainly not if it was \nrationing care. The ultimate rationing right now occurs when people \narbitrarily get dropped because the insurance company doesn't want to \npay the bill; when people cannot get the coverage they need because of \na preexisting condition; or when they lose their life because they \ncan't find affordable insurance. Our legislation is about saving lives \nand saving money.\n  I wish now to turn the floor to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow for \nthat very good statement on what I think is a very important issue. As \nwe speak, and as I have watched the floor, I hear my Republican friends \ntalking, as Senator Stabenow said, about rationing. They are seeming to \nimply this legislation somehow would do that. They also look at this \nadministration and see that a prevention task force report of some of \nthe key experts in the country, trying to give us the very best \nscience, the very best medicine--that somehow that could be rationing.\n  My advice to women, listening to this debate, is that they should be \nconsulting their doctors when it comes to things such as this. They \nshould be listening to their doctors. Their doctors are up on the best \nresearch, they are up on the best science, they are up on the best \nmedicine and get on top of it.\n  I would say to the women of America: Listen to your doctors, not to \nRush Limbaugh.\n  Senator Begich from Alaska is on the floor. I am happy to join with \nhim and Senator Merkley and Debbie Stabenow--with all these great \nSenators down here--to talk about this bill. But there is something \nthat--I look on the other side and I see these huge stacks of paper. We \nshould be a little bit truthful and talk to people in a truthful way \nabout these stacks of paper. First of all, they are one-sided, so you \nonly have print on one side, which is not even the way we print them up \naround here. I have had mine printed up on both sides so I use both \nsides of the paper. They have made an attempt here to make it look a \nlot higher than it is, as Senator Begich pointed out here earlier \ntoday, and if you take the type and reduce it to the regular type of a \nbook, you come out with an average size book.\n  We are doing a piece of health care legislation that is very \nimportant to this Nation, a significant part of our economy, and we \nwant it to be something that will rein in these insurance companies, \nbring in competition, bring in more choices, so we have to be careful \nabout what we put in it. I think we should focus on the substance \nrather than focus on the gimmicks. We are getting a lot of gimmicks \nfrom our friends on the Republican side with these big stacks of paper. \nLet's talk about the substance.\n  I hope we are going to see someday in this debate an actual \nRepublican bill and proposal so we can debate it back and forth. We \nhave not seen that yet. We have just heard an awful lot of rhetoric.\n  One of the things I want to talk about today is what is a very \nimportant part of this bill and that is the public option section. A \npublic option would bring to the Nation more competition. What we want \nmore than anything is to have more choices when it comes to insurance. \nWe want to see as many choices out there in the marketplace.\n  Sometimes I don't understand, when my Republican friends talk about \nthis, because we are talking on their terms--about competition, about \nchoice in the marketplace, giving people more choices. I don't \nunderstand why they are opposed to those kinds of solid principles that \nare the backing of this particular bill.\n  The other thing a public option would do is keep insurance companies \nhonest. That is tremendously important. We have these insurance \ncompanies out there, we know they are doing very well in terms of their \nprofit making. I am going to be talking about that in a little bit. We \nknow they have very high administrative costs. If you have a public \noption that is actually dedicated to providing health care rather than \nto making a profit, then you are going to have something going on in \nthe marketplace that will keep everybody honest.\n  As you can see here, keeping the insurance companies honest, \ninserting competition into the market, and giving the uninsured access \nto affordable coverage--that is what we are talking about here. When we \nsay a ``public option,'' we are not talking about subsidized by the \ngovernment. This is going to be fully financed by premiums. The public \noption is not going to make a profit for its shareholders, it is going \nto focus on health care. It would have low administrative costs since \nit operates as a nonprofit. It would exert bargaining power to obtain \ndiscounts from providers. It would offer savings to its subscribers \nwith lower premiums, greater benefits, or lower out-of-pocket expenses. \nIt should follow the same insurance requirements as private plans. What \nyou are going to see is the public option offering low cost and high \nvalue.\n  I think at this point what I wish to talk a little bit about is what \nhas happened with some of our major health care insurance companies in \nthe last couple of months. We have reached the end of a quarter. You \nsee Wall Street has completed its third quarter earnings. Two of the \nbig health care companies, Humana and Cigna, released their reports a \ncouple of weeks ago. Let's just say that both companies did very well \nlast quarter.\n  How well, you ask. Humana reported a 65-percent jump in profits over \nthe same period. That is a big number. But, ironically, Humana's \nearnings seem positively restrained compared to Cigna's report. That is \nbecause Cigna reported a 92-percent increase in third quarter profits--\n92 percent.\n  Many companies right now are just getting back on their feet after \nthe worst recession since the Great Depression. Although the economy is \nimproving, times are still tough. When you take that into \nconsideration, an earnings report with a 65-percent jump or a 92-\npercent jump in profits makes you wonder how Humana and Cigna are doing \nso well in such tough economic times.\n  I will tell you how they do it. They do it by putting profits above \npeople. While Humana and Cigna touted earnings that are \nincomprehensible to the average person, or the average business for \nthat matter--the average businesses, the business people I talk to say, \nare making 10 percent, 15 percent profit if they are doing well. Yet \nhere these folks are making these huge profits.\n  While these health insurance companies are doing that, 47 million \nAmericans continue to struggle without health insurance. While Humana's \ntotal revenue jumped 8 percent to almost $8 billion, and Cigna \npredicted profits of more than $1 billion this year, small businesses \nbegan reporting that their premiums are expected to jump more than 15 \npercent next year.\n  Unfortunately, Humana and Cigna are not alone in their ``profits \nabove people'' business model. Over the past 7\n\n[[Page S11844]]\n\nyears, publicly traded health insurance companies, companies that \ninclude Humana and Cigna, saw a 428-percent increase in profits--428 \npercent increase in profits. While the companies were raking in the \ncash, so were their CEOs, who in 2007 alone made $118 million between \n10 of them. That is why health insurance premiums more than doubled \nover 9 years. Health insurance premiums doubling over 9 years, three \ntimes faster than wages increased.\n  Giant insurance companies are happy with the status quo. For them it \nmeans little competition, skyrocketing profits and the ability to do \njust about whatever they want to do to boost their bottom lines. A \npublic option would change all of this. It would keep insurance \ncompanies honest by putting much needed competition back into the \nmarket. It would provide real choice for Americans by giving them \nanother option that best meets their needs. And it would help small \nbusinesses and the self-employed by making health insurance for their \nemployees more affordable.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pay close \nattention to these earnings reports. I urge them to take a hard look at \nthe skyrocketing profits these health insurance companies have reported \nand ask themselves: Whose side am I on? The insurance companies that \ncontinue to put profits above people, or the people I was sent to \nWashington to represent?\n  I know which side I am on. I know a public option is the right thing \nfor Americans and the right thing for this country.\n  One of the things we hear in this debate--all of us, as Senators, \nstay in constant contact with our constituents. We get mail, we get \ntelephone calls, we get e-mails. My constituents in New Mexico have \ntalked to me a lot about their health care problems. They have talked \nto me about their rising premiums. They have talked to me about losing \ntheir insurance. And they send me some very powerful stories I want to \nshare.\n  Here is a story from a woman in Placitas, NM. Here is what she wrote \nme in an e-mail.\n\n       Dear Senator Udall: I own a small business--just me and my \n     secretary. I just got my notice from my insurer about the \n     rate increase for next year, which is between 9 and 10 \n     percent. For two people I will now be asked to pay $2,300 per \n     month in premiums.\n       We can't afford it. I am now faced with the likelihood of \n     having to drop insurance, which for two cancer survivors is \n     not the right answer.\n       I know you support the public option and that you are a \n     reliable vote for reform. But if anyone on the Hill is \n     keeping a record of how the inanity of this debate is \n     actually affecting real people, please include this e-mail in \n     the log.\n\n  How would a public option help in that circumstance the woman just \nwrote in about? A public option would provide another, more affordable \nchoice for small businesspeople such as this lady from Placitas, people \nwho own their own businesses, who are doing the right thing, pursuing \ntheir own American dream. These folks cannot achieve that dream when \nthey are paying outrageous costs for health coverage for themselves and \ntheir employees. A public option would help small businesses succeed by \ngiving them another, more affordable choice in the insurance market.\n  This is something we need to focus on. As we flip through the bill, \nas the American people look at this bill, ask themselves: Are you for \nthe status quo, are you for keeping these premiums going up, are you \nfor the insurance companies dominating the market or are you for \ncompetition? When it finally comes down and we look at the overall \npackage, it is going to be clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will vote for the motion to \nproceed. That gets us to the point at which we can have the bill before \nthe Senate in order to debate and to amend the legislation. It is a \ndebate we must have. It is a debate we cannot afford not to have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is OK as long as it is taken from the Democratic \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will vote for the motion to proceed to bring \nthe legislation before the Senate. This is a debate we must have. It is \na debate we cannot afford not to have. What is before us is to make \nhealth insurance available and affordable. The legislation that will \ncome before us will prevent someone from being denied insurance because \nthey have a preexisting condition. It will not allow the insurance \ncompanies to cancel policies because someone is sick. It will bring in \nmillions of uninsured people who will then be able to have insurance \nand can afford it. By the way, that brings down the cost of all the \nrest of our premiums because they get health care at the emergency \nroom, and guess who pays. All the rest of us do, to the tune of a \nnational average of about $1,000 per policy. This legislation will \nreduce the deficit, $130 billion over the next 10 years and over $650 \nbillion in the second 10-year period. There is room for improvement. \nThat is why we need to debate it. That is why we need to amend it. I \nwill be offering an amendment that will produce savings to the \ntaxpayers of another $100 billion by lowering the cost of drugs to \nMedicare recipients. Let the debate begin. I look forward to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Republican side should now have 60 \nminutes; correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That will extend until about 2:05.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the debate has begun. The debate is \nabout reducing health care costs--the cost of premiums every American \nhas or the cost to the government that every American has to be \nresponsible for. The bill we have been presented goes in the opposite \ndirection. It raises taxes. It means higher premiums. It cuts Medicare. \nIt transfers major new costs to States which, in turn, will damage \nhigher education and/or increase taxes or both.\n  Our purpose on the Republican side is to take this next hour, as we \nintend to take several hours, all the hours allocated to us today and \ntomorrow, and help the American people have a chance to read the bill \nsection by section, to understand what it costs and to understand how \nit affects them.\n  In this next hour, the Senators from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss and Mr. \nIsakson, and the Senator from Kansas Mr. Brownback, will be focusing on \ntax increases. We will be referring specifically to page 348, title I, \nsubtitle (f), part 2 of this 2,074-page bill, which has to do with the \ntax on employers. We believe a great many employers will look at this \nbig bill, look at the tax on them, if they don't pay insurance, look at \nthe new government program and say: It is going to be a lot easier for \nme to pay the fine and write a letter to the employees and say: \nCongratulations, I have written a check to the government. You are on \nthe government plan.\n  Then we will go to page 2,040 of the bill, which is the new Medicare \npayroll tax. That is a tax on hiring. You heard that right, a tax on \nhiring in the middle of a 10-percent unemployment situation. How is \nthat going to create any jobs? We don't think it will.\n  Then Senator Chambliss, especially, and Senator Isakson, because of \nhis background as a small businessperson, will talk about what \nRepublicans want to accomplish. If you are waiting for the Republican \nleader to roll in a wheelbarrow with a 2,074-page Republican version of \nhealth care reform, you will never see it. We don't believe in that. \nWhat we do believe in is identifying a goal--reducing the cost of your \npremium, reducing the cost to the government, and then going step by \nstep toward that goal; for example, by reducing junk lawsuits, by \nallowing small businesses to pool their resources to purchase \ninsurance, which we have offered but the Democrats will not allow to \ncome forward, and by allowing people to purchase health insurance \nacross State lines. Senator Chambliss and others of us will talk about \nthis during the next hour.\n  That is the Republican plan, to do what most Americans want done, to \nreduce the cost of premiums, and to not increase premiums and taxes, or \ncut Medicare.\n\n[[Page S11845]]\n\n  There is one hidden tax I wish to talk about because it is in the \nbill, and it is in the news. Most Americans may have seen that the \nUniversity of California yesterday raised tuition 32 percent. There \nare, in our country, around 18 million students who are in higher \neducation. What I wish to say to them is, if this bill passes, their \ntuition is going up. California's tuition is going up again. It is \ngoing up in Tennessee. It is going up in North Dakota, in Nebraska, in \nGeorgia, everywhere there is a public college, university, or community \ncollege there are going to be new taxes or higher tuition or both.\n  In California right now, they are pointing fingers at each other \nabout the 32-percent tuition increase. But they should be pointing the \nfinger at us, Washington, DC, Congress, because it is we who have \nallowed the Medicaid Program, the largest government-run program we \nhave in the country, to go year after year with increases of 7 or 8 \npercent. We require every State, if it opts in, to have a government-\napproved Medicaid Program. In our State, it is called TennCare. That \nMedicaid Program is helping bankrupt the States.\n  Here is a State of Tennessee headline: ``State looks at $1 billion in \ncuts.'' Part of that is from the recession. But part of that is because \nof the increased cost of Medicaid. What does this bill do? It sends to \nthe States another $25 billion in increased Medicaid costs. What will \nthat mean? Higher tuition rates, higher taxes, or both. The University \nof California has the reputation as the best public university in the \nworld. It will not be that very long if the Congress of the United \nStates doesn't rein in Medicaid and reduce its cost so Californians can \nafford to have both a health program and a fine university system. The \nGovernor of Tennessee has said the same thing. He has been outspoken \nabout this. He has talked about exactly the dollars it will cost us. In \nthe House bill, it is $1.4 billion over 5 years. In my view, I don't \nsee how the State of Tennessee can pay that without a big State tax \nincrease or without damaging higher education or both.\n\n  Someone might look at this and say: What does health care have to do \nwith a 32-percent tuition increase in California? It has everything to \ndo with it. Instead of reining in Medicaid, we are expanding Medicaid. \nBy doing that, we are making it impossible for virtually every State to \nproperly support higher education. The only choice they have, other \nthan taxes, is raising tuition for 18 or 20 million students across the \ncountry. Californians, if this bill passes, your tuition is going up \none more time.\n  I call on the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson. He spent a number of \nyears as the leader of the Republicans in the Senate. He dealt with the \nMedicaid question. He dealt with the question of taxes. As a small \nbusinessman for most of his life, he understands well the impact of new \ntaxes on hiring and mandates on businesses.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to be a part of the debate for all the \nright reasons, to talk about things we can do but also talk about \nthings that the proposed legislation, in fact, does do to the American \npeople, to small business, and to our future.\n  When I end my speeches in Georgia, I always end with the same line. I \nsay: I am 65 years old. I have nine grandchildren; in fact, No. 9 was \njust born. His name is Hunter. He is 5 weeks old. I always say my life \nis about their lives. The rest of my life is about making their lives \nas rich, as prosperous, as safe, and as free as the one my parents left \nto me.\n  Legislation such as this severely threatens that. I wish to talk \nabout two ways in which it does.\n  The heart and soul of America is the small businessman, as 73 percent \nof our employees are employed by small business. I ran one. I had 200 \nemployees and 800 independent contractors. By law, I could provide \nhealth insurance to the 200 employees, and I did. But contractors, \nbecause they are independent, the IRS will not let an employer provide \nthat benefit. That is one of the reasons you have a large number of \nuninsured who are actually working--real estate agents, sole \nproprietors, contractors. The Senator from Tennessee and I and the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, then as chairman of the HELP Committee, \nproposed a small business health care reform act, a Republican act \nproposed in this body to cover one-third of the uninsured without \nraising rates or without raising premiums or without raising taxes. We \nhad to get to a cloture vote of 60, and we only got to 57. So 3 years \nago we missed a chance to cover one-third of the uninsured by a change \nin our law which would make it more affordable and accessible for \nindependent contractors. That is what we were for.\n  Let me tell you what this bill does to a small businessperson. No. 1, \nif you have more than 50 employees and you do not offer them health \ninsurance, you have to pay a fine of $750 per employee for ad \ninfinitum. If it is 500 or 51, you have to pay a $750 fine. I ran a \ncompany for 20 years. When I ran that company, I did provide insurance \nto 200 employees. I paid about $3,200 a year for the company's expense \nof their group health insurance. They paid the balance. If this offer \nwere before me as a small businessman, then I would have said: Well, I \nhave a $750 fine if I don't insure them and a $3,200 cost if I do. What \nshould I do? Well, as a businessman, you are going to elect not to \nprovide insurance, to pay the less expensive cost, which is the $750-\nper-person fine, and drive them into a public option.\n\n  This is not about a public option, it is about a public ultimatum, \nbecause as you look at the revenue-raising procedures, the tax-raising \nprocedures, and the policy procedures, it basically drives people to a \npublic option and drives small business away from providing that \ninsurance.\n  There is another way it hurts small business. It also says, if you do \nprovide health insurance to an employee and the cost of their part of \nthe premium exceeds 9.8 percent of their annual income, then you have \nto move them to the public option, and they get subsidized. But you get \nfined $3,000 a year for the rest of the number of years that person \nworks for you because their cost to their insurance was more than 9.8 \npercent of their income. You might say: Well, whose insurance would be \nmore than that? Well, if you take a receptionist or someone like that \ntoday in a business, who may be making $25,000 or $30,000--an entry-\nlevel job--9.8 percent of that is only $2,800, $2,900. It would be more \nthan easy for their share of their premium to exceed 9.8 percent. So \nthe company gets fined, the employee gets driven to a public plan, and \nmore revenue goes to the government through an indirect tax of a fine.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If the employee were eligible for the Medicaid Program \nin Georgia and lost employer insurance and went into the Medicaid \nProgram, isn't it true that the employee who went into the new \ngovernment plan under this bill is likely to pay a higher premium and \nhave a harder time finding a doctor?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. There is no question. I say to the Senator, you are \nexactly right. To think that it actually benefits the employee by doing \nthat is wrong. They will have fewer doctors providing the coverage, and \ntheir cost might, in fact, be higher.\n  But I want to talk about one other thing on the small businessman \nbefore I yield to one of my other colleagues.\n  There is another tax--and we have heard the business about taxing the \nrich. This bill provides a surtax on payroll--a payroll Medicare tax on \nany employer who makes more than $200,000 if they are an individual or \n$250,000 if they are a couple. The Medicare tax goes from 1.25 \npercent--your share; the company matches it--to 1.95 percent.\n  Now, $200,000 is a lot of money, and so is $250,000. But to a small \nbusiness incorporated as an LLC, a sub S, or something like that, that \npays taxes as an individual, that is 1.95 percent doubled, which will \nincrease the tax to 3.9-percent on every dollar that company makes on \ngross, not profit, if they're above $200,000. It is a tax on their \nbusiness for Medicare to pay for a public option, not for Medicare. And \nMedicare goes broke in 2017.\n  So we are raising taxes on Medicare for the alleged rich, which \nreally is most small businesspersons, all to pay for a program that \ndoes not benefit Medicare. The unintended consequences of this \nlegislation are disastrous to small business, it is inappropriate in \nthe way they are handled, and\n\n[[Page S11846]]\n\nit is directed to drive people to an inevitable option to where there \nis no option at all.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for giving me the time. I know my \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Chambliss, has a few facts to add as \nwell.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues from \nTennessee and Georgia.\n  I want to talk just for a minute about what Republicans are for. We \nhave been criticized by the folks on the other side of the aisle for \nbeing just against what they are for, and that is not at all true. \nThere are actually four other plans that were filed in both the HELP \nCommittee and the Finance Committee, three of which were strictly \nRepublican plans, one was a bipartisan plan, that never saw the light \nof day, simply because the folks on the other side of the aisle had \ntheir minds made up that they were going to have their plan with a \ngovernment option, and they were going to do whatever they could to \nmove us toward universal health care coverage.\n  I want to say to those folks on the other side of the aisle who have \nstood up and said on the floor of this Senate: Yes, by putting a \ngovernment option in place, our intention is for the government to take \nover health care--some of them have been very straightforward about \nthat, and they have been honest. There have been others who have been \nnot so honest about that. But that truly is the reason there is a \ngovernment option in the plan we have up for a vote tomorrow night.\n  But what are Republicans for? First of all, everybody in this body is \nin agreement that we want to drive down the cost of health care and we \nwant to drive down the cost of insurance, and those are integrally \nlinked. If you drive down the cost of health delivery, then you will \ndrive down the cost of health insurance.\n  There are a number of ways we can agree today to enact legislation \nthat will help drive down the cost of health care. What are those \nthings?\n  Preventive health care. Well, there is some mention of preventive \nhealth care in Senator Reid's bill somewhere in these 2,074 pages. \nThere is the mention of preventive health care, but there is not the \nincentive in place to encourage people to move toward preventive health \ncare as was done in the private sector with Safeway, a grocery store \nchain where the CEO has visited both Republicans and Democrats and \ntalked about the way Safeway was successful in doing that.\n  We all want to make sure those who do not have insurance today are \ncovered. We want to cover preexisting conditions. We want to make sure \nwe put competition into the insurance market by allowing policies to be \nsold across State lines. All of those things will work in concert to \ndrive down the cost of delivery, as well as the cost of insurance \npolicies per se.\n  There is another measure that will significantly improve the cost of \ndelivery; that is, putting in some measure of tort reform. In this \nbill, with these 2,074 pages, that seeks to totally reform the health \ncare industry in America today, there is not one mention of reforming \nthe tort system in this country, the malpractice reform area. If you go \nto any doctor and you ask him what is the No. 1 issue on his mind when \nit comes to reducing the costs in his office, I bet in 99 percent of \nthe cases--maybe 100 percent--they are going to tell you that tort \nreform must be implemented if we are ever going to hope to drive down \nthe cost of the delivery of health insurance in this country.\n  Senator Graham and I have an amendment we will be talking about that \nis a tort reform measure that is a loser-pays style of tort reform. It \ndoes not take away the right from anybody who is injured. Anybody who \nis injured ought to have the right to have their day in court. But it \ndoes eliminate the potential for the extensive, frivolous lawsuits that \nour docs and our hospitals have to deal with every single day that \ndrive up the cost of health care.\n  I want to talk, too, about one other measure we are for that has been \ntalked about a lot today; that is, covering the uninsured. I think, \nwithout question, if you want to drive down the cost of delivery and \nthe cost of health insurance, you need to cover those people in this \ncountry who need to be covered.\n  We have a little disagreement with folks on the other side of the \naisle as to the exact number they seek to cover with this 2,074-page \nbill. But there is one area where we do agree; that is, there are \nsomewhere between 47 million and 50 million people in America today who \nare truly in that uninsured category whom we all, as a body of 100, \nwould like to see have affordable insurance available to them.\n\n  Now, who are these uninsured? First of all, there are about 6 million \npeople in this country today who are uninsured who are here illegally, \nand they are illegal, undocumented aliens.\n  Folks on the other side--and there is some question about this when \nyou look at the language in this 2,074-page bill, whether they cover \nthose illegal aliens, but let's assume we all agree they ought not to \nbe covered. There are another 14 million people in America today who \nhave health insurance available to them from the Federal Government in \none form or another. Either they are Medicaid eligible or they are \neligible for some form of SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. In Georgia, it is called PeachCare. For whatever reason, these \n14 million people have not taken the initiative to go out and sign up, \nfor example, in Georgia, at the Department of Family and Children \nServices. I do not know what it is in Tennessee, I say to Senator \nAlexander, but there is a comparable office in all 50 States for that \nto be done. What do these 2,074 pages seek to promote as to the 14 \nmillion people who have insurance available to them today to go in and \ntake that insurance? Nothing. So these 14 million people are not even \naddressed.\n  Then there are another 15 million people to whom Senator Isakson just \nreferred. They are people who are either those independent contractors \nor they are employees who work for employers who do not provide health \ninsurance, but all of them are gainfully employed, and they have the \nability to purchase health insurance. Some of these people are dealt \nwith in this 2,074-page bill. Some of them are not because if you are \nan employer with 50 or fewer employees, then you are exempt, you would \nnot be covered, still, as a part of that 15 million.\n  Then there are about another 12 million to 15 million whom I refer to \nas the hard-core uninsured. Those are the folks whom we really ought to \ntry to reach, and those are the folks to whom the bulk of the $2.5 \ntrillion this bill is going to cost during the 10 years when it becomes \nfully implemented seeks to reach.\n  I would simply say, if we are going to truly have a health reform \nbill, we need to start and take it step by step. If the folks on the \nother side of the aisle are serious about health care reform, we can \nget the appropriate committee chairmen together this afternoon, \ntomorrow, or whenever, and begin work on these issues I have just laid \nout about which there should be no disagreement. We could move forward \nwith developing a true and meaningful health insurance reform package.\n  I want to come back in a minute and talk about Medicare taxes and the \nway Medicare is going to be dealt with here. But I would simply throw \nit back to the Senator from Tennessee, as well as to my colleague from \nGeorgia, because they have both been involved in a very honorable way \nat the State level. Senator Alexander is a former Governor of \nTennessee. Senator Isakson was an elected member of our State house, as \nwell as our State senate.\n  I say to the Senators, you gentlemen have experience dealing with \nMedicaid, and you know what the taxation side of Medicaid does from a \nState level. I would like to ask for your thoughts on what this 2,074-\npage bill is going to do to Medicaid in this country as we know it \ntoday.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I am \ngoing to throw the question right back to Senator Isakson in just a \nminute.\n  I appreciate Senator Chambliss taking time to point out what \nRepublicans are for because it seems as if no matter how many times a \nday we say it, our Democratic friends do not hear it.\n  Let me put it this way: Let's say Senator Isakson, who has been a \nsmall businessman, buys a new small business. He takes it over, and he \nsees that generally it is working pretty well but\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\nit has some problems with it. I wonder if the first thing he would do \nis come in and say, I tell you what, let's just turn it all upside down \nand change it all, or would he say, let's identify the problem, and \nlet's take a few steps in the direction of fixing that problem.\n  What Republicans are saying is, we have a big health care system that \nin general works pretty well. Mr. President, 250 million of us have \nhealth insurance plans; 47 million do not. Senator Chambliss has just \npointed out who those people are. Thirteen million or 14 million are \nalready eligible for plans and for one reason or another do not sign \nup. A few million are illegally here. Some others are young and think \nthey are invulnerable and do not sign up. But we are saying the problem \nis the cost, people cannot afford to buy their own insurance, the \ngovernment cannot afford its health care costs, and people are going \nbroke over this. So we want to reduce the cost.\n  Senator Chambliss identified this step-by-step approach. He mentioned \nreducing junk lawsuits against doctors. We have proposals for that. \nCombating waste, fraud, and abuse--we have introduced legislation for \nthat. Senator Isakson talked about allowing small businesses to pool \ntheir resources. Additional ways to reduce cost is allowing people to \npurchase insurance across State lines, so you can shop for more \ninsurance and reduce your cost through competition, and amending the \nhealth savings account laws so you can withdraw your money in a tax-\nfree way to pay for your insurance premium, and encouraging wellness \nand prevention. We could take those six steps, reduce costs, and then \ntake six more.\n  I wonder, Senator Isakson, with your experience in business, if you \nthink it makes any sense for us to just come in here and say: OK, we \nare really smart here in the U.S. Congress. This is a big country, with \n300 million people. We are just going to turn the whole health care \nsystem upside down, write a 2,074-page bill, change the premiums, raise \nthe taxes--do all these things--or would you go step by step in the \nright direction and try to re-earn the confidence of the American \npeople who have lost a lot of confidence in Washington, DC?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I think it is an excellent question, because every year \nin my company we had an annual planning retreat at the end of the year \nfor the next year, and ironically--and I didn't know we were going to \nget into this discussion--but our No. 1 topic that I would send out to \nall of my management team is: What is the No. 1 thing we need to \ncorrect or do in our company? We would spend the entire retreat talking \nabout that one thing. If that one thing was the uninsured, then what we \nwould have talked about is what do you do to insure that 14 to 15 \npercent who don't have coverage.\n  Senator Chambliss hit the nail on the head: Small businesses with \nhealth plans that allow independent contractors and contractors to be \ncovered; that is one. Have an immediate identification and registration \nsystem for people who are eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP so \nthat when they come to a provider or a doctor they end up getting \ncovered. Then, third, come up with a program that meets that last \nthird, which Senator Chambliss referred to as hard core, those who by \nchoice or by chance are not covered.\n  The last thing I would have done is said, We are going to throw out \nthe 85 percent of this that works in order to fix the 15 percent that \ndoesn't, and that, in effect, is what this bill does.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I say to Senator Chambliss, one of the most difficult \nissues I think for many Americans who are watching what we are doing is \nthe plan to cut Medicare. The new bill goes a step further. The way I \nread it--and I indicated the sections in the bill a moment ago--we are \nnot only cutting Medicare, we are going to tax Medicare. Then we are \nnot even going to spend the money on Medicare. In other words, we are \ngoing to cut grandma's Medicare, tax grandma's Medicare, then spend \ngrandma's money on somebody else, and grandma's Medicare is going broke \nin 3 or 4 years, according to the Medicare trustees.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. In addition to that, we are going to continue to tax \nyoung people who are in the workplace for additional Medicare taxes \nthat are intended to be used by them in what is called the CLASS Act, \nwhich is another part of this monstrous bill, and chances are those \npeople are never going to see those benefits. There is one tax after \nanother in this bill that applies to Medicare.\n  One other aspect of Medicare that is of such critical importance here \nis that they have an $850 billion pricetag, according to the Democrats. \nAccording to the numbers and the figures of Senator Gregg, the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, who came down here this morning and \ntalked about it, that $850 billion is for the first 10 years. The taxes \nbegin next year. The benefits don't begin until 2014. When you look at \n2014 to 2025, the first 10 years of full implementation, the cost of \nthis bill is actually $2.5 trillion, not $849 billion.\n  Why is it $2.5 trillion? Well, it is because the scope of government \nhas broadened to such an extent that the expense of providing the \nservices is going to be greater. We are going to have more people \ncoming onto Medicare. We know now, as Senator Alexander said, according \nto the bipartisan Medicare Commission, we will be paying out more in \nMedicare benefits than we receive in Medicare taxes in the year 2017. \nThere are only two ways to fix that: either raise taxes or decrease \nbenefits. The majority that is in power in Congress today has a habit \nof not seeing a tax they don't love, so my guess is that is the \ndirection in which they are going to want to go: Raise taxes on \nMedicare beneficiaries and those in the workplace again to ultimately \npay for Medicare benefits down the road.\n  The other part of this I wish to address with respect to Medicare is \nthe Senator from Florida got up as we were coming on the floor and \ntalked about this so-called deficit reduction. What do they mean when \nthey say we are going to have a $32 billion deficit reduction over 10 \nyears? Well, here is how it works. The deficit reduction is brought \nabout primarily by the addition of a program in this bill to Medicare, \nwhat is called the CLASS Act. The CLASS Act is a long-term policy of \ninsurance to take care of long-term health care needs. Young people are \ngoing to be required--young people in the 20, 30, 40-year age bracket \nwill pay into the so-called Medicare trust fund that will be used to \npay benefits for long-term care for those individuals when they start \nreaching the age where they need long-term care. So CBO has said that \nbecause these folks are 20, 30, and 40 years old and they are going to \nbe buying these policies, they are not going to be getting any benefits \nfor another 20, 30, or 40 years. So we are going to take the position \nthat all of those premiums, which go into the general fund, by \ncoincidence, will go to reduce the deficit. But guess what is going to \nhappen, even according to CBO, when all of these young people who have \nbeen paying into the CLASS Act start getting benefits. All of a sudden \nwe are going to start seeing deficits in the outyears, and our children \nand our grandchildren are going to have an additional debt put on them \nbecause of the way this particular provision is scored--and it is being \ntouted as a deficit-reducing provision right now--that truly is going \nto be a provision that adds to the deficit and the debt our children \nand grandchildren are going to have to pay.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It must be a little confusing to the American people. \nI mean, one day Senator Reid comes out and, a big hurrah, we are going \nto reduce the deficit and we are only going to spend $800 billion, and \nthen the next day Republicans come out and say, No, when the program \ngets going, it is $2.5 trillion over 10 years. I wonder if I could say \nto the Senator from Georgia, while we have heard you talk about these \nprojections, the senior Republican on the Joint Economic Committee has \ncome to the floor, the Senator from Kansas.\n  How do you explain this to people in Kansas, Senator Brownback, who \nmust be very confused by this back and forth?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I don't think they are particularly confused. I think \nthey smell a rat in this and they know if you are going to add this big \nof a program, somebody is going to tax me somewhere here.\n  The interesting way this is actually scored in the bill is the \ngovernment uses the old heavy hand of inflation. As\n\n[[Page S11848]]\n\nwe have heard, many economists have spoken in the past about how \ninflation is the most cruel tax of all, particularly for the people on \na fixed income, because then the base dollars they have do not go as \nfar as they used to. What is scored in this bill--and we have seen this \ntime and time again--is what you have as an inflation factor that is \nnot indexed. It is not indexed.\n  I wish to show these charts here to prove it. At the end of how this \nis scored, we will end up having people who have subsidized insurance \nwhen they start out, but that in the outyears in the scoring will be \ntaxed for having subsidized insurance. So we will be both taxing them \nat the same time as we are subsidizing their insurance. And we are \nalso--and I will show a chart here in a minute--taxing their insurance \nplan that we are subsidizing at the same time, and that is built into \nthe base score. So then that is how you get to a CBO score that, presto \nchango, the budget is balanced; we are even producing a surplus. It is \nthis cruelty of inflation.\n  People can remember back to the Jimmy Carter days with 10 percent \ninflation. They know what that did to them. Look at this. This is all \nin the CBO scoring. This is from the Joint Economic Committee staff who \nhave been working through these calculations to see, How do you come up \nwith adding a multitrillion-dollar entitlement program and come to a \nbudget deficit-neutral facet to it? What we see here is surtax levels--\nand this is kind of a busy chart--but this red line is 100 percent of \npoverty in 2009 and 100 percent of poverty built out over 100 years, \nwhich is also part of the scoring system, and then the median income of \nmarried households. What you see is families receiving subsidies \nbeginning to pay the surtax in the scoring of this. That is all due to \nthe cruelty of inflation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I could ask the Senator from Kansas, \nhaven't we heard this story somewhere before? As I remember, back in \nthe late 1960s there was a so-called millionaires' tax. We were going \nafter 155 very rich people in America who weren't paying any taxes and \nnow we call it the alternative minimum tax, and if we don't fix it \nevery year more and more people will end up paying this tax. I think \nlast year there were 28 million Americans who would have had to pay the \ntax.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is absolutely correct, and it is the same \ntechnique. This is the alternative minimum tax on steroids in the \ninsurance industry and in the insurance field. It is the same thing. We \nfix it every year. That is why this is such a fraud. Do you really \nthink we are going to tax people for their health insurance at the same \ntime we are subsidizing their purchase of health insurance? That isn't \ngoing to happen, so those dollars aren't going to arrive. So where are \nthose dollars going to come from? It will be from deficit and debt, or \nyou are going to have this cruelty of inflation taking place.\n\n  The bill funds health care reform with increased Medicare taxes. We \nare going to see that taking place in this as well.\n  Here is the chart I like that I will show. It demonstrates how we are \ngoing to have these Chevrolet plans--you have heard of these health \ninsurance plans. Let me put this chart up. We are going to tax the \nCadillac plans, all right? Well, it turns out under this bill, the \nChevy becomes a Cadillac. So you are going to tax the Cadillac when it \nis still a Chevy. That is because of inflation.\n  Most people know their health insurance premiums have been going up \npretty consistently over time. Well, it turns out that the Chevy will \nmetamorphose into a Cadillac and it gets taxed and that is in the CBO \nscoring of this bill, and that is how you come out with balancing the \ncost of the bill.\n  None of this is going to happen. You will have some sort of AMT-type \nfix that will take place on an annual basis, and at the end of the day \nyou get a big debt and deficit you are going to have with it or \nhorribly cruel high levels of inflation or maybe both.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I would ask the Senator from Kansas if he would yield \nfor a question. The question is: The Senator from Kansas and I were \nelected to Congress in the same year. This is our 15th year, I believe, \nof serving. You have been over here longer than any of us have, and you \nwere involved in State government as well.\n  Have you ever seen a Federal program that was projected to be at X \nnumber of dollars of expenditure which came in on time and on budget?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. No, I haven't seen that take place.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Do you think that when Senator Reid comes down here \nand says this bill is going to cost $849 billion over 10 years, that is \na correct figure for a massive reform of health care?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. No, and I don't know that there would be 5 percent of \nthe public in my State who would believe that, because their experience \ntells them differently. Their experience tells them: Look, I know you \nguys make these great promises and everything, but I also know the \nfurther out you make this promise, the less reliable your data, and I \nhave seen that whenever the government gets into things, it always \ncosts a lot more and it seems as though our debt and deficit always \nkeeps growing and it is way too big.\n  What is troubling is that this is built into the base of how we get \nto the numbers of getting this as a budget-neutral matter. This isn't \ngoing to happen. On top of all of that, you say we are going to save \n$400 billion in Medicare. We have now voted four times for the so-\ncalled doctor fix, which was a slight reduction in Medicare spending \nfor providers, and I voted for it three times, to fix it, on an annual \nbasis. Do you possibly think--possibly think--that the Congress is \ngoing to cut Medicare $400 billion, that people are going to come back \nhere and say, You can't do that, you are going to be ruining Medicare \nand that Congress will fix it? I said this to Treasury Secretary \nGeithner yesterday: Our experience has never been to do something like \nthat. So where does the money go? It goes right on the deficit and the \ndebt and you are going to add to that $12 trillion estimate. We are \nhemorrhaging Federal money and, at the same time, the global community \nis saying, you have to get your fiscal house in order.\n  We just had our President over in China, hat in hand, with our \nbankers saying, OK, we think human rights is pretty important, but we \nneed that loan. What we are going to see take place, because this is a \nfiscally irresponsible package, I think we are going to see the \ninternational community saying words are one thing but action is what \ntalks, and we are going to start pulling capital out of the U.S. \nmarketplace. It is going to drive up interest rates, it is going to \ndrive up inflation.\n  So maybe this scenario happens, but it is cruelly done through \ninflation, and it is not fair to the American public.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I might ask Senator Isakson from Georgia, \nwe talked a little bit about his experience as a small businessman. \nSenator Brownback has talked about taxes and how they are going to go \nup. According to the Republican Budget Committee analysis, the new \ntaxes in this bill that we have on our desks would be about $850 \nbillion over a 10-year period of time. Senator Isakson has been a small \nbusinessperson. Some of those taxes would be on you. Who is going to \npay the taxes?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. My customer. The thing is, business is the collector of \ntaxes for the government. Government imposes a fee, a fine, a cost to \nbusiness, and it rolls into the base of what that business has to pay \nto produce its product and it is upon that which they make a profit. So \nthis business of taxing business, they are getting business to collect \na tax from the ultimate consumer. That is all it is.\n  I want to throw something else in. I appreciate Senator Brownback \nvery much. I was in Georgia a few weeks ago, Albany, near where Senator \nChambliss raised his family, at a Rotary Club. I was asked by a fellow: \nYou keep talking about a trillion. How much is that? I babbled and \nfumbled. Have you ever tried to explain that number and quantify that? \nIt is a huge number. We are talking about $2.5 trillion in the first \nfull 10 years. I got so frustrated that I got on the calculator to \nfigure out an analogy as to how much it is. I decided, I wonder how \nmany years would go by for a trillion seconds to pass. I got on the \ncalculator and worked it out. It is 31,709 years for a trillion seconds \nto go by. That gives\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\nyou some proportion of the volume of dollars we are talking about in \ntaxes and costs and, as the Senator said so rightly, debt. That is a \nlot of money, and the American taxpayer ultimately is on the bill for \nevery dime of it.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask my colleague from Georgia, we talked about this, \nand he has had extensive experience at the State level with respect to \nMedicaid. Take our State--and I think we are representative of all 50 \nStates. We have a Medicaid Program now that provides for coverage or \neligibility at 100 percent of the poverty level. This bill takes that \nto 133 percent of the poverty level. Talk for a minute about the impact \nof going from 100 to 133 percent to cover some of those uninsured I \nreferred to earlier. What is the impact on our State?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Right now, Georgia's current year budget for the cost of \nMedicaid is $2.15 billion, or about 12 percent of the State \nappropriations. This bill, as currently configured, raises that \neligibility by 33 percent. But the Feds hold harmless the States for \nthe first 3 years of that increase, and then it is a 90/10 split for \nthe next 7 years, and then it is silent. To give everybody the benefit \nof the doubt, say States only have to pay 10 percent more. That is one-\nquarter of $1 billion more in Georgia--from $2.15 billion to $2.4 \nbillion in the State budget.\n  We all know what is going to happen--what happened with the original \nMedicaid program. The State will eventually have to pay the full 35 \npercent match, which would mean that over time, at the end of the 10 \nyears, using today's numbers without inflation, Medicaid costs in \nGeorgia for about 12 percent of the population would go from $2.15 \nbillion to $3.4 billion a year for Medicaid.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Whether it is paid by the Federal Government after \nthat 3 years or by the State of Georgia, whose pocket will it come out \nof?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The taxpayers of the United States of America.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As we were discussing earlier, it could be paid out of \nthe pockets of the 18 million or 20 million students who go to, for \ninstance, the University of Kansas and Kansas State. We began this \ndiscussion by pointing out that California raised tuition yesterday 32 \npercent for its students. They are pointing fingers at each other, but \nthey should be pointing at us for not reining in Medicaid because over \ntime that is the biggest reason.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. In my State of Kansas, a huge budget debate is going \non about where we are going to come up with the shortfall this year in \nthe State budget. People can save in some places, but you have to do \nthis on Medicaid. It ends up, in all probability, that a \ndisproportionate share will come out of the schools for the \nschoolchildren. Is that what we at the Federal level want to see take \nplace? No. That is one of the reasons I am voting against this bill. \nYou are dictating a State budget. Initially the Feds are putting in the \nfull amount, but I have seen this before too. You start with the \nFederal Government wiggling the carrot, saying: Take a bite. You can do \nit. Then once you get hooked, you say: OK, we are going to reel it in \nnow, and you will pay more of it. It will be the Federal Government \ndictating the State budget, putting it into Medicaid and taking it away \nfrom schools. That is what will take place. That is what is happening \nin my State now.\n  It is not fair to do that. It is not right for us to do that. Most of \nthe people across Kansas think this whole issue is fiscal insanity--\nliterally fiscal insanity--what we are looking at doing with that level \nof debt, $12 trillion a year. With my State having the level of debt it \nhas, making this requirement--a multi-trillion-dollar entitlement \nexpansion when the Federal Government is hemorrhaging money, as well as \nState governments--is fiscal insanity. The world community is saying: \nGet your fiscal house in order. This makes no sense.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I don't think we can overstate what the Senator has \nsaid. Not only is the Federal Government looking at the largest deficit \nwe have ever seen in the history of our country--just this past year, \n$1.3 trillion--but every State is having the same problem. That deficit \nis trickling down.\n  In Georgia, for example, we have one county that has run into these \neducation reductions that Senator Alexander is talking about, which \nuniversities are facing. That one school system reduced the days the \nchildren are going to school from 5 to 4 days to save the cost of buses \nrunning and other bills, for heating and whatnot, for that extra day. \nThat is not what we need to be doing as Americans. We need to figure \nout a way to struggle through this.\n  Instead of struggling through it, we are now in the toughest times we \nhave ever seen, as Senator Brownback said, we are adding these huge \ntaxes that will stifle the small business community on top of the debt \nthat we have seen created in this country just in the past 12 months.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have a question I will ask any of the Senators who \nwant to comment. Someone asked me yesterday: Where is all this \nopposition to these health care bills coming from? We have seen the \nGallup poll and the Pew poll. These are not Republican Polls. They are \nwell-respected polls in this country that are showing that independent \nvoters, by 2 to 1, say they don't want this bill.\n  I have been in and out of politics for many years. I have never had \nas many people stop me on the street or in the airport or wherever, and \nsay, ``Please don't do this.'' Somebody asked me yesterday: Why is \nthere that much opposition?\n  My answer was--and this is what I would appreciate comments on--this \nis not just about health care. This is, as President Obama said one \ntime, a proxy for a national debate about the role of government in \nWashington and in everyday American life. This is about the stimulus \npackage, about the Washington takeover of car companies. This is about \nthe growing debt; this is about the takeover of student loans; this is \nabout every Washington takeover, and every increase in debt. That is \nwhat this debate is about. I think that is why we are seeing such \nintensive opposition. I wonder if you have any reflection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I certainly think it is. What I observe, too, is \npeople coming up to me in large numbers and very passionately saying \nthey are both mad and scared. They are mad about this taking place, and \nthey are scared it is going to actually happen to them. They feel like, \nhow can this happen to them in this country? They look at that huge \ndebt and at our President over in China talking as if he is going to \nsee the banker, and they don't like it. This isn't their country the \nway they want it to be. They want our country to be fiscally sound \ninstead of going to beg hat-in-hand to the ``banker'' in a foreign \ncountry. Then you are going to add another big entitlement on top of \nthat? They are saying: Don't ask me, the taxpayer, for more money \nbecause I don't have it. They are mad and scared about this. It is very \ndisconcerting for people in the country.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I agree with Senator Brownback. I guess I could sum it \nup in four phrases. There will be less access, seniors fear, because of \ncuts in Medicare. They will have less access. There will be higher \ncosts because of the bending of the way in which they calculate \npremiums and the additional taxes. Everybody knows that will be a \nhigher cost. There is a great fear of rationing, which is a component \npart of almost every plan to get from where we are to where they want \nto take us.\n  Lastly, I hear a lot from young people who are considering a medical \ncareer either in research or in applied medicine. They fear that \nmedicine will not be the practice in this country in the future that it \nhas been in the past. If that is true, if they leave and go to other \nfields, we will have less innovation and research and development and, \nin the end, less quality health care for the American people.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. These are not people who are on the extreme right or \nextreme left who are bombarding us with phone calls, e-mails, and \nletters as all of us get on airplanes, as I did Monday. I had people \ncome up as I walked through the airport, and as I was on the airplane, \nand when I got off the airplane, saying: Please stop this bill. Don't \npass this foolish bill that you all are talking about up there now. It \nis amazing, the type of folks who will come up and say that.\n\n  I have two quick anecdotes I would like to read. One is a letter I \ngot from a doctor. It reads:\n\n\n[[Page S11850]]\n\n\n       Dear Senator:\n       I am a vascular surgeon in Rome, GA, with a patient \n     population that is 70 percent Medicare. I am deeply concerned \n     about the proposed Medicare cuts. After 8 years of college \n     and medical school, and 7 years of training, I have \n     accumulated a large debt in loans and interest. Plus there is \n     the huge administrative burden of a large Medicare population \n     in my practice. I don't know how I and other physicians are \n     going to be able to afford to continue to see Medicare \n     patients if these cuts go through. As it stands now, I am \n     paid only 23 cents on every dollar charged. I would \n     appreciate help in staving off these cuts.\n\n  The other one is an e-mail I got in the last few days about a good \nfriend of Senator Isakson and mine, Bob Lovein, a funeral director in \nNashville, GA, which is close to my hometown. It says this:\n\n       A lady walked into the funeral home and gave him a letter \n     from the VA. The letter stated that they (the VA) owed her \n     $307 on her husband's death benefits. Bob pulls her husband's \n     file and he had buried him 10 years ago . . . and we trust \n     the government to run health care?\n\n  That is how ridiculous it is in the minds of people in this country \nwho are calling and writing our offices--certainly the offices of every \none of the Members of this body--because they don't understand why we \nare mortgaging and sacrificing our children's future, or why, as \nSenator Brownback says, when the President goes to China to see their \nbanker--China owns almost $1 trillion worth of our debt--the Chinese \nPremier asked the President about the health care bill because he is \nconcerned about the way we are spending money here.\n  I can never remember any foreign leader ever asking the President of \nour country about anything to do with the financial condition, \nparticularly a program like this, which would affect us.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am afraid our time is almost up.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, our President got lectured by the Chinese \nregulator about our financial system. This is unbelievable. This \nexacerbates it, if we pass this bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank Senators Brownback, Chambliss, and Isakson. I \nthink all four of us want the American people to know above all that we \nhave repeatedly said that instead of 2,000-page bills that raise taxes, \nraise premiums, cut Medicare, and transfer costs to States, we would \nrather identify the goal of reducing costs and go step by step toward \nthat goal. We have introduced specific legislation to take those steps, \nwhich could be bipartisan, such as allowing small businesses to pool \ntheir resources to purchase insurance, that Senator Isakson talked \nabout, and reducing junk lawsuits, as Senator Chambliss talked about, \nand allowing competition across State lines. We have our step-by-step \nplan.\n  We believe the American people have lost confidence in Washington and \nthat they would prefer that we go step by step in the right direction \nto reduce costs and re-earn their trust rather than pass a 2,074-page \nbill that will bankrupt the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the debate has now begun on the bill we \ncall our health care reform bill. It has taken us a long time to get \nhere. After a lot of hearings, a lot of markup, a lot of public \ndiscussion, a lot of town meetings around the country, now we are at \nthe final pivotal moment, a historic moment in the long march to pass \nmeaningful health care reform.\n  I say long march because it started with Theodore Roosevelt and \ncontinued on through the New Deal, continued on to Harry Truman's \nadministration, and on to this time. Every time we have been turned \nback by the status quo forces, those who want to stick with what we \nhave, those who are afraid of making changes. This time they are not \ngoing to stop us. This time it is unstoppable. We have come this far, \nand we are not going to turn back.\n  Just listening to a little bit of the discussion on the Republican \nside today and listening to what the Republicans have had to say about \nhealth care reform in the last few months and anticipating what we will \nhear from Republicans in the next few weeks, it will be a message of \nfear that somehow by changing the status quo, the American people are \ngoing to be worse off than they are now, that somehow we are going to \ntake away something they have, that somehow if we just stick with what \nwe have, everything will be fine. But you will hear a lot of words and \nmessages from the Republican side meant to frighten people, to put a \npall of fear over what we are trying to do.\n  The frightening thing for the American people is if we do nothing, if \nwe stick with the status quo. Too many people in this country have no \nhealth insurance whatsoever. Thousands every day in this country, every \nsingle day thousands of people lose health care insurance coverage. So \nmany people who have preexisting conditions cannot get coverage at all. \nPeople who are beginning to retire but they are not quite 65 and cannot \nget on Medicare are left in a state of limbo, where they cannot get \nhealth care coverage.\n  So many people in this country are being discriminated against in \nhealth insurance because--well, because they are a woman or perhaps \nbecause they are older, perhaps they are a person with a disability. \nFor a variety of reasons, they are being discriminated against in \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  We have to make these changes. We cannot continue to spend over the \n$2 trillion a year and still be so lacking in the essential health care \nservices for the people of this country. We spend twice as much in this \ncountry on health care as Europe. Yet we have twice as many people sick \nwith chronic illnesses. That does not seem to make sense.\n  We have some of the highest of high-tech medical devices and \nprocedures and interventions anywhere in the world and, of course, \npeople who have a lot of money in other countries--we always see kings \nand princes and wealthy people from other countries come here. They \ncome here for the very high-tech, high-cost interventions. We are very \ngood at that. We are the best. We are unequaled in that. But where we \nfall short is helping the very broad mass of American people to have \nthe peace of mind knowing that if something happens to them, if they do \nget ill, they are not going to lose everything.\n  The single biggest cause of bankruptcy--I know in my State of Iowa \nand I think most of the country, the single biggest cause of bankruptcy \nis because of medical expenses because people bump up against lifetime \ncaps or annual caps, they cannot make it, and they declare bankruptcy. \nIn no other country in the world is this allowed to happen. It is \nincumbent upon us to get this bill through.\n  At the beginning, I wish to salute our majority leader Harry Reid for \nwhat he has done. We had our bill that came out of the committee that I \nam now privileged to chair after the untimely death of our esteemed \ncolleague and friend, Senator Ted Kennedy. Our HELP Committee bill came \nthrough under the great leadership of Senator Chris Dodd. We passed it \non July 15. Then the Finance Committee, under the able leadership of my \nfriend and classmate Senator Max Baucus of Montana, did their work. \nThen the two bills had to be put together and that was done by the \nmajority leader and he did a masterful job of putting the two bills \ntogether and getting it down to the Congressional Budget Office and \ngetting a score on what it would cost, what it would cover. When we saw \nthe bill come back--the bill we now have in front of us, the so-called \nmerged bill--it truly is a work of genius by the majority leader.\n  I said the other day that he has the patience of Job, the wisdom of \nSolomon, and the stamina of Sampson to get this job done.\n  I also salute all the Senators--Democrats and Republicans--whose \nideas are incorporated in this bill. It is a robust bill. It went \nthrough a long, bipartisan process. In our committee, we had \nproceedings that spanned 13 days, 54 hours. Republicans were full-\nfledged participants. They offered 210 amendments. We accepted 161, \nmany of them making substantive changes in the bill.\n  A similar open and inclusive process was followed in the Finance \nCommittee. I daresay, when we got our bill through, after all that, \nafter all the\n\n[[Page S11851]]\n\namendments offered, accepted or adopted, not one Republican would vote \nfor our bill--not one. It is truly unfortunate now that we have put \nthese bills together, we have gone through this long process that has \ntaken most of this year, that Republicans have now chosen the path of \ndelay and filibuster and obstruction.\n  Why are we even here today? We are here because the Republicans are \ntrying to prevent us from even bringing the bill to the floor for \ndebate. How many people in America know that? The reason we are here is \nbecause the Republicans do not even want to bring the bill to the floor \nfor debate and amendment. That is their right under the rules of the \nSenate. It is their right. They can filibuster. They can delay. They \ncan obstruct. They can say no. But just as surely as that is their \nright, it is our responsibility, as Democrats, to move this bill \nforward.\n  I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that last year \nvoters overwhelmingly voted for Barack Obama to make changes, and one \nof the changes he campaigned so hard on was changes in the health care \nsystem and, just as surely, voters elected Democrats to majorities--big \nmajorities--in the House and the Senate to do the same thing. So it is \nour responsibility to lead, and that is what we are doing now by \nbringing this bill to the floor. We are taking another giant step \ntoward fulfilling the mandate--the mandate--the people of this country \ngave to President Obama and the Democratic Party last November to \nundertake a comprehensive reform of America's health care system.\n  As not only the long debate has made clear to the American people, \nbut innately the American people know and they understand the current \nsystem is hugely dysfunctional, it is wasteful, and it is abusive. \nPeople are aware of the abuses that have become standard practice in \nthe health insurance industry: denied coverage because of preexisting \nconditions; health insurance being dropped because they get sick; their \ninsurance premiums jacked up 100 percent, 200 percent in a year simply \nbecause they had an illness.\n  People know they can be charged higher rates simply because they are \na woman. We know, we have the data. Woman, man, same age, same \noccupation, same status--a woman is charged more than a man for the \nsame policy or they are charged more if they are older. We know about \nannual caps and lifetime caps I just mentioned that cause people to go \ninto bankruptcy.\n  The bottom line is this: Every American family knows that in many \ncases, they are one illness away from financial catastrophe. If you \nwant to talk about fear, that is what people are afraid of, not so much \nof getting sick--that is part of life--but the fact that illness will \ndrive them to financial ruin, that they will not have enough money to \ntake care of their kids, to send them to college, or to take care of \nthemselves in their old age to supplement their Social Security because \nthe money will be used for an illness.\n  As I said earlier, 62 percent of U.S. bankruptcies are linked to \nmedical bills. What is the kicker in this is that 80 percent of those \nwere people who actually had health insurance, but they ran up against \ntheir lifetime cap. Abuses, abuses by the health insurance industry \nbecause they can do it and they can get by with it.\n  Think about it this way: Health insurance companies employ armies of \nclaims adjustors who routinely deny requests for medical tests and \nprocedures. Why do they do that? Because they get bonuses by saying no \nto the policyholder. Think about that. An insurance company says to \ntheir claims adjustors: We will pay you more the more people you deny. \nWhat a system. It is outrageous. It is intolerable, and we cannot \nafford to let it go on any longer.\n  One of the many things we do in this bill is to crack down on these \nhealth insurance companies' abuses in a very strong and robust way. \nAgain, I deeply regret that our Republican colleagues refuse to join us \nin this reform effort. They have chosen to defend the status quo, \nprotect the insurance companies and their profits over the health of \nthe American people.\n  Indeed, my friends on the Republican side and the health insurance \ncompanies are now joined at the hip--same talking points, same \ndistortions, same untruths about this bill, same bogus, cooked-up \nstudies, the same determination to obstruct and kill any health care \nreform effort.\n  As I said earlier, this time they will not succeed. The more the \nAmerican people learn about this bill and what is in this bill, the \nmore they like it and the more they are demanding that we get the job \ndone.\n  President Obama pledged that we would do health reform and not add to \nthe deficit. We have done that with this bill. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says this bill will actually reduce the deficit by $130 billion \nnext year and by $650 billion in the next decade--$650 billion--and it \nwill reduce the deficit continually every decade thereafter. All the \nbudget concerns have been put to rest. Now we can focus on what is in \nthe bill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says our bill will cover 94 percent \nof the American people; 94 percent will now be able to have the peace \nof mind to know they have health insurance coverage.\n  Our bill says if you have a health care plan that you like and that \nyou want to keep, nothing will disturb that--nothing. You can keep \nwhatever plan you want if you like it.\n  A lot of people say this plan doesn't go into effect until 2014. It \ndoes take some time to get these exchanges and things set up, but there \nare some immediate things that will happen next year, and the American \npeople ought to know what that means. For example, our bill right now \nwould ban lifetime and excessive annual limits on coverage next year--\nnot 2014 or 2015, next year. Think about that in your own policy. Your \npolicy, I guarantee, has some kind of lifetime cap or annual caps. Next \nyear, they will not be able to do that any longer.\n  Our bill bans rescissions. What that means is that right now so many \npeople don't know that their health insurance policy can drop them. \nThere is a clause in it that says that when you are up for renewal, \nthey can drop you for any reason. The reason they use is, if you get \nsick. Think about that.\n  I can't tell you how many people I have talked to in my State of Iowa \nwho have come up to me, especially during the town meetings we have had \nthis summer, and have said: I like my health insurance policy. I have a \ngood policy, and I would like to keep it.\n  My rejoinder is: That is fine, but I want to ask you a couple of \nquestions. What is your lifetime or annual cap?\n  Most often, people say: I don't know.\n  I say: Do you have a lifetime or annual cap in your policy?\n  They aren't certain.\n  I say: Do you have a rescission clause in your policy?\n  I can tell you 100 percent of the people I have talked to said: What \ndoes that mean?\n  I said: What it means is, if you get sick, if you have to have a \nkidney transplant or if you have cancer or heart disease, can your \ninsurance company drop you when your policy comes due, with no \nexplanation whatsoever?\n  They don't know.\n  I said: You have to look at your policy and find out, because most \npolicies have those rescission clauses.\n  I daresay, when a lot of people say they have a good health insurance \npolicy, they answer yes, they do have a good health insurance policy, \nas long as they are healthy. As long as you are healthy. Once you get \nsick, out the window it goes because you have a cap, either a lifetime \nor an annual, or you have a rescission clause.\n  The other thing I hear from a lot of families: You know, my kids were \ncovered when they were in school. They are now out of school, they have \nnot quite gotten a job yet, and I can't keep them on my policy and it \ncosts a lot of money to put them on a different policy.\n  Our bill says that now these young people can stay on their family \npolicy until they are age 26. This is a huge benefit to working \nfamilies.\n  I have said many times that the two biggest winners under our health \ncare reform bill are small businesses and the self-employed. Small \nbusinesses--we are in a deep recession. If we want to get out of that \nrecession, we better start focusing on small businesses because it is \nsmall businesses that create over 65 percent of the jobs in this \ncountry. Yet small businesses are thwarted in their effort to expand \nand grow. One\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\nof the biggest reasons is because of the cost of health care for their \nemployees. So many small businesses now have dropped health care \ncoverage for their employees because they simply cannot afford it or \nthe premiums have gone up, the deductibles are huge, and basically what \nit has gotten to be is basically catastrophic coverage for their \nemployees. Small businesses need help in order to grow and expand and \nget us out of this recession. This bill will provide immediately, next \nyear, up to a 35-percent tax credit for health insurance policies for \ntheir workers. That is a big deal. It is not just for small businesses, \nit is for my farmers and for those who are self-employed--for so many \nself-employed in this country, next year, a tax credit of up to 35 \npercent.\n  Next year, we are going to have a new policy option for people who \nhave preexisting conditions. So if you had an illness in the past, if \nyou have been living with cancer and you have it under control, you \nhave a chronic illness, next year we are going to provide a new policy \noption to put people like that into a high-risk pool and provide that \nthey can get insurance coverage at prices they can afford. When the \nexchanges come on in 3 years, all of that will go by the wayside. They \nwill not be able to discriminate because of preexisting conditions. But \nnext year, right away, people who have preexisting conditions can get \npolicies at prices they can afford.\n  How many times do I hear people tell me: Here I am, I have been \nworking hard, I have been a construction worker, or something like \nthat, that is hard work. I am 55. I have had some accidents. I have a \nbum leg and my back is bad. I can't work until I am 65. But what am I \ngoing to do about my health insurance?\n  We have in here, starting next year, if you are an early retiree, we \nhave a program to protect your coverage and at the same time reduce \nyour premiums, both for you and your employer, until the time you get \nto be age 65. This is a big deal for so many people in this country.\n  Last, in whatever time I have left--parliamentary inquiry: How much \ntime does the Senator from Iowa have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator has 37 minutes 13 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I understand my friend from North Dakota \nwishes to speak. I will wrap this up by saying there is one other part \nof this bill that is so important that doesn't get much play but I \nconsider to be one of the most significant parts of this bill, and that \nis an emphasis on prevention and wellness, keeping people healthy in \nthe first place.\n  There is a lot of talk about bending the cost curve and how we are \ngoing to bend that curve and get costs down. I submit that not only the \nbest way but perhaps the only way we are going to do this is by keeping \npeople healthy in the first place, putting more emphasis on prevention.\n  I have often said that we don't have a health care system in America, \nwe have a sick care system. If you get sick, you get care. Almost all \nof our expenditures go for interventions and patching and fixing and \nmending once somebody gets sick. Very little goes for prevention. About \n96, 97 cents of every dollar goes for taking care of you after you get \nsick. Only about 3 or 4 cents goes to prevention. It is time to do more \nfor that, time to do more for prevention and wellness, keeping people \nhealthy in the first place.\n  In this bill, we have a provision that says that if you want to go in \nfor your annual checkup and your annual screening, no copay, no \ndeductions, and for certain other screenings, such as colonoscopies, \nbreast cancer screenings, and things like that, no co-pays, no \ndeductibles.\n  In the ensuing days and weeks when we debate that, I will be talking \na lot more about the prevention and wellness part of this bill. It is \nbig. It is the first time we have ever done anything like this, to \nbegin to move the paradigm in this country away from sick care to \nhealth care. Our goal in this bill with this provision is to change \nAmerica into a wellness society, where it is easier to be healthy and \nharder to be unhealthy--just the opposite of what it is today. It is \neasy to be unhealthy in America today. It is hard to be healthy. We are \ngoing to change that around, and we are going to start with this bill.\n  One of the most important parts of this bill is the massive change we \nare going to make in prevention and wellness.\n  I note the presence on the floor of my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, \nand I commend him for the outstanding work he did on the HELP \nCommittee, especially on the prevention provision. I don't think there \nis anyone in the Senate who has been more dedicated to moving us from a \nsickness system to a wellness system than the Senator from Iowa. He did \noutstanding work on the prevention provisions in the Health Committee \nbill, many of which now are in the bill before us. I applaud him for \nhis leadership because in many ways those are the most important \nprovisions. If we can encourage people to lead healthy lifestyles and \nhave an emphasis on wellness, we can change the quality of millions of \npeople's lives.\n  I personally think the provisions Senator Harkin authored that are \npart of this legislation are in many ways the most important pieces of \nthis bill. What is interesting is they have received very little \nattention in the public debate. In fact, many of the most important \nprovisions in this bill have very little attention in the public \ndebate. Hopefully, over the next weeks that will change and people will \nlearn what is really in this bill versus the rumors of what is in this \nbill. They are very different things.\n  I again thank the Senator from Iowa for his leadership. It made a \nreal difference to the quality of this bill.\n  Why are we here? We are here because we face a completely \nunsustainable situation in health care in this country. Medicare is \ngoing broke, premiums are rising 3 times as fast as wages, 46 million \npeople have no health insurance, spending is twice as much per person \nin our country as in almost any other country in the world, and the \noutcomes of our system for our people are not as good as they should \nbe. So it is very clear: The status quo is unacceptable. Doing nothing \nis not an option. Failure is not an option. It is critically important \nthat we reform the health care system in this country. If we do not, \nour families' budgets will be threatened, our businesses will be \nthreatened, and the Government itself is threatened. That is the \nreality.\n  I want to praise Leader Reid for putting together a responsible \npackage and a really very good first step. I also want to praise \nSenator Baucus for his leadership in the Finance Committee. He did an \noutstanding job. I have never seen, in my 23 years, any committee \nchairman have as diligent and focused an effort as Senator Baucus gave \nthis in the Senate Finance Committee over a 2-year period. Our group of \n6 alone met 61 times, and there were dozens and dozens of other \nhearings, meetings, forums, roundtables. Senator Baucus organized a \nhealth care summit last year, and that was a model of how Congress \nought to approach an issue. So I give high praise to Senator Baucus.\n  Senator Dodd, who was called in at the eleventh hour to replace \nSenator Kennedy because of Senator Kennedy's illness, deserves enormous \ncredit, enormous praise for picking up the ball at a critical juncture \nand carrying it across the line in the HELP Committee as well.\n  Senator Reid had the very difficult task of bringing together the \nFinance Committee bill and the HELP Committee bill, combining them into \na vehicle for consideration here.\n  This bill is not perfect. No work of humans ever is. Certainly more \nneeds to be done to control cost. That is what I believe. But this is a \nvery good beginning. This bill makes an important contribution to \nimproving health care. Those who labored for months and months to \nproduce it deserve our thanks and praise.\n\n  I am somewhat taken aback by speeches I have heard from colleagues \nover the last several days acting as though this vote tomorrow is the \nend of the story. Anybody who understands Senate procedure even a \nlittle bit knows this is the beginning of the story. This is the \nbeginning of the debate. This is the beginning of a process to amend \nand improve the bill. This is\n\n[[Page S11853]]\n\nthe beginning of the discussion on the floor of the Senate about \nlegislation to reform the health care system. I don't know of a single \ncredible reason to vote against going to consideration of legislation \nto reform the health care system in this country. This isn't about the \nfinal result. This is about beginning the discussion and the debate. \nWho would want to prevent a discussion and debate? Who would want to \nprevent Senators from being able to offer amendments to improve the \nlegislation?\n  If people are dissatisfied with the product at the end of the \nprocess, that is when they can vote no. They can vote no against \ncloture. They can vote no against the package. There are lots of \nopportunities to oppose it if you are unhappy with the final result. \nBut being unwilling to even discuss the subject strikes me as a \npreposterous position.\n  This plan meets key health care reform benchmarks. It is fully paid \nfor. In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office--not \ncontrolled by Republicans or Democrats; it is strictly nonpartisan--\nthis measure reduces the deficit by $130 billion over the first 10 \nyears. That is their judgment. In the second 10 years, they say this \nlegislation will reduce the deficit by $650 billion. When people come \nout here and say this increases the deficit, this increases the debt, I \ndon't know what legislation they are talking about. It is not the \nlegislation before us. They are, of course, free to make up whatever \nnumbers they want, but the official evaluation of this legislation by \nthe nonpartisan CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, is that this bill \nreduces the deficit in both the short and long terms.\n  It also expands coverage, according to the CBO, to 94 percent of \nAmericans. It contains critical insurance market reforms and, perhaps \neven more important, delivery reforms. We will get into those in a \nminute.\n  Let's talk about the need for action. This chart shows what is \nhappening to premiums for health insurance coverage. Premiums are \nprojected to continue to rise on American families. In 1999, premiums \naveraged $6,050. In 2009, they increased by 117 percent. What the \nexperts are telling us is, from 2009 to 2019, they will go up another \n71 percent to average premiums in 2019 of $22,440 to an American family \nfor health care premiums. How many families will be able to afford \npremiums of $22,440?\n  At the same time we see employer-based health care coverage--and the \nvast majority of our people receive coverage at their place of \nemployment--is in decline, from 68 percent to 62 percent in 2008. In \n2000, 68 percent of companies were offering health care coverage. That \nis down to 62 percent in 2008.\n  At the same time we know 46 million fellow citizens do not have \nhealth insurance. That is projected to increase, by 2019, to 54 million \nwho will not have health insurance. It is interesting because every \nother industrialized country in the world has universal coverage. They \nhave figured out a way to provide health insurance to every family in \ntheir countries. France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, every other \nmajor industrialized country has figured out a way to provide health \ninsurance for every one of their citizens. It is time for America to do \nthe same. That is a moral issue. That is not just a financial issue; it \nis a moral issue. What kind of country are we going to be?\n  This is a letter I received from a constituent in September. I wanted \nto share it with my colleagues.\n\n       Dear Senator Conrad, I am 51 years old and have never given \n     much thought to writing a Senator until now. Three days ago, \n     we received some of the worst news a person can get. My \n     husband has been diagnosed with bladder cancer. He does not \n     have health insurance. We are self-employed. Our income is \n     low but we do own some property which makes us ineligible for \n     most assistance programs. A few years ago we both dropped our \n     Blue Cross Blue Shield because the premiums were too high. I \n     re-applied and got my insurance back but my husband was \n     denied due to his weight. (He quit smoking 4 years ago and \n     put on weight gradually since then.)\n       We are stunned by the diagnosis and are terrified by the \n     uncertainties of his prognosis. We already owe $2,000 just \n     for emergency room costs and he has surgery scheduled for \n     September 22 with at least an overnight stay in the hospital. \n     The medical bills will be astronomical. If the cancer is not \n     localized, he will be referred to oncology and will begin \n     chemotherapy/radiation treatment and possibly even more \n     surgery. We will have to sell almost everything we own to pay \n     [the] bills.\n       Please, sir, consider our story when thinking about health \n     care reform. Any change will happen too slowly to help us but \n     others will benefit. Don't give up. We are counting on you to \n     make a difference.\n\n  To that woman, I make this pledge: I am not going to give up. I think \nenough of my colleagues will not be giving up so that we can at least \nbegin the debate on whether there should be health care reform in this \ncountry. I repeat, I can't think of a single credible reason why \nsomebody would vote against beginning the debate, to have a chance to \namend. If you don't like the product as it has come to the floor, that \nis what legislating is about, the opportunity to amend, the opportunity \nto improve, the opportunity to convince colleagues that we need to move \nin a different direction. I don't know what could be more clear than \nthat we have to move in a different direction on health care.\n  We are now spending 17 percent of our gross domestic product on \nhealth care. That is $1 in every $6 in this economy. The experts tell \nus by 2050, we will be spending 38 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct on health care, if we stay on the current trend line. That \nwould be more than $1 in every $3 in this economy on health care. That \nwould be a disaster for the American economy, a disaster for the \nbudgets of families and businesses. That simply cannot be the result \nfor our Nation.\n  On Medicare and Medicaid spending, in 1980, if you put the two \ntogether, Medicare and Medicaid consumed 2 percent of our gross \ndomestic product; $1 in every $50 in this economy was going to Medicare \nand Medicaid. In 2010, we are up to almost 6 percent of GDP for \nMedicare and Medicaid, three times as much as a share of our economy. \nBut look where we are headed. By 2050, again on the current trend line, \nwe would be spending 12.7 percent of gross domestic product just on \nMedicare and Medicaid, six times as much as back in 1980. If we look at \nthe indebtedness of the country, there is no bigger contributor than \nMedicare. It is the 800-pound gorilla: $37.8 trillion of unfunded \nliability in Medicare. The comparable number for Social Security is \n$5.3 trillion. We can see the unfunded liability in Medicare is seven \ntimes the unfunded liability in Social Security.\n  For those who say, let's not even go to a debate, let's not even go \nto a discussion on reforming health care, what is their proposal? Are \nthey afraid to offer one? Do they not have one? Is their answer do \nnothing? Is their answer really to do nothing in the face of a crisis \nof this magnitude? Their answer is: Let's not even debate it; let's not \nhave even have a chance to amend it?\n  That is not a credible position. It is not a responsible position. It \nis not a serious position. That is a position of obstruction, pure and \nsimple.\n  If we look at our system, we have had a review by Dartmouth Medical \nSchool. They concluded:\n\n       Although many Americans believe more medical care is better \n     care, evidence indicates otherwise. Evidence suggests that \n     states with higher Medicare spending levels actually provide \n     lower quality care.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       We may be wasting perhaps 30% of U.S. health care spending \n     on medical care that does not appear to improve our health.\n\n  As a country, we are spending almost $2.5 trillion a year on health \ncare. If 30 percent of that money is being wasted, is not contributing \nto better health, 30 percent of $2.5 trillion is $750 billion a year. \nThe answer by some of our colleagues is, let's not even debate it. \nLet's not even discuss it. Let's not even attempt to address it.\n  That is a remarkable position to take.\n  If we look at our country versus others around the world, we see we \nare spending far more as a share of our income than they are. If we \nlook country by country: Japan is spending 8 percent of GDP; the United \nKingdom, 8.4; Belgium, 10 percent; Germany, about 10; Switzerland, \nalmost 11; France, 11; and we are at 16 percent. That is as of 2007. We \nhave gone up to 17 percent of GDP in 2009 on health care. We are \nspending as a share of the economy almost twice as much as any other \nmajor industrialized country in the world. Yet we still have 46 million \npeople without any health insurance.\n\n[[Page S11854]]\n\n  Under the British model, they have universal coverage. Under the so-\ncalled Bismarck model, countries of Germany, France, Japan, \nSwitzerland, and Belgium have universal coverage. Yet if we remember \ntheir costs, we see even though they are providing universal coverage \nin these other countries, their costs are much lower than ours.\n  If we look further at the quality of health care outcomes, quite an \ninteresting story emerges. Those countries have universal care, lower \ncosts. And if we look at quality outcomes, they do better than we do. \nOn preventable deaths, the Commonwealth Fund, which is very \ndistinguished and nonpartisan, looked at preventable deaths around the \nworld. They found the United States came in nineteenth. But other \ncountries that have much lower costs and have universal coverage, for \nexample France and Japan, are ranked 1 and 2. With much lower costs and \nuniversal coverage, they are getting better results. And some do not \neven want to debate going to health care? They are going to have a tall \norder to explain why they do not even want to discuss it.\n\n  On infant mortality, the United States is ranked 22nd, again, \naccording to the Commonwealth Fund. Again, these are countries that \nhave universal coverage, with much lower costs than we do. Ranked No. 1 \nwas Japan. France was No. 5. Germany was No. 9. From my earlier chart, \nyou will remember each of those countries has universal coverage and \nmuch lower costs than we do, and yet they are getting, on these \nmetrics, better outcomes than we are.\n  It does not stop there. Here is life expectancy, as shown on this \nchart. The United States is ranked 24th. This is according to the OECD, \nthe international scorekeeper. Again, Japan, Switzerland, France--\nuniversal coverage, much lower costs--still ranked much higher than we \ndo on that metric.\n  Japan, with universal coverage, much lower cost than we have--in \nfact, half as much as ours--yet they were No. 1. Switzerland, No. 2--\nthey have universal coverage, with much lower cost than we have, and \nyet they rank No. 2. France, with universal coverage, much lower cost, \nis ranked sixth in the world.\n  It would seem to me we ought to look to evidence, and evidence shows \nus there is a better way, and that is what this legislation seeks to \nfind. It seeks to find a better way to expand coverage, to improve \nquality, and to contain exploding costs.\n  The key elements of this Senate health care reform plan are these: \nOne, it reduces both short- and long-term deficits. I noticed in one of \nthe newspapers circulated on the Hill today a full-page ad asking: How \ncan Senator Conrad, who is a deficit hawk, be for this bill? Well, \nbecause I have read the CBO analysis, the Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis, that says clearly and unequivocally this bill lowers the \ndeficit. It lowers it by $130 billion over the first 10 years. It \nlowers it by $650 billion over the second 10 years, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  So when somebody asks, How can a deficit hawk like Senator Conrad be \nfor this bill? It is because this bill lowers the deficit. That is not \nmy analysis. That is the official analysis of the Congressional Budget \nOffice which is nonpartisan.\n  This bill also expands coverage to 94 percent of the American people. \nIt promotes choice and competition. It reforms the insurance market. It \nimproves the quality of care. All of these issues are at the heart of \nwhat reform must be.\n  The Senate health plan reduces short- and long-term deficits. It \nextends Medicare solvency. Medicare is going to go broke in 8 years. \nThis bill extends the life of Medicare by 4 to 5 years. It extends the \nsolvency of Medicare by 4 to 5 years. It includes reforms to improve \ndelivery of care and reduces costs.\n  It curbs overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans. Some Medicare \nAdvantage plans are now costing 150 percent of traditional fee-for-\nservice Medicare. Medicare Advantage was started on the basis it would \nsave money. In fact, it was initially capped at 97 percent of \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare. It was supposed to save money. \nNow there are Medicare Advantage plans that cost 150 percent of \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare. It is not saving money, it is \ncosting much more money. And it will break Medicare if we do not reform \nit. That is clear.\n  This bill also creates an Independent Medicare Advisory Board to make \nrecommendations on how we can have further savings to extend further \nthe solvency of Medicare. It also includes an excise tax on insurers \noffering Cadillac plans. Virtually every analyst who came before the \nFinance Committee said one of the most important things we could do was \nto start with a levy on Cadillac health insurance plans to reduce \noverutilization and to begin to control the exploding costs.\n  When I say this bill reduces the deficit, that is not my assertion or \nthe work of the Senate Budget Committee. That is the judgment of the \nofficial scorekeeper here, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \nHere is a page from their report, and it shows very clearly, from 2010 \nto 2019, this legislation reduces the deficit by $130 billion.\n  I have heard colleagues come to the floor and give all kinds of \nspeeches about how this increases the deficit. They have every right to \ncome here and make up any numbers they want to make up. They can make \nany claim they want. But let's be clear, the official analysis of this \nbill by the agency we have all empowered to give us objective analysis \nhas concluded that this bill reduces the deficit by $130 billion over \nthe first 10 years, and $650 billion over the second 10 years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office on the Senate health plan and \nreducing long-term deficits:\n\n       . . . CBO expects that the bill, if enacted, would reduce \n     federal budget deficits over the ensuing decade [beyond 2019] \n     relative to those projected under current law--with a total \n     effect during that decade that is in a broad range around \n     one-quarter percent of gross domestic product.\n\n  Gross domestic product over that second 10-year period is forecast to \nbe $260 trillion. One-quarter of 1 percent of $260 trillion is $650 \nbillion.\n\n       . . . CBO anticipates that the legislation would probably \n     continue to reduce budget deficits relative to those under \n     current law in subsequent decades. . . .\n\n  In other words, it would continue to reduce deficits beyond the first \n20 years.\n  The excise tax, which virtually every analyst has said needs to be \npart of a package if you are going to be serious about controlling the \nexplosion of costs, will target plans that have a value of more than \n$23,000 a year. The average premium in 2013 is projected to be $15,740. \nSo these Cadillac plans are plans that would have a value of more than \n$23,000 a year. There are very few people in the country who have plans \nof that value today, and there will be very few who will have plans of \nthat value in 2013.\n  The Senate health care plan also expands coverage. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, it covers 94 percent of the American \npeople by building on our existing employer-based system. It creates \nState-based exchanges for individuals and small businesses.\n  It provides tax credits to help individuals and small businesses buy \ninsurance. In fact, there is more than $400 billion of tax credits \nhere. Somebody said: Well, this is a big tax increase. It is a big tax \nincrease. Well, they must have left out the $400 billion of tax \ncredits. They must not have gotten to that page in the bill.\n  It expands Medicaid eligibility with assistance to States so they are \nable to afford it.\n  The Senate health plan also promotes choice and competition. It \ncreates a public option to compete with private plans, but not one \nbased on Medicare levels of reimbursement. I think many of my \ncolleagues know I strongly resisted a public option tied to Medicare \nlevels of reimbursement because that would work a real hardship in my \nState. But in this plan, there is no tie of a public option to Medicare \nlevels of reimbursement. And States can opt out. It also provides seed \nmoney for nonprofit cooperatives--member-run, member-controlled \ncooperatives--to compete with private plans.\n  This chart shows the Medicare reimbursement per enrollee for 2006. \nYou can see, New York was getting nearly $10,000; North Dakota, though, \n$6,000. That is the kind of disparity that exists in Medicare \nreimbursement. It is\n\n[[Page S11855]]\n\neven more dramatic if you look at institution to institution. In fact, \nfor many years, I was shown a hospital in Devils Lake, ND--Mercy \nHospital--that would get one-half as much as Lady of Mercy Hospital in \nNew York City to treat the exact same illnesses--one-half as much. That \nis all based on formulas based on historic costs. That is why many of \nus believe it would be unfair to tie a public option to Medicare levels \nof reimbursements. That disparity across the country would work an \nextreme hardship on low reimbursement States such as mine.\n  The cooperative plan allows for not-for-profit co-ops to provide an \naffordable, accountable, transparent alternative to private insurance. \nThe mission is to provide the best value for consumer members. It could \noperate at a State, regional, or national level. They are self-governed \nby members with an elected board--not controlled by the Federal \nGovernment--subject to the same State and Federal rules and regulations \nas private plans. There would be $6 billion in startup funding for \ncapitalization by the Federal Government. And that would be the end of \nthe Federal Government role.\n  The Senate plan also reforms the insurance market. It prohibits \ninsurers from denying coverage for preexisting conditions. It prohibits \ninsurers from rescinding coverage when people become sick after they \nhave paid premiums for years. It bans insurers from lifetime caps and \nunreasonable annual limits on health care benefits. And it prevents \ninsurers from charging more based on health status.\n  This plan also improves the quality of care. It covers preventive \nservices. It provides incentives for healthy lifestyles. It promotes \nadoption of best practices in comparative effectiveness research, and \nincludes delivery system reforms to encourage quality over quantity of \ncare.\n  When we look at the major reforms that are in this bill on the \ndelivery system and compare them to the House bill, we see that the \nSenate has accountable care organizations; the House a pilot. Both have \nprimary care payment bonuses. Both have readmissions reforms. Only the \nSenate has hospital value-based purchasing. Both have comparative \neffectiveness research. Both have CMS innovation centers. Only the \nSenate has an Independent Medicare Advisory Board. And only the Senate \nhas a full platform for bundling. The House just has a pilot.\n  Debunking the myths: There is no government takeover of health care \nhere. The public option, according to CBO, would get 2 percent of the \nAmerican people--2 percent. That is hardly a government takeover. And \nthere is no tying of the public option to Medicare levels of \nreimbursements. There is no cut in the guaranteed benefits for seniors. \nThere is no coverage for illegal immigrants. There are no ``death \npanels.'' And there is no expansion of Federal funding for abortion \nservices.\n  To conclude, if we look at the Senate Democratic plan and the only \nRepublican plan, and compare them, the Senate Democratic plan contains \ndelivery system reforms. There are none in the Republican proposal. The \nSenate Democratic proposal reduces the number of uninsured by 31 \nmillion people. The Republican plan makes no progress on that front. \nThe Senate Democratic plan reforms the insurance industry, banning \npreexisting conditions and rescissions of coverage and health status \nratings and lifetime benefit limits. The Republican plan has no similar \nprovisions.\n  The Senate Democratic plan improves rural Medicare reimbursement. The \nRepublican plan does not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats' hour has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senate Democratic plan extends Medicare solvency by 4 \nto 5 years. The House Republican plan has no extension of Medicare \nsolvency. And, finally, the Senate Democratic plan reduces the deficit, \naccording to CBO, by $130 billion--twice as much as the Republican plan \nfrom the House.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican deputy leader.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you. Mr. President, we are going to focus for the next \nhour on perhaps one of the most pernicious aspects of Leader Reid's \nbill: the fact that it cuts Medicare by almost $\\1/2\\ trillion--almost \n$500 billion in Medicare cuts.\n  There are a lot of seniors in my State of Arizona and in the States \nrepresented by my other Republican colleagues. Those seniors are scared \nof these cuts. It is not because of anything Republicans have said to \ntry to scare them; they have simply become aware of what is in these \nbills. By ``these bills,'' I am talking about both the Senate bill \noffered by the majority leader and the House bill, which are the two \nbills that would presumably try to be reconciled in conference. Our \nseniors have been told that under both bills, their benefits are going \nto be cut by about $500 billion, and that is enough to scare them.\n  In fact, all of America is concerned about this. A recent USA TODAY \nGallup Poll shows that an overwhelming number of Americans--61 \npercent--oppose cutting Medicare to pay for health care reform. Yet, \ndespite that overwhelming opposition, Democratic leaders in Congress \nhave moved ahead with this bill to slash, as I said, nearly $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion from Medicare to pay for the new health insurance programs. \nThey are simply not listening to what Americans have to say about this.\n  If Democratic leaders have their way, hundreds of billions of dollars \nwill be slashed from hospitals that treat seniors, from the Medicare \nAdvantage Program, which we will talk about in a minute, from nursing \nhome care, home health care, and hospice care. Medicare already faces a \nsevere challenge, including a whopping $38 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities and insolvency by the year 2017. That is almost \nincomprehensible--in just a few short years, $38 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities and insolvency. Obviously, seniors want us to fix that \nproblem rather than raiding Medicare to pay for a new health care \nprogram, and they want to preserve Medicare Advantage.\n  I receive letters from worried seniors every day about this \nDemocratic plan to cut Medicare Advantage, which is a very popular \nprogram in Arizona. Medicare Advantage is the opportunity we have given \nseniors to enroll in a private insurance company to help them receive \nMedicare benefits. What these private insurance companies do is make a \nmore attractive program by adding some additional benefits to the basic \nset of benefits that are promised under Medicare. What our seniors are \ntelling us is, these are very important benefits to them, things such \nas vision care and hearing. Now that I am getting a little bit older, I \ncan tell you that both my vision and hearing is starting to go, and I \nwould like to have that kind of benefit. Dental benefits, preventive \nscreenings, free flu shots, home care for chronic illnesses, \nprescription drug management tools, wellness programs, personal care, \nand durable medical equipment, all very important for seniors. By the \nway, physical fitness programs, one of which has a great name--it is \ncalled the SilverSneakers Program, and the seniors are very supportive \nof this because it keeps them physically fit which is, of course, what \nwe should be doing.\n  I get letters and phone calls from my constituents, and they are \nsharing their anxieties about losing these benefits, losing \nprescription drug coverage; about the overall decline in the quality of \ncare that they understand will occur when their doctors' payments are \ncut, when all these other cuts under Medicare that my colleagues are \ngoing to discuss in a moment finally hit. They know it is going to \nimpact their care. They don't like this interference from government \nbureaucrats, in effect, getting between them and their physicians when \nit comes to their health care.\n  Let me read portions of three letters from constituents and then I \nwill yield to my colleagues.\n  A constituent from Surprise, AZ, writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Kyl:\n       Please fight the cuts to Medicare Advantage. I am on Social \n     Security disability and on a fixed income. The Medicare \n     Advantage insurance I have has literally been a lifesaver for \n     me. I cannot afford to lose the coverage that includes \n     prescription drugs. I need your help on this.\n\n  Two Medicare beneficiaries, a husband and wife from Mesa, AZ, write:\n\n       We believe that our health is our responsibility and that \n     we have a right to make all\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\n     the decisions regarding our health. We do not need permission \n     from our government to take actions that will protect and \n     preserve our health. We do not need a third party who has \n     never met us and who is not acting in our best interests in \n     making decisions about our medical care and we do not want to \n     lose our Medicare HMOs.\n\n  That is the Medicare Advantage about which I spoke.\n  Then, a constituent from Sun City West, AZ, who incidentally is a \nWorld War II veteran, wrote a very powerful letter about how Medicare \nAdvantage improved his life and his wife's life. He said:\n\n       As a B-17 pilot I flew 50 combat missions out of England \n     and I earned five air medals after flying B-24s on coastal \n     submarine patrol. When we moved to Arizona to be near our \n     children I visited a local VA hospital to find out that I had \n     a $50 copay for each visit and I never saw a physician, just \n     an assistant. In desperation, I purchased a Medicare \n     supplement for my wife and myself. The cost was almost $600 \n     per year and I only receive $833 a month on Social Security. \n     Fortunately, here in Arizona, my wife and I were both able to \n     sign up for MediSun, an Advantage plan, with no monthly \n     payment and simple $10 or $20 copays. That made it possible \n     for us to purchase a home. With the health care reform being \n     considered, we understand that Advantage plans will be \n     reduced or eliminated. What happened to ``if I like my \n     insurance, I can keep it''?\n\n  Well, it is a good question from my constituent. Of course, he is \nexactly right. When the promise was made: If you like your insurance \nyou get to keep it, unfortunately, that is not the way this legislation \nworks. As a result, a lot of the benefits they are currently receiving, \nfor example, from Medicare Advantage, would be cut or eliminated.\n  My constituents are right to be wary of cuts to their Medicare \nAdvantage. They depend on it. They realize you can't cut $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion from Medicare without adversely affecting your health care.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I wonder, before the Senator closes, if he \nwould yield.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I think it is important for us to \nunderstand that there are some differences between the bills--the HELP \nbill, the Finance Committee bill, and the bill that has come out of the \nHouse of Representatives--but in each and every case the proposals put \nforward by the Democrats do have this $\\1/2\\ trillion cut in Medicare. \nIndeed, as the Senator pointed out, these involve cuts to hospitals, to \nMedicare Advantage, Medicare cuts to nursing homes, to home health, and \nto hospice. There is no question about that. I appreciate the Senator \nbringing some information to the public and to the Senate about the \nconcerns of his constituents.\n  In the previous hour, I heard a Senator from the other side of the \naisle talk about scare tactics Republicans will be putting forward \nduring the coming weeks of this debate. Of course, you have read \nletters from your constituents outlining why the people of Arizona are \nlegitimately fearful for the coverage they have enjoyed. I would tell \nmy colleagues that the opposition to these Medicare cuts has come in a \nbipartisan way. We heard a great deal about that from our friends at \nthe other end of the building when the House of Representatives was \ntalking about this.\n  The president of the Blue Dog Democrats, Mike Ross, a senior Democrat \nfrom Arkansas who has worked to try to make this palatable to people in \nhis constituency, had this to say about these Medicare cuts:\n\n       With more than $400 billion in cuts to Medicare, it would \n     force many of our rural hospitals to close, providing less \n     access to care for our seniors.\n\n  Less than 12 days ago, Representative Ross from Arkansas said this. \nHis constituency in Mississippi is very much like mine, and I can \nassure my colleagues that a great number of our hospitals in \nMississippi and throughout the country are rural and no doubt they are \nin Arizona too. So there is a very real concern. The gentleman from \nArkansas flatly says it can force many of these hospitals to close.\n\n  Representative Larry Kissell from North Carolina said this:\n\n       From the day I announced my candidacy for this office, I \n     promised to protect Medicare. I gave my word I wouldn't cut \n     it and I intend to keep that promise.\n\n  Representative Kissell from North Carolina concluded that in his \njudgment, the only way he could keep that promise was to vote no on \nthis legislation.\n  Representative Michael McMahon of New York said:\n\n       Medicare Advantage, which serves approximately 40 percent \n     of my seniors on Medicare, would be cut dramatically.\n\n  This is not a Republican scare tactic; this is a flat statement by an \nelected Democrat from the State of New York in the Northeastern part of \nour country, one of the larger States. But he said flatly that Medicare \nAdvantage would be cut for 40 percent of his seniors and he voted no on \nthat basis.\n  Representative Ike Skelton, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, said:\n\n       The proposed reductions to Medicare reimbursement could \n     further squeeze the budgets of rural health care providers.\n\n  Chairman Skelton goes on to say:\n\n       I also oppose the creation of a new government-run public \n     option and continue to have serious concerns about its \n     potential unintended consequences for Missourians who have \n     private insurance plans they like and, of course, we know \n     that this Reid bill also has the government-run option.\n\n  Finally, to quote Representative Rick Boucher, another senior \nDemocrat from Virginia, he said:\n\n       I also intend to oppose the bill because of my concern that \n     a government-operated health insurance plan could place at \n     risk the survival of our region's hospitals.\n\n  I am concerned, and I am determined to protect the rural health care \nwe have in the State of Mississippi and that we have in these districts \nthat are represented by these comments.\n  So I wanted to jump in now, before the Senator from Arizona concludes \nhis portion of the initial remarks, and say that the concerns are not \nonly coming from Republicans, they are coming from actuaries, they are \ncoming from people who have analyzed this bill, and they are coming \nfrom Democrats who have read the bill, who understand its meaning and \nwho understand that these cuts to Medicare are real and they are \nhurtful.\n  I yield back to the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi is exactly \nright. It is not just Members of the House and Members of the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats and senior citizens in the State of Arizona. \nHere are some other third-party sources. I will just cite three: The \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services; that is, CMS. That is the \noutfit that runs Medicare. They confirm that cuts will indeed \ncompromise the services seniors now receive.\n  The Washington Post--how about that for a third-party source--\nsummarizes a report in a November 13 article entitled ``Bill Would \nReduce Senior Care.'' That is a fairly specific headline. It says:\n\n       A plan to slash more than $500 billion from future Medicare \n     spending, one of the biggest sources of funding for President \n     Obama's proposed overhaul for the Nation's health care \n     system, would sharply reduce benefits for some senior \n     citizens and could jeopardize access to care for millions of \n     others.\n\n  Then Politico, which is a Capitol Hill newspaper, reported that, by \n2014, enrollment in Medicare Advantage would drop from 13.2 million to \n4.7 million because of less generous benefit packages. That is a 64-\npercent decrease.\n  Looking at my colleague's chart there, Medicare Advantage, which I \nspoke about and which my constituents wrote to me about, the concern \nthere is that people now enrolled--13.2 million--are going to be \nreduced down to 4.7 million because the reductions in the benefits are \nsimply no longer sufficient incentive for them to enroll in that \nprogram.\n  Of course, that is what the pro-government-run health care folks want \nto happen. They are all for a public company competing with private \ninsurance companies in the market for folks, but when it comes to \nMedicare, they don't want the private companies that provide Medicare \nAdvantage care competing with the government program. Under this bill, \nthey will get their way. It is going to go from 13.2 million down to \n4.7 million. That is a lot of senior citizens who will lose their \nMedicare Advantage coverage.\n  I will conclude by confirming what the Senator from Mississippi said. \nIt is not just Representatives in the House or Senators who have sworn \nto help protect our constituents, but it is third-party sources as well \nin the government and in the media that have\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\nconfirmed that this bill will cut benefits. They will certainly do it \nfor senior citizens.\n  We will talk later about the Republican ideas. Republicans have \nsuggested a step-by-step approach to target specific solutions to \nspecific problems, including things such as medical liability reform; \nallowing Americans to purchase insurance across State lines, which \nwould expand competition for patient business; association health plans \nto help reduce costs. Most of our ideas are cost-free; they won't cost \na dime. They wouldn't cut Medicare or diminish the quality of care for \nanybody. They have been rejected by our Democratic colleagues.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree that a place to start in this \nlegislation is not to cut Medicare. Why would you want to cut Medicare \nif the whole idea here is to provide greater opportunity for affordable \nand quality health care for American citizens? It makes no sense to me.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to be here \nwith my colleagues from Arizona, Mississippi, and Florida.\n  When the people of the United States talk about health care reform, \nthey are seeking some way to control the punishing and skyrocketing \nincreases, year after year, in health care insurance costs and medical \ncosts and better access and quality of health care. Yet when this \n2,074-page bill, which was crafted in secret for the last 2 or 3 weeks, \nwas finally revealed, that is hardly what we got. In fact, the reality \nis that this bill will drive up the cost of health care insurance and \nmedical care in this country. It will increase taxes by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. It will cut Medicare by hundreds of billions of \ndollars. It will grow the Federal Government by $2.4 trillion of new \nspending over a 10-year period. It will push the needy uninsured not \ninto subsidized health care insurance but into a failing entitlement \nprogram, Medicaid. It will impose a damaging unfunded mandate on States \nthat are already strapped financially. It will leave millions of \nAmericans uninsured, while probably creating the most enormous and \nmassive government extension of Federal control over our economy that \nwe have seen in our country, starting with creation of a new federally \nowned and managed insurance company.\n  As the Senator from Arizona indicated, today we are here to focus on \nthe Medicare cut aspect of this legislation. The Senate bill contains \nsomething in the neighborhood of $500 billion of cuts in Medicare. The \nfirst one I want to focus on is the one the Senator from Arizona \nalready identified; that is, the Medicare Advantage cuts.\n  The Senate bill contains $118 billion in cuts to the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. Let me talk about that program for a minute. \nCurrently, there are nearly 11 million seniors, as has been indicated, \nenrolled in Medicare Advantage. That represents about one out of four \nof all Medicare beneficiaries in the United States. In my State of \nIdaho, there are more than 60,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, \nwhich is about 27 percent of the population in Idaho.\n  In addition, this is an extremely popular program. A 2007 study \nreported very high overall satisfaction with the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. Eighty-four percent of the Medicare respondents said they were \nhappy with their coverage and 75 percent would recommend Medicare \nAdvantage to their friends or family members. Yet, despite this, there \nare massive cuts coming forward in the bill. Why would that be the \ncase?\n  I don't think most Americans who are not on Medicare recognize the \ndifference between Medicare generally and Medicare Advantage. Medicare \nAdvantage was a modification of the traditional Medicare Program that, \nfrankly, was put into place--I ask my colleague from Arizona to \ncomment. Wasn't it put into place when the Republicans were in control \nof the Congress to try to help get market forces more engaged and \ninvolved in the administration of Medicare benefits?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the answer to that is yes. The idea was that \nseniors were complaining about the existing program. One thing was that \na lot of folks in rural areas were not receiving good, efficient, and \nquick care because they had to drive long distances and couldn't find a \ndoctor to serve them and hospitals couldn't take care of them.\n  Republicans tried to figure out, how could we incent the insurance \ncompanies to put together pools of physicians and hospitals to go into \nrural areas and take care of citizens who live there. The Medicare \nAdvantage Program was one of the ways in which that was done. It has \nproved to be very successful.\n  Mr. CRAPO. If you look at the Federal entitlement program Medicare, \nthe portion of Medicare that truly does have some private sector \ninvolvement, where private sector companies can come in and contract to \nprovide the government's responsibilities under Medicare, it is the \nmost popular of all Medicare programs, the one that was growing and \nletting the private sector deliver the benefits.\n  One of the aspects of the Medicare Advantage Program is that senior \ncitizens on Medicare Advantage actually get additional benefits beyond \nthose traditional Medicare benefits that those in the normal or \nstandard Medicare Program get because the private sector options have \nbeen able to identify ways to enhance and create opportunities for \ngreater and stronger benefits.\n  Yet those who don't want to have anything but a single-payer system, \nthose who want to make sure the government-provided health care is \nprovided only by the government, do not like the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. So it is not surprising that we see this level of cuts in this \nprogram.\n  During the Finance Committee markup, CBO estimated that the value of \nextra benefits that Medicare Advantage plans provide will drop from \n$135 a month to $42 a month of extra benefits. The CBO Director, Mr. \nElmendorf, confirmed this during the markup. I asked him:\n\n       So approximately half of the additional benefit would be \n     lost to those current Medicare Advantage policyholders.\n\n  His answer was:\n\n       For those who would be enrolled otherwise under current \n     law, yes.\n\n  In other words, compared to current law, if these cuts are put into \nplace, about half of the benefits would be lost to these Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries.\n  We now have more detail on that. I am sorry we don't have a bigger \nchart. We will have one in the future. If you can see the United States \nhere, the States in the deep red are those that have cuts in excess of \n50 percent to their Medicare Advantage beneficiaries; those in the \nlighter red are between 25 and 50 percent. In the white, there are only \nfive States; they are the ones that don't have a negative impact. So 45 \nof the 50 States will see significant reductions in the Medicare \nAdvantage benefits that are provided to their constituencies. You just \nhave to look at the map to see it is a large percentage of those 45 \nStates that are getting cuts in excess of 50 percent of their benefits.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. The Senator is saying that seniors who have Medicare \nAdvantage now will have big reductions in the benefits they receive. My \nunderstanding is that includes flu shots, eyeglasses, and hearing \naids--as the Senator from Arizona said, programs to keep seniors \nhealthy. My folks in Florida very much appreciate the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. We have more than 900,000 Floridians who are on \nMedicare Advantage.\n\n  I want to make sure I understand this correctly--that under the \nproposal put forward by Senator Reid, we are going to make substantial \ncuts to Medicare Advantage and the benefits Medicare Advantage \nprovides.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator is right. The way I look at it is that it is \nthe extras. Some say Medicare benefits aren't being cut by these \nproposals, but that is a real stretch. When you look at Medicare \nAdvantage, it is an outright misrepresentation. The benefits are vision \nbenefits, dental benefits, and the kinds of preventive medicine, such \nas the mammograms, the PSA tests, and other types of things we have \nfound that help you to dramatically increase your health, if you pursue \nthese kinds of preventive medicine options. They are the ones that will \nbe deprived through these benefits.\n\n[[Page S11858]]\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. WICKER. I notice that in Florida that reduction, according to the \nCBO map, would be 81 percent. That is an unthinkable, drastic change in \nMedicare Advantage. In my area of the country, over in Arkansas, for \nexample, it has a 40-percent reduction. My State, Mississippi, has a \n41-percent reduction. Our neighboring State of Louisiana--these are \nsome examples--has an 81-percent reduction, the same as the proposed \nreduction this legislation would cause for the State of Florida. I \nthink it is important for our constituents to understand the magnitude \nof these Medicare Advantage reductions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. That is absolutely true. Taking a couple of other States, \nCalifornia is 68 percent; Arkansas, 40 percent; New York, 69 percent; \nNew Mexico, 65 percent. The list goes on. The point here is this: The \nCBO Director made it clear that these will be benefits Medicare \nAdvantage holders will be losing.\n  I want to move on to some of the other reductions in Medicare. The \nargument being made by the proponents of this bill is that we can cut \n$500 billion out of Medicaid and not impact anybody's benefits or the \nquality of the medical care they are receiving. That is not true. Where \nare the other cuts, non-Medicare Advantage cuts, coming from? They come \nfrom home health agencies, hospice, skilled nursing facilities, \nhospitals that provide care to seniors, and other Medicare providers in \nwhat is called the market basket.\n  You might say we can just continue to cut the compensation or the \nallocation of return for procedures and health care provided in these \nmedical providers' services and not have any impact. The reality is far \nfrom that. What will happen is this. I will give a couple of specific \nexamples. In general, what happens is, when a home health agency or a \nskilled nursing facility or a hospital receives these massive \nreductions of over $100 billion worth of cuts in these areas, they have \nto adjust somehow. Let me give you some examples. The adjustment is \nthis: In some cases, providers simply stop taking Medicare patients \nbecause they can no longer make a profit. In that case, the Medicare \npopulation loses access because they have fewer providers from which to \nchoose. In other cases, they reduce services or reduce employees. \nAgain, both the quality and the quantity of health care services to \nseniors is reduced.\n  Let me give some examples. A few weeks ago, I spoke to Gary Thietten \nof Idaho Home Health and Hospice about the impact of Medicare cuts to \nhome health and hospice providers, which is his business. He described \nto me just how bad the fiscal situation has already become for home \nhealth, hospice, and other Medicare providers in Idaho.\n  Idaho has already lost nearly 30 percent of its home care providers. \nLet me repeat that. Already, it has lost nearly 30 percent of its home \nhealth care providers. They are going out of business because we are \nsqueezing them down so tight. And that included Idaho's largest \nprovider. The providers that are still in business are working under \nthe same Medicare reimbursement levels they received in 2001--8 years \nago. If the kinds of cuts contemplated by this legislation go into \neffect, on top of the current reimbursement issues, the situation will \nget worse.\n  Gary said that he compared this situation for home health and hospice \nproviders to the farmers in Idaho. He said that most farmers don't grow \njust one crop. Similarly, home health agencies do more than just \nprovide home health; they provide hospice and private-duty care along \nwith medical supplies and equipment. All of this will get reduced.\n  Let me give another example. Robert Vande Merwe of the Idaho Health \nCare Association talked to me about the impact of these cuts on skilled \nnursing facilities.\n  Skilled nursing facilities, such as the hospice facilities, already \nface a budget challenge under recent CMS rules restricting their \ncompensation for the services they provide. The cuts they have already \nreceived, not counting what will come at them in this bill a \nhundredfold more, have already caused a reduction in reimbursement in \nIdaho by over $4 million per year to skilled nursing facilities.\n  He pointed out to me that in the nursing home world, more than 70 \npercent of the expenses they have are labor, primarily nurses and \nnursing assistants. He said when payment cuts like these occur, they \ncannot go to their buildings and take bricks out of it. What they have \nto do is reduce their employment. That cuts employees. That cuts \nbenefits and services to those who are there.\n  Let me make this clear. First of all, these cuts are going to reduce \njobs and, secondly, they are going to directly tie to the quality and \nnumber of staff there to provide care for those in the Medicare system.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask if my colleague will yield for a quick \nquestion.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. We talked a lot about the rationing of health care that is \nthe inevitable result of these cuts in this bill; that when you reduce \nthe amount of money you compensate hospitals, doctors, nurses, and \nothers, they cannot provide as many services. Some leave the business \naltogether. As the Senator from Idaho pointed out, some businesses go \nout of business. So there are fewer entities providing the care. That \nmeans it takes longer for patients to obtain the care where it is \navailable, and frequently they do not get as good of care because folks \ncannot take that much time to take care of them in that sense.\n  Will my colleague please talk about his concerns about the overall \nproblem of rationing that comes from the reductions in the benefits to \nproviders? By the way, the Senator's chart says ``other Medicare cuts \nto providers.'' We use that term ``providers'' as a short-cut term. \nWill my colleague explain what it means to a 70-year-old woman in Idaho \nwho is a provider and how important is that, what happens when you \ndon't pay that provider so that provider is no longer available to take \ncare of her?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate that question, who are the \nproviders. If this Medicare beneficiary is in a skilled nursing \nfacility, the provider is the facility itself, which I said we already \nlost 30 percent of our facilities. It is the nurses and the nurse \nassistants who are there to assist them and care for them.\n  The bottom line is, you simply cannot cut hundreds of billions of \ndollars out of these services and expect to provide the same level of \naccess and quality and available health care.\n  The same would be true if the care were being provided in a home \nsetting, which a lot of the home care services are compensated by \nMedicare or in a hospital which is there to provide care in some of the \nmost serious types of circumstances. Whatever it is, whether it is home \nhospice care, skilled nursing facility, a hospital or what have you, \nwhat we see is a reduction in the number of facilities and personnel \navailable, and that is nothing other than rationing.\n  It is a different kind of rationing than will occur under some other \nparts of this bill where the government will actually get in the \nbusiness of saying what kind of health care you can get and at what \ntime in your life you can get it. But it is a kind of rationing that \nsimply forces the availability of health care down so far that the \nsystem itself rations it out.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I wanted to follow up on my colleague's point. With all \nthese cuts to Medicare, $464 billion in this proposal, $192 billion in \nreductions to most services, $118 billion in cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage, $21 billion cuts to hospitals serving low-income patients, \n$23 billion from other sources, it seems inevitable that seniors are \ngoing to have a lower quality of health care. We were told by the \nPresident that if you liked your health care, you were going to be able \nto keep it. But it seems to me that we need to change that a little bit \nbecause under this proposal, you might be able to keep it unless you \nare a senior and that seniors are going to have a diminished quality of \nhealth care under this proposal; is that correct?\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator is absolutely correct. I will comment on that \nand then conclude and turn the floor over to my colleagues from \nMississippi and Florida for their comments. That is exactly right. In \nfact, one of the most clear and obvious places in which\n\n[[Page S11859]]\n\nthis legislation violates the President's pledge--that if you like what \nyou have you can keep it--is in Medicare Advantage because one out of \nfour Medicare beneficiaries in America will not be able to keep what \nthey have and will see their benefits cut.\n  There are also other parts of this bill that impact people outside of \nMedicare in terms of the kind and quality and extent of health care \ninsurance coverage they have and expect that will be impacted. It would \nimpact beyond this. This is about as clear a case there is of violating \nthat promise.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves that subject \nmatter, I wonder if I could interject. My friend from Idaho also has \nlisted specific cuts under this legislation: hospitals, Medicare \nAdvantage, cuts to nursing homes, cuts to home health, and hospice. But \nalso I think Senators and Americans need to understand that the Reid \nbill also establishes a permanent board of unelected members appointed \nby the administration which, in this case, initially at least would be \nthe Obama administration, and they would dictate further savings under \nMedicare.\n  This gets to the question of my friend from Arizona about rationing. \nIt would dictate annual Medicare cuts geared toward reducing Medicare \nspending. These people are not going to be like us--accountable. They \nwill not have to go back to their district every 2 years or their \nStates every 6 years. But they will have the unbelievable power under \nthis legislation to dictate additional cuts that we know not. The Wall \nStreet Journal called this a rationing commission. This ties right in \nwith the concerns that Americans have had over the last 2 or 3 days \nabout these recommendations with regard to mammograms.\n  I realize I am intruding on the Senator's time, but I have a letter \nfrom a physician in Mississippi who is fearful that this sort of \nrationing board is going to impose the requirement that mammograms not \nbe given until after age 50. He says:\n\n       My wife and I have two daughters who had breast cancer in \n     their 40s. One daughter was age 42 and it was picked up on a \n     routine yearly mammogram. The other daughter was age 49 and \n     she found an abnormality by self breast exam and it was \n     confirmed by a mammogram. . . .\n\n  Now we have a group of unelected people coming forth and saying you \nare not supposed to get a mammogram, you are not entitled to a \nmammogram, and we learned that some insurance companies have already \ndecided to follow that dictate. This gentleman, a physician, says my \ntwo daughters would be dead from breast cancer if that were imposed.\n  I am afraid that in addition to these very definite cuts, this \npermanent board of unelected members would impose the very type of \nrequirement that we are fearful might come forward on mammograms.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator is correct. I will conclude with this. I think \nwe have all seen folks are almost falling over themselves backing away \nfrom the news on the mammograms that came out. But it is a very clear \nexample in a way a study can come out from a government source or \notherwise to say we don't need to have this kind of health care in the \nUnited States, it is a cost saving. What do you think is the potential \nfor this commission to say: We are charged with saving costs in these \nprograms, and we are going to do that.\n  I suspect that the mammogram issue is one they would not do it on \ntoday because of the reaction to it. Somewhere this commission is going \nto save tens of billions of dollars, in addition to these kinds of \ncuts, by reducing services. Color it as you want, you cannot make this \nkind of reduction of health care services, personnel, and \ninfrastructure without reducing the access to and the quality of care \nthat Americans receive.\n  I will conclude by saying these issues face every State in America. \nWe are going to see in this arena a dramatic reduction of the quality \nand content and quantity of health care that our Medicare beneficiaries \ntoday see because of these proposals, and they are being done not in \norder to make the Medicare system more solvent but to finance yet \nanother major Federal entitlement program that will cost hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. As a matter of fact, if you look at the true \nnumbers, the cost will be over $2 trillion in a full 10-year period of \ntime.\n  There is a lot more we could say, but I know my colleagues from \nMississippi and Florida have some remarks they wish to make. I yield to \nthem at this time.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \ngreat remarks today. I want to follow up on what he started to discuss \nand continue also with the comments from my colleague from Arizona \nabout Medicare Advantage because it seems to me, being a Senator from \nFlorida where we have the second highest senior population in the \ncountry, the highest per capita senior population, we have 3 million \npeople on Medicare, more than 900,000 on Medicare Advantage, that \nFlorida is going to receive the worst impact perhaps of any State in \nthe country because of this proposal.\n  I am here today to talk about this not just as an American but as a \nFloridian because I want my fellow Floridians to know, especially \nseniors, what is in this bill and what it means to them. That is our \njob. It is our responsibility to read through this document, this \n2,074-page bill that we received a day and a half ago and to talk about \nwhat it means for the average American and, in my case, the average \nFloridian.\n  We find out today this Medicare Advantage Program that 900,000-plus \nFloridians enjoy is going to have a substantial cut to the benefits. \nThis is not just extras or fringe benefits. These are things people \nneed to stay healthy--eye doctors, hearing aids, programs to make sure \nfolks stay in shape, all sorts of things that contribute to the health \nand wellness of seniors. Our seniors enjoy this program. The popularity \nof this program is sky high.\n  But we are finding out today--and I am looking at this map--that \nFlorida is getting the worst impact of any State in America. Only \nLouisiana is going to get it as badly as Florida. We get the \nhurricanes, and now we are going to get the Medicare Advantage cuts--an \n81-percent reduction in the benefits to our seniors.\n  What is that going to mean? It means they are not going to have the \nhealth care they enjoy now, which is what the President promised.\n  Right now this bill says the benefits offered will drop from $135 a \nmonth to $42 a month. Florida seniors will lose 81 percent of this \nadditional coverage. I have some constituents who have written to me \nbecause they have been hearing about these problems. I want to read one \nor two of these letters from Floridians who are concerned about losing \nMedicare Advantage. This one is from Dennis Shelton in Plant City, FL, \nwhich is in central Florida. He writes to me:\n\n       Senator LeMieux, I am writing this letter to express my \n     deep concern about the proposed cuts in Medicare Advantage \n     funding. I am currently enrolled in an advantage program that \n     is crucial for me to get medical attention. The plan provides \n     doctors, medicines, urgent care and my diabetic supplies. The \n     plan does this significantly better than traditional Medicare \n     at a reduced cost.\n       By regular visits . . . I have been able to maintain \n     reasonable health. If the cuts reduce services then my health \n     will suffer along with other seniors that are in the \n     Advantage program.\n       This is distressing and I sincerely hope that you will \n     strongly advise fellow congressmen how important Medicare \n     Advantage programs are to seniors all across the United \n     States.\n\n  I am new to this body. I have only had the honor of serving here for \na couple of months, so I am still learning the ways of Washington. But \nmy understanding of this health care process and this health care bill \nis we were going to maintain quality, we were going to try to cut costs \nfor people who have experienced the high cost of insurance, and we were \ngoing to try to provide more access.\n  But what I am finding out from this proposal is that we are going to \ncut quality for seniors, and we are not going to reduce the costs of \nhealth care for the 170 million people who actually have insurance.\n  It occurs to me that the goals that were set are not being achieved \nby this plan. Worse still, we are taking a program that seniors rely on \nand that seniors paid into their whole life through their wages and we \nare going to cut $\\1/2\\ trillion out of it, a program that in 7 or 8 \nyears is going to run a deficit and be in tremendous trouble.\n  The question I have--and maybe my colleague from Mississippi can help \nme with this since I am new to the Chamber--is why are we going down \nthis\n\n[[Page S11860]]\n\npath? This doesn't seem good for seniors. It doesn't seem good for \npeople in any walk of life in America, especially in light of what my \ncolleague from Mississippi pointed out with the mammogram issue that \ncame out and the self breast exam issue that came out this week. Why \nare we going down this path?\n  Mr. WICKER. I appreciate the Senator asking that question. The answer \nis there is no reason for us to go down that path.\n  Early in our hour, the Republican whip pointed out that there are \nmany proposals the Republicans have that do not require the huge \nexpenditure, the huge expansion of Federal power and actually are \nrelatively simple and relatively inexpensive. For example, we have a \nproposal:\n  To reduce junk lawsuits against doctors, by Senator Ensign, the \nMedical Care Access Protection Act. It is only 28 pages, compared to \nthese huge pieces of legislation in front of us. That would not cost \nanything. It certainly would not require any reduction in Medicare.\n  To combat waste, fraud, and abuse, by my friend from Florida, and I \ncongratulate him for that. It is only 21 pages, something Republicans \nhave been begging for and arguing for for years and have been stymied \non.\n  To allow small businesses to pool resources to purchase health \ninsurance for employees. Small business people in restaurants and \nrealty companies, small motels, ought to be able to pool together and \nhave the same purchasing power the huge corporations have. But that \nwould only take 8 pages, it would not involve a cost to the Federal \nGovernment, and certainly not involve these draconian cuts of $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion to Medicare and Medicare Advantage.\n  Further, we could purchase health insurance across State lines. We \ncertainly agree there is not enough competition in health care \npurchasing. I would love to see a commercial someday with someone \ncoming in saying, ``I have great news, I just saved a ton of money on \nmy health insurance by switching to XYZ Company.'' We see that in car \ninsurance and life insurance. There is vibrant competition. But if we \nopened competition across State lines to the 50 States and if I could \nbuy insurance from Idaho, I might find a company that gives me better \nservice, that provides better care or reduced premiums. Or if I could \nlook at a Florida insurance company, the Senator from Florida might \nlook at a Mississippi company. We would use good old American \ncompetition that has worked in our market society for years but has not \nbeen allowed to work in the area of health insurance.\n  Then, of course, health savings accounts--a one-page bill by my \nfriend from Arizona and our colleague Senator DeMint. And then wellness \nand prevention, again only a simple 14 pages.\n  None of these would require cuts to Medicare. None of these would \ninvolve the $2.5 trillion that this spends per decade, once it is fully \nimplemented. So the answer to the question of why we are doing it is, \nit is not necessary. I guess the reason people might be doing it is \nthat they believe that big government works well. I have a different \nview on that.\n  I see, as the Senator pointed out, all of these Federal programs that \nare not exactly working as efficiently as they were projected to be. My \ndad is on Medicare. We are going to protect Medicare. Republican and \nDemocrat, we are going to do that. But as the Senator pointed out, it \ngoes broke in the year 2017. We certainly do not need to be taking from \nMedicare to pay for a new entitlement.\n  Medicaid, as has been pointed out--many doctors will not take \nMedicaid payments anymore because it is broke and it doesn't reimburse \nat a market rate. So we see in my home State of Mississippi, 60 percent \nof the doctors will not take Medicaid. Yet there are some people in \nthis building, there are some people in this country within the sound \nof my voice, who believe that somehow a huge $2.5 trillion takeover of \none-sixth of our economy can work and will not be like the Census and \nFannie and Freddy, like the post office and the highway trust fund, and \nwill not be broke.\n  It comes down to a difference in philosophy. But certainly we ought \nto all agree that savings we find in Medicare ought to be used to shore \nup Medicare, to make sure it is there for people such as my dad and \npeople who are going to rely on that program for years to come.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I thank the Senator for that explanation. That is very \nhelpful to me. What is disconcerting about the path it seems we are on \nis we are going to have this government-run health care system and if \nalready now people cannot go see their doctor if they are on Medicaid \nbecause doctors won't take Medicaid, and if it is growing more and more \nthe case that you cannot see a doctor if you are on Medicare--I have \nsome information here about 29 percent of beneficiaries surveyed saying \nthey are having a problem finding a doctor who will take Medicare.\n  There is a senior from Sanford, FL, Earl Bean, who was interviewed \nthis week and he said:\n\n       I called about 15 doctors and was told repeatedly that they \n     were not accepting Medicare patients. . . .\n\n  They wouldn't even take his name when he called. So what I am worried \nabout is we are going to enter into a system where 5 years from now, 10 \nyears from now when everybody in the country is basically on a \ngovernment-run health care program--Medicare, Medicaid, or this new \nprogram which unfortunately we all think will push the private insurers \nout of the business eventually and we all have government health care--\nis we will be going places, there will be 100 people waiting in the \nroom if we can get a doctor at all, they will be rationing the care, \nthey won't be providing mammograms such as this recommendation that \ncame out this week by the Government task force, for women in their \nforties to be discouraged from self-breast exams, and we will all have \nvery poor health care unless you are wealthy.\n  What is already happening now is that those folks who are wealthy--\nthere are doctors now who are not taking Medicaid, they are not taking \nMedicare, and they are not even taking insurance. So what concerns me--\nmaybe the Senator from Mississippi can comment on that--if we enter on \nthis path, we are going to a world where the majority, the vast \nmajority of Americans are going to have poor quality government-run \nhealth care and only the very rich will have access to good doctors and \nall the best quality of health care. That does not seem to me like an \nAmerica we want to live in.\n  Mr. WICKER. I think this constituent of mine, from Brandon, MS, said \nit very well in a recent e-mail I received. Obviously she is dependent \nupon home health care.\n\n       I support the goal of health care for all. However, that \n     goal should not come at the expense of frail, elderly and \n     disabled homebound Medicare beneficiaries receiving care in \n     their homes and communities. . .\n\n  She points out what this legislation would do to home health care.\n  Truly, this bill before us and the one from the House and the one \nfrom the two committees takes money from America's seniors to the tune \nof $\\1/2\\ trillion, and instead of shoring up the system that needs to \nbe enhanced and protected, it puts that money in the new government \nentitlement program we have exhibited here. I certainly believe we can \ndo better.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to interrupt my colleague from \nMississippi for a moment and ask him--or I think the Senator from Idaho \nhas some experience with this as well--we have been talking about $\\1/\n2\\ trillion in cuts to Medicare. But we have not even talked about the \nbiggest one yet. We have talked about cuts to Medicare Advantage, we \nhave talked about the cuts that will be ordered by this new Medicare \nCommission. But I guess I would ask my colleague from Idaho, isn't it \ntrue that the biggest dollar cuts to Medicare are going to come because \nwe are going to pay the doctors and the hospitals and the nurses a lot \nless money?\n  Of course, every one of my constituents who has talked to me about it \nsaid wait a minute, if you are going to pay them a lot less money--I am \nhaving a hard time finding a doctor who will take Medicare patients. \nIsn't that going to result in delay of care for me and denial of care, \nin effect rationing of care? There will not be enough doctors and \nnurses to take care of me because they are not being paid enough to \neven keep their doors open.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator is right. As a matter of fact, if I understand \nthe\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n\nlegislation correctly, it assumes the current projected cuts for \nphysicians are going to happen. That is how it says it is not going to \nincrease the deficit. You and I both know this Congress will not let \nthat happen.\n  But even today, 29 percent of Medicare beneficiaries looking for a \nprimary care doctor had a problem finding one because, both with regard \nto Medicaid and Medicare, because of the problems we have been \ndiscussing here, there are fewer and fewer providers who will take \npatients in those programs.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I was wondering if I could ask my \ncolleague, the leader from Arizona, a question because we are about at \nthe end of our time. My understanding is we are going to have a vote \ntomorrow at 8 o'clock. Again I am new here. I was hoping the Senator \ncould explain this for me. My understanding is we are going to vote \nwhether to proceed on this bill. It is not going to be this bill, it is \ngoing to be some kind of shell bill or something, which hopefully can \nbe cleared up for me. But I am told by folks who work with me that the \nCongressional Research Service has said when there is a vote to proceed \non a bill, that 97 percent of the time that bill passes. So it seems to \nme if we are voting tomorrow to proceed, that is really a vote on this \nbill.\n  Do I understand that correctly?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague from Florida that \nis exactly right. I was interested in that Congressional Research \nService report, a totally nonpartisan report, which essentially makes \nthe point if you vote to proceed to the bill, 97 percent of the time \nyou are voting to approve the bill because they end up passing. Those \nof our colleagues who say they have problems with this bill, serious \nproblems with the bill, are enablers if they vote to proceed to the \ndebate of this bill. They are enabling those who want to pass a bad \nbill to do so because that is exactly what will happen.\n  In order for them to try to fix the bill it would take 60 votes to \nget an amendment agreed to and that is a very tall order around here.\n  The second part of the question, yes, this may be a little confusing, \nbut what the majority leader has asked is that we vote on a cloture \nmotion to proceed to a House bill that has to do with bonuses for AIG \npeople. You say, What does that have to do with this? The answer is it \nhas nothing to do with this. The leader ordinarily would have taken the \nHouse bill, which is the bottom half of this stack here, would have \ntaken the House-passed health care bill and asked to proceed to that \nbill. If we then agree to proceed to that health care bill, he would \nthen substitute his own version, which is the second half of the stack \nhere, and then you would have a Senate version that we would begin to \namend or act on or at least debate.\n  I don't think the majority leader wants those on his side of the \naisle to have to vote on the House-passed health care bill. It doesn't \nappear to be very popular out in America. In fact, by about 2 to 1 the \nAmerican people say they don't want to have anything to do with that \nbill. So, instead, we are going to a shell bill that has nothing to do \nwith health care and then the leader will simply shift to his \nsubstitute health care bill. As my colleague from Florida knows, once \nyou vote to begin the debate on this bill, you have put in motion the \nprocess by which it could, and in 97 percent of the cases does, end up \ngetting passed into law.\n  For those colleagues who say I am not sure I like this bill but you \nknow I will move the process along by at least going to it, the time to \nstop it and to say let's fix it before is the time right now, not after \nyou get on the bill. It is too late.\n  Mr. WICKER. Will my colleague yield? This Reid substitute that will \nbe substituted for the shell bill contains taxpayer funding of \nabortions and it contains a government-run company to compete with the \nprivate sector. So Senators who vote to proceed on that bill, in my \nopinion, are playing with fire and very much risking that type of \nlegislation might come out of the closed room that will be the House-\nSenate conference.\n  Mr. KYL. The point is this: Unless they have a way to get 60 votes to \nget those provisions out they are in effect endorsing them by voting to \nproceed to the bill because they can't get them out. My colleague is \nexactly right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The time of the Republicans \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to support the majority \nleader and his motion for cloture to cut off debate to allow us to vote \non the motion to proceed which will allow us, then, to get the bill to \nthe floor so that we can debate and start amending this bill. I wish to \nuse the next several minutes to lay out a comprehensive reason of why \nthis Senator supports moving to take up this legislation.\n  I look forward to the amending process, and there will be vigorous \nattempts to amend it. I had offered a number of amendments in the \nFinance Committee. Most of those amendments were, in fact, adopted, but \nthere was one in particular that was not adopted on a vote of 13 to 3. \nIt would save the American taxpayers $109 billion by having the price \nof drugs that are sold to Medicare recipients under the Medicare Part D \nwho also are eligible for Medicaid but get their drugs under Medicare, \nit would cause those drugs to be sold at the same discounts that they \nget the drugs under Medicaid. There have been discounts for a couple \ndecades because of the bulk purchases of millions and millions. It is \nclose to 50 million people who get drugs under Medicaid. There are \nabout 43 million people who get their drugs under Medicare.\n  Let me correct that. There are 43 million people on Medicare. There \nis some number less than that who are now getting their drugs under \nMedicare Part D. But, in fact, they don't get the same discounts that \nthose very same people in Medicaid would get, even though they are \neligible for those discounts. Those people are called dual eligibles \nbecause they are eligible because they are poor to get it under \nMedicaid, but they are also over 65. Therefore, dual eligibles should \nbe able to get cheaper drugs. No, we can't do that. Because in the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit passed 6 years ago, those kinds of \ndiscounts were not allowed.\n  That is a huge additional cost to the taxpayers. The overall amount \nof Medicare drugs being sold, if you got those discounts, would be \nsomething in excess of saving the American taxpayer $200 to $250 \nbillion. For those who are dual eligible--they qualify for Medicaid but \nget their drugs under Medicare--the savings would be $109 billion.\n  This Senator is going to offer that amendment. It is a high threshold \nof 60 votes that we have to get but, indeed, we will see and on down \nthe line.\n  Why am I insisting on continuing to offer this? Well, it is \ninteresting that just recently an AARP study has come out, along with \nanother study called IMS. They have noted that the cost of drugs, brand \nname drugs, their wholesale prices have increased, in the year 2008, \n9.3 percent. Contrast that to the rate of inflation, which was about \nzero percent. So you see that the cost of drugs is continuing to go up. \nIt is time to give our people some relief.\n  We could do a lot with that extra $109 billion. First, we could lower \nthe deficit by $109 billion. So whereas this bill brought forth by the \nmajority leader saves the Treasury money over the 10-year period and \nreduces the deficit by $130 billion, we could add another $100 billion \nto that. We could be lowering the deficit $230 billion. But we could \ntake part of that money that we would save the taxpayers and use that \nto fill the doughnut hole.\n  That is the strange creature in statute that gives senior citizens \nunder Medicare some reasonable compensation for their drugs, up to a \ncertain level. That level is, generally, between about $2,500 and \n$4,500 of total drug purchases within a year. But once they get into \nthat zone, that doughnut hole, in fact, they get no assistance from \nMedicare. That is called the doughnut hole. We could help senior \ncitizens fill that doughnut hole so they are not bearing the full cost \nof those drugs when they get hit with huge drug expenses in a \nparticular year.\n  We will see what the will of the Senate is as we come out here and \nstart to vote.\n  The reason it is important, tomorrow night at 8, for us to get 60 \nvotes to shut off debate is so we can go to the motion to proceed to \nget this bill to the floor. The reason is we need a debate. We\n\n[[Page S11862]]\n\ncan't afford not to have a debate. In what is known as the world's most \ndeliberative body, that is what we do--debate and amend and try to \nperfect. Is anyone denying that health care, the cost of health care, \nthe availability of health care, the availability of health insurance, \nthe availability of health insurance at a reasonable price, is anybody \ndisagreeing that is not a problem? Our people are hurting.\n  One of the main purposes of bringing this legislation out here and \ntrying to find a reasonable solution is to make health insurance and \nhealth care available and affordable.\n  For example, what about if you have a preexisting condition. You \ncan't get health insurance. We are going to change that in this \nlegislation.\n  What about if you are sick and your insurance company suddenly comes \nand says: We are going to take away your insurance, we are going to \ncancel your health insurance. Is that a good outcome? There is nobody \nin America who thinks that is a good outcome. That is what we are \ntrying to change. By the way, that is what the bill proposed by the \nmajority leader will, in fact, do.\n  What about all those 46 million people who don't have health \ninsurance? First of all, a lot of those folks do get health care, but \nwhere do they get it? They get it at the most expensive place at the \nmost expensive time. They go to the emergency room, after what could \nhave been very possibly prevented becomes an emergency. So it is at the \nmost expensive place at the most expensive time. By the way, guess who \npays. Do you think all those costs suddenly evaporate in the ether? No. \nThey are costs in a hospital that are ultimately borne by all the \npeople who support the health insurance system; that is, those who have \nhealth insurance policies and pay premiums. It is no small amount that \nwe pay. As a matter of fact, nationwide, the additional cost to a \nfamily health insurance policy to take care of uninsured people is \nbetween $900 and $1,000 per year extra. It is a hidden tax on all the \nrest of the people who are paying their health insurance premiums.\n  In my State of Florida, it is even higher. It is estimated to be \n$1,400 per family policy per year, a hidden tax. That is a hidden tax \nthat will disappear, if we can bring in those 46 million people \nnationally who are uninsured, 4 million of whom are in Florida, if we \ncan bring them into the system. Will we bring them into the system? The \nbill the majority leader has put on the table will cover 98 percent of \nall Americans with health insurance. That is the entire spectrum of \nAmericans who receive health care. Is that worthwhile doing? I \ncertainly think it is.\n  I said at the outset this bill also tries to approach this in a \nresponsible financial way. The actual cost of the bill is about $848 \nbillion over 10 years. But that $848 billion is more than paid for \nbecause, at the end of that 10 years, there is an additional $130 \nbillion that is left over. That is surplus that will go directly to \nlower the deficit. The projection by the Congressional Budget Office \nfor the second 10-year period is at least a $650 billion reduction of \nthe budget deficit in that 10-year period and possibly as high as $1 \ntrillion in lowering the deficit.\n  What does that tell us? What it tells us is that one of the reasons \nwe need a bill coming out on the floor is that not only do our \nindividual Americans have difficulty paying for the cost of health \ncare, the U.S. Government is having difficulty paying for the cost \nexplosion of Medicare.\n  Unless we start getting those costs under control, then, in fact, we \nare going to be in an unsustainable proposition with Medicare. A system \nof revising health delivery capabilities so people are not being \ncanceled, no preexisting conditions, people can get health insurance at \naffordable rates but at the same time starts lowering the overall cost \nto not only individuals but to the U.S. Government, it seems to me that \nis desirable.\n  So you will hear and we have just heard comments about how Medicare \nis going to be cut. Well, there are clearly inefficiencies in Medicare \nthat need to be wrung out. Let me give you an example. Right now, we \nhave what is known as Medicare fee for service. It basically pays the \ndoctor's bill that is submitted for the person who is eligible for \nMedicare. But what happens is, the Medicare patient goes to this \nspecialist, that specialist, that specialist, and all of them are not \ntalking to each other. This one orders this particular set of tests, \nand that one, because he does not know what the other one is doing, is \nordering the same test, but Medicare is getting all of the same bills. \nThis bill, in reforming health care delivery, is going to try to get at \nthat. It is going to set up accountable care organizations. It is going \nto set up electronic records so there is no more of this shifting \naround and, oh, I didn't get the report. It is going to be there \navailable immediately. These are obvious technology increases we have \nto do. That is Medicare fee for service.\n  How about a program called Medicare Advantage? Let me tell you what \nMedicare Advantage is. Medicare Advantage is a fancy word for a \nMedicare HMO. Do you know what an HMO is? An HMO is an insurance \ncompany. It was originally designed in the late 1990s that you could \ndeliver health care cheaper to senior citizens in Medicare through an \nHMO. So when it was first set up, Medicare HMOs were given 95 percent \nof fee for service because they were going to save costs. They were \ngoing to save costs to the individual, they were going to save costs to \nthe government--95 percent.\n  But, lo and behold, in 2003, in the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, it not only set up what I described a while ago as this \nunusual doughnut hole and drugs that cannot be discounted to the \nFederal Government when it is buying drugs in bulk for millions of \nMedicare recipients, it also set up that we are going to give a cushy \narrangement to insurance companies where insurance companies that want \nto sign up Medicare recipients are going to get 14 percent more per \npatient--114 percent instead of 100 percent of Medicare fee for \nservice. Is it any wonder costs are exploding in Medicare if suddenly a \nprogram gets 14 percent more per patient than what the standard \nbaseline ought to be, which is Medicare fee for service? It does not \ntake a rocket scientist to figure that out.\n  Because insurance companies--Medicare HMOs; the fancy name is \n``Medicare Advantage''--because they get more, 14 percent more, then \nthey can offer additional things to the senior citizens, and this has \nproved to be quite popular. Basically, 30 percent of all Medicare \nrecipients in my State of Florida have signed up for Medicare \nAdvantage. Indeed, the biggest thing they have that is desirable--you \nhear about eyeglasses and hearing assistance and so forth, but the \nbiggest thing that is the most popular is that because the insurance \ncompany is getting paid so much more per person, it can then use part \nof that money to pay the copays on Medicare, such as Medicare hospital \ninsurance, Part A and part B, as well as Part D, the drugs. So it is \nvery popular.\n  So what I said in the Finance Committee is--obviously, we ought to \nreform the system. And I can tell you, this Senator did not vote for it \n6 years ago, which set up this system, which was a cushy system for \ninsurance companies as well as the drug companies. But the fact is, we \nhave not.\n  So this Senator said, in the Finance Committee: All right, what I \nwant to do is I want to grandfather the people who have it in Florida \nso that, on a going-forward basis, when this takes effect--in this \nbill, it takes effect in 2013--when it takes effect, it is only those \nnew people signing up who will operate under the new system that will \nmake it more streamlined but that those who have the existing benefits \nfrom Medicare Advantage will not be cut. I offered that amendment along \nwith other Senators in the Senate Finance Committee, and that amendment \nwas adopted.\n  So the statements that have been made on this floor about Florida \nMedicare Advantage recipients being cut in Florida is not accurate on \nthis bill. I fought for that. Everybody knew I fought for that. And of \nthe 949,000 Medicare Advantage recipients in Florida, at least 800,000 \nare operative under the formula we put in and the remaining 149,000 \nvirtually would not be affected anyway. I cannot speak for the other \nStates, but I can sure speak for Florida. That is in this bill. Those \nother Senators who offered the amendment with me in the Finance \nCommittee had things that tended to their\n\n[[Page S11863]]\n\nStates, as well, that were part of that amendment. But that is what the \nsituation is with regard to this legislation.\n  Let me say that if we can get this legislation out of the Senate and \nget it to a conference committee with the House, the House has a whole \ndifferent approach. The House works on streamlining Medicare Advantage \nfrom the basis of not something known as competitive bid, which is in \nthe Senate bill, but what is known as fee for service, as the target \nbenchmark. That does not have the Draconian cuts, in my opinion, to \nmany of our Medicare Advantage recipients.\n  But I want the record clear here that with regard to Florida, Florida \nMedicare Advantage people have been grandfathered in of those who are \nin existence and those who still will be in existence having signed up \nfor Medicare Advantage until the date at which the new system would \nstart.\n  I see we have changed Presiding Officers, and it is such a pleasure \nto have the esteemed Senator from Minnesota in the chair. Madam \nPresident, there is room for improvement. We spent 2 full weeks in the \nSenate Finance Committee on amending this legislation. We had spent 3 \nmonths prior to that discussing it. You can imagine, in a nation as \ndiverse and complicated as ours and a health care industry where \neverybody and his brother and sister have their fingers in the pie, how \ncomplicated this is. But that is the reason for the amendatory process: \nto improve, to perfect.\n  I want to wind up my remarks by giving a picture of the totality. We \nhave had so much of the debate, ever since summer, dominate on the \nconcept of a public plan. Many organizations have now come out and said \nthat a public plan, at max, is going to affect 4 million or 6 million \npeople. If it affects 6 million people who sign up for a public plan--\nif there is one in existence. And, of course, the majority leader has \nin here not one that is mandatory. He has it as an option where a State \ncan withdraw from having a public plan. But if the max of 6 million \npeople signed up on a public plan, that is 2 percent of the entire \ncountry. Yet you would think that was the only thing when you listen to \nthe arguments--and sometimes we watched fights in these townhall \nmeetings back in the summer--you would think that was the only thing \nthis whole health care reform was about. In the max, it is going to \naffect 2 percent.\n  Why is that? Why is it that it only affects 2 percent? Well, look at \nthe whole population to whom we want to give health care delivery.\n  Take my State of Florida. Approximately--and I am rounding these \nnumbers--approximately 50 percent of our people in Florida get their \nhealth insurance from their employer and they are in a group policy. \nAnother 16 percent in my State get their health care from Medicare \nbecause they are eligible at their age. Another 10 percent in my State \nget their health care from Medicaid because they are either qualified \nunder the income level or they are disabled. Now add that up. That is \n76 percent right there of all the people of Florida. That includes \nchildren. OK. What about the remaining 24 percent? About 4 or 5 percent \nof our people also have health insurance but they pay through the nose \nbecause they are buying it as individuals as opposed to a group policy. \nIf you are buying it individually, where all the health risk is on one \nlife, the cost of those premiums is very high. The remaining 19 percent \nare the uninsured. That is as to the population of my State of Florida. \nThat will vary with different States. Obviously, in Florida we have \nmore people aged 65 and older and therefore eligible for Medicare than \nmost States.\n  But you can see now that what we are going to do is, over here for \nthis remaining 24 percent, we are going to set up a health insurance \nexchange. In the case of Florida, it is going to have potentially 4 \nmillion people in it. It is going to be the uninsured who are now going \nto have access to health insurance with no preconditions, and they \ncannot cancel their policies, and it is affordable. It is also going to \nbe available to those people who, in fact, have policies they cannot \nafford, usually the individual policies. There will be some small \nbusiness employers--for example, those with 50 employees or fewer--who \nwill not be offering health insurance, and their employees will, for \nthe first time, be able to go to the health insurance exchange and be \nable to get health insurance.\n  All right. The competition in that health insurance exchange is going \nto have a public plan, if a State approves. That is why it comes down \nto such a small percentage. That is why an issue has dominated the \ndebate but is not the main issue. The main issue of this legislation is \nto provide health insurance and health care to our people that is \navailable and affordable.\n\n  I will close with this: We have all heard these stories because \npeople have been coming to us in our townhall meetings, on the phone, \nin the airport, back during the parades, at the meetings, and they have \nbeen telling us these very tragic stories: the woman who is in the \nmiddle of chemotherapy and suddenly gets a cancellation notice from her \nhealth insurance company; the person who desperately needs health \ninsurance and can't get it and who has had it for some period of time; \nthe person who is hanging on for dear life to that job because that job \nthey have is not only their means of financial remuneration but is also \ntheir ticket to having health insurance.\n  These are the tragic stories we want to change. We want to make \npeople's lives better. We have to start somewhere. That point of \nstarting is going to be at 8 o'clock tomorrow night, Saturday night, \nbecause the Senators are going to parade on this floor and indicate yea \nor nay on whether we are going to shut off the filibuster in order to \nget to the motion to proceed which will then allow us to get to the \nbill after Thanksgiving.\n  It is absolutely essential for the sake of our people that we bring \nthis legislation to the floor and that ultimately we get a product we \ncan pass and get it on to a conference with the House and have an \nagreement that the President can then sign into law.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the \ntopic that is on the mind of each and every Senator today: health care \nreform. First off, I wish to congratulate our majority leader, Senator \nReid. He has accomplished something that has not been done in years. He \nhas the Senate on the precipice of debating a major health reform bill \non the Senate floor.\n  I agree with the Senator from Florida. Tomorrow night at 8 o'clock we \nshould come to the floor and we should move this bill. It is essential \nthat we pass health care reform this year. The present system lets down \nall Americans and we need a new, reformed health care system. We should \nmove this bill and then we can debate, we can amend, as the Senator \nfrom Florida said, and we can deal with this bill then. But it is \nessential that we move this bill.\n  Senator Reid has melded the good work of the Finance Committee and \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee into one bill that \nwe stand ready to bring to the Senate floor. If people don't \nacknowledge that accomplishment, they are forgetting history. For all \nthe efforts to reform our health care system back in 1994, the Senate \nnever came close to bringing a bill to the floor to debate. Because of \nthe searing experience the Congress went through back then, it took \nanother 15 years to pass before Congress attempted another major reform \nof our present dysfunctional health care system.\n  I believe if we don't get it done this year, it might take another 15 \nyears or more before we will bring it up again, and Lord only knows \nwhat will happen to the health care system in this country in the \ninterim. But thanks to Senator Reid and Chairmen Baucus, Dodd, and \nHarkin, as well as the tremendous efforts of their members, the \ncommittee staffs, all the long hours, weekends in the office and time \nspent away from their families, we stand here this afternoon literally \na day away from the first procedural vote on the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. Make no mistake. We cannot afford to wait another \nday to fix our health care system.\n  We need to pass health care reform because the trajectory of our \nnational health care expenditures is out of control. In 1979 we spent \napproximately $220 billion as a nation on health care--\n\n[[Page S11864]]\n\n$220 billion. By 1992 we spent close to $850 billion. And in 2009 we \nwill spend $2.5 trillion on health care--from $220 billion in 1979 to \n$2.5 trillion in 2009. The trajectory clearly is absolutely \nunsustainable.\n  We need to pass health care reform because premium costs for middle-\nclass Americans are rising at an astronomical rate. Take my home State \nof Delaware, for example. In 2000, the average premium for family \nhealth coverage was just over $7,500. In 2008, that number had jumped \nto $14,900, almost doubling in just 8 years. If we do nothing and allow \nthe current health care system to continue, the same premium for family \ncoverage is expected to reach $29,000 in 2016, another doubling of the \nprice. Think about it. Every 8 years, our premiums doubling in size. \nThat is simply unaffordable.\n  We need to pass health care reform because failure to do so will \ndrive more and more Americans into bankruptcy. Today, bankruptcies \ninvolving medical bills account for more than 60 percent of U.S. \npersonal bankruptcies, a rate 1\\1/2\\ times that of just 6 years ago. \nKeep in mind, keep in mind, 75 percent of families entering bankruptcy \nbecause of health care costs actually have health insurance. To repeat: \nMore than two-thirds of all bankruptcies due to medical expenses are of \nAmericans who have health care insurance. That number is simply \nappalling.\n  We need to pass health care reform because small business owners and \ntheir employees are desperate for relief from the cost of health \ninsurance. Right now small business owners and their employees pay much \nhigher premiums than their counterparts in large corporations. In fact, \nduring the past 5 years, one in five small businesses reported premium \nincreases of 20 percent annually. Add that up and that is 100 percent \nover 5 years. Imagine paying a 100-percent increase.\n  Largely because of the increase in premium rates, fewer and fewer \nsmall businesses offer coverage to their employees. For example, in \n2000, 68 percent of small businesses were able to offer health \ninsurance coverage to their employees. By 2007, just 59 percent of \nsmall businesses offered health benefits. That is a reduction from 68 \npercent to 59 percent in just 7 years.\n  Small businesses are the engine of our economy and will be the \ncatalyst to get us out of this recession. It is time to make it easier \nfor small business owners to provide health insurance for their \nemployees so they can retain the workers they have and hire more to \nhelp lift us out of this economic distress.\n  We need to pass health care reform because failure to do so could \nbankrupt the country. Just look at Medicare and Medicaid. One of the \nbiggest driving forces--in fact, the biggest driving force--behind our \nFederal deficit is the skyrocketing cost of Medicare as well as \nMedicaid. In 1966, Medicare and Medicaid accounted for only 1 percent \nof all government expenditures. They now account for 20 percent. If we \ndo nothing to start bending the cost curve down for health care costs \nfor Medicare and Medicaid, we will eventually spend more on these two \nprograms than all other Federal programs combined.\n  I am pleased the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act begins to \ntackle these problems and begins to reform our health care system. It \nis passed time.\n  This bill is fiscally responsible. Anyone who is concerned about our \nbudget deficits should embrace this bill. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the bill will reduce deficits by an \nestimated $130 billion over the first 10 years from 2010 to 2019, and \nby more than one-quarter percent of GDP in the decade after. This \namounts to about $55 billion in 2020 and several hundred billion \ndollars over the next 9 years. This is not chump change. This is real, \neffective deficit reduction that will help our economy over the next 10 \nto 20 years.\n  In addition to reducing the deficit, the bill strengthens the \nMedicare Program. Contrary to claims of the bill's critics that we hear \non the Senate floor, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nadds coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. It doesn't cut a single \nservice. Let me repeat: It doesn't cut a single service.\n  For instance, the bill provides seniors with three annual wellness \nvisits under Medicare where they can develop personalized prevention \nplans with their doctors to address their health conditions and other \nrisk factors for disease, making the conditions easier and less costly \nto treat. The bill also eliminates out-of-pocket costs for recommended \npreventive care and screenings such as mammograms. In terms of \nrestrictions on drug coverage, the bill helps seniors manage the cost \nof the doughnut hole in Medicare Part D coverage by giving a 50-percent \ndiscount on brand-name drugs and biologics to low- and middle-income \nseniors.\n\n  Most importantly, the act helps ensure the sustainability of the \nMedicare Program for years to come. In the past year, Medicare spending \nhas increased by roughly 8 percent a year. According to the CBO, under \nthis bill, the annual growth rate for Medicare dropped substantially to \n6 percent for the next several decades. Adjusted for inflation, CBO \nestimates that Medicare spending per beneficiary under this bill will \nincrease the annual average rate of growth of roughly 2 percent during \nthe next two decades, much less than the roughly 4 percent annual \ngrowth rate of the past 20 years.\n  Right now, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to \nbecome insolvent in 2017. But with the measures to strengthen the \nMedicare Program contained in this bill, the date of insolvency of the \ntrust fund is put back by at least 4 to 5 years. Simply put, this bill \nis good for seniors and Medicare and good for the Federal budget.\n  As I mentioned earlier, small business owners struggle to provide \ntheir employees with affordable health insurance. This bill will help \nsmall business in this quest. The bill will provide a sliding scale tax \ncredit based on the number of employees and annual average wages of \nthese employees to help these small employers pay for health insurance \nfor their employees. This tax credit is estimated to reach more than \n3.6 million small businesses nationwide. In addition, small businesses \nwill be able to purchase insurance through the new State-based \nexchanges. These exchanges would allow small businesses to expand their \nrisk pool and thereby lower premiums. The bill is a win for small \nbusiness.\n  The bill helps protect middle-class Americans against the worst \nabuses of the insurance industry. No longer will Americans be denied \ncoverage because of preexisting conditions. Let me repeat that: No \nlonger, if we pass this bill, will Americans be denied coverage because \nof preexisting conditions. No longer will insurers be able to rescind \npeople's coverage once they get sick and they actually need the \ninsurance they have been paying premiums on. No longer will insurers be \nable to charge people more based on their health status or gender.\n  The bill helps protect the finances of middle-class Americans and \nhelps reduce the number of medical-related bankruptcies by placing a \ncap on what insurance companies can require families to pay out of \npocket. It also restricts the use of annual limits and prohibits the \nlifetime limits on insurance benefits, which is especially important \nfor Americans with high-cost conditions to treat. It creates a health \ninsurance exchange that provides a public insurance option to compete \nwith private insurers to provide consumers with more choice.\n  This will make a great difference in States where one or two \ninsurance providers dominate the marketplace and where there is no true \ncompetition.\n  These are good, strong provisions that will help provide health \nsecurity and stability to all Americans.\n  The bill is strong in two other areas as well: promoting prevention \nand wellness and cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse. On the \nprevention front, the bill recognizes that we have to move away from a \nsystem that encourages people to wait until they are sick to seek \ntreatment. Instead, it encourages prevention and early treatment of \ndiseases which can help lower the cost of treating patients.\n  The bill recognizes the need to shift this emphasis by eliminating \nany copayments or deductibles for recommended preventive care and \nscreenings, such as cancer screenings, colonoscopies, and mammograms. \nThe bill would allow employers to offer premium discounts and other \nawards for up to 30 percent of the total premium\n\n[[Page S11865]]\n\nfor individuals who quit smoking, lose weight, lower their cholesterol \nor blood pressure, or take other steps to improve their health status.\n  We have already seen how successful this type of program can work at \ncompanies such as Safeway. All of these measures will help increase the \nuse of preventive measures and reduce the need of costly new treatments \nas a result of waiting too long to treat a condition or disease.\n  Finally, I wish to highlight the measures contained to reduce the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse that exist in our current system. Each year, \nhealth care fraud drains between $72 billion and $220 billion from \ndoctors, patients, private insurers, and State and Federal Government. \nLeft unchecked, fraud drives up the cost of care while reducing public \ntrust in our health care system. I am pleased this bill will increase \nthe funding for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Fund to fight \nfraud in public programs. In fact, CBO estimates that every $1 invested \nto fight fraud results in approximately $1.75 in savings.\n  In fact, CBO estimates that every $1 invested to fight fraud results \nin approximately $1.75 savings.\n  The bill will also establish new penalties for submitting false data \non applications, false claims for payment, or for obstructing audit \ninvestigations related to Medicare, Medicaid and the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program.\n  By reducing the amount of waste, fraud and abuse tolerated in the \nhealth care system, we will be able to bring health care costs down for \neveryone.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill.\n  I have only touched on parts of the bill, as time does not allow me \nto discuss every provision--including the fact that the bill will \nextend insurance coverage for an additional 31 million Americans.\n  But it is a good bill. It is fully paid for. It reduces short and \nlong term deficits. It strengthens the Medicare program. It provides \nsecurity and stability for the middle class. It provides Americans with \ngreater insurance choices. It promotes prevention and wellness. It \ncracks down on waste, fraud and abuse. I applaud the hard work that \nwent into the drafting of this bill.\n  As I have said many times, it is time to gather our collective will \nand do the right thing during this historic opportunity by passing \nhealth care reform.\n  We can't afford to wait another 15 years. We need to act now. We can \ndo no less.\n  The American people deserve no less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kohl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am going to focus for the next 10 \nminutes on the issue of costs. I know many people are focused on \nimportant issues like the fact that this bill will finally eliminate \nthe limitations on preexisting conditions, so if your kid gets sick, \nyou don't have to lose your health care; and the fact that people will \nbe able to keep their kids on their health care until they are 26. \nThese are very important parts of the bill. It is very important to \npeople of my State.\n  The other facet that is very important to people in my State is \nsomething I heard about all over the last few months: the issue of more \naffordable health care. This is why: At $2.4 trillion per year, health \ncare spending represents close to 17 percent of the American economy. \nIt will exceed 20 percent by 2018 if the current trend continues.\n  Hospitals and clinics are providing an estimated $56 billion in \nuncompensated care. In fact, today, Peter Orszag, the Budget Director \nfor the President, wrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post that \nhighlights the fiscal importance of passing health care reform. One of \nthe things he said is, looking forward, if we do nothing to slow the \nskyrocketing costs of health care, the Federal Government will \neventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than all other \ngovernment programs combined. He notes that it is time to move toward \nthe high-quality, lower cost health care system of the future.\n  As you know, Mr. President, coming from Wisconsin, we know how to \ndeliver high-quality, highly efficient care. They do it in Wisconsin \nand in Minnesota. They also do it in Washington State. A number of \nStates have figured out how to do this. Those are the models we need to \nsee all across the country. We need to make health care affordable for \neverybody, and we need to reduce the waste and fraud that plagues the \ncurrent system in this country.\n  In 2008, employer health insurance premiums increased by 5 percent, \ntwo times the rate of inflation, and the annual premium for an employer \nhealth plan covering a family of four averaged nearly $12,000.\n  In fact, I tell people around me that they have to know 3 numbers: 6, \n12, and 24. Ten years ago, the average family was paying $6,000 for \ntheir health care premiums. Now it is $12,000. That is average. A lot \nof small companies in Minnesota--the owners of companies are paying \nmore than that. But right now the average nationally is $12,000. If we \ndo nothing to bend the cost curve, the average family will be paying, \non an annual basis, $24,000 for their health care 10 years from now.\n  Meanwhile, a new study found that small businesses pay up to 18 \npercent more to provide health insurance for their employees. We are \ntalking about a backpack company up in Two Harbors, MN. A guy started \nthat small company, and it is now up to 15 employees. He has a family \nof four and is paying $24,000--in Two Harbors, MN--for his family to \nmake sure they have health insurance. He said if he knew it would have \ncost that much, he might not have started that company. Now they are \nproviding beautiful, great backpacks for our troops who are serving \nus--high-quality backpacks. Those backpacks wouldn't have existed if he \nknew what was happening. Those jobs would not have existed. He could be \nworking at a big company and paying less. But he was an entrepreneur, \nand we should reward that.\n  The American people know inaction is not an option. If we don't act, \ncosts will continue to skyrocket, and 14,000 Americans will continue to \nlose their health insurance every single day. We must keep what works \nand fix what is broken.\n  Let me tell you about some good news. It is encouraging news that the \nSenate will start considering the bill that will reduce the Federal \ndeficit by $127 billion in 10 years. If we go out 20 years, it is a \n$650 billion reduction in the deficit. That is good news. We achieve \nthese long-term savings by making our health care system more \nefficient, rewarding quality, and improving patient outcomes, and \nreducing administrative spending and waste.\n  Most health care is purchased on a fee-for-service basis. So more \ntests and more surgery mean more money--quantity not quality pays.\n  According to researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, nearly $700 \nbillion per year is wasted on unnecessary or ineffective health care. \nThat is 30 percent of total health care spending. One study showed if \nthe hospitals in some of these inefficient areas would follow the high-\nquality protocol the Mayo Clinic uses--and a lot of people would like \nto have that kind of health care--we would save $50 billion in taxpayer \nmoney every 5 years for chronically ill patients--$50 billion. That is \njust one example for one set of patients.\n  That is what we do in Minnesota. We want that same kind of health \ncare, the same kind of high-quality care, the incentives on the Federal \nlevel that aren't there now, and that is what we are seeing in this \nreform package.\n  I am pleased the ``value index'' I proposed, which was cosponsored by \nSenator Cantwell of Washington and Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, was \nincluded in the Senate bill. This indexing will help reduce unnecessary \nprocedures because those who produce more volume will need to also \nimprove care or the increased volume will negatively impact their fees. \nDoctors will have a financial incentive to maximize the value and \nquality of their service instead of the quantity. This is supported by \ndoctors in my State.\n  Linking rewards to the outcomes for the entire payment area creates \nan incentive for doctors and hospitals to work together to improve \nquality and\n\n[[Page S11866]]\n\nefficiency. In too many places patients struggle against a fragmented \ndelivery system, running all over with x rays in the back of the car, \nseeing specialists, and not having someone in charge, or a quarterback \nrunning the team, having 20 wide receivers running this way and that \nway. That is why we need the integrated care that is rewarded in the \nbill--bundling of services. What you pay for is the result, the \ncombination of services that gives you good results. That is what \nbundling is about.\n  There is another good thing about the bill. In 1 year, hospital \nreadmissions cost Medicare $17.4 billion. A study found that Medicare \npaid an average of $7,200 per readmission that was likely preventable. \nWho wants to go back in the hospital if you don't need to? One of the \nproblems, if we don't have quality indexes in place--my State has one \nof the lowest hospital readmission rates in the country. If we don't \nhave that index in place, we are rewarding bad practice. We want to \nreward high quality and put the patient in the driver's seat. That is \nwhat we do with the provisions in the bill.\n  I am encouraged the Senate bill includes a provision that calls for \nreduced payments to hospitals if they have preventable readmissions.\n  In this bill, we also work to better reward integrated health care \nsystems. At places such as Mayo Clinic or Health Partners in Duluth, a \npatient's overall care is managed by a primary care doctor in \ncoordination with specialists, nurses, and other care providers, as \nneeded--one-stop shopping.\n  In our rural communities, critical access hospitals utilize this \nmodel and provide quality health care for residents in their \ncommunities with a team of providers.\n  To better reward and encourage collaboration, we encourage the \ncreation of accountable care organizations. This is what I hear from \nthe people in my State and across the country: We want more \naccountability in this health care system.\n  Do you know what else accountability means? It means better \nenforcement of Medicare fraud. When the dollars are so tight and people \nare having so much trouble affording health care, why do we want to \nwaste $60 billion a year on fraud? Think what that money could be spent \nfor to make it easier to go to the hospital or doctor instead of $60 \nbillion wasted on fraud.\n  This bill and some of the amendments we are going to propose in the \nnext month will bring us much closer to reducing that fraud, bringing \nthat fraud down, and will hold the perpetrators accountable, including \ncriminal penalties--that is important--making sure we have direct \ndeposit, a bill that Senator Snowe and I have, so nobody can make out \nfalse checks and try to get the money that way; giving our law \nenforcement officers more tools to go after Medicare fraud. We can save \n$60 billion a year.\n  In today's Washington Post, Peter Orszag writes:\n\n       As we enter the homestretch, the greatest risk we run is \n     not completing health reform and letting this chance to lay a \n     new foundation for our economy and our country pass us by.\n\n  I argue one of the most important things we can do--and I know \neverybody is focusing on who pays and what the provision means--is to \nchange the delivery system in this country, reward that kind of high-\nquality, highly efficient care, so that our big companies are able to \ncompete with companies in other countries that have more highly \nefficient delivery systems so our small companies are able to exist and \nmultiply and keep their employees on health care, so that individuals \nin this country aren't cut off just because their child gets sick. That \nis what this reform is about. Thank you. I look forward to the vote \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the whole point of health care reform is to \nbring down costs and to make health care more affordable for American \nfamilies. So why have Democratic leaders produced a health care bill \nloaded with provisions that will increase premiums?\n  Independent studies from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nand the Joint Committee on Taxation and even a study by the chief \nactuary at the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed this: \nthat the Democrats' plan will drive up premiums and overall health care \nspending faster than in the absence of these so-called reforms.\n  How is this so? Let me mention five specific ways.\n  First, new insurance mandates and new taxes on the insurance \nindustry. New insurance requirements and new taxes on the insurance \nindustry will force premiums to rise for many Americans, particularly \nthe young and healthy. According to an independent analysis that \nstudied the effect of the new insurance reforms and new taxes on the \ninsurance industry, insurance premiums in my home State of Arizona \ncould skyrocket by as much as $2,619 for individuals and $7,426 for \nfamilies.\n  Think of that, an increase of $7,426 for families in my State. That \nis outrageous.\n  What can $7,426 buy an Arizona family? A lot of things. It could pay \nfor a year's tuition at the University of Arizona. It could pay for a \nyear and a half of groceries or nearly 2 years of utility bills or it \ncould pay for 2 years' worth of gasoline. Families have a lot of \nexpenses and a lot of ways to spend $7,426. They don't need the Federal \nGovernment intruding on them and dictating that money has to go \nsomewhere else.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle will say they could \nprovide subsidies. In fact, the legislation will provide subsidies to \nhelp with this increased cost. But not every family will qualify, and \nthe subsidies may not even cover the total cost of the increase.\n  Moreover, what is the point of raising the cost of health insurance \nand then subsidizing a portion of the increase? You are still raising \npremiums. It is nonsensical to have a health care reform that makes \nfamilies worse off and then gives them a government subsidy to help \nmake up for part of the cost.\n  Second, new mandated benefits will increase costs. Under the Reid \nbill, the government will require insurers to cover a broad range of \nnew medical benefits determined by Washington, regardless of whether \nthose benefits are actually needed by each individual patient.\n  These additional benefits might help some patients, of course, but \nthe government cannot provide them to everyone for free. So the cost \nwill be shared by everyone in the insurance pool, and that means \nincreased premiums for many Americans.\n  In fact, the Council for Affordable Health Insurance estimates the \nnew mandated benefits would increase the cost of basic health coverage \nbetween 20 and 50 percent. That is the second way insurance premiums \nare increased.\n  Here is the third way: limits on plan types. Under this Reid bill, \ninsurers are limited to offering a total of only four specific kinds of \ninsurance plans. So the low-cost, high-deductible plans that currently \nfamilies and individuals enjoy will be virtually eliminated. They will \nhave to buy more expensive plans, again paying more in premiums. \nWhatever happened to getting to keep what you have? Just as one size do \nnot fit all, in this case, four sizes do not fit all either.\n  Here is the fourth way premiums increase: New taxes are imposed on \ngroups such as medical device makers. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, a new tax on medical \ndevices will increase premiums and increase the price of everything \nfrom wheelchairs to diabetes testing supplies, to pacemakers, and it \nwill be paid entirely by the patients.\n  Its cost, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation? It is $19.3 \nbillion over 10 years. This tax will hit cutting-edge technology such \nas CT scanners, replacement joints, and the arterial stents that \ndoctors use during angioplasty. This tax will clearly stifle \ninnovation.\n  As the Wall Street Journal editorialized:\n\n       This new tax will eventually be passed through to patients, \n     increasing healthcare costs. It will also harm innovation, \n     taking a big bite out of the research and development that \n     leads to medical advancements.\n\n  The fifth way in which this legislation will increase costs for the \ninsured is it actually taxes the insurance plans themselves for the \nfirst time. You buy insurance, you get taxed. The Reid bill, for the \nfirst time, directly accomplishes this. As the independent Joint \nCommittee on Taxation told us, this new tax will increase the cost of \nhealth\n\n[[Page S11867]]\n\ninsurance for everyone, since insurers will pass the costs along to \ntheir patients.\n  This tax alone could raise some Americans' premiums by $487 per year. \nBecause this tax is indexed to regular inflation rather than to health \ncare inflation, just as with the alternative minimum tax, it could soon \nstart hitting middle-income families.\n  According to former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas \nHoltz-Eakin, half of all families making less than $100,000 per year \ncould end up paying this tax.\n  Those are five specific ways in which this bill will increase your \ncosts, increase the premiums you pay for health insurance once this \nbill is in effect. We believe there are better ideas. Republicans have \nproposed a variety of solutions to target specific problems and, in \nparticular, the problem of cost.\n  I, specifically, want to conclude by mentioning the Republican health \ncare alternative in the House of Representatives. The majority voted it \ndown, but the truth is, it would, in fact, lower premiums for \nindividuals, families, and small businesses. Contrast the House-passed \nbill which increases premiums, the Reid bill which increases premiums, \nbut the Republican House bill which would actually decrease premiums \nand you will see Republicans in the Senate proposing similar ideas.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, under the Republican \nplan, premiums would be $5,000 lower than the cheapest plan under the \nPelosi bill.\n  Small businesses, too, would see their premiums decrease by as much \nas 10 percent, again according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Those in the small group market would also see a 10-percent decrease \nunder the House Republican bill, again according to the nonpartisan \nCBO.\n  The House Republican bill included such reforms as allowing States to \nsell policies across State lines. You have heard a lot of Senators on \nthe Republican side talk about that point. That would have enabled \n1,000 companies to compete nationally, and that helps to drive down the \ncosts. Medical liability reform, a proven way to cut costs. My State of \nArizona, Texas, and Missouri have all seen premiums go down because of \nmedical malpractice reform. Health savings accounts, which put patients \nin charge of their own health care by allowing them to save their \nhealth care dollars to spend as they choose, this, too, would have been \nstrengthened by the House bill, and you heard Republican Senators talk \nabout that as a reform. There are many other ideas we have. We will be \ntalking more about those ideas as we go forward.\n  I wish to conclude my remarks about the Reid bill, loaded with \nprovisions that increase insurance premiums, and to make the point that \nsince, as I said at the beginning, the whole point of the exercise is \nto reduce health care premiums, the last thing we should be doing is \nadopting the provisions in the Reid bill, which will actually increase \nhealth care premiums.\n  Let's keep in mind that health care reform is all about making things \nbetter for Americans, and this bill does not meet that test by a long \nshot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the health care bill \nthat the Senate will begin voting on tomorrow evening. Let me begin by \nmaking clear that I believe our health care system needs fundamental \nreform.\n  One of my top priorities as a Senator has been to work to expand \naccess to affordable health care. The fact is, however, that the \ngreatest barrier to health care coverage today is the exploding cost. \nMonthly health insurance premiums in Maine have risen at an alarming \nrate. They now often exceed a family's mortgage payment. Whether I am \ntalking to a self-employed fisherman, a displaced mill worker, the \nowner of a struggling small business, or the human resource manager of \na large company, the soaring cost of health insurance is a vital \nconcern.\n  Much of the health care reform debate so far in this Congress has \ncentered around the need to expand coverage to the uninsured, a goal I \nembrace. The fact is, however, it will be difficult to achieve our goal \nof universal coverage until we find a way to control health care costs \nthat have driven up the cost of insurance coverage for families, \nemployers, and governments alike.\n  While I agree that our health care system is broken and in need of \nmajor reform, the bill we are about to consider falls far short when it \ncomes to reining in health care costs. This is a critical issue because \nthe high cost of health care is the biggest barrier for those who lack \ninsurance. The high cost of health care is what is driving up the cost \nof insurance premiums, causing many middle-income families and small \nbusinesses to struggle to meet these rising costs.\n  I am concerned that this bill takes us in the wrong direction and \nthat it will actually drive up costs and reduce choices for many \nmiddle-income Americans and small businesses.\n  Health care reform should give Americans more, not fewer, choices of \naffordable health insurance options. Under this bill, many Americans \nwill be required to purchase health insurance that is more expensive, \nnot less expensive, than the coverage they currently have.\n  Under the majority leader's bill, all individual and small group \npolicies sold in our country must fit into one of four categories: \nbronze, silver, gold, or platinum, and they must have an actuarial \nvalue of at least 60 percent. Post reform--if this bill becomes law--it \nwill be illegal to issue new policies in the individual or small group \nmarkets that do not meet those standards.\n  Moreover, unless they are grandfathered, most Americans who are not \nenrolled in at least a bronze plan will face a new $750 fine.\n  Let's look at what this means. In my home State of Maine, 87.5 \npercent of those purchasing coverage in the individual market today \nhave policies with an actuarial value of less than 60 percent. In other \nwords, they have policies that do not qualify under the standards that \nwould be established by this bill.\n  The most popular individual market policy sold in Maine costs a 40-\nyear-old about $185 a month. Under Senator Reid's bill, that 40-year-\nold would have to pay at least $420 a month, more than twice as much, \nfor a policy that would meet the new minimum standard, or pay the $750 \npenalty.\n  I believe Americans should have the choice to purchase more \naffordable coverage if that is what works best for them. Health care \nreform should be about expanding affordable choices, not constricting \nthem. It should not be about forcing millions of Americans to buy \ncoverage that is richer than they want, need, or can afford. Yet under \nthis bill, even an individual who does not qualify for any taxpayer \nassistance, for any subsidy, would have to buy a prescribed plan rather \nthan, for example, a low-cost, high-deductible policy that, when \ncombined with a health savings account, may best meet his needs.\n  Moreover, the very tight rating bands in this bill will increase \ncosts for young people.\n  Why does that matter, when we are trying to expand coverage for those \nwho are uninsured? For this reason: More than 40 percent of uninsured \nAmericans are between the ages of 18 and 34. Extreme price increases \nfor the young and healthy will simply force them out of the market \nbecause most young people, I fear, will just do the math. They will \ndecide to pay the new $750-a-year fine, rather than paying $5,000 a \nyear or more for health insurance. This is particularly true because \nunder the bill, if they do get sick later, they can still buy insurance \nwith no penalty, no increased cost. That is why the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners--keep in mind, this is the \nassociation of State officials which regulates insurance; these are \npublic officials--according to the NAIC, these provisions will lead to \nsevere adverse selection that will drive up the cost of premiums for \neveryone else who is in the insurance pool.\n  Proponents of this legislation contend that the subsidies included in \nthe bill for low- and moderate-income Americans will compensate for any \npremium increases. Let's take a look at that. First of all, it is \nimportant to know that the subsidies do not go into effect until the \nyear 2014 yet a lot of the taxes which I am going to discuss later, \nwhich are also going to drive up the cost of premiums, go into effect \nnext year. So that is a problem as well.\n  Moreover, these subsidies are going to be available, it is estimated, \nto fewer than 8 percent of Americans.\n\n[[Page S11868]]\n\nMoreover, if you receive your health insurance from your employer, as \nthe vast majority of Americans now do, you are not eligible for a \nsubsidy under this plan. But your premiums are still going to go up \nbecause of the increased taxes and fees imposed by the bill.\n  When Americans understandably are so upset about the high cost of \nhealth care, and when health insurance premiums are going up by double \ndigits, making it so difficult for most Americans to afford health \ninsurance, the last thing we should be doing is to make the situation \nworse. I can't help but think of the Hippocratic Oath, ``do no harm.'' \nShould not that be our first rule?\n  Americans who are already shouldering the burden of too high health \ncare costs would hardly consider a bill to be ``reform'' if it drives \nthose costs up further. Yet I fear that is exactly what will happen if \nthis bill becomes law as written.\n  In light of this, I think it is a legitimate question to ask whether \nthis bill may actually increase the number of uninsured Americans by \ndriving up the cost of health insurance for years before the subsidies \ngo into effect?\n  Let me take a further look at some of the increased taxes that are in \nthis bill. Americans will face at least a dozen new or increased taxes \nand fees amounting to $73 billion before the subsidies go into effect \nin 2014. What kind of new taxes are we talking about? This chart shows \njust some of the taxes that will hit Americans when the bill goes into \neffect--and there are many more. Here are a few.\n  There is a tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers, a tax on health \ninsurance providers, a tax on medical devices. Think of what we are \ntalking about taxing here: We are talking about insulin pumps, \nartificial hips and knees, stents put into hearts--all sorts of medical \ndevices. If a new fee is put on these devices, that is going to be \npassed on to consumers and reflected in insurance premiums.\n  All in all, as I mentioned, these taxes will cost $73 billion before \n2014. These taxes will be paid right away by Americans in the form of \nhigher health insurance premiums. That is not just my opinion, that is \nthe view of the Congressional Budget Office, which evaluated the impact \nof several of these taxes. For example, here is what the CBO said about \nthe $6.7 billion increased tax on insurers:\n\n       We expect a very large portion of the proposed insurance \n     industry fee to be borne by purchasers of insurance in the \n     form of higher premiums.\n\n  The problem is, the way these taxes are structured, they are going to \nbe passed on to consumers, and it is not only the taxes on insurers \nthat will be passed on. Here is what the CBO Director said about new \nfees on the pharmaceutical industry and also on medical devices. The \nCBO said:\n\n       Those fees would increase costs for the affected firms, \n     which would be passed on to purchasers and would ultimately \n     raise insurance premiums by a corresponding amount.\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation looked at the tax on the so-called \nCadillac plans, the 40-percent excise tax. Here is what it said:\n\n       As insurers pass along the cost to consumers by increasing \n     the price, the cost of employer-provided insurance will \n     increase.\n\n  I do not believe that the American people have sent us to Washington \nto raise their taxes and call it health reform--especially now, in the \nmidst of a recession, with unemployment above 10 percent.\n  This leads me to another point. I am so concerned about the impact of \nthis bill on our small businesses. They are the job creators in our \neconomy, and the rising cost of health care has been particularly \nburdensome for them. A small business owner in Maine recently e-mailed \nme to say the following:\n\n       I just received our renewal proposals for our small \n     business. The plans are all up anywhere from 12 to 32 percent \n     on the three plans that we offer. . . . You are right when \n     you say we need to address the cost of health insurance, not \n     create another vehicle to deliver the services. The current \n     legislation, as I understand it, totally misses the mark.\n\n  How does this bill help small business? On balance, it doesn't. That, \nagain, is not just my opinion; that is the opinion of our Nation's \nlargest small business group, the NFIB. In a statement on the bill \nreleased yesterday, the NFIB said:\n\n       This kind of reform is not what we need. New taxes . . . \n     new mandates . . . new entitlement programs . . . paid for on \n     the backs of small business.\n\n  In fact, NFIB described the bill as ``a disaster.''\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of the NFIB statement be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From NFIB--Small Business News, Nov. 19, 2009]\n\n                    Senate Bill Fails Small Business\n\n                        (By Stephanie Cathcart)\n\n       Washington, DC.--Susan Eckerly, senior vice president of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business, the nation's \n     leading small business association, issued the following \n     statement in reaction to the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act:\n       ``Small business can't support a proposal that does not \n     address their No. 1 problem: the unsustainable cost of \n     healthcare. With unemployment at a 26-year high and small \n     business owners struggling to simply keep their doors open, \n     this kind of reform is not what we need to encourage small \n     businesses to thrive.\n       ``We oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     due to the amount of new taxes, the creation of new mandates, \n     and the establishment of new entitlement programs. There is \n     no doubt all these burdens will be paid for on the backs of \n     small business. It's clear to us that, at the end of the day, \n     the costs to small business more than outweigh the benefits \n     they may have realized.\n       ``Small businesses have been clear about their needs in \n     health reform; they have been working for solutions for more \n     than two decades. They have a unique place in this debate \n     because of the exceptional challenges they face. They \n     experience the most volatile premium increases, are the most \n     cost-shifted market, see the most tax increases and have the \n     least competitive marketplace. For all these reasons, they \n     especially need reform, but these reforms can't add to their \n     cost of doing business. The impact from these new taxes, a \n     rich benefit package that is more costly than what they can \n     afford today, a new government entitlement program, and a \n     hard employer mandate equals disaster for small business.\n       ``We are disappointed that, after so many months of \n     discussion, small business could be left with the status quo \n     or something even worse. Unless extreme measures are taken to \n     reverse the course Congress is on, small business will have \n     no choice but to hope for another chance at real reform down \n     the road.\n       ``Congress is running out of opportunities to prove to \n     small business that they are serious about helping our \n     nation's job creators. We are hopeful that a robust \n     bipartisan debate will produce a bill that small businesses \n     see as a solution and not another government burden.''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there are some provisions in the bill \nthat are intended to try to help small business but again they miss the \nmark. I support and have long proposed the idea of tax credits for \nsmall businesses to help them afford to provide health insurance for \ntheir employees. But the credits for small businesses in this bill are \npoorly structured. Only businesses with no more than 10 workers, paid \nan average of $20,000, can get the full tax credit. So if a small \nbusiness hires additional employees or pays more, its credit begins to \ndecline and it is eventually phased out. Businesses with more than 25 \nworkers, or paying average wages of above $40,000 get no tax credit \nwhatsoever.\n  Take a look at this. I realize this chart is a bit busy, but stay \nwith me. Under the Finance Committee bill, if you have 10 employees and \nyou pay them on average $20,000, you get a 50-percent tax credit \napplied to the cost of the insurance. But if you give them a raise, the \ntax credit begins to decline. For example, if you have 10 employees and \nyou pay them $25,000 on average, you only get a tax credit of 38 \npercent.\n  Let's say you are trying to improve their quality of living. They \nhave done a great job for you, so you give all your employees a raise, \nbringing their average wage to $30,000. Now the tax credit is only half \nas much as when you paid them $20,000.\n  If you pay them $40,000 on average--zero. You lose the tax credit \naltogether.\n  What we have here is a tax credit that is structured in such a way \nthat it discourages small businesses from adding employees and paying \nthem better. That doesn't make any sense at all. That makes no sense at \nall.\n  This legislation would have enormous consequences for our economy and \nfor our society. We have to remember that this bill would affect every \nsingle American, every small and large employer, every health care \nprovider. It affects 17 percent of our economy.\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\n  There are many reforms, such as allowing small businesses to pool \ntogether to have better bargaining clout, that I support and that have \nstrong bipartisan support, that could have been the basis for further \ndebate and amendments. So it disappoints me greatly that we are about \nto proceed to a divisive, partisan bill. I continue to believe that the \nAmerican people would be better served by a bipartisan bill that brings \ntogether the best ideas on both sides of the aisle, and I pledge to \ncontinue to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to develop \nalternatives that will bring about true health care reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I find it fascinating, listening to the \ncomments from the Senator from Maine. Maine and Wyoming are similar in \na number of ways. One is that the engine that drives our economy is \nsmall businesses. What we heard is that this bill right here, this \nlarge bill which is the bill the Senate is considering right now, over \n2,000 pages--underneath it is the bill that passed the House--I hear \nthese are actually going to penalize the small businesses of Maine and \nthe small businesses of Wyoming when those businesses try to hire \nanother employee.\n  We are looking at 10.2 percent unemployment right now. People in our \nStates are well aware of those numbers. I don't know if that number is \nbeing neglected by others, but for small businesses trying to hire \npeople, this health care bill makes it much tougher. It will certainly \nmake it tougher for them to provide insurance, and it will make it \ntougher for those small businesses to give raises to people.\n  It is, indeed, unfortunate that we are here in the Senate Chamber \nlooking at a bill that is going to raise premiums for the American \npeople who have insurance and who like the insurance they have. Their \nbig concern isn't cost. We are looking at a bill that is going to cut \nMedicare for seniors who depend on Medicare, and the numbers are huge, \nalmost $500 billion. And we are looking at a bill that is going to \nraise taxes on the American people.\n  I heard the Senator from Maine, and she can jump in and correct me if \nI am wrong. What I heard her say is that it is not just a tax on the \nrich; it is a tax on people all across the board because the taxes are \ngoing to be passed on. I see the Senator nodding her head in the \naffirmative. When taxes are raised on medical devices or on medication, \non one thing after another after another, those are costs that will get \npassed on to all the consumers of health care.\n  Right before this party took the floor, we had the senior Senator \nfrom Minnesota talking about the Mayo Clinic and the wonderful care \nthat is given there. It is wonderful care. But the Mayo Clinic has also \nsaid they don't want any part of this bill, nothing to do with it, to \nthe point that they have sent doctors in my home State and States \nsurrounding the Mayo Clinic who refer patients--and I practiced \nmedicine in Wyoming for 25 years, have taken care of families there as \na physician, and we sent patients to the Mayo Clinic--they just said: \nStop sending patients on Medicare or Medicaid. We want nothing to do \nwith it because the government is the biggest deadbeat payer. The Mayo \nClinic said: Every time we get one of those patients, we have to charge \nthe people who pay their own way, the people who have insurance. We \nhave to charge them more. We don't want to take any more patients on \nMedicare and Medicaid. Hospitals and the communities in Maine, South \nDakota, and Nevada, hospitals in those States have to take all those \npatients.\n  So what happens to people who pay their own way because they buy \ninsurance themselves or they get it through work is the hospitals have \nto charge them more to make up for the biggest deadbeat payer of all \ntime--the Federal Government.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada rising to his feet. I imagine the exact \nsame thing is happening to hospitals in Nevada. Premiums are going up \non the 85 percent of the people who have insurance they like. Yet we in \nthe Senate tomorrow night are going to vote on a bill which, to me, the \npeople of America don't like. Do you know who doesn't like it the most? \nSeniors. They are concerned. They know Medicare is going broke. And by \nthe year 2017, there will be $500 billion of cuts in Medicare. Yet the \nmoney that is being cut from Medicare isn't being used to save \nMedicare; it is to start a whole new program that will cause Americans \nwho have insurance to pay more. It will cause people who don't have any \ninsurance to make it harder to get or if they go to an emergency room \nand have to pay a bill, that bill will be higher, all because of what I \nbelieve is an irresponsible piece of legislation that is going to be a \nhuge weight on the American economy at a time when we have 10.2 percent \nunemployment.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada. He has a similar copy of the bills \nnext to him. He may want to chime in on what he sees in his home State \nand what he is hearing from people who live in Nevada, from small \nbusinesses as well as hospitals and providers.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, these pieces of legislation were put on \nour desks to show the American people what we are dealing with. We have \nonly just started going through these bills. Already we have found \nmajor problems with the legislation.\n  What we are going to talk about over the next few minutes is the \npremium increases for the American people. If you have insurance now, \nyour premiums are going to go up because of this legislation we have \nbefore us. Probably in other ways we don't even know about yet, we will \ndiscover in the future, but we at least know some ways that are going \nto cause the premiums to go up.\n  Let me first talk generally about the bill and what some of the \nproblems are and just briefly on some alternative ideas Republicans \nhave come up with in more of a step-by-step type approach.\n  We know this bill cuts Medicare by $465 billion, including $118 \nbillion in Medicare Advantage cuts. That means millions of seniors who \nare on Medicare Advantage today will lose the plan they have. Medicare \nAdvantage plans in my State are incredibly popular among senior \ncitizens. I know they are across the country. We know taxes are going \nto go up by almost $500 billion. We know premiums are going to go up \nfor millions of Americans.\n  This bill was supposed to bend the cost curve. Because it is actually \ndeficit neutral, maybe it helps the deficit a little bit because of the \nsmoke and mirrors they play with it. They say that bends the cost \ncurve, but when we look at the American people and the actual cost they \nwill be paying for health care, their cost curve continues to go up and \nup and up into the future.\n  This bill will also lead to rationing. We saw this week a Federal \nboard that talked about mammograms, and it caused an outrage in women \nacross America. That is the sort of thing that is going to happen \nbecause of this legislation. Federal bureaucrats are going to be in \ncharge of your health care, not your doctor and you. We need to have \nlegislation that focuses on that doctor-patient relationship that \nshould be so sacred in our health care system today.\n  Republicans have come up with the idea of medical liability reform to \nstart driving down the cost of all of this defensive medicine that is \npracticed. We all know doctors order all kinds of unnecessary tests to \nprevent themselves from being sued in all these frivolous lawsuits.\n  Both sides agree, let's eliminate the preexisting conditions. That is \nkind of a given. That is something on which we all agree. That is part \nof the step-by-step approach this side of the aisle would certainly be \nwilling to do.\n  I also believe we need to encourage healthier behavior in America \nbecause 75 percent of all health care costs are because of people's \nbehavioral choices--smoking, people who are overweight. We know obesity \ncontributes to every kind of cancer, to heart disease, diabetes. It is \nepidemic in this country. Look at our young people. If we don't turn \naround people's behavior, get them to exercise more, eat right, quit \nsmoking, I don't care what health care reform you pass, we are not \ngoing to do anything about driving down the cost. And the high cost of \nhealth care is the No. 1 problem with our system.\n  We believe we should have small business health plans where small \nbusinesses can join together to buy health insurance, take advantage of \npurchasing power that larger businesses\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\nhave. We believe individuals should be able to buy across State lines \nthe way you do with car insurance. If your State is too high on \ninsurance, buy it in another State where it is cheaper, where maybe \nthey don't have as many mandates. Doesn't that make sense?\n  We also believe we should have transparency on cost and quality. When \nyou walk into your doctor's office, you should be able to get a written \nestimate of what it is going to cost. You should be able to shop that \nestimate so that we have more consumers making more intelligent choices \non health care. When was the last time you went into your doctor's \noffice and got a written estimate or knew how much something was going \nto cost? I practiced veterinary medicine for many years. When you walk \ninto my practice, you get a written estimate. We have you sign that \nwritten estimate because we have to give that. That is part of our \ngeneral practice. We need to bring that into human medicine, whether it \nis hospitals or doctors' practices. We need to have transparency for \ncost and quality.\n  How does this bill drive up premiums for Americans?\n  First, there are nine new taxes put in by the Democratic majority: a \n40-percent insurance plan tax for what are called Cadillac plans; \nanother tax on insurance companies; an employer tax; a drug tax; a lab \ntax; a medical device tax; a failure to buy insurance tax; a cosmetic \nsurgery tax, brand new in this bill; and also an increased employee \nMedicare tax, a brandnew tax structure on Medicare taxes. Who pays for \nthese kinds of taxes? It isn't just insurance. On the failure to buy \ninsurance, 71 percent of that tax is going to be paid for by people who \nmake less than $120,000 a year.\n  Almost every one of the taxes I just put up of those nine new taxes--\nthe vast majority of them are paid by people who President Obama, when \nhe was campaigning, said would not pay one dime more in new taxes. He \nrepeated that promise time after time. He said: No new fees, no new \ntaxes, capital gains. He went through the whole litany of types of \ntaxes that would not be raised. Yet in this plan approximately 80 \npercent of all of the new taxes are paid by people making less than \n$250,000 a year.\n  Another way this massive piece of legislation raises premiums is this \nthing known as cost-shifting. The doctor from Wyoming practiced \nmedicine. He was talking about the Mayo Clinic and why the Mayo Clinic, \nthe Cleveland Clinic, and other places and other doctors don't want to \ntake Medicaid and Medicare patients anymore. Why? Because the \ngovernment pays 20 to 30 percent less than private health insurance in \nreimbursement to doctors; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Plus, when you read this bill, one of their so-called \nsolutions is they will put more people on the Medicaid rolls.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. How many more people are going to go on the Medicaid \nrolls?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is millions and millions of people, with the cost to \nthe States. You say we will take it out of here. You won't see it in \nthis bill because they are going to make the States pay over $20 \nbillion in money because it is a matching program, so they get it off \nthe Washington books. But it is still the taxpayers and the States, and \nwe all come from States. That is going to drive up the cost for \nindividuals as well as increase taxes around the country.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Because you were in the practice of medicine, I ask the \nSenator from Wyoming, I have heard numbers as high as 15 million new \npeople on Medicaid, plus we have a new public option, so there will be \nmore people on another government plan. What will happen as far as cost \nshifting to those of us who have private insurance? For those tens of \nmillions of Americans who have private health insurance, what will \nhappen to their cost of insurance when more people are on government \nplans?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Those costs will have to go up. Premiums will go up for \nall people who have insurance, private insurance. The Senator from \nNevada is correct. Some people think the number is 15 million more who \nwill go onto the Medicaid rolls because there is a difference between \nthe Senate bill and the House bill as to how many more folks they move \nonto the Medicaid rolls. But either way, we are talking tens and tens \nof billions of dollars that will come out of the taxpayers' pockets \naround the States. But that is still for a government-run program that \ndoesn't reimburse, doesn't pay the hospitals, doesn't pay the doctors \neven what the cost of delivering the care is.\n  Across the board, hospitals will tell you they cannot keep their \ndoors open if everyone is paid at Medicaid or Medicare rates. The only \nway they can pay the nurses, keep the lights on, take the food in the \ntrays around to the patients, do all the things a hospital has to do, \nor keep a doctor's office open, the only way they can do it is because \nthey charge more to people who have private insurance than they get \npaid for people on Medicare or Medicaid. And Medicaid is worse than \nMedicare in terms of the payment.\n  So it is this cost shifting that occurs. Who pays that? The people \nwho have regular insurance. It is the hard-working men and women of \nAmerica through their jobs who pay for that. We just heard from the \nSenator from Maine. Anytime we try to help that individual--I see the \nSenator from South Dakota is in the Chamber as well, and he may want to \njump in as well because South Dakota is a State like mine where we have \nlots of small businesses that are going to be hit specifically hard as \nthey try to continue to provide insurance. This does not even allow \nsmall businesses to group together to get better deals.\n  The Senator from Nevada talked about buying insurance across State \nlines to help people get the costs down. This bill prevents that. It \nalso prevents small business groups from getting together, which would \nbe a great help.\n  I know the Senator from South Dakota is interested in getting into \nthe discussion. I invite him to discuss this very aspect and the impact \nof all these increasing premiums on the folks in his State.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Wyoming is not a lot unlike the States of \nSouth Dakota or Nevada, as the Senator knows, although they have a few \nlarger businesses in Nevada. But the people who get hit hardest under \nthis bill are small businesses.\n  We heard the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, point out the impacts \non small businesses. The ironic thing about that is a lot of small \nbusinesses, where you would want to encourage them to offer health \ninsurance to their employees, will be discouraged from doing so under \nthis bill. In fact, what most of them are probably going to do is pay \nthe $750 penalty and then push everybody off into the government plan.\n  The assumption that is being made in here is that the government \nplan--it will grow over time, obviously. I think 5 million people will \nlose their private insurance, according to CBO. My guess is that number \nis going to be much higher because I think what is going to happen is \nsmall businesses that are impacted the most by these tax increases are \ngoing to find themselves less and less able to provide health insurance \ncoverage to their employees.\n  The other thing I want to point out, as to what my colleagues from \nWyoming and Nevada have said, is that I would be somewhat, I guess, \ninterested in what is being proposed by the other side if it did \nanything to impact cost. But it does not. The whole purpose of this \nexercise, at least in the minds of most Americans, is to drive the cost \ncurve down. I heard my colleagues on the other side get up and talk \nabout, well, their plan is going to decrease costs for people in this \ncountry.\n  Well, here is the cost curve, as shown on this chart. The blue \nrepresents the cost curve; that is, what would happen if we do nothing. \nThat is the expected increase in health care costs in this country if \nwe do nothing.\n  What is ironic is, the red represents what happens under this bill. \nSo instead of bending the cost curve down, it actually increases the \ncost curve. So we are going to spend $160 billion more on health care \nin this country by enacting this bill, this monstrosity of a bill right \nhere, which, as my colleagues have pointed out, is 2,074 pages. The \nSenators from Nevada and Wyoming both also have the House version, \nwhich is 2,200 pages. But look at this thing. You would think somewhere \nin here, in all this volume of paper, there would be a way to actually \ndo something to actually bend the cost curve\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\ndown. But all that represents more spending.\n  In fact, if you look at the amount of spending in the bill when it is \nfully implemented, it is much more than what the CBO estimated it would \ncost. There was all the publicity when they unveiled this health care \nplan a couple days ago that it is going to be under $1 trillion. Well, \nin fact, we all know they have used a lot of accounting gimmicks, a lot \nof scoring tricks, a lot of ways to obscure the true cost. In fact, \neven in the first 10 years it understates the cost, which is over $1 \ntrillion. But the 10-year fully implemented cost of this bill is $2.5 \ntrillion--a $2.5 trillion expansion in the size of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  If you look at how that plays out and how it is paid for over the \nfully implemented phase--we all talked about $\\1/2\\ trillion in \nMedicare cuts. For 10 years, fully implemented, it is over $1 trillion \nthey have to cut Medicare to pay for this thing, and then to raise \ntaxes by another $1 trillion. So you are talking about not only cutting \nMedicare to senior citizens, as the Senators have talked about, but \nalso raising taxes substantially on small businesses. But at the end of \nthe day, after all is said and done, what do you end up with? You end \nup with an increase in cost above and beyond what we would see if we \ndid nothing. Tell me how you can call that reform.\n  The other point I will make before I yield back to my colleagues is, \nif you are someone who already has insurance--and 182 million people in \nthis country have insurance--you are not going to be able to \nparticipate in the exchange.\n  You get no more options out of this. There are 19 million Americans \nwho would, perhaps, benefit from being part of an exchange. But if you \nare one of the 182 million people in this country who currently have \ninsurance, you cannot get into an exchange and you cannot get any \nsubsidy. What you get are big fat tax increases and increases in your \ninsurance premiums, for all the reasons that have been mentioned. \nBecause when you tax the health insurance companies--as this bill \ndoes--when you tax the medical device manufacturers--as this bill \ndoes--when you tax the pharmaceutical companies--as this bill does--and \ncreate all new kinds of mandates on insurance companies, including \nchanging these age band ratings, going to a 3-to-1 age band rating, you \nare going to raise premiums for a lot of people in this country, and \nyou are going to raise them the most for people who are age 18 to 34. \nThe people who are age 18 to 34 do not realize what is coming at them \ntoday, but it is about a 69-percent increase in their insurance \npremiums. They are the ones who get stuck the hardest.\n  But if you are any of these 182 million people, your taxes are going \nto go up, your insurance premiums are going to go up, and you are not \ngoing to see any benefit from being able to participate in any sort of \nan exchange. These are the cold, hard facts.\n  I have heard countless Democratic colleagues come down here and talk \nabout bending the cost curve down and reducing premiums for people in \nthis country. As shown on this chart, this is the Congressional Budget \nOffice number. This is not anything the Republicans put together. This \nis the CBO cost estimate of what it would do to the cost curve. As I \nsaid before, the red represents the increase: a $160 billion increase \nin health care spending over 10 years--all of which is going to be \nborne by those 182 million Americans in this country who already have \ninsurance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator from South Dakota would yield, I wish to \nget your comments--maybe from both of my colleagues--on a couple of \nquotes from the Congressional Budget Office as well as the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation dealing with these premium increases and who is \nactually going to bear the taxes. Because a lot of people think that: \nWell, let's tax the insurance companies. Let's tax the medical device \ncompanies. Let's tax somebody else. Well, this is what the \nCongressional Budget Office says. Let me read a couple quotes. One \nquote is:\n\n       Although the surcharges would be imposed on the firms, \n     workers in those firms would ultimately bear the burden of \n     those fees, just as they would with pay-or-play requirements. \n     . . . Many of those workers are more likely to have earnings \n     at or near the minimum wage.\n\n  So it is the low-income people who are going to end up paying when \nyou actually put some of these taxes that we have talked about in.\n  Here is another quote from the Congressional Budget Office. Let's \nremind folks, the Congressional Budget Office is nonpartisan. It is not \nRepublican, not Democratic. They are kind of the objective scorekeeper \naround here. They say, these taxes ``would increase costs for the \naffected firms, which would be passed on to purchasers and would \nultimately raise insurance premiums by a corresponding amount.''\n  The last economic quote is this. This is by the Joint Tax Committee:\n\n       Generally, we expect the insurer to pass along the cost of \n     the excise tax to consumers by increasing the price of health \n     coverage.\n\n  I say to the Senator, this is what you are talking about on that \nother chart you have up. I wish to hear your comments on that.\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, the Senator is absolutely right. I think what the \nCBO has pointed out is--and I have the Joint Tax Committee there; the \ndata they produced is very similar to what CBO said--84 percent of the \ntax burden is going to fall on people making less than $200,000 a year. \nAnd half of the families making under $100,000 a year are going to get \nhit with new taxes under this bill. So it is going to fall on those \npeople in this country. And I think they like to think they are taxing \nmedical device manufacturers and everybody else, but at the end of the \nday, a lot of this gets passed on. And the taxes in the bill, the \npremium increases in the bill, are all going to be borne by the people \nwho are probably least able to absorb that and take that, and it is \ngoing to be the people in the lower income categories.\n  So the Senator from Nevada is absolutely right. I again come back to \nthe basic premise of this whole purpose of health care reform, which \nshould be to get health care costs down, not raise them. The Senator \nfrom Wyoming has alluded to a number of things we believe would do \nthat, that actually do put downward pressure on health care costs in \nthis country. It is done in a step-by-step way. It is done in a way \nthat does not call for throwing out everything that is good about the \nhealth care system in this country, creating this massive new expansion \nof the Federal Government here in Washington, DC, with $2.5 trillion in \ncosts over a 10-year period when it is fully implemented.\n  And probably--who knows--if a lot of these things do not happen, if \nthe tax increases, for some reason, do not happen, if the Medicare cuts \ndo not occur, it means borrowing from future generations. They talk \nabout reducing the deficit by $130 billion only because they did not \ninclude the physician fee fix in this, only because they added $72 \nbillion in revenue from something called the CLASS Act, which we know \nis never going to become law--and even if it does, it is a huge money \nloser in the outyears.\n  So you have all these things that they did, including delaying the \nimplementation date by 5 years so it understates the true cost of this \nthing--all these things that have been done to try to make this turkey \nlook like something other than what it is, which is a massive increase \nin spending, massive tax increases on the American people, and \nincreased premiums for Americans, particularly those 182 million \nAmericans who already have health insurance who are going to get hit \nthe hardest by this.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Maybe we could have the Senator from Wyoming comment. One \nof the big things Republicans have been talking about--instead of \ndriving premiums up, which this bill does--is driving premiums down. \nMaybe the Senator can discuss medical liability reform, which the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is a very conservative estimate, has \nsaid would save about $100 billion in medical costs in this country.\n  As a practicing physician, maybe the Senator could talk about the \nunnecessary tests that are ordered, the huge increases in medical \nliability insurance costs that physicians face today.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, if you do a poll of doctors, with the \nquestion: Have you ever ordered a test that was not going to help that \nperson get better, that patient get better, but you were doing it \nbecause you did not want to miss something for fear of a malpractice \nsuit, every hand will go up of\n\n[[Page S11872]]\n\nevery physician. The Massachusetts Medical Society did a poll and 87 \npercent of doctors said that. Massachusetts has their new health care \nplan.\n  As an aside, the dean of the Harvard Medical School had an editorial \nin one of the major national publications this week, and he gave this \nwhole thing--he said: I give this whole thing a failing grade. He said \npeople who support this--the legislation that is being proposed--are \nengaged in collective denial. We need to do some things that will help \nwith cost, with access, with quality. All this bill is going to do is \ndrive up the cost, with no improvement at all in quality.\n  So there are step-by-step things we can do: letting people buy \ninsurance across State lines, getting the same tax breaks as others. \nThe Senator talked about helping people stay healthy--exercising, \ngetting down the cost of their care by getting their cholesterol down.\n  But also you have to deal with lawsuit abuse. It is out there. You \ncould do a thing as easy as loser pays. Obviously, there are great \nobjections to trying to do that. There are people who would oppose that \nall the way. But it would help eliminate--eliminate--a lot of the \nunnecessary tests and certainly a lot of the costs of the system. \nBecause two-thirds of the cost of that whole liability system goes to \nthe system, it does not even go to the injured person. If somebody is \ninjured, you want to take care of them. But this does not do it at all.\n  One of the things the Senator from South Dakota mentioned, fairly \nquickly in passing, was age band ratings, which flies in the face of \nthe things we have been talking about: individual responsibility, \nopportunities for people to stay healthy. The big problem is that we \nknow 50 percent of all the money we spend on health care on this \ncountry is on 5 percent of the people--the people who eat too much, \nexercise too little, and smoke. But yet under this government-forced \ninsurance, where people are going to be forced to buy insurance--and if \nyoung people do not buy it, they are going to be listed as either tax \ncheats or criminals because they are going to get fined or they are \ngoing to get taxed an amount for not buying the insurance--they are \ngoing to have to buy insurance.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota talked about a 3-to-1 ratio--and the \nSenator from Maine mentioned the same thing--what that means is for the \nyoungest, healthiest person buying insurance--that kid out of college \nwho is staying healthy or might be working construction, who is in good \nshape, going to the gym--what they are doing on a 3-to-1 ratio is that \nperson has to pay a lot of insurance compared to the person who does \neat too much, exercises too little, and smokes. The ratio of their \ninsurance premiums--this person can pay no less than one-third of what \nthis person pays, when you might have 100 young people where their \ntotal health care bills for a year would be equal to that one person \nwho exercises too little, eats too much, and smokes.\n  So these young people are going to end up paying the cost. And it is \ntheir premiums--and I think we heard that from the Senator from South \nDakota--their premiums are going to go up--did I hear 69 percent?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 69 percent. If you are 18 to 34, that is \nwhat you are looking at in the form of premium increases, not to \nmention the fact that future generations are going to deal with all of \nthe debt we continue to pile on them, which I think bears heavily on \nthis debate right now, when you are looking at trillion-dollar deficits \nas far as the eye can see. This is not a good deal if you are a young \nperson in America.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is the wrong prescription for America.\n  I am going to continue to speak on the floor about the things that I \nthink are problems with this bill. I think it is the wrong approach. I \nthink it costs way too much. I think it raises taxes on all Americans. \nIt cuts Medicare. What we have heard now, and what we know for sure, is \nit is going to raise premiums for people who have insurance, who like \nthe insurance they have, who want to keep the insurance they have; and \ntheir costs are going to continue to go up if this becomes law, at a \nrate faster than, as we saw from the graph, if nothing was passed at \nall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats control the next hour.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I have listened to several of my Republican colleagues and I wish to \nnote that they have the bill in front of them and they are attacking \nthis health care bill, but nowhere on their desks do we see their bill. \nThey have no answers, no solutions.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I can't yield.\n  They have no solutions at all on an issue that affects every single \nAmerican.\n  What we have before us is the Reid bill which I think is an excellent \npiece of legislation that will make life better for every single \nAmerican. I will spell that out in the course of my remarks.\n  We all know change isn't easy. It is easy to come down here and \ndemagog and pound your fists and complain. It is human nature to resist \nchange. But every once in a while a situation cries out for change, and \nthat is the case today with our health care system.\n  The status quo is not benign. It is hurting our people. I wish to \nshare the story of Nikki White as brought to us in the book ``The \nHealing of America'' by T.R. Reid. He talks about Nikki in the prologue \nwhere he poses it as a moral question: What we do about health care? \nThis is what he writes:\n\n       If Nikki White had been a resident of any other rich \n     country, she would be alive today. Around the time she \n     graduated from college, Nikki White contracted Lupus. That is \n     a serious disease, but one that modern medicine knows how to \n     manage. If this bright, feisty, dazzling young woman had \n     lived in say, Japan, the world's second richest Nation, or \n     Germany, the third richest, or Britain, France, Italy, Spain, \n     Canada, et cetera, the health care systems there would have \n     given her the standard treatment for Lupus and she could have \n     lived a normal life span. But Nikki White was a citizen of \n     the world's richest country--the United States of America. \n     Once she was sick, she couldn't get health insurance. Like \n     tens of millions of her fellow Americans, she had too much \n     money to qualify for health care under welfare, but too \n     little money to pay for the drugs and the doctors she needed \n     to stay alive. She spent the last months of her life \n     frantically writing letters and filling out forms pleading \n     for help. When she died, Nikki White was 32 years old.\n\n  That is a story that should move every one of us, move every one of \nus to action.\n  Look, we have spent years studying and analyzing what is working in \nour health care system and what is not working. What it comes down to \nis this: Too many of our fellow citizens are suffering because of the \nbroken promises of a health insurance system that abandoned them when \nthey needed it the most. Too many cannot afford health insurance. Too \nmany are getting sick after praying to God that they wouldn't because \nthey knew that sickness could leave them in economic ruin. Praying is \nnot a health care insurance plan.\n  Americans will spend over $2.5 trillion on health care next year; \n$2.5 trillion. In all, we spend twice as much per person on health care \nas other advanced nations. Yet, the United States of America, out great \nNation, ranks near the bottom of the 30 leading industrialized nations \nin basic measures of health, such as infant mortality rate and life \nexpectancy--the bottom of the list. That is where we are. So we spend \ntwice as much and the results are not anywhere near where they should \nbe. It is clear why. Too many people don't have affordable health \ninsurance, and they wait too long before they get the help they need. \nOr, they are like Nikki and they never get the help they need.\n  Health care premiums have more than doubled in the last 9 years--more \nthan doubled in the last 9 years--and one respected nonpartisan study \nsays if we fail to act, the average American family will have to spend \n45 percent of their income on health insurance premiums alone, and that \nis by 2016. By 2016, 45 percent of their income, the average family, by \n2016, if we do nothing. My friends on the other side stand there with \nthe bill and downgrade what we are doing and never address that issue.\n  It is time for change. When we know that two-thirds of all \nbankruptcies are due to a health care crisis, it is time\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\nfor change. When we know that every day--every day--another 14,000 \nAmericans lose their health care coverage, that tells me it is time for \nchange.\n  I know there are many people listening who think the uninsured are \nnot their problem, that it doesn't affect their health care. They are \nflat wrong. Right now, every one of us with insurance is paying $1,100 \na year--each of our families--for those who are uninsured. Why? Because \nwe have to pay for the emergency room services they get when they are \nrushed into the hospital because they have neglected a health care \nproblem and it is very expensive, and we are paying for it. That tells \nme it is time for change.\n  When family after family tells us they paid for insurance for years, \nbut when they had a crisis their insurance company walked away from \nthem--in T.R. Reid's book, we learn about a man who paid all his life \nfor insurance and he got struck by an automobile and he was in the \nhospital with a terrible situation, and the insurance company knew it \nwas going to cost them a lot. You know what they did? They rescinded \nhis insurance. They told him that he weighed more than he should have, \nand they walked away from him. Story after story. Good, hard-working \npeople unable to get health insurance, knowing that their future is \ndark. It is time for a change.\n  Today, I want to say to America's families: Change is definitely on \nthe way. It won't be easy. It is going to be tough. But all these \nthings I have said are truths. Everybody here has to be moved by that. \nI believe we will finally bring change. I am hopeful. I am hopeful \nbecause of the work of so many of our colleagues and the work of \nSenator Harry Reid. He has put a bill before us that, as I said, will \nmake life better for every single American. It is called the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act. First and foremost, if you have \nhealth insurance you like, this bill gives you the security of knowing \nit will be there for you when you need it. And if you don't have health \ninsurance, you will be able to get affordable coverage through a new \nexchange which includes the public option.\n  Ultimately, under this bill, we are expanding health care to cover \nmore than 94 percent of the American people, and all the while we are \ncutting the Federal deficit by an estimated $130 billion over 10 years, \nbecause there are real savings and real revenues in this bill to offset \nthe new important programs.\n  When this bill is signed into law, America's families will see \nimmediate improvements to their health care. They won't have to wait.\n  For example, right away, when President Obama signs this bill, your \ninsurance company won't be able to kick you off your plan for some \nmade-up reason because they no longer want to cover you. They will no \nlonger be able to cap your coverage. I can't tell my colleagues how \nmany people think they are safe because they had a $500,000 cap on \ntheir insurance. They never dreamed they would use it up. But one \ndifficult and terrible illness can use it up, and then they are out of \nluck. No more rescissions, no more caps.\n  Parents will be able to keep their children on their health care \npolicy up to the age of 26. Small businesses will have immediate access \nto tax credits to make covering their employees more affordable. And \nseniors will have a more generous benefit through their prescription \ndrug coverage. We all hear about that doughnut hole that affects \nseniors as soon as they need to buy more pharmaceuticals. This will \ngive them another $500 before they reach that point. Those are just a \nfew of the immediate benefits of the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Here is a sample of other major provisions. This is a very important \none. In this bill, no family of four making less than $88,200 a year \nwill have to pay more than 9.8 percent of their income for health \ninsurance premiums. Let me say that again. No family of four making \nless than $88,200 a year will have to pay more than 9.8 percent of \ntheir income for health care premiums. So if you make anything between \nsay the poverty rate all the way up to $88,200, you never have to pay \nmore than 9.8 percent of your income for health care premiums, and if \nyou are on the lower end, it is even less. It goes down to about 2 \npercent. So it ranges from 2 percent to 9.8 percent at $88,200. That \nmeans that more than 62 percent of all of our families will be able to \nbe assured that they will not have to go broke to buy health insurance.\n  Remember what I said. A respected study has already stated that if we \ndo nothing, by 2016 people will be paying 45 percent of their income on \npremiums. In this bill, we ensure that our middle class down to our \nworking poor do not have to worry about those kinds of premium \nincreases.\n  For the rest of our Nation's families who are more affluent, there is \nthe security of knowing that the insurance company reforms in this bill \nare going to help you. The insurance company can't walk away from you. \nIf you have a preexisting condition, they can't turn you down. If you \nhave a child you want to keep on until age 26, you can. If you are a \nsmall business, you will get tax credits to help you pay for your \nemployees. There are many other benefits, including some free \nprevention coverage that kicks in right away. So no more discrimination \nagainst those with a preexisting condition.\n  By the way, no longer will insurance companies be able to \ndiscriminate based on gender. Right now, women in my home State of \nCalifornia are paying almost 40 percent more for the same insurance as \nmen. There is gender discrimination. That will end when this bill \nbecomes law.\n  In this bill we increase competition, which is perhaps one of the \nmost important things we can do to bring down costs to our families. We \nhave the health care exchange which includes a public option that will \ncompete on a level playing field with insurance companies to keep them \nhonest. In other words, there will be a government option, but there \nwon't be anything different about the government plan in terms of the \nway it negotiates with the insurance companies.\n  There has been a lot of shouting from my colleagues about the public \noption. Why shouldn't the American people have access to a public \noption?\n  I ask that question. I don't hear my Republican friends coming down \nto the floor and saying they are going to give up their public option. \nMore than 90 percent of us have a public option right now--the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits Program. I don't see one of my colleagues who \nhave been trashing the public option coming to the floor and saying I \nwish to get rid of mine. Oh, no. They like it. But they don't want it \nfor the rest of the people. I don't understand it.\n  There are lots of public options we have here. Medicare is a public \noption, run by the government. I don't hear my Republican friends \ncoming here and saying we should end Medicare. They used to say that. \nThey don't say it anymore. Now they say they depend on it. It is a \npublic option; 45 million Americans are covered by it. Not one of them \nsaid get rid of Medicare.\n  I don't hear any of my Republican friends coming to the floor saying \nwe should get rid of another public option called Medicaid. That is for \nthe poor. It works well. It is tough, and there are problems with it, \nbut it works and it covers 60 million Americans. So you have 45 million \nAmericans in a public option called Medicare, 60 million Americans in a \npublic option called Medicaid.\n  How about the veterans health care program? I don't hear them \npounding the table and saying get rid of the public option for our \nveterans. I will tell you, maybe they want to, but they would not say \nit because the veterans would be at their door because that public \noption covers 7.9 million veterans. Not one of my Republican colleagues \nsay they want to end it.\n  I don't hear my Republican friends coming to the floor to say we \nshould end our TRICARE program for our military. That is a public \noption for 9.5 million people. I don't hear them saying stop that \npublic option.\n  Again, their own health care, brought to them by FEHBP, Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, that is a public option that covers \n8 million people, including them, and they don't seem to want to end \nthat. But when it comes to everybody else, they come down here and \nbasically say: a government takeover of health care. False.\n  The public option is just one option in the exchange. It has to run \nby the rules of all the other insurance companies. I say if it is good \nenough for a Republican Member of the Senate and a\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\nDemocratic Member of the Senate, a public option ought to be an option \nfor the people whom we represent.\n  Small business needs help here. I don't know if everybody is aware of \nthis, but small businesses pay as much as 18 percent more for the same \nhealth insurance as large businesses. In California, we have seen \nincreased premiums to small businesses that have meant a choice between \nlaying off employees or not providing health insurance at all. More and \nmore of these businesses are dropping health care coverage. If you are \nin the position where you work for a small business, you don't have \nhealth care coverage, and you want to stay there, when this bill goes \ninto effect, you can go into the exchange and then you will have some \nbuying power or your small business can go into the exchange.\n  This bill will protect our seniors, and it will strengthen Medicare. \nMedicare is a success story. Before Medicare became law, half our \nsenior citizens went without health insurance. Now, 98 percent of our \nseniors are covered by Medicare. They believe in the program and they \nwant it to continue. Those of us supporting this bill want to make \nMedicare stronger, and we do. This bill will ensure a stronger, more \nsustainable Medicare Program. It lowers prescription drug costs, as I \nmentioned before. It increases access to preventive services for our \nseniors, and it extends the solvency of the Medicare Program by 4 to 5 \nyears.\n  My Republican colleagues are standing here saying that Democrats want \nto hurt Medicare--by the way, Medicare is a public option. They are \nsaying the Democrats want to hurt Medicare, a public option. Honestly, \nwho could believe that?\n  In 1964, George H. W. Bush called Medicare ``socialized medicine.''\n  Newt Gingrich, when he was Speaker of the House, said he wanted to \nsee Medicare ``wither on the vine.''\n  In 1995, while seeking the Republican nomination for President, \nSenator Bob Dole bragged that he voted against creating Medicare in \n1965. He bragged about it and said: ``I was there fighting the fight, \nvoting against Medicare . . . because we knew it wouldn't work in \n1965.''\n  The Republicans are saying the Democrats want to destroy Medicare in \nthis bill. That is beyond ridiculous. The American people know who is \non their side when it comes to protecting Medicare. We didn't just wake \nup this morning. We know who brought us Medicare.\n  This bill expands Medicaid. That is for the poor to ensure that the \npoorest and sickest among us can get into the program. We are going to \nget those with incomes below 133 percent of the poverty level into the \nprogram. That means that more than 1.5 million Californians who are \nuninsured or are struggling with the cost of health care, that will \nallow them to be covered.\n  I thank the majority leader for working with us to ensure that \nCalifornia receives increased Federal support as we expand Medicaid. \nFor the first 3 years of this expansion, the Federal Government will \nfully cover the cost of expanding Medicaid.\n  I talked a little bit about prevention. Today, only 4 cents of every \n$1 we spend on health care is on prevention. Yet more than half our \npeople live with one or more chronic conditions.\n  Five chronic diseases--heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes--are responsible for more \nthan two-thirds of the deaths in America.\n  This bill will eliminate copays and deductibles for preventive care \nso people don't get to that serious illness. Those preventive services \ngo into effect immediately.\n  That is an overview of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct. My friends on the other side have already come out against this \nbill. They say it is too long, too complex. One of them said it is \n``holy war.'' This bill will cause them to fight a ``holy war,'' for \nsome reason. Where is their bill? They don't have one. After all the \nthings we know are wrong with the system--and you don't have to agree \nwith us on everything, but where is your bill?\n  It seems like my Republican friends care more about playing politics \nthan about protecting our families. That is what it feels like. They \nseem to care more about bringing down our President than bringing down \nthe cost of health care.\n  They seem to care more about all that than Tim and Josie Jentes, of \nLos Angeles, CA. Tim is retired from Raytheon. He gets his health care \nthrough his retirement plan. During 2007, the first year of his \nretirement, their monthly health care premium was $460. During 2008, it \nrose to $630. In 2009, it rose to $850. That is an 85-percent increase \nin 2 years for this retiree.\n  Tim wrote to me and said:\n\n       I understand that compared to many we are fortunate to have \n     good health care and insurance. But we look forward to you, \n     Senator Boxer, the Senate, and the House . . . addressing the \n     seemingly unbounded increase in health care cost.\n\n  We do it in this bill. People such as Tim will be protected. But my \nfriends across the aisle say: No, we are not going to help Tim.\n  What about Madeleine Foote of Costa Mesa, California? She turned 25 \nand lost the health care coverage she had under her parents. She tried \nto get coverage, but because she is taking medicine, she was denied. \nThey said it was a preexisting condition. They said you can have health \ncare, but you have to have a $3,000 deductible and premiums of $300 a \nmonth. She wrote:\n\n       As a young person working in a restaurant, repaying student \n     loans and trying to make it on my own, this is a huge \n     financial burden. I cannot afford insurance that charges me \n     so much. . . . For now, I am forced to hope that nothing \n     extremely bad befalls me.\n\n  She is another one who prays not to get sick. That is not a health \ncare plan. My friends on the other side say: No, sorry, we are not \ngoing to help you, Madeleine.\n  I have so many other stories. There is Douglas Ingoldsby, a small \nbusiness owner in Santa Barbara, CA. He has 11 employees, and soon he \nwill not be able to afford to get them insurance anymore. He asked that \nI support a public option, and I do. My Republican colleagues are \nsaying: Douglas, no, we are not going to help you. It goes on. The \nstories go on.\n  One of the stories is from a doctor, a retired pediatrician in \nSacramento, Robert Meagher, who wrote and said that some parents begged \nhim not to write on the form--after he saw a child with asthma, they \nasked: Please don't write down asthma. Say it was bronchitis. If you \nwrite down that my child has asthma, they will have a preexisting \ncondition and when they go out on their own, they cannot get insurance.\n  Can you imagine a doctor having to face a parent like that? My \nRepublican friends don't want to think about that. They seem to be \nthinking about politics and the next election.\n  We all know the bill before us isn't perfect. They should vote to \nstart debate. They can try to make it better. There are many issues I \nam working on for California. There is the Disproportionate Share \nHospital Program. I am working to get better prevention for women.\n  At the end of the day, this is where we are. Health care coverage for \nall of America's families has been an elusive goal since Teddy \nRoosevelt first proposed it nearly a century ago. Our dear friend, \nSenator Ted Kennedy, whom we miss so much, fought for health care right \nhere on this Senate floor from the moment he arrived in the Senate in \n1962 to the moment he died. Today, I am proud to say we are moving \ncloser to fulfilling this promise of health care for all.\n  Robert Kennedy once said:\n\n       Few will have the greatness to bend history itself; but \n     each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and \n     in the total of all those acts will be written the history of \n     this generation.\n\n  This is our time. This is our moment. This is the moment for us to \ncome together as a nation and make sure our people never again have to \nface what Nikki White faced in her last days--filling out forms, \npraying to God she could get health care, not being able to get it, and \ndying at age 32. That is immoral. It is not necessary. We can fix it, \nand we should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I note that this has been a lengthy \ndiscussion already. My guess is that because this is merely a motion to \nproceed to a subject on the floor of the Senate--my guess is that were \nthis motion to be approved, we will have weeks on the floor of the \nSenate talking specifically\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\nabout amendments, about approaches that will strengthen and improve \nsome portions of the legislation that will be before us. The subject is \nhealth care.\n  Frankly, health care is personal to everybody--from senior citizens \non Medicare to people who get their health care policy from their \nemployment, to families who are struggling to pay for increasing costs \nof health care year after year. So the question before the Senate \ntomorrow evening is: Should we debate and vote on these matters? It is \nnot should we approve a health care bill but should we proceed to the \nbill to have a discussion and have some amendments.\n  Health care has changed dramatically in a very short period of time. \nMy background is from a town of 300 people. In my little town, as was \nthe case many decades ago, we had a town doctor in a town of 300 \npeople. It doesn't happen much anymore. We had a doctor, Doc Hill. He \ncame when he was a young man, and he stayed until he died. He delivered \nprobably 1,500 babies. They had a Doc Hill Day once, and all the babies \nhe birthed came to march in the parade in my little hometown.\n  As times changed, medicine changed, things changed. Doc Hill used to \ngo on house calls to the farms, yes, to deliver babies and to deal with \nillness, house calls all around the region. Times changed and those \npractices changed as well.\n  The big debates in the last half century or perhaps century about \nhealth care have, in most cases, advanced health care. I was not here, \nof course, nor were most of my colleagues--I guess a couple of them \nwere perhaps here--during the debate on Medicare. I remember vividly as \na very young boy the old folks in my hometown, some of whom had \nnothing, lived in little shacks, certainly had no health care, no \nhealth care coverage, because when you got old, back in those days, no \ninsurance company wanted to cover you, even if you could pay for \ninsurance. Nobody was chasing old folks to say: Now that you are 70, 80 \nyears old, can't we sell you a health insurance policy? They couldn't \nfind health insurance.\n  Half the senior citizens in this country couldn't get health \ninsurance. So the Congress came together and said: What do we do about \nthe people in their sunset years, those who helped build this country, \nwent to war, built the roads, built communities? What do we do about \nthat? So they passed Medicare.\n  Medicare has been an unbelievable success. Yes, there are financial \nstrains on Medicare, but that is born of success. People are living \nlonger and over a period of a longer life, they often need more health \ncare. But that is a success, not a failure. We have changed medicine in \nour country in many ways. Medicare is one example.\n  Miracle medicines, medicines that did not exist some decades ago now \ncan be used to keep people out of acute care hospital beds. Vaccines \ncan now prevent people from getting sick. Polio was cured. Smallpox was \ncured. Think of the changes over all of these years. And, yes, it is \nthe case that if you have a very serious illness, in most cases you \nwant to be in this country.\n  It is the case, however, that many in this country cannot afford to \naccess the health care that exists. But people come here, not \nelsewhere, for good health care. We have terrific clinics and \nopportunities for people to get good health care in this country. The \nproblem is, the cost is relentlessly increasing every single year and \npricing health care out of the reach of too many Americans. Too many \nfamilies cannot figure out how to pay for health care. They cannot pay \nfor the increased insurance premium that is going up double digits \nevery year. They have to go to the grocery store and stop in the \npharmacy to figure out what a prescription drug is going to cost. They \nbuy their medication first and see what they have left for groceries.\n  The fact is, prices of health care are marching relentlessly upward, \nso too many people do not have coverage. Families often cannot afford \nit. Small businesses cannot afford the price increases for health care. \nSo what do we do about that?\n  If there is a sick child, should a sick child who is crying because \nof pain be told: Your visit to a doctor depends on how much money your \nparents have? I don't think so. So we passed legislation dealing with \nthat, providing health care opportunities for children who come from \nfamilies of meager means.\n  The question for us now is, Is there a way for us to extend health \ncare coverage and also to put the brakes on these relentlessly \nincreasing costs? If at the end of the day legislation that is \nconsidered here does not put the brakes on price or cost increases, I \ndon't want to be a part of that. I am not going to be supporting things \nthat really do not put the brakes on these relentless increases in \nhealth care costs. That is the purpose of all of this, is to try to get \na handle on costs somehow.\n  There was an author named Barbara Ehrenreich who described visiting \nwith a friend of hers from a European country. She told her friend that \nshe had breast cancer and had difficulty getting insurance because she \nhad breast cancer. She said: But isn't that when you would most need \ninsurance? Not understanding, of course, in our country you are least \nlikely able to get what you need when you need it the most.\n  That is another question in this set of issues, preexisting \nconditions. Is there a way for us to make it easier for people to \naccess health insurance when they really need health insurance because \nthey have a debilitating illness? I would hope so.\n  What should happen when you pay an insurance company premiums for 10 \nor 15 years? You pay every month and all of a sudden the insurance \ncompany says: We are going to terminate you. What should happen? Is \nthat fair? I don't think so.\n  Shouldn't there be some opportunities to address those kinds of \nthings--the denial of coverage, the termination of coverage? I think \nso.\n  Let me also say as we discuss these policies, there is another \nelement that is not very often discussed that I want to amplify, and \nthat is the issue of personal responsibility--personal responsibility \nthat goes well outside legislative activities.\n  Two-thirds of the people in this country are overweight. One-third \nare obese, according to statistics. I invited someone from Safeway \nCorporation to meet with our caucus. The CEO of Safeway, Steve Burd, \nhas met with folks in both caucuses in the Senate. He told of a very \ninteresting program at Safeway.\n  I think there were about 45,000 employees in this group, and he did \nthe following. He said: Here is your health insurance plan. Here is the \namount the Safeway company will pay, and here is the amount that you \npay. So that amount the employee pays is X. But the company said to the \nemployees, you can reduce the amount you pay if you do four things. You \ncan reduce it in four steps: Do you have high blood pressure? You have \nto be on medicine to control it, and we will pay for the medicine.\n  Do you have high cholesterol? You have to be on medicine to control \nit, and we will pay for it.\n  Are you overweight? Then you have to be on some sort of weight \nreduction program, and we will pay for that.\n  Are you smoking? Then you have to stop or be in a smoking cessation \nprogram, and we will pay for that.\n  If you don't do any of those things, you don't want to do those \nthings, you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoke, and are \nwell overweight, that is all right, here is your copay. It will be \nhigher. But if you do all four of those things, and the company will \npay in each instance for the cost of it, you will pay four steps below, \nless money every single month.\n  He says with that program, they have had flat health costs for 5 \nstraight years. Think of that: 5 years flat cost. While the rest of the \ncountry is seeing these relentlessly increasing costs, that program \nprovided flat costs, no cost increases. Why? Because they incentivized \npersonal behavior in the right way: Do this, improve your health, we \nwill pay the cost of it and save yourself some money. That is exactly \nthe right thing to do.\n  I hope as we have this discussion, a fair amount of that impulse can \nbe a part of what we are trying to do--incentivize the right behavior, \npersonal responsibility. That makes a great deal of sense to me.\n  One of the things I have always supported is the issue of health care \ncoverage at the workplace. That is where most Americans get their \nhealth care coverage. I don't want to do anything\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\nto disincentivize that. I want, whether it is small, medium, or large \nbusinesses, for us to say: You know what, good for you. You are \nproviding health care to your employees. We support that. I don't want \nto disincentivize that; I want to incentivize that.\n  I know it is hard for small businesses during tough economic times to \npay 10 percent more this year than last year and 10 percent more next \nyear than this year. That is what they are seeing in health care costs. \nThat is why it is important for us to put the brakes on these cost \nincreases, for small businesses, medium-size businesses and large \nbusinesses as well, to help them be competitive.\n  We have to find a way to do that. I am not talking about diminishing \nthe quality of health care. I am saying let's put the brakes on the \nprice increases year after year. Let's find out what is causing it--and \nI have some ideas about that--and let's put the brakes on it. That is \nwhat this debate needs to be about.\n\n  I want to talk about an amendment I intend to offer as soon as we are \nable to offer amendments. It is an amendment, by the way, that is \nbipartisan, unlike a lot of things in this Chamber. My amendment was \ncosponsored by the late Ted Kennedy. It is also cosponsored by Senator \nOlympia Snowe, Senator John McCain, Senator Chuck Grassley, Senator \nDebbie Stabenow, and the list goes on including Republicans and \nDemocrats. The amendment is about prescription drug prices, and I want \nto describe it.\n  It says let's give the American people the freedom to access the \nidentical FDA-approved drugs when they are sold for a fraction of the \nprice everywhere else in the world. The American consumer is charged \nthe highest prices in the world for brand-name drugs.\n  By the way, here is what is happening to price increases for \nprescription drugs. We see the rate of inflation in this country. That \nis the yellow line. Take a look at drug prices, the red line. By the \nway, this past year, there was a 9 percent increase in prescription \ndrug pricing.\n  This issue is not some irrelevant issue. There are a whole lot of \nfolks who use prescription drugs to manage their disease and keep them \nout of a hospital. I understand many of these drugs are miracle drugs. \nI don't want to slow the ability of companies to create drugs, do \nresearch and so on.\n  A substantial amount of the research goes on at the National \nInstitutes of Health, which is publicly funded. The knowledge from that \nresearch is made available to the drug companies, and that knowledge \nleads to a product. Good for them.\n  But what I don't like is the fact that those same pharmaceutical \ncompanies charge the American consumers the highest prices in the \nworld. They will say: If you offer an amendment, you Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats, that tries to give the American people the \nfreedom to access the same identical FDA-approved drug when it is sold \nin Spain or Italy or Canada--name the country--when it is sold in a \nnumber of countries for a fraction of the price, then somehow it will \nharm research and development on new drugs.\n  That is not true at all. Those name-brand drugs are sold for a much \nlower price in Europe, and they do more research in Europe--at least \nthat was a couple years ago. I haven't seen recent data. The fact is, \nthey have lower prices and they have done more research.\n  In any event, there is more money spent on advertising, promotion, \nand marketing than there is on research. Watch television tonight and \nsee when you see the next commercial that says: Shouldn't you be taking \nsome Flomax--whatever that is. Shouldn't you ask the doctor whether the \npurple pill is right for you? Go find a doctor and say: I don't have \nany aches and pains, there is nothing wrong with me, but isn't the \npurple pill right for me? That is what the commercial tells you to do.\n  I haven't the foggiest idea what the purple pill is used for, but \nthey relentlessly push this advertising. Knock it off. Maybe they \nshould use some of that money for a little more research and \ndevelopment, I say.\n  To put a finer point on it, if I might, this is the price of Lipitor. \nThis is the new price, by the way--$4.78 in the United States for a 20-\nmilligram tablet and $2.05 in Canada.\n  By the way, here is what the two bottles look like. The same pill is \nput in these bottles, made by the same company--Lipitor. It is the same \nmanufacturing plant in Ireland. They put the same pill in these two \nbottles. This one goes to the United States; this one goes to Canada. \nThe American consumer has the privilege of paying $4.78 per tablet, and \nthe Canadian buys it for $2.05. That was June 4, 2009, when I priced \nit.\n  It is not just Lipitor, although Lipitor is the most popular \ncholesterol-lowering drug. But Zocor, a 20-milligram tablet, the same \nthing, $5.16, $2.45, U.S. price versus Canadian price. I used Canada \nbecause it is a close neighbor. I could have used Spain, Italy, France, \nGermany.\n\n  By the way, some folks on the floor of the Senate will support the \npharmaceutical industry's pricing policies of pricing their brand-name \ndrugs the highest in the United States--I don't support that. Some \nwill. They will say you can't really import drugs safely. The fact is, \nin Europe they have been importing drugs for 20 years. They have \nsomething called parallel trading. If you are in Germany and want to \nbuy a prescription drug from Spain, no problem. If you are in Italy and \nwant to buy it from France, no problem. You have parallel trading of \nprescription drugs. The consumers have the freedom to buy it where it \nis least expensive.\n  In our country, consumers don't have that freedom, and our amendment \ngives the American consumer the freedom to shop for those prescription \ndrugs where they are sold for the most reasonable prices. I am not \ninterested in having consumers buy their drugs from other countries. I \nam interested in the opportunity to buy drugs at a fraction of the \nprice, forcing the pharmaceutical to reprice their drugs in this \ncountry.\n  I sat on a straw bale once at a farm where we had a town meeting. We \nall sat around on these bales and talked. An old codger there, about 80 \nyears old, said to me: My missus--he meant his wife--my wife has been \nfighting breast cancer for 3 years. Every 3 months, we have driven to \nCanada to buy Tamoxifen. That is the medicine my wife has taken to \nfight breast cancer. Every 3 months, we drive to Canada to buy \nTamoxifen.\n  I said: Why do you drive to Canada?\n  He said: Because it costs me 20 cents for what I would pay a dollar \nin the United States. I can't afford it in the United States, so we \ndrive to Canada.\n  The fact is, they will allow someone like that to drive across with \n90 days of use. But most Americans do not have that opportunity and \nmost Americans could not access that drug from Canada because it would \nbe against the law at this point.\n  I want to give the American people the freedom to be able to access \nFDA-approved drugs, and the legislation I will introduce with my \ncolleagues has the most substantial safety provisions, including batch \nlots and pedigrees on these drugs that will make the entire drug supply \nmuch safer than it is now.\n  Price increases in 2009. The paper this week described what is \nhappening with the pharmaceutical industry in pricing drugs. Enbrel, an \narthritis drug, increased 12 percent this year. Nexium, for ulcers, \nincreased 7 percent this year. Lipitor is up 5 percent this year. \nSingulair is up 12 present this year. Plavix's price increased 8 \npercent this year; that is an anticoagulant. Osteoporosis--if you are \ntaking Boniva, there was an 18-percent increase this year. What is the \ndeal? Does anybody understand what the reason for this is, these kinds \nof unbelievable price increases?\n  I am going to offer this amendment with my colleagues. My expectation \nis if you want to say at the end of the day that you have really done \nsomething to address the issue of skyrocketing prices in health care--\nyou can't say that if you decide you are not going to do something to \nput the brakes on prescription drug pricing, because the American \npeople should no longer pay the highest prices for brand-name drugs in \nthe world. That is not something that should be allowed. It is \ncertainly not something that is fair to the American people and not \nsomething that we ought to turn a blind eye to when we are talking \nabout legislation here.\n\n[[Page S11877]]\n\n  My legislation will be about giving the American people freedom--the \nfreedom to access those drugs from a number of other countries named in \nour bill that have an identical chain of custody to our country, where \nit will be safe and secure for the American consumer to access those \ndrugs at a fraction of the cost.\n  I want to say that some are pointing out that the issue of health \ncare is also a jobs issue because the fact is, this is a significant \nburden on employers; that is, those who hire workers and who are \ncovering them with benefits, as part of their compensation including \nhealth care. So it is a jobs issue, and when the burden becomes too \ngreat, it destroys jobs. That is just a fact. So I want to talk about \njobs for a moment because even as we describe these issues, which I \nthink are very important, they relate to jobs. But I want to go further \nto talk about jobs just because I have a bit of time today.\n  I have seen some things in the press recently that have bothered me, \nsome stories. I want to describe them.\n  First of all, Senator Durbin and I are leading a task force to talk \nabout how we put together a new effort to try to create jobs. What \nkinds of incentives will allow small- and medium-size businesses to \ncreate new jobs? What are the things that will get the economic engine \nrestarted, not just in GDP but putting people back on payrolls, putting \npeople back to work?\n  I noticed that small- and medium-size businesses are having great \ndifficulty in this country, even those that want to expand, because \nthey can't find the financing to do it. I saw a report this week about \nthe large financial institutions that got TARP funds, the bailout \nfunds. The 22 banks that got the most help from the Treasury's bailout \nprograms cut their small business loan balances by a collective $10.5 \nbillion over the past six months. And the fact is that Wells Fargo got \n$73.8 billion in TARP funds, and in the last 4 months they have cut the \namount of financing of small business loans by 3.9 percent. Think of \nthat--a company gets $73.8 billion in TARP funds and cuts lending \nneeded by small businesses by 3.9 percent. Bank of America, $41.9 \nbillion in TARP funds, and they cut small business lending by 5 \npercent. I am quoting from a Treasury Department report, by the way, \ncomparing 4/30/90 to 9/30/09. JPMorgan Chase, $25.4 billion in TARP \nfunds, and they cut lending to small business 2.9 percent. American \nExpress--the list goes on. I don't understand this at all.\n  So the question is, How do we try to give some help to small- and \nmedium-size businesses and see if we can restart this economic engine \nso that they can put people back to work? They are the job generators \nin this country. And we are looking for a mix of ideas. What are the \nbest ideas we can use to try to put people back on payrolls?\n  But what I want to talk about just for a moment is something I saw in \nthe Washington Post this week when the President was in Asia. It talks \nabout:\n\n       [Folks from the] 21 Pacific Rim Nations at an annual event \n     that this year has put some of America's policies in the line \n     of fire.\n       A chorus of complaints about U.S. trade policies . . . in \n     the hour before the President's arrival [in Singapore]. \n     Leaders of Mexico, China and Russia broadly condemned \n     protectionism . . . endorsing free trade as the best engine \n     of growth--\n\n  And so on.\n\n       The bluntest criticism . . . [said] America is moving in \n     the opposite sense of free trade.\n\n  China and others have said the same.\n  Let me just say, it takes an unbelievable amount of gall to suggest \nthat we are moving in the opposite direction of free trade. We have an \nunbelievable trade deficit, and this is a trade deficit with China. It \nis a sea of red ink that has gotten worse and worse--a $266 billion \ndeficit last year, a $266 billion trade deficit with China, and China \nis telling us we have a problem with free trade? They are the ones that \nhave closed markets. We are the sponge for all the goods China wants to \nsend us, only to find out we can't get into their markets. This is \nabout jobs. This is about jobs that leave our country and go there. \nWhen we start talking about how to create jobs, maybe we ought to \nstraighten out this trade mess.\n  Let me say, there is a discussion in the same story about Korea and \nthe trade agreement with Korea. I think it is pretty interesting. This \nis what happened with Korea last year. They sent us about 600,000 cars. \nThey put them on ships and sent them to America to be sold. We were \nable to sell them 100,000 cars. Why? They don't want American cars on \nthe streets of Korea. Ninety-eight percent of the cars on their roads \nare made in Korea because that is what they insist and that is what \nthey want. They are criticizing us about the lack of free trade? That \nis unbelievable.\n  Let me describe the Cash for Clunkers Program in this country. We did \na Cash for Clunkers Program. Yes, it put people in some showrooms and \nsold some cars. The Chinese and the Koreans had cash for clunkers \nprograms. A lot of us would have liked to have said: You know what, if \nyou are going to spend some money on cars, maybe at least spend it on \ncars that are made in manufacturing plants in this country. But that \nwas not a requirement because it was so-called illegal under the WTO \nrules.\n\n  For example, when Japan and Korea decided, for their own economy, on \na cash for clunkers program, they figured out a way to favor their \ndomestically produced cars.\n  In Japan, only 5 percent of the cars were imports and 95 percent were \nmade in Japan because that is the way they wanted it in 2007. After the \ncash for clunkers program, even fewer cars came from imports. Why? \nBecause Japan had what was called a certification requirement that was \nopen to only a small number of foreign vehicles. For example, they \nwould allow the sale of a Toyota Land Cruiser, but you couldn't buy a \nFord Explorer in Japan under the cash for clunkers program.\n  Yet we have these folks saying to us that we are not for free trade? \nExcuse me? How much gall do you have to suggest that a country with a \n$600-plus billion annual trade deficit, $260 billion of which is from \nChina--to have our President go overseas and have others suggest that \nsomehow we are not owning up to our responsibilities in trade?\n  The reason I make this point is this is about jobs. I think \nrestarting the economic engine is an unbelievable priority in this \ncountry. A good job that pays well makes almost everything else \npossible. There is no social program in America as important as a good \njob that pays well. That is what makes everything possible for you and \nyour family.\n  When we see the millions of people who have been laid off as a result \nof the deepest recession since the Great Depression, we need to get \nabout our business. Senator Reid and Senator Durbin and I are working \non that need, to address it. One of the ways to address it is with this \ntrade issue as well.\n  Let me conclude as I started, talking about the bill that is before \nus. The legislation we are dealing with is health care, and the vote \nthat will occur is on the motion to proceed. There is a lot of \nhyperbole about these issues. This is a motion to proceed to a piece of \nlegislation that we will then debate for weeks and we will amend, I \nexpect.\n  I just described one of my amendments that I feel very strongly \nabout. It will be bipartisan. I fully expect it to pass. I have a \ncouple of other amendments as well that I will offer.\n  I don't want health care to be concluded by the Congress in some way \nor another without the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which has \nbeen languishing for many years here in the Congress, being a part of \nit. These are the first Americans, and too often these days the first \nAmericans have second-class health care despite the fact that we signed \nthe treaties on the dotted line and we owned up to the trust \nobligations that we have, that we have never quite delivered in health \ncare, housing, and education. I have spent a lot of time, as have some \nof my colleagues, on the subject of the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct. I hope very much that in this discussion--and I certainly will \nraise it as an amendment--we will have the opportunity to do what we \nneed to do with respect to Indian health care.\n  I know there will be a lot of opportunity in the coming weeks to \ndescribe virtually all the things people want to describe about every \nsingle issue. I want to come back to something I mentioned in the \nmiddle of my presentation; that is, personal responsibility.\n  We can do all we want to do. We can have all kinds of legislation. \nBut there also has to be some personal responsibility with respect to \nhealth care. I\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\nhope, whatever we do legislatively, if, in fact, at the end of the day \nthe legislation moves forward, I hope we remember the lessons we have \nlearned from some companies around the country that are deciding that \npersonal responsibility and the incentives for that kind of personal \nbehavior is the right way to address some of these rising costs of \nhealth care. Certainly the Safeway example I described is in that \ngenre.\n  Our time is about up. I want to say again that we will vote tomorrow \nnight, come back after Thanksgiving, and my guess is that for 3 or 4 \nweeks we will have a substantial, generous amount of discussion about \nhow best to put the brakes on health care costs. This has to be done in \na way that is fiscally responsible. It has to be done in a way that is \neffective. If not, there ought not be legislation passed, in my \njudgment. If so, if we can do this in a way that is fiscally \nresponsible, in a way that helps the American people and begins to put \nthe brakes on the skyrocketing health care costs, then I would want to \nbe part of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, transforming American health care so that \nmore Americans get good health care at home, instead of only in a \ndoctor's office, is an idea whose time has come.\n  Quality, affordable home-based care makes sense for patients. It \ngenerates good-paying jobs for our people and sparks development of \nexciting technologies through research that will pay even bigger \ndividends in the years ahead. Care at home is an idea that Democrats \nand Republicans, conservatives and progressives, can all come together \non and get behind.\n  Right now, getting to see a doctor in their office can be an onerous \nprocess. You start by calling the doctor's office and testing your \npatience while you sit through menu after menu of options just to get \npast the doctor's voicemail system. You are in trouble if you don't \nlisten carefully and miss the option you wanted. You might get sent to \nrecords or accounting and have to start all over again. After you have \nrun that gauntlet, you have to match your schedule up to whatever days \nthe doctor's in. With doctors having other obligations like surgeries \nor teaching, you could be up against a schedule where the doctor only \nhas office hours a few days a week. That will lead to your getting an \nappointment two months from now. That won't do much good if you are \nsick today.\n  Once you have won that prized appointment, you have to navigate to \nthe doctor's office on the day in question. In rural areas, you might \nend up driving yourself and your family long distances to get there. In \nurban areas, workers lose a big part of their day getting themselves, \nor maybe their elderly parent, to and from the doctor's office or \nhospital. That can be a difficult task if your parents have a hard time \ngetting around at home--never mind getting them from the car to the \ndoctor's office safely. By the time you get to the doctor's waiting \nroom, you feel like you have run a marathon. It's the opposite of the \nwell-oiled machine you would expect from a country that leads the world \nin health care innovation.\n  Our current health care system seems modern, but it is actually based \non a 19th century model of institutionalized health care. It is like \nriding a horse-drawn wagon all the way from here to Oregon. Just \nbecause the Pioneers did it and found the beauty of Oregon at the end, \nit doesn't mean that is the best way to get there in 2009. Likewise, \njust because the majority of American health care is delivered in a \ndoctor's office or hospital doesn't mean that is the best way either.\n  There is a lot of wasted time and effort spent on services that could \nbe done more easily--and in some cases, more effectively--done from \nhome thanks to something called ``telehealth technologies.'' Telehealth \ntechnologies are simple-to-use, home-based systems that use tools, such \nas home security sensors and the internet to connect patients to their \nmedical providers. Home telehealth has already been used by the \nVeterans' Administration and has lowered costs for treating patients \nwith multiple chronic diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure.\n  Here's how it works. Some systems help patients with chronic \nconditions like diabetes or high blood pressure send their daily blood \nsugar or blood pressure readings straight to their medical \nprofessional. There, the readings can be checked and monitored for \nsigns that the patient's care needs to be adjusted. Sudden weight \ngains, which can be a sign that someone's about to go into congestive \nheart failure, can also be noted and addressed right away, so that the \npatient can be treated and avoid that outcome.\n  These are just a few of the ways that telehealth technologies can \nhelp patients better manage their health issues from home, instead of \nwaiting for their occasional checkup in a doctor's office, when it \nmight be too late to correct their health problems. Telehealth \ntechnologies give medical professionals a new tool by increasing the \namount of data they can collect on their patients over a long period of \ntime. That aggregated information improves the quality of care that the \npatient then receives when they do visit the doctor's office.\n  Some of these telehealth technologies are so advanced they sound like \nscience fiction, but they are real, they are here today and they need \nto be part of building our new health care system. They offer more than \njust unique, time-saving solutions. Telehealth technologies also open a \nnew world of jobs and services that will shore up our economy with \ngood-paying work right here at home.\n  Researchers from around the country are working to tap the potential \nof these technologies, and I am proud to report that much of the \ncutting edge work is being done in the Pacific Northwest. Their \ndiscoveries address everything from depression to neurological \ndisorders. For example, new technologies can help isolated seniors stay \nconnected to the world through a variety of social networking sites. \nThis would be a simple, high-tech fix that can help cure the loneliness \nthat so many seniors suffer from, and that often leads to depression. \nSome seniors with cognitive issues are being taught how to use personal \ncomputers to play games that exercise the brain, like Sudoku puzzles. \nNeurologists can then analyze the changes in patients' success at the \ngames over time and to understand how and when their cognitive \nabilities start to deteriorate.\n  Technologies like this give us the chance to learn about devastating \ndiseases like Alzheimer's so that, hopefully, we can one day find new \ndrugs and treatments for those who suffer from it.\n  Other technologies are moving forward to help those with memory loss \nand help to improve the quality of life for our seniors. ``Caller ID on \nSteroids'' is what one technology has been called that would be life-\nchanging, and give them more confidence as they age, despite possible \nmemory loss. It is a system that brings up a whole host of information \non a senior's telephone every time someone calls. The system would show \na photo of the person and their name. It would tell them the last time \nthey spoke on the phone--and even a brief description of what they \ntalked about. Another new invention would help seniors remember to take \ntheir medications on schedule.\n  There is a day-a-week pill caddy with sensors built it to tell \nwhether or not a patient had come close to it or opened the particular \nday's drawer. A screen on the caddy displays reminders or hints about \nhow to take the medication. This kind of technology improves patients' \nadherence to taking their medications as prescribed, which increases \ntheir effectiveness and improves their overall health. Imagine the \ndifferences these kinds of technology would make in the life of a \nsenior who is suffering frightening and debilitating memory loss.\n  In the case of neurological illnesses like Parkinson's disease, \ntelehealth has been shown to be a better way to manage medications and \npersonalize treatment. Parkinson's patients can perform neurological \ntests on a laptop at home and have their success at these tasks \nreported to the doctor in real time. No longer will an annual visit to \nthe doctor be the only opportunity to demonstrate how their illness is \nprogressing and be the basis for the prescription the doctor writes. \nThis kind of innovation could improve the quality of life for such \npatients and reduce the physical and economic toll that unnecessary \nmedications cause.\n  But telehealth technologies do more than just help patients. There \nare some\n\n[[Page S11879]]\n\nthat also help the people who care for them. Many caregivers for people \nwith Alzheimer's find themselves, caring for their patients in the \nmiddle of the night. Telehealth technologies have been developed to let \nsomeone else from their caregiver support group know that they're up \nand available to talk, even at 3:30 in the morning. A ``presence lamp'' \nsystem uses simple home security sensors and the internet to turn on a \nlamp in one person's home when their friend also happens to be awake in \nthe middle of the night, and vice versa. It becomes a lifeline between \nfamily caregivers who could reach out for emotional and social support, \neven in those darkest and bleakest of hours.\n  All these innovations point to the fact that a technological \nrevolution is going on right now in home health care solutions, and \nit's time health care reform brought those solutions into the mix. If \ndone right, reform should do more than give affordable, quality care to \nall Americans. As these technologies prove, health care reform should \nalso stimulate the economy with new jobs and industries that will allow \nus to care for our rapidly aging population.\n  Home health care will help put America at the forefront of a new \nhealth care services industry that will generate more than a million \nnew jobs that can never be outsourced. Those jobs will come from \ninventing new home-based care technologies and using those technologies \nto deliver virtual and remote care services here at home and abroad.\n  I have already introduced legislation that uses the concept of \ncoordinated home health care to help people on Medicare live healthier \nby managing their chronic conditions and reducing duplicative and \nunnecessary services, hospitalization, and other health care costs. \nThis bill has broad bipartisan support, from Senators Burr and \nChambliss to Senators Stabenow, Mikulski, and, previously, the late \nSenator Kennedy.\n  My bill, the Independence at Home Act, establishes a 3-year Medicare \npilot project that helps Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic \nconditions remain independent for as long as possible in a comfortable \nenvironment. It provides for coordinated-care programs that hold \nphysicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other team \nmembers accountable for quality, patient satisfaction, and mandatory \nminimum savings. The act was accepted into the Senate Finance Committee \nhealth reform bill and I will pull out all the stops to see it included \nas part of the final health reform legislation that the Senate will \nvote on.\n  Before Congress finishes writing the bill for 21st century health \ncare reform, it is important to define what Americans are paying for, \nhow best to deliver much-needed personalized care to patients where \nthey live, work, and play, and how to make the U.S. a world leader in \nhome-based care industries. The home can become a fundamental location \nfor health and wellness and also a priority for reform. In addition, \nall this can be done with a focus on stimulating our economy with new \njobs, technologies, and services for a world that will share the \nchallenge of caring for an aging population.\n  I encourage my colleagues to ensure that health care reform is about \nnew approaches to patient care, quality of life, and growing old with \nindependence and dignity, not just about who's paying the bill. This is \na chance to redesign our health care system with a new vision that sees \nthe patient as the center of a more efficient and effective system. It \nis a chance to change our health care system to one that helps prevent \ndisease, treat patients, support family caregivers, and enable seniors \nto maintain their independence, by bringing health care reform home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11879-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Zorn\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to express our Nation's \ndeepest thanks and gratitude to a special young man and his family. I \nwas saddened to receive word that on November 16, 2009, SSG Ryan Zorn \nof Wright, WY, was killed in the line of duty while serving our country \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Staff Sergeant Zorn died near \nthe town of Talifar in northwestern Iraq from injuries sustained when \nhis armored vehicle overturned.\n  Staff Sergeant Zorn was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 34th Armor \nRegiment, 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, out of Fort Riley, KS. \nStaff Sergeant Zorn grew up in Upton, WY, and joined the Army following \nhis graduation from Upton High School. He loved his country, and loved \nserving his country. His mother JoAnn says this is what he lived for. \nHe was on his third tour of duty in Iraq. His family and his faith were \nvery important to him. Friends and neighbors remember him as always \nopen and friendly, with a broad smile and a wonderful sense of humor. \nHe was dependable and generous, always willing to help others without \nhesitation.\n  It is because of Ryan Zorn that we are allowed to go about our daily \nlives as free people. America's men and women who answer the call to \nservice and willingly bear the burdens of defending our Nation deserve \nthe deepest respect and gratitude of all Americans. They put their very \nlives on the line every day, and because of them and their families, \nour Nation remains free and strong in the face of danger.\n  Jesus says in the Book of John that, ``Greater love has no man than \nthis, that he lay his life down for his friend.'' SSG Ryan Zorn gave \nhis life, that last full measure of devotion, for you, me, and every \nsingle American. He gave his life serving and defending his country and \nits people, and we honor him for this selfless sacrifice.\n  Staff Sergeant Zorn is survived by his mother JoAnn, his father \nMyron, and his brother Todd. He is also survived by his brothers and \nsisters in arms of the U.S. Army. We say goodbye to a son, a brother, a \nfriend, and an American soldier. The United States of America pays its \ndeepest respect to SSG Ryan L. Zorn for his courage, his love of \ncountry and his sacrifice, so that we may remain free. He was a hero in \nlife and he remains a hero in death. All of Wyoming, and indeed the \nentire Nation, is proud of him. May God bless him and his family and \nwelcome him with open arms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11879-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11879-S11880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, each November, we celebrate National \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month to honor the original \ninhabitants of our great nation and celebrate their formative impact on \nAmerican history. This month is an opportunity to promote the tenets of \ntribal sovereignty and recommit to the Federal Government's treaty and \ntrust responsibilities to American Indians. I would like to personally \nhonor the nine treaty tribes of South Dakota: the Cheyenne River Sioux, \nthe Crow Creek Sioux, the Flandreau Santee Sioux, the Lower Brule \nSioux, the Oglala Sioux, the Rosebud Sioux, the Sisseton-Wahpeton \nOyate, the Standing Rock Sioux, and the Yankton Sioux. Each tribe's \nrich heritage greatly influences the character of South Dakota.\n  It is fitting that hundreds of tribal leaders journeyed to our \nNation's Capital in early November to participate\n\n[[Page S11880]]\n\nin the White House Tribal Nations Conference. President Barack Obama \nhas committed to placing American Indian issues at the center of his \nadministration, and the multiday conference was an important testament \nto the President's pledge to involve American Indian people in \nconstructive dialogue. The conference allowed leaders from the 564 \nfederally recognized tribes to interact directly with the President and \nrepresentatives from the highest levels of the administration. The \ntribal leaders in attendance displayed the very diverse face of Indian \nCountry. Each individual tribe forms a distinctive chapter of the \nAmerican Indian story, yet the narrative contains many common themes of \ntriumph and tragedy.\n  President Bill Clinton hosted the first tribal nations conference at \nthe White House in 1994. It is not without precedent that President \nObama invited leaders from all federally recognized tribes; however, I \nbelieve that this year's event is unmatched in its potential for \nprogress. President Obama has charged each Cabinet agency with \ndelivering a detailed plan of how to improve tribal consultation and \nhow to address the complex challenges facing Indian Country. This \nCongress, with the leadership of President Obama, has an exceptional \nopportunity to improve the quality of life for American Indian tribes \nby consulting with tribal leaders and focusing on tribal sovereignty \nand the empowerment of Indian communities. For far too long, American \nIndians have endured a drastically underfunded health care system, \ncrumbling education facilities, dismal economic prospects, and a subpar \nstandard of living. It is essential to address this erosive cycle of \npoverty and marginalization in a thoughtful manner.\n  The diversity of American Indian tribes reflects the vibrant origins \nof our Nation. As the First Americans, sound American Indian policy is \na precursor to our Nation's capacity to evolve and progress in an ever \nchanging, diversifying society. We need to celebrate the proud ancestry \nand incredible sacrifices of American Indians. National American Indian \nand Alaska Native Heritage Month reminds us to promote diversity rather \nthan suppress it, as diverse values and cultures erect the foundation \nof the United States.\n  American Indians contributed to the formation of modern political \ninstitutions as tribal confederacies influenced the foundations of \nearly American democracy. In every conflict since the Revolutionary \nWar, tribal members have courageously sacrificed their lives to help \ndefend and preserve these democratic ideals. As the Federal Government \nworks to assert a modern environmental ethic that can address climate \nchange and natural resource scarcity, we have much to learn from \nAmerican Indian communities. The environmental consciousness inherent \nin tribal culture promotes conservation and sustainability. American \nIndian communities have demonstrated that society can thrive and \nprosper without destroying the natural environment.\n  I hope this month provides students with the opportunity to explore \nthe Thanksgiving story from the American Indian point of view. \nObservance of National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month \nreaffirms this Nation's respect for American Indian people. I encourage \neveryone to participate in our celebration of American Indians. I would \nlike to pay tribute to the more than 65,000 American Indians in South \nDakota whose heritage enriches our communities. While the month of \nNovember serves as an important testament to American Indian culture, \nit is critical to make a daily commitment to advancing the quality of \nlife of American Indians, in order for our Nation to walk forward with \nstrength and purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11880-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE DAY\n\n  Mr JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Saturday, \nNovember 21, as National Survivors of Suicide Day. National Survivors \nof Suicide Day is a day of healing for those who have lost someone to \nsuicide. In 1999, a Senate resolution created this annual event behind \nthe efforts of Senator Harry Reid, who lost his father to suicide. This \nyear, on November 21, over 230 conferences will take place \ninternationally to allow survivors of suicide to connect with others \nwho have experienced the tragedy of suicide loss.\n  The statistics about suicide are deeply concerning. In our Nation, \nsuicide is the eleventh leading cause of death for all ages. Among \nyoung adults ages 15-24, there are approximately 100-200 attempts for \nevery completed suicide. Suicide takes the lives of approximately \n30,000 Americans each year, and a person dies by suicide about every 16 \nminutes. Suicide is an epidemic that tears families and communities \napart, and we must do all that we can to prevent it.\n  A suicide survivor is an individual who has lost someone to suicide. \nIt is estimated that for each suicide, seven other lives are altered \nforever because of the death. Every year, approximately 200,000 people \nbecome survivors due to this tragic loss of life. Many suicide \nsurvivors are left devastated, confused and weakened by their loss. \nFriends and family often experience depression, guilt, shock and anger. \nUnfortunately, there remains a stigma surrounding suicide and mental \nillness, and victims often shoulder some of the blame.\n  South Dakota is among a group of Western States that consistently has \na higher rate of suicide than the rest of the country. The suicide rate \nfor American Indians ages 15-34 is more than two times higher than the \nnational average and is the second leading cause of death for this age \ngroup. The loss of these young people is a real crisis. We must provide \ntribes with the resources they need to implement culturally sensitive \nsuicide prevention programs. It is critical to strengthen the social \nfabric to help improve mental health. On American Indian reservations \nin South Dakota, I have seen the catastrophic ripple effect that one \nsuicide can have. Given the alarming occurrence of ``suicide clusters'' \nand imitative deaths that have occurred in Indian Country this year, it \nis imperative to provide support for those left behind.\n  I hope that National Suicide Survivors Day is an opportunity to \npromote the broad based support that each survivor deserves. We are not \ndoing enough to fight this tragic epidemic that is taking the lives of \nso many in our communities. We must concentrate our efforts on \naddressing the root causes of suicide in Indian Country and throughout \nthe Nation. It is critical to expand access to mental health services, \nincluding a focus on education, prevention and intervention. \nFurthermore, we need to acknowledge the obstacles that suicide \nsurvivors face during their grieving and encourage the involvement of \nsurvivors in healing activities and prevention programs. This is one of \nthe goals of the South Dakota Strategy for Suicide Prevention. Finally, \nI believe that with appropriate support and treatment, suicide \nsurvivors can lead effective advocacy efforts to eliminate stigma and \nreduce the incidence of suicide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11880-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11880-S11881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN DIABETES MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize November as \nAmerican Diabetes Month. National studies estimate 23.6 million \nAmericans live with diabetes, and nearly one-quarter of this population \nhas not yet been diagnosed. The number of South Dakotans living with \ndiabetes has doubled since 1998, with more than 39,000 adults diagnosed \nas diabetics in 2008 and an estimated 10,000 not yet diagnosed.\n  American Diabetes Month focuses on increasing awareness of the \ndisease, strengthening prevention efforts, and identifying associated \nhealth risks. The disease carries with it an increased rate of heart \ndisease and stroke, high blood pressure, kidney disease, blindness, and \namputation of the lower extremities, among other associated health \nproblems. For the past few decades, the prevalence of overweight and \nobesity has steadily increased nationwide, increasing the prevalence of \ntype 2 diabetes. As the prevalence of diabetes increases, we are \nbeginning to understand the costs to both our citizens' health and to \nour economy. The high costs to our government in direct medical and \nindirect costs of lost productivity, coupled with the personal costs of \nrising health care coverage and treatment, make type 2 diabetes control \nand prevention a national priority.\n\n[[Page S11881]]\n\n  Throughout my career, I have strongly supported initiatives to \nadvance diabetes research, prevention, and education efforts. I commend \nthe work conducted at the National Institutes of Health, the National \nInstitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention to explore cures and \ntreatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and prevent the development \nof type 2 diabetes.\n  Americans diagnosed with diabetes, whether insured or not, often face \nsignificant barriers in receiving timely, affordable treatment in our \ncurrent health care system. Congress is currently considering \ncomprehensive reform of our Nation's health care system. This is a \nhistoric opportunity to improve access to quality, affordable health \ncare for all Americans and better manage the treatment of chronic \ndiseases. Given the cost of diabetes to our citizens' health and \npersonal finances and to our national economy, we must also continue to \npush to increase funding for diabetes research and prevention programs. \nAmerican Diabetes Month provides an opportunity to learn more about the \ncauses and health risks of diabetes and recognize its impact on our \nNation and our families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11881-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               REMEMBERING SERGEANT WINFIELD THOMPSON SR.\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the life \nof SGT Winfield Thompson Sr., an honored member of the Sisseton-\nWahpeton Oyate. When this war hero and South Dakota native passed away \nNovember 6, 2009, our State lost a respected tribal member and a \nwonderful citizen who served as an inspiration to us all.\n  After entering the U.S. Army in April 1941, SGT Winfield Thompson Sr. \nwas captured by Japanese forces in the Philippines on April 9, 1942. He \nwas forced to march 90 miles over rough terrain with little food and \nwater along with thousands of captured soldiers in what is today known \nas the Bataan Death March. After his capture, Sergeant Thompson was \nheld at various prison camps and suffered horrible conditions until he \nwas finally liberated in September 1945. Upon his rescue, he stood at \nattention, saluted, and said, ``Sergeant Thompson reporting to duty, \nSir.'' During Sergeant Thompson's extraordinary military career, he was \nawarded the Prisoner of War Medal, American Defense Service ribbon with \nBronze Star, Victory Medal, Asiatic Pacific Theater Ribbon with three \nbronze battle stars, Philippine Defense Ribbon, eight Overseas Service \nBars, one Service Stripe and the Good Conduct Medal.\n  After his honorable discharge from the U.S. Army in May 1946, \nSergeant Thompson returned home and married Virginia Redday. Winfield \nand Virginia were blessed with 7 children, 16 grandchildren, and 29 \ngreat-grandchildren. Winfield was preceded in death by his wife.\n  SGT Winfield Thompson Sr. embodied South Dakota values with his \nunwavering devotion to family and country, and I extend my deepest \nsympathies to his family on the loss of this great man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11881-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM J. ROGERS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish today to extol the enormous \nlegacy of selfless service, contribution, and, above all, patriotism of \nan extraordinary Mainer and American, William J. Rogers, and to \nrecognize with the highest esteem the American Legion Post in Auburn, \nME, founded by Bill and his fellow veterans, which will be \nappropriately named the ``William J. Rogers American Legion Post 153'' \nin his honor on November 29, 2009. This fitting accolade pays tribute \nto an individual who devoted his life to serving and defending our \ncountry, as well as tirelessly advocating for those who placed their \nlives in harm's way on our behalf--our courageous veterans.\n  Bill was one of the great sons of my hometown of Auburn, ME, where my \nroots run deep. In fact, on a personal note, I am proud to say we both \ngraduated from the same high school, Edward Little. As fate would have \nit, years later, I enjoyed the pleasure of having Bill and his lovely \nwife, Connie, as wonderful neighbors of mine on Nottingham Road.\n  As a young man, Bill answered his country's call to serve during \nWorld War II and joined the U.S. Navy, training to be a pilot at the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill along with Boston Red Sox \nlegends, Ted Williams and Johnny Pesky Bill's roommate. As a naval \naviator, Bill fought heroically and was awarded the Air Medal and \nPresidential Unit Citation for his wartime service, having deployed to \nfight in the Pacific, where he valiantly flew F6F Hellcats and Lockheed \nVenturas.\n  While Bill departed from active military service in 1946, his \ncommitment to veterans and a lifetime of advocacy on their behalf was \njust beginning. Bill was a founding member of American Legion Post 153 \nin Auburn, where he held several offices at both the local and State \nlevels including adjutant, vice commander, and department commander. On \nthe national level, Bill became Maine's national executive \ncommitteeman, a member of the liaison committee to the National Public \nRelations Commission, and from 1965 to 1966 national vice commander. In \n1976, Bill received the tremendous distinction of being elected \nnational commander of the American Legion, the first national commander \nfrom the State of Maine--and we could not have been more proud.\n  Traveling more than 300,000 miles throughout the world in all 50 \nStates and 17 countries, Bill was the voice of Legionnaires and \nveterans, meeting with leaders such as President Ford and President \nCarter. Maine and our Nation could not have had a better champion for \nthe American Legion and our brave and noble veterans than Bill Rogers.\n  Throughout his life, in word and deed, Bill placed service above self \nand country above self-interest. He held sacred our country's \nobligation to stand by those who have stood by us, and I cannot imagine \na more perfect testament to this outstanding Mainer and American who \nplaced such a high premium on contributing to our Nation than to name \nAuburn's American Legion Post after him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11881-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11881-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11881-5", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11881-S11882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1599.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the \nSecretary of Energy to carry out programs to develop and demonstrate 2 \nsmall modular nuclear reactor designs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nuclear \nPower 2021 Act, which is cosponsored by Senator Murkowski and Senator \nUdall from Colorado.\n  This bill, along with Senator Udall's bill S. 2052 are designed to \ngive the Department of Energy a set of specific programmatic \nauthorities to help address ways to lower the up-front capital cost of \nnuclear reactors. The National Academies of Science in their recent \nAmerica's Energy Future study determined that by 2030 we will need \nessentially to double the existing base load power provided by nuclear \nenergy or about another 100 gigawatts.\n  But before we can make such a large and dramatic increase in nuclear \nenergy, I believe we must demonstrate the ability to construct ``first-\nmover'' reactors in the U.S. that are on cost and schedule. The \nNational Academies likewise confirmed this as one of two principal \ndemonstrations that must be carried out during the next decade to more \nfully understand the range of available options for controlling carbon \nemissions from energy production. The other challenge of commensurate \nimportance that they identified is the demonstration of carbon capture \nand sequestration on a large scale for fossil-fuel based energy \nproduction.\n  In that regard, the bill I am introducing today addresses the topic \nof small modular reactors, which are typically rated with a capacity of \nless than 300 electrical megawatts; and that can be constructed and \noperated in combination with similar reactors at a single site. These \nreactors can be less capital intensive than the larger 1,000 megawatt \nreactors currently being licensed at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; \nthey have the potential to be built in a modular fashion much like our \ncurrent fleet of nuclear submarines.\n  This bill is similar to the Department of Energy's Nuclear Power 2010 \nprogram; it concentrates not so much on the research and development of \nthese reactors but demonstrating the ability to license them. Senator \nUdall's bill authorizes the Department to conduct research on these \nreactors with the goal of reducing cost while operating them in a safe \nand secure fashion.\n  More specifically, this bill authorizes the Secretary of Energy to \nwork in a public private partnership to develop a standard design for \ntwo modular reactors, one of which will not be more than 50 megawatts; \nobtain a design certification from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nfor each design by 2018; and obtain a combined operating license from \nthe Commission by 2021.\n  All of this effort would be cost shared by non-federal funds and \nselected under competitive merit review process while emphasizing \nefficiency, cost, safety and proliferation resistance.\n  The climate change issue we face today is too large to exclude any \none\n\n[[Page S11885]]\n\ntechnology that can produce energy without emitting carbon dioxide. The \nNational Academies report acknowledges the important role nuclear \nenergy has and must play in a carbon constrained energy world; this \nbill I hope is another step to address some of the recommendations of \nthis report. I hope my colleagues join me as cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2812\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill tb amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure more timely access to home health services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Conrad to introduce legislation to ensure that our seniors and \ndisabled citizens have timely access to home health services under the \nMedicare program.\n  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives \nand clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important \nroles in the delivery of health care services, particularly in rural \nand medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be \nin scarce supply. In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in \n1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services \nprovided by these health professionals as long as those services are \nwithin their scope of practice under state law.\n  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered \nnurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home \nhealth services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only \nphysicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for \nMedicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the \npatient's case as the non-physician provider. In fact, in many cases, \nthe certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the \npatient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, \nphysician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse \nmidwife to order the medically necessary home health care. At best, \nthis requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps \nto the process before home health care can be provided. At worst, it \ncan lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home \nhealth care they need simply because a physician is not readily \navailable to sign the form.\n  The inability of advanced practice registered nurses and physician \nassistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for \nMedicare beneficiaries in medically underserved areas, where these \nproviders may be the only health care professionals available. For \nexample, needed home health care was delayed by more than a week for a \nMedicare patient in Nevada because the physician assistant was the only \nhealth care professional serving the patient's small town, and the \nsupervising physician was located 60 miles away.\n  A nurse practitioner told me about another case in which her \ncollaborating physician had just lost her father and was not available. \nAs a consequence, the patient experienced a two-day delay in getting \nneeded care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another \nphysician. Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ridiculous \nthat she can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute \nfacility but cannot order home health care. One of her patients had to \nwait 11 days after being discharged before his physical and \noccupational therapy could continue simply because the home health \nagency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation \nof the same therapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to \nauthorize when the patient was in the facility.\n  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act will help to ensure \nthat our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care that they need \nwhen they need it by allowing physician assistants, nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives \nto order home health services. Our legislation is supported by the \nNational Association for Home Care and Hospice, the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American \nCollege of Nurse Practitioners, the American College of Nurse Midwives, \nthe American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and the Visiting Nurse \nAssociations of America. I urge all of my colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2815. A bill to extend certain housing-related deadlines in the \nHeartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I have introduced a bill to extend \ndeadlines by one year for three provisions in the Heartland Disaster \nTax Relief Act of 2008.\n  The Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act has been critical in rebuilding \nthe lives and communities of those affected by the terrible floods and \ntornadoes from last year.\n  Because of delays in Federal funding and tighter credit conditions, \nmany homeowners affected by the 2008 floods and storms will be unable \nto meet the deadline for the tax relief intended to help with recovery.\n  It is only fair to extend the deadline and give these homeowners the \nchance to recover and rebuild. A lot of people are still trying to fix \ntheir ruined homes or move on to new housing. A house is ruined in a \nfew minutes, but banks and governments take what seems like an \neternity.\n  The first provision is a one-year extension of the provision allowing \ndisaster victims with damage to their primary residence to use their \nown assets\n\n[[Page S11886]]\n\nto buy a new home or repair an existing home by withdrawing money from \ntheir retirement plans without tax penalties.\n  The second provision is a one-year extension of a provision allowing \ndisaster victims that have borrowed from their retirement account for \ndisaster recovery to repay their own account without penalty.\n  The final provision is a 1-year extension of a provision allowing \ndisaster victims whose banks cancel mortgage debt to not have the \ncancelled debt counted as taxable income. I urge my colleagues to help \nme in getting this important legislation enacted into law as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to engage in a colloquy with my Republican colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this is the health care bill. There are a \nlot of things in this bill that I object to. The $2.5 trillion cost, \nthe 24 million people still left uninsured, the unconscionable $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion cuts to Medicare and our senior citizens, with another $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in job-killing tax increases, in my view, the stunning \nassaults on liberty, and the Orwellian policies making health insurance \neven more expensive--any one of these things would make me vote no on \nthis bill. But one issue has me troubled the most; that is, the issue \nof rationing. We have several of my colleagues here who will speak to \nthis subject, and we will engage in a colloquy. I don't think this \nissue has sunk in with the American people and, for that matter, the \nmedia.\n  I want everyone to understand something. This bill aims to control \nthe government's spending by rationing your access to health care. Let \nme repeat that. This bill aims to control the government's spending by \nrationing your access to health care. There are at least four \ngovernment entities--we decided to call them ``the rationers''--that \nwill stand between you and your doctor, and these four entities are \nrepresented by the four walls on this chart behind me blocking the \ndoctor-patient relationship. You can see a pair of senior citizens and \nwith frowns on their faces and then we have the rationers. We have an \ninstitute, a board, a center, and a task force, some of which are in \nplace now and some are not. But every Senator should know about them \nand every health care recipient or especially senior citizen should \nknow about them. Senator Reid's bill establishes the Patient-Centered \nOutcomes Research Institute--that is the first wall--to conduct \nsomething called comparative effectiveness research, or CER, which is \nresearch that compares two or more of the same treatment options for \nthe same condition to see which one works best. That sounds like a good \nidea. But, unfortunately, when CER is conducted by a government under \npressure to meet a budget, it can be manipulated in some very sinister \nand counterproductive ways, as has been demonstrated by the United \nKingdom's CER Institute. They call theirs the National Institute for \nHealth and Clinical Excellence. The acronym is NICE, but NICE is not \nvery nice in Great Britain.\n  NICE is notorious for delaying or outright denying access to health \ncare treatments based on CER that takes into account the cost of the \ntreatment and the government's appraisal of the worth of the patient's \nlife or comfort. Some of the more shocking CER decisions handed down by \nNICE over the years include: restricting access to drugs to save \nseniors' vision from macular degeneration until the patient is blind in \none eye, inconceivable; denying access to breakthrough treatments for \naggressive brain tumors; and refusing to allow Alzheimer's therapy \nuntil the patient deteriorates.\n  The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute will be the American \nversion of NICE using CER to save the government money by rationing \nyour health care.\n  Over the past few months, I have offered several amendments, along \nwith Senators Kyl, Coburn, and Enzi, to protect American patients from \nNICE-style rationing, to prohibit this bill from valuing cost \ncontainment over the care of patients. Unfortunately, they have all \nbeen voted down on party-line votes in the HELP Committee, the Finance \nCommittee, and previously on the floor.\n  Let's move to the independent Medicare advisory board. That is the \nsecond wall between patients and their doctor. The Obama-Reid bill \nestablishes a new independent Medicare advisory board, an unelected \nbody of 15 experts who\n\n[[Page S11889]]\n\nwill decide Medicare payment policy behind closed doors with minimal \ncongressional input--something that is happening all too often around \nhere. Although the bill says this anonymous board shall not include any \nrecommendation to ration health care, what else would you call denying \ncoverage for Medicare patients based on cost? That is what this board \nwill do--deny payment for knee replacements or heart surgery or \nbreakthrough drugs, all to achieve an arbitrary government spending \ntarget. I don't know what you call that, but I call it rationing. Also \nnotice that this board will necessarily ration access to health care \nbased on age and disability. Its payment policies will only affect the \nelderly and disabled who receive Medicare.\n  What will be a patient's recourse if Medicare refuses to pay for an \ninnovative new therapy that could save or prolong their life? These are \nthe reasons why the Wall Street Journal has dubbed this board the \nrationing commission.\n  Let us move now to the CMS innovation center. We come to the third \nwall between the doctor and patients. The Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, or CMS--and every provider knows what that is--\nadministers the Medicare Program upon which 43 million Americans rely. \nThat is almost 15 percent of the population. CMS already rations care. \nThis has already been referred to by Senator Thune and others in their \ncomments on the floor. It is not authorized to but it does so \nindirectly through payment policies that curtail the use of virtual \ncolonoscopies, certain wound-healing devices, and asthma drugs. In \nfact, courts recently had to intervene to prevent CMS from rationing a \nrelatively expensive asthma drug in Medicare because rationing is \ncurrently against the law.\n  However, the Reid bill establishes a new CMS innovation center which \nwill, for the first time, grant CMS broad authority to decide which \ntreatments to ration.\n  Let's go now to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. That is the \nlast one right here. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is yet \nanother panel of appointed experts--a lot of those in this bill--who \nmake recommendations on what preventive services patients should \nreceive.\n  Currently, the task force recommendations are optional, but the Reid \nbill bequeaths this unelected and unaccountable body with new powers to \ndetermine insurance benefit requirements in Medicare, Medicaid, and \neven in the private market.\n  The task force has already revealed the types of recommendations it \nwill be making. Just last week it decided to reverse its longstanding \nrecommendation that women get regular, routine mammograms to detect \nbreast cancer starting at age 40. One has to wonder if the task force's \nabrupt about face has anything to do with the fact that the Federal \nGovernment's financial responsibility for these screenings and for the \nhealth care needs they could potentially reveal will be greatly \nexpanded if this health care reform bill passes.\n  In the words of one prominent Harvard professor:\n\n       Tens of thousands of lives are being saved by this \n     screening, and these idiots want to do away with it. It's \n     crazy. It's unethical, really.\n\n  The outcry from oncologists, the American Cancer Society, the \nAmerican College of Radiology and breast cancer survivors and families \nacross the country has forced our Health and Human Services Secretary, \nKathleen Sebelius, to backpedal away from the task force \nrecommendation, saying they do not affect government policy. As a \nmatter of fact, Secretary Sebelius said: Let you and your doctor make \nthe decision. But this bill relies on the task force's recommendation, \nsome 14 times throughout the legislation, to set benefits and determine \ncopayments and make grant awards. So contrary to the Secretary's \nassertion, if this bill passes, the recommendation of the task force \nwill become government policy. Not only that, it will be forced onto \nprivate insurers as well.\n  Some may ask, after my comments: Why so cynical? Why not trust these \ntools that they will only be used for good, to advance medical science \nand patient care. I hope that is the case. To those folks I answer by \nshowing this chart over here by Dr. Ezekial Emmanuel and his ``complete \nlives system.'' As many of you know, Dr. Emmanuel is the brother of \nWhite House Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel. He is a bioethicist, one of \nthose special advisers to the President. Perhaps he could actually be \nthe rationing czar.\n  Dr. Emmanuel has published very disturbing ideas on how to ration \ncare, which could be summed up by this ``Brave New World'' humpback \nwhale graph we have here, along with aging groups of the population.\n  Dr. Emmanuel's Complete Lives System--something that sounds a little \nbit like a cure-all elixir sold out of Del Rio, TX--basically works off \nthe premise that the older you are, the more you have lived and, \ntherefore, the less you deserve in terms of health care.\n  I would like to point out that the average age of a Senator is 62--\njust something for all of you to think about, as you look at this chart \ndepicting the Complete Lives System.\n  As shown on this chart, if you are 10 years old, you are doing pretty \ngood right here. Twenty years old, that is when you think you are \nbulletproof and you do not want insurance, but you have a lock under \nthis plan. Thirty years old, you are in pretty good shape. Forty, here \ncomes the roller coaster. Fifty, you are in trouble. Sixty, you might \nas well forget it. Seventy, well, you are off the chart.\n  President Obama has clearly listened to Dr. Emmanuel's counsel. \nRemember his observation in an interview this summer that, as patients \nget closer to the end of their life: ``Maybe you're better off not \nhaving the surgery, but taking the shots and the painkiller'' instead.\n  Well, as someone who falls toward the end of Dr. Emmanuel's bell \ncurve here--as shown over here on this chart--this type of thinking is \nunbelievable: Telling someone they cannot have a knee replacement \nbecause they are too old? How old is too old, according to Dr. \nEmmanuel?\n  The Wall Street Journal reported on the age rationing that occurs in \nCanada. In that country, apparently 57 is too old for hip surgery. \nPerhaps they can drive south and find care right here in the United \nStates. But I am not sure where they will go if this bill passes.\n  The White House may complain that I am taking Dr. Emmanuel's musings \nout of context. My response to that is this: This is the context right \nhere. This is how the government will contain costs. All these policies \nmust be viewed through the prism of these ideas: This institute, this \nboard, this center, this task force follows that blueprint. This is the \ngoal: to save the government money by rationing care, by basing that \nrationing on some pseudoscientific graph such as this. At least in the \nUnited Kingdom they are honest about it.\n  These are the tools of rationing. These tools will restrict your \nability, and your family's ability, to get a knee replacement or a \nbreakthrough cancer drug or treatment for Alzheimer's or a mammogram.\n  They will destroy the American health care system--the best health \ncare system in the world. And they are the main reason why I will vote \nno on this bill.\n  I yield to Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as I rise this evening after months of \neffort and countless hours of meetings, discussions, and markup in the \nSenate Finance Committee to craft a health care reform bill, I have \ncome to the floor to talk strictly about the substance and policy of \none of the most complex and intricate undertakings the Congress has \never confronted.\n  Instead, we are confronted with procedural gyrations that are as \nbaffling to those living outside the beltway as they are, \nunfortunately, for those who would prefer to achieve broader agreement \non some of the most critical elements of health care reform.\n  As one who has worked constructively to forge solutions to this \nendemic problem plaguing our health care system, I think it is \nabsolutely an imperative to ensure affordable health insurance coverage \nto the people of this country. But it must be done in an effective, \ncommonsense, and bipartisan way. It matters what is in those 2,000 \npages.\n  That is why I find it deeply disconcerting that the Senate, in its \nartificially generated haste to begin debate, has resorted to this \nconvoluted\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\nprocess before us in which we first vote to proceed to an empty shell \nbill, which is then replaced with actual health reform legislation that \nis the result of behind-the-scenes integration of the two bills that \nwere passed by the Senate Finance Committee as well as the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  The reality is, beginning our deliberations in the Senate with \ntactics rather than transparency does nothing to enhance credibility \nwith the American public at a time when so many are already \nunderstandably wary of the speed and direction of Congress on this \ntransformational issue.\n  As I have mentioned on numerous occasions, it took a year and a half \nto pass Medicare to cover 20 million seniors. So we simply cannot \naddress health care on the legislative fast track. I am truly \ndisappointed we are commencing this historic debate on one of the most \nsignificant and pressing domestic issues of our time with a process \nthat has drawn a political line in the sand and forestalled our ability \nto arrive at broad consensus on some of the most crucial elements of \nhealth care reform.\n  Again, I arrive at this moment as one who has been fully immersed in \nthis issue with the Senate Finance Committee process and the so-called \nGroup of Six within the committee, where we engaged in deliberations \nfor almost 4 months, intensively, on a weekly basis--recognizing the \nperilous state of health care coverage in America and also recognizing \nthe looming trajectory of unsustainable costs in our health care system \nis a critical problem that, indeed, must be solved.\n  Ten million more Americans have lost their insurance since the last \nattempt at health care reform in 1993. Today, 75 million Americans are \nburdened by inadequate or nonexistent coverage. Over the last decade, \ninsurance premiums alone have risen by 131 percent--if you look at this \nchart, 131 percent, contrasting that with the growth in wages of 38 \npercent and inflation at 28 percent. That is what has happened over \nthis last decade alone when it comes to health insurance costs.\n  In my home State of Maine, from 2001 to 2009, we have been hammered \nwith a stunning 271-percent increase in average health insurance \npremiums in our small group insurance market. It has been estimated by \nthe Business Roundtable that we can expect premiums to grow 166 percent \nby 2019, absent any reform.\n  So given this current trend, health care costs will continue to grow, \nand more than double the rate of inflation, further driving up \npremiums, sending the entirety of our health insurance system into a \ndeath spiral.\n  Health care spending could total over $33 trillion in the next \ndecade, and average costs of an employer-based family health plan will \nreach $30,800 just a decade from now, should we fail to act.\n  So even as everyone has differing opinions on how to address this \nissue, virtually everyone I have encountered agrees the system is \nbroken. In a recent poll that asked: ``How much, if at all, should the \nhealth care system in the U.S. be changed,'' an astounding 84 percent \nsaid either ``a great deal'' or ``a moderate amount''--84 percent.\n  The National Small Business Association reports that 62 percent of \nall small business owners want Congress to enact some kind of reforms--\nand no wonder, as our small businesses have experienced annual premium \nincreases of at least 20 percent, year after year after year.\n  The reality that this is not simply a solution in search of a problem \nis what brought us together in the Senate Finance Committee in the so-\ncalled Gang of 6 that I--and I commend Chairman Baucus and Senator \nGrassley as well. Chairman Baucus wanted to convene on a bipartisan \nbasis earlier this year, which was the only bipartisan effort in any \ncommittee of the House or Senate. We met more than 31 times to debate \npolicy, not politics, in attempting to reach a bipartisan consensus on \nreform legislation. This reflected the kind of extensive, meticulous \nprocess that an issue of this magnitude requires. Because the American \npeople understand intuitively that when you are debating the future of \none-sixth of our economy, and a matter of such personal and financial \nsignificance to every American, we should not be railroading solutions \nalong partisan lines.\n\n  To that point, on a cautionary note for all of us, a recent Gallup \npoll concluded that neither party can boast that a majority of \nAmericans are currently behind them on this issue. Without question, \npeople are already apprehensive about Congress's ability to reform this \nsystem--with Gallup also finding that 66 percent of Americans also \nbelieve their Member of Congress does not have a ``good understanding'' \nof the issues involved in the current debate.\n  Well, if there is one thing I have learned from my more than 30 years \nof legislative experience, it is that the only way to allay people's \nfears is by systematically working through the concerns, the issues, \nand the alternatives. In fact, it was an adherence to those very \ntenants that led up to the Finance Committee markup that was reported \nout of the committee and which I supported because, while far from \nperfect, it produced watershed, bipartisan market reforms and navigated \nthe ideologies on both ends of the political spectrum--by bolstering \nwhat works in our current system, building upon the employer-based \nsystem, and fostering choices, competition in coverage, and changing \nthe accelerating cost curve of our health care spending.\n  At the same time, that was one, albeit significant, step in the \nprocess. As said in my remarks at the conclusion of the markup, it \nwould be imperative moving forward that our course of action give \ndeference to the scope and complexity of the issue--and there should be \nan inclination by the majority to earn broader support. The bottom line \nis, policies that will affect more than 300 million people simply \nshould not be decided by partisan, one-vote-margin strategies.\n  Thinking back over the last century, just consider for a moment if \nSocial Security, civil rights, or Medicare could have been as strongly \nwoven into the fabric of our Nation had they passed by only one vote \nand on purely partisan lines. Instead, as you can see from this chart, \nthese votes all occurred during a time when Democrats controlled both \nthe Congress and the White House.\n  Social Security passed the Senate with 64 percent of Republican \nsupport, 79 percent of Republican support in the House; civil rights, \n82 percent of the Senate Republicans, and in the House, 80 percent of \nRepublicans; Medicare, when it passed, in 1965, had the support of 41 \npercent of Senate Republicans, and in the House, 50 percent of the \nRepublicans.\n  So there was significant bipartisan support because it engendered a \nprocess that yielded bipartisanship and a consensus-based approach. \nThose are not only impressive numbers illustrating the strong \nbipartisan support that landmark legislation has garnered in the past, \nbut they would be nothing short of mythological in today's political \nenvironment. Because at a time when we are supposed to be in a world of \npostpartisan politics, here we are facing a vote along partisan lines. \nWhen it comes to the subject at hand, the most consequential health \ncare legislation in the history of our country and reordering $33 \ntrillion in health care spending over the coming decade, surely, we can \nand must do better.\n  In a recent column, David Broder captured perfectly the path we \nshould be following. He wrote:\n\n       Scholars will also make the point that when . . . complex \n     legislation is being shaped, the substance is likely to be \n     improved when both sides of the aisle contribute ideas.\n\n  I could not agree more. So when it comes to procedural gymnastics \ndesigned to move us to a purely partisan bill as quickly as possible, \non an issue as monumental as health care, that only serves to enhance \npublic cynicism at a time when congressional approval ratings already \nhover consistently in the 20th percentile range and after a vote on the \nHouse reform bill that occurred after a grand total of two amendments \nand 12 hours 32 minutes of debate on almost 2,000 pages of a document.\n  Consider that it has been more than a month since the Finance \nCommittee completed its work on legislation--even as it concluded that, \nwork remained to be done--a month in which progress might have been \nmade toward building greater consensus on some of the most critical and \ncontentious matters in this debate.\n\n[[Page S11891]]\n\n  But that opportunity was regrettably forsaken. I cannot support \nmoving to a health care reform bill on a procedural motion designed to \nprevail not on policy grounds but on partisanship. Because the result \nis, this procedural vote tomorrow presents a serious obstacle if you \nhave substantial concerns about the legislation--as the process going \nforward will likely require a threshold of 60 votes to add, change, or \nremove any major provision, including a public option plan, that was \nnot included in the final Finance Committee legislation.\n  I think we all appreciate the impetus for the public option; that is, \na fundamental mistrust of the insurance industry. That is a sentiment I \nstrongly share, as many have been victimized by their egregious \npractices in denying coverage based on preexisting conditions, \nrescinding coverage because someone actually has the temerity to get \nsick, or discriminating based solely on one's gender.\n  In my home State of Maine, that mistrust couldn't be more profound--\nwhere two companies controlling 88 percent of the market has resulted \nnot only in the inconceivable increases in premiums I described earlier \nbut has forced thousands in my State to purchase plans with a \nremarkable $15,000 deductible for an individual and $30,000 for a \nfamily.\n  As I was told by one of our insurance companies--one of the two in \nMaine that dominate the market--it has become one of the most popular \nplans by virtue of its affordability, by virtue of the fact that it is \nall people can afford in the State of Maine and certainly among small \nbusiness owners. Well, that is unconscionable. That is unacceptable. \nWhen we think of their basic coverage having a $15,000 deductible for \nan individual, $30,000 for a family, that is not what you would \ndescribe as reasonable coverage.\n  In response to that, I have worked to implement principles on which \nmany of us have been adamant: ending flagrantly unfair practices so no \nAmerican can be denied coverage, no policy can be rescinded when \nillness strikes, and no plan can be priced based on health status or \ngender.\n  To address the dearth of competition in the market, we created health \ninsurance exchanges to become a powerful marketplace for creating \ncompetition and lowering premiums by bringing in potentially 30 million \nnew customers, which CBO believes could reduce costs up to 10 \npercent. That is not even talking about the tax credits and the \nsubsidies. So clearly the exchanges will have a significant effect on \nlowering prices through administrative changes in competition.\n\n  I would argue that we have taken these groundbreaking steps to alter \nthe competitive landscape. I strongly believe that inserting a \ngovernment-sponsored plan in today's dysfunctional marketplace--before \nreforms can work to improve the market--could actually inhibit the \nentry of new competitors and could undermine achieving the highly \ncompetitive environment we must have to make industry deliver lower \ncost coverage.\n  Just when we want to provide Americans a wide variety of competitive \nplans, can inserting a public option into smaller States such as my own \nactually encourage new plans to enter those markets or will we see just \na pair of plans--the existing dominant insurer and the government, and \nis that limited option really the choice Americans want? When we also \nconsider the difficulties we have experienced in improving care and \nassuring prompt, fair, and accurate payments in Medicare and Medicaid, \nwe certainly must ask whether a public plan would spur the innovation \nthat is so vital in health care coverage.\n  But we also cannot leave the performance of insurance companies and \nthe success of reform to chance. I have proposed there is a role for a \nFederal safety net plan if affordable choices that are specifically \ndefined aren't offered in a given State. Moreover, under my provision, \ncompanies would submit their pricing a year prior to the open \nenrollment period, and if it is determined that affordable plans aren't \navailable in a State, the insurer would have 30 days to resubmit their \nbid. At that point, if affordable plans still aren't offered, a Federal \nfallback is provided without delay. This will provide the certainty \nthat affordable options exist so that no one falls through the cracks, \nwhile CBO also reports that the threat of a fallback in a State would \nalso pressure industry to lower premiums.\n  In stark contrast, the bill we will consider on the floor not only \nincorporates a public option but also a State opt-out provision that \nwill allow any State at any time to drop that public plan for any \nreason whatsoever, irrespective of whether their residents in that \nState actually have access to affordable plans. So if affordability is \nour goal--and it certainly is--then will someone explain to me exactly \nhow an indiscriminate opt-out achieves that end when a State could \ndecide on a political whim it would not allow a public plan and leave \nits residents without affordable choices?\n  It simply makes no sense. Rather, we ought to take the safety net \napproach at the forefront as we did in Medicare Part D, which spurred \ncompetition and, as a result, it never was triggered, and to ensure \naffordability not just in some States but in all 50 States. I happen to \nbelieve a person's Zip Code should never dictate their ability to \naccess affordable health care coverage.\n  So the public option provision is of paramount concern. At the same \ntime, in examining the proposed legislation, it is not my only concern. \nThere are practicalities to what we are doing, and I am concerned, \nquite frankly, that this legislation misses the mark as far as \naddressing the needs of Main Street America. Just yesterday, the NFIB \nreleased a statement opposing the bill--the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses--saying that enactment of it would make health \ncare for small businesses more expensive than what they can afford \ntoday--a ``disaster for small business'' is how NFIB describes it. That \nis coming from a group that supported the Senate Finance legislation \nand has been a constructive voice throughout the debate, so that ought \nto grab our attention.\n  Furthermore, in the Finance Committee I insisted that CBO provide an \naffordability analysis of what a ``silver'' plan would look like, for \nexample, and I used that analysis to do my own modeling on all of the \nplans. It helped me to assess premium affordability and render an \ninformed evaluation about the approach overall. For the measure before \nus now, the CBO has yet to assess the question of affordability on this \nrevised, integrated bill. So exactly how do we go forward on this \nlegislation and consider it when we don't even understand some of the \nmost fundamental aspects of this legislation? None of us can tell with \nadequate specificity at this point what an average plan will look like, \nwhich is what Americans are going to be asking us. What are the \npremiums? What are the deductibles? What are the copays? What are the \ncoinsurance requirements?\n  These are questions Americans rightfully will ask and are asking. \nWhat will reform mean to them? What will it look like? What will they \npay for? Those are the answers to the questions we do not have because \nwe haven't had a chance to evaluate this legislation, and we are going \nto have a vote tomorrow night to move along party lines--to ram it, to \njam it--and that is what I am hearing from my constituents. They say: \nDo you really know what is in those 2,000 pages? They are asking the \nright questions with great validity. They believe their lives are out \nof control because they see Washington and they think Washington is out \nof control because we don't have a profound understanding of what we \nare doing.\n  That is why it took so long in the Finance Committee for 4 months. It \nwasn't enough to be immersed in intensive discussions and \ndeliberations. There were artificial deadlines that were set time and \ntime again from March to April to May to June, July, August, September, \nOctober. It has gone on. Christmas now is the deadline. The State of \nthe Union is the deadline. Why not just try to get it right?\n  I have heard time and again people say we just have to do something. \nWell, what I am hearing from my constituents and from many Americans is \nthat it is not just doing something, it is doing the right thing. Every \nline and every word in this 2,000-page document matters because it is \ngoing to have profound ramifications and implications. There are \nunintended consequences. It is not just about cobbling something\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\ntogether in the dark of night. It is about making sure those mechanics \nwork and what it is going to cost the average consumer, what it is \ngoing to do to small businesses, what it is going to do in this time of \nperilous economic climate. We simply must ensure that an affordable \ncoverage option is available to every individual and small business.\n  I get back to the affordability question because that is the heart \nand soul of this matter. We have to be assured that we are going to \nprovide affordable health insurance plans. That is why I recommended--\nand I am going to push that through the amendment process--that we open \nthe ``young invincible'' or the catastrophic plan as described in the \nmajority leader's bill. We should open up to everybody. It is now \navailable to those under the age of 30, but we should open these plans \nto all to ensure that no one has to buy up into a more expensive plan \nif they don't choose to.\n  I have also advocated throughout this process for the very first time \nnational plans which I included in the Finance bill, as small \nbusinesses should be able to purchase plans with uniform benefit \npackages sold across State lines which is vital to enhancing \ncompetition and increasing choices for consumers, and portability, and \ndriving down premiums. In fact, we drive down premiums by more than 12 \npercent.\n  I will be introducing an amendment--because, regrettably, it is not \ngoing to be in the bill we will be considering--that States cannot opt \nout of these national plans because these plans should be able to be \navailable to every State in the country.\n  Finally, with our mounting deficits and our struggling economy, if \nanything, we should be scaling back the scope of health care reform \nwherever possible. We should take our cues from the American people who \nrightly reject more taxes and expanded government bureaucracy that will \nconstrain our future economic prosperity. So I am disturbed that the \nlegislation we will be considering will increase Medicare payroll taxes \nby $54 billion over the next 10 years. That is diametrically opposed to \nthe tack we should be taking. We should be finding ways for cutting \nback and scaling back. ``Practicality'' should be the word of the day.\n  Then we have the insertion of another new and costly program, the so-\ncalled CLASS Act. I understand its laudatory goals. If it is going to \nbe providing long-term care, it is obviously very important. Proponents \npoint to the fact that it will raise $72 billion over the first 10 \nyears, but that is a bad timing shell game as it collects premiums in \n2011 but doesn't begin paying benefits until 2016, near the end of our \ncurrent budget window. CBO has concluded in the decade following 2029 \nthe CLASS Act will begin to increase the deficit. How much sense does \nit make to create this new bureaucracy, this new program, that will \nbegin providing similar benefits just 4 years before the Social \nSecurity disability insurance trust fund is expected to be exhausted as \nopposed to first fixing that program?\n\n  I intend to offer amendments as legislation is considered on the \nSenate floor, and the impending amendment process will be a true test \nof whether there is a will to improve this legislation in a \nnonideological, bipartisan manner. On that note, I hope the past is not \na predictor of the direction we are headed because in the final \nanalysis, no one has a monopoly on good ideas. It is not a conservative \nidea, moderate idea, or a liberal idea. It is a good idea to improve \nthis legislation because that is what is going to be our most pressing, \nmost focused, singular goal--to improve the legislation that will be \nbefore us, irrespective of who is offering the amendment or who has the \nvotes or whether it is the 60 votes. That is my concern, if it is going \nto take 60 votes to undo and change those provisions that are \nabsolutely essential to be modified.\n  The American people have expressed a sharp and legitimate note of \ncaution as we pursue health care reform, especially during these \nchallenging economic times. It is a message we would do well to \nreflect. So let the tone we set for this unprecedented debate rise to \nthe level of the problems we have a responsibility to resolve. This is \nalready an undertaking of historic proportions. Let's ensure this isn't \nthe only historic legislation passed in the last half century on purely \npartisan lines.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I thank the Senator from Maine. She used \nthe very descriptive terms of ``ram it'' and ``jam it.'' That is \nessentially what is happening right now. I think everyone is aware--all \nthe media have taken pictures of the closed doors. They know that just \na handful of Democrats were in there. Ironically, there are a lot of \nDemocrats who didn't know what was going on, either. But they came out \nwith a product. It is not a good product, and I will talk more about \nthe product in a moment.\n  But I think probably more significant and more concerning to a lot of \nthe people I talk to is the manner in which this bill is being brought \nto the floor. It is beyond just being deceptive that the Democratic \nleadership plans to vote on Saturday night at 8 o'clock to proceed to \nH.R. 3590, a bill that has nothing to do with health care. This bill is \none that passed the House in October of this year, 416 to 0. It would \npass the Senate by a unanimous vote, I am sure. The bill is an eight-\npage bill to ensure that our military service members are not excluded \nfrom the first-time home buyer tax credits, and no one had any quarrel \nwith that. The House side wouldn't have any quarrel, nor would we. But \nwe all remember and America remembers that the House passed their \nhealth care bill, H.R. 3962, on November 7, late at night, on a \nSaturday night, the same type of thing we are looking at here.\n  Let me say one thing. I was surprised to hear the unanimous consent \nrequest that was made just a few minutes ago because it was an \nadmission--and I appreciate their honesty--that what we are going to be \nvoting on tomorrow night has nothing to do with H.R. 3590. Yet that is \nwhat we are going to be moving to.\n  They stated that at 8 p.m. tomorrow night the Senate will proceed to \na rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 3590, the legislative vehicle for the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act. My thinking was--and I still think \nthere are a lot of Democrats who would end up voting for this tomorrow \nnight and would send out a letter to constituents: Oh, this is a vote \nthat is going to help our military with some of the problems they have.\n  This reminds me so much, the way this is taking place, of what \nhappened in the Environment and Public Works Committee when they were \ntrying to get through the massive cap-and-trade bill which they did and \nthey voted it out without any Republicans there. It is on the Senate \nfloor right now. It is not going to be brought up because it is dead on \narrival. The people of America realize they don't want to have the \nlargest tax increase in the history of America on something that would \ndo no good.\n  But the point is, the deceptive method to bring up that bill is the \nsame thing we are dealing with now. I think by virtue of the fact they \nrammed it and jammed it, to borrow the terms from the Senator from \nMaine, out of the Environment and Public Works Committee caused it to \ngo down. I think the same thing is going to happen here.\n  The second thing is a motion to proceed at 8 p.m. on Saturday night. \nWell, Saturday night. What are people doing on Saturday night? They are \nnot watching TV. They are not listening to the radio. They have ball \ngames and other things the American people do in the American way of \nlife on a Saturday night.\n  Do you think it is just coincidental? That is the same time of night \nthey ended up voting on the House health care bill, on a Saturday \nnight. Of course, it got out with barely a majority.\n  Now, not only is the way in which the bill is being brought up \nquestionable, the substance of the bill is definitely questionable. It \nhas been repeated--I am trying to make a couple of comments about this \nthat have not really come to our attention as much as other issues, the \ngovernment-run health care bill--that Republicans are working to ensure \nthat Washington bureaucracy does not get between the patients and their \ndoctors. That is the big issue.\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\n  Now, you are going to hear shortly from my junior Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn, who is an OB-GYN. He will talk about that.\n  I don't think you have to have a doctor explain to you that if you, \nas in my case, have a very large family, with a lot of grandkids--we \ndon't want the government telling us what we can and cannot do. A \ngovernment-run universal health care system or a socialized system is \nnot the answer.\n  All you have to do is listen to some of the testimony from \nindividuals who have come here, such as members of the Parliament in \nGreat Britain, who came and addressed us in this building and said: We \ncannot believe that something that has been such a failure, that we are \ntrying to get away from, is something you are now trying to move \ntoward.\n  The other day, in the Wall Street Journal they talked about a \nCanadian citizen who waited in pain for more than a year to see a \nspecialist for his arthritic hip. The specialist recommended a state-\nof-the-art procedure, but the government bureaucrats determined that \nthe patient, who was only 57, was too old for that procedure. Rationing \nis alive and well. If you don't believe it, go up in the northern part \nof the United States, to the Mayo Clinic or some of those others, and \nyou will see the large number of Canadians who come down to \n``barbaric'' America, with our system, because they couldn't get the \ntreatment they needed through rationing in Canada.\n  The Democrats' bill represents an unprecedented expansion of \ngovernment's control over health care. Oklahoma physicians shared with \nme in a July 23rd letter that they are concerned a public option plan \nwill unfairly compete with the private market and ultimately crowd it \nout. It is a no-brainer. You cannot compete with the Federal \nGovernment. All they have to do is change and the competition is gone.\n  Under this bill, the government will tell people what type of \ncoverage they can and cannot have, mandate that every American have \nhealth care or pay a tax, mandate employers to provide a certain level \nof benefits or pay a fine, introduce a government-run plan designed to \ndestroy the private market, include new policies designed to control \nwhat drugs and procedures Americans can receive, and require a historic \nexpansion of Medicaid. According to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, \nthe ones who administer the Medicaid Program called Soonercare, they \nestimate that this type of expansion could cost Oklahoma an additional \n$128 million each year, resulting in harmful cost to existing State \npriorities. By the way, the Oklahoma Governor and the State legislature \nare talking about going into a special session because of the problems \nwe have--the budget problems. Of course, we would then inherit this.\n  This bill violates the President's promise not to raise taxes. I \nthink we have covered that. The fact that they have taxes such as the \n40-percent excise tax on the so-called Cadillac plans--that means if \nyou, through your own decision, decide that for your family you want to \nhave more extensive coverage, you will get penalized. You could have a \ntax imposed upon you of 40 percent because you wanted to have better \ntreatment for your family. The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation \nhave testified that these taxes and fees would be almost entirely \npassed on to consumers. The fact is that they estimate, by 2019, 89 \npercent of the taxes would be paid by those making less than $200,000 a \nyear. It reminds me of the regressive nature of the cap-and-trade tax, \nwhich would affect the poor people more than the wealthier people.\n  Anyway, with the penalties and everything else in there, we are going \nto be looking at something that the American people don't want and \nshould not have. That doesn't mean Republicans don't want to have \nreforms. We need reforms. We need medical malpractice reforms. I have \ntwo friends in Tulsa, two man-and-wife teams. There is Rick and Lisa \nLowry. He is a cardiologist and she is a dermatologist. They moved to \nTexas. They will tell you the only reason they did it is because of the \ntort laws in Oklahoma. Then there is Boris and his wife Kathy, another \npair of doctors. Boris is an electrophysiologist, and she is a pain \nmanagement doctor. They moved to Fayettville, AR. This is what is \nhappening right now.\n  We know what reform is. We know that HSAs have worked, giving people \nchoice. We want to have some reform. We should keep in mind for \ntomorrow that, at 8 o'clock, if just one Democrat would say, no, I \ndon't want a government-run system--just one--they wouldn't have 60 \nvotes. It is going to be interesting to see if there isn't one. They \nwill never get by with saying it was just a motion to proceed to a bill \nhaving to do with housing for the military. It will not happen. People \nare smarter than that. I hope at least one Democrat will oppose a \ngovernment-run system. We will find out tomorrow night.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleagues and I thank particularly the \nsenior Senator from Maine for her long, arduous work as part of a small \ngroup of Senators who did try, honestly and with great integrity, to \nadvance this process so we would have a bipartisan product to deal \nwith. I appreciate her efforts. I heard a little bit of her frustration \nas she spoke on the floor this evening. I thank her for her leadership.\n  I concur with my fellow Senator from Oklahoma that we all agree \nreforms are needed in the health care world. We all agree that the \nstatus quo is not acceptable. But where we differ is certainly what \nleads us to the discussion this evening, and tomorrow, and up to the \nvote tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock.\n  Typically, this time of year, going into Thanksgiving and then the \nholidays that follow in December, we consider this the season of \ngiving, where we give thanks and do a lot of giving back. \nUnfortunately, what we are looking at this particular November, with \nthis particular bill, kind of makes it a season of taking--taking away \nyour ability to choose the health insurance you want, taking away \nnearly $\\1/2\\ trillion by cutting from Medicare--a program that is \nalready strapped, a program that provides so much for our seniors and \nthe disabled. But we recognize that program is seriously underfunded \nand looking to literally go off a cliff by 2017--by taking more of your \nsalary and increasing the Medicare payroll tax for government intrusion \ninto your health care decisions.\n  This health care bill is a massive overreach by the Federal \nGovernment that will result in our government having more involvement \nin your family's health care decisions and greater government \nintervention, cutting into 16 percent of our economy.\n  Before we get into the policy debate on the health care bill, I asked \none of the interns in my office to go down to the Dirksen post office. \nWe had gotten an inquiry from a constituent from Alaska wanting to know \nif we could send a copy of the bill. The bill, as you can see on some \nof the Members' desks, is large. When it was weighed at the post office \nin the Dirksen building, it weighed in at 20 pounds 5.5 ounces. That is \nprobably close to the size of the turkey my family and I will purchase \nfor Thanksgiving. It is going to take about $45 to mail that by \npriority mail to Alaska. So we suggested that perhaps the Internet is a \nbetter option.\n  In this 2,000-plus page bill, you will find the government requiring \nthat you comply with an individual mandate where the Federal Government \nis going to tell you you have to buy health insurance, regardless of \nwhether the premiums are affordable. This goes back to the concerns of \nthe Senator from Maine. So much of this is about the affordability. If \nwe require individuals to purchase health care insurance but we have \nnot done anything, or enough, to make it more affordable for them, all \nwe are doing is setting them up for additional penalties. Failure to \ncomply will result in a $750 penalty per person to a family.\n  We also know in this bill our government is going to be telling \nemployers they have to comply with employer mandates, which place \nonerous penalties on a large number of our small businesses. These are \nbusinesses that have 50 or more employees. I think it is important to \nrecognize that the SBA, Small Business Administration, defines a small \nbusiness as one with 500 or fewer employees. But for the purposes\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\nof the employer mandate, we are going to say that if you have over 50 \nemployees, you will be required to provide for that insurance.\n\n  Let's use an example here. Say you have a small business, you employ \n51 employees, and one of those employees receives a Federal subsidy for \nhealth insurance. Under this Democratic health care reform bill, the \nemployer will be fined $750 for each of its 51 employees--not just the \none employee who receives a subsidy but for all of them. So if you are \na small business owner in Alaska, in Anchorage, or Fairbanks, or \nJuneau, who runs a restaurant or a small hotel, that employer needs to \nknow he could be subject to a total of over $38,000 in penalties if \nonly one of his employees seeks a government subsidy. This penalty \nprovision alone in the bill is estimated to raise $28 billion to pay \nfor the Democratic health program.\n  The bill before us today also subjects Americans to health insurance \nthat the Federal Government is going to define that this is what you \nhave to have. What the drafters of this 2,000-plus page bill declare is \nit is an insurance plan with a 60-percent actuarial value. In other \nwords, all of the discussion about ``if you like the health care plan \nthat you have, you can keep it''--yes, in fact, you can, but only if it \nmeets the definitions we are setting forth within this, and the \nrequirement is that it is 60 percent of actuarial value.\n  In Alaska, we have over 88 percent of the health benefits that are \nprovided to individuals and small businesses by the largest insurance \ncompany operating there, Premera Alaska Blue Cross/Blue Shield. We are \ntold that 88 percent will not meet this 60-percent threshold \nrequirement. So what does that mean? You have had your insurance plan \nthrough Premera and your employer provided it. But if it doesn't meet \nthis threshold requirement, what then happens is that those small \nbusiness employees will not be in compliance with the provisions of the \nbill, so you are going to see penalties assessed. Many of my \nconstituents will see those penalties assessed. They may lose the \ninsurance they have, which they like, but the penalty will be a massive \nincrease in health care insurance premiums.\n  When we talk about the promises of health care reform and what we are \ngoing to make available to you, I think most people believe that with \nhealth care reform would come a reduction in premiums, or at least not \nincredible increases in premiums.\n  In this bill, we raid the strapped Medicare Program to pay for \nexpanding the role of government in health care reform. We raid future \npayments to the Medicare patients through increased payroll taxes. I \nthink it is important to recognize that this is an unprecedented and \ndangerous step that plays a shell game with Americans. We are going to \nincrease your taxes through the Medicare payroll tax, but then we are \ngoing to divert that money to pay not for keeping Medicare solvent--I \nmentioned earlier the insolvency cliff out there--and we are going to \ndivert that money not to keep Medicare solvent, not to increase funds \nto Medicare, not to increase patient access to doctors and nurses, \nwhich so many of my constituents are suffering from but, instead, we \ninstitute a new Medicare payroll tax that is used to pay for expanding \nthe size of the Federal Government and creating yet another federally \nrun health plan. We recognize that the insolvency of Medicare is real. \nThe Medicare trustees report from 2009 said that Medicare is going to \nbe insolvent by the year 2017. But the drafters of the bill don't write \na reform bill to fix Medicare insolvency. Rather, they are using this \nas an opportunity to tax Medicare funds to pay for the creation of \nanother Medicare-like system. This is truly the height of hypocrisy. It \nis working against what is right and what should be done for Medicare.\n  The inclusion of a 5-percent Medicare payroll tax is bad enough, but \nwhen one realizes that the tax is not indexed to inflation, one can \nonly cringe at the financial pain that is ahead for America's middle \nclass.\n  There may be many people out there saying, oh, you are increasing \ntaxes on the rich and individuals earning $200,000 or more, and couples \nearning $250,000 or more, but you need to put this in context and \nrecognize how far from the truth this can be.\n  Back in 1969, Congress enacted the alternative minimum tax, the AMT, \nto ensure that fewer than 200 individuals paid their fair share of \ntaxes. Unfortunately, the AMT was not indexed to inflation, and today \nwe have nearly 30 million taxpayers who face the long hand of the AMT \ntax, with many of them falling squarely in the middle of the middle \nclass.\n  Congress has consistently taken action to protect the middle class \nfrom the AMT. We do this, as we know around here, on a year-by-year \nbasis, and each year it is costing more than the previous year with the \nnumber of people who face the tax growing each year. The recent 1-year \npatch cost $70 billion. A 10-year fix is expected to cost $447 billion. \nSadly, history has a habit of repeating itself, and Congress has \ndemonstrated a consistent inability to learn from its mistakes.\n  My prediction is if the Medicare payroll tax increase becomes law, \nCongress will, once again, need to spend large sums of money to protect \nthe middle class from this onerous new tax.\n  Let's delve into the Medicare and Medicaid restrictions on doctors \nand nurses under these government health programs. In my State of \nAlaska, in our most populated city, Anchorage, we have very few general \ncare doctors who are willing to accept Medicare patients. We had a \nstudy done not too long ago, and the number given in that study is \nthere are 13 providers, 13 doctors who are taking on new Medicare-\neligible individuals. In Alaska, if you are about to hit the magic age \nof 65, going on Medicare, you have Medicare as your primary insurance \nwhether you like it or not.\n  What you learn when you are on Medicare is you have very few doctors \nwilling to see you. Eighty-three percent of the primary care doctors in \nAlaska's largest city will not see Medicare patients. These \nindividuals, who before they were 65 enjoyed unfettered access to care \nwhen on private health insurance, whether they had it through the \nmunicipality, Anchorage, or they worked for a private employer, they \nare now realizing the harsh realities of Medicare and that they are \ngoing to face some severe restrictions in access to a primary care \ndoctor.\n  We are seeing it on a very accentuated basis in Alaska, but we are \nseeing it in many parts of rural America. It is almost unthinkable to \nme. A number of constituents have come up to me and have said: Look, \njust get us out of the Medicare system. Let us go out to the private \nmarket and purchase health insurance like we were able to do before we \nwere on Medicare because, regardless of the contributions I make, \nregardless of how much I have paid into the Medicare system, it doesn't \nmean anything to me if I don't have access to care.\n  They are saying: I know I have worked all these years to pay in, but \nI want my old insurance back. It is because what we have done is \nrestricted their access to services, and it is something they have \nnever dealt with before.\n  This problem is not just in my State. According to GAO, we have \nStates such as Colorado, Oregon, and New Mexico that are facing these \nmajor restrictions in access to primary care doctors. Senator Daschle, \nwhen he was doing his health care tour last year, when he was in \nDublin, IN, and talking to doctors about how best to reform our health \ncare system, the doctors in Dublin told the Senator that the Medicare \nreimbursement rates are not keeping pace with the costs of a medical \npractice. So if we know that private insurance pays significantly more \nthan government insurance, then access under a government plan will \nundoubtedly be reduced. We have seen this both in the Medicare and the \nMedicaid Programs.\n  Under the Medicaid expansion program in this health care bill, we \nknow that Medicaid is now going to include individuals up to 133 \npercent of poverty. Under the Democrats' health bill, the Federal \nGovernment pays all the costs covering newly eligible enrollees through \n2016. This is good for the States. It will allow Alaska, for example, \nto expand the roll of the Medicaid Program and include more Alaskans on \nthe State's Medicaid Program. CBO said after 2016, the share of the \nFederal spending is going to vary somewhat from year to year but \nultimately would average about 90 percent.\n  If you are responsible for your State's budget and your State can no\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\nlonger afford the Medicaid Program in the year 2017, when the Federal \nGovernment drops that coverage to somewhere around 90 percent, if your \nState is a balanced budget State such as Alaska and your State revenues \nare going down because of what is happening with tourism or a bad \nfishing season or the price of oil, what then do the States do to \ncontinue the Medicaid Program?\n  It seems to me there are a couple options. They can either drop the \nexpanded Medicaid population or they could reduce reimbursements rates \nand place the Medicaid enrollees who once had decent care in Alaska in \nthe same predicament as my Medicare constituents are currently in.\n  There is a reason why Democratic and Republican Governors have said \nthis Medicaid expansion is the mother of all unfunded mandates.\n  While all these provisions I mentioned are certainly enough for me to \ndecide not to support this health care bill, the most troubling aspect \nwe are seeing played out in the news right now is the impact of \ngovernment rationing, which will allow the government to deny access to \nhealth care services.\n  This is something Republicans have been speaking about all summer \nwith regard to various health care bills. We have all seen throughout \nthe news a great deal of concern over the announcement from the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force that it no longer recommends routine \nmammogram screening for women between the ages of 40 and 49. This task \nforce's recommendation is just a look behind the curtain of what we can \nexpect if the government runs your health care.\n  Under this bill, we are going to provide one person, the appointed \nposition of the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. We are \ngoing to give her the ability to make a wide variety of determinations, \nboth on the health exchanges as well as in the government-run plan.\n  I am very concerned about what we are finding from this task force \nand what it means for both men and women who suffer from this deadly \ndisease. I can tell you, without a doubt, what this has caused is great \nconfusion. The task force came out with their recommendations and then, \nshortly thereafter, Secretary Sebelius came out saying women in their \nforties should continue to get mammograms. The task force is saying \nwomen should not even conduct self-breast exams. We have constituents \nwho don't know what they should or what they should not be doing. This \nis why we need a hearing to better understand how this task force came \nto their conclusions.\n  But the bigger picture is, what we need to appreciate is this ordeal \nwe have been dealing with this week is a glimpse into the chaos of what \nwe could see with a federally run health plan and a massive expansion \nof the Federal Government's role in your health care.\n  I wish to mention, because there have been multiple accounts in the \nmedia about, no, we are not intending that this task force \nrecommendation is going to change in any way what coverage might be \navailable to women. I know that some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have recognized, in fact, that these recommendations do \nhold great weight with the policymakers and the insurance companies.\n  One of my colleagues from Maryland has said she plans to offer an \namendment that would address or limit the cost of breast cancer tests \nfor women 40 and older. She said otherwise insurance companies may use \nthis new recommendation as yet another reason to deny women coverage \nfor mammograms.\n  In fact, in the bill, there are at least 14 references to the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force. In section 4105 is a provision that \nwould authorize the Secretary to modify benefits under Medicare if \nconsistent with task force recommendations and deny payment for \nprevention services the task force recommends against.\n  This could be a situation we should be very concerned about how, with \nrecommendations such as we are seeing come out of the task force, they \ninadvertently or perhaps advertently will impact a woman's access to \ncare.\n  I know I have probably gone over my time, and the Senator from \nOklahoma is waiting. I will close my comments by saying we do need \nhealth care reform. I echo the remarks of the Senator from Maine. We \nneed to do it the right way. Setting an arbitrary timeline, saying we \nhave to get it done by this holiday or that holiday or moving down the \ncalendar--we have to take the time to do it right.\n  We have to bring down the premium costs so everyone can have access \nto affordable health care. Imposing mandates on individuals or on \nemployers, if we haven't done anything to provide for greater \naffordability, we haven't helped the situation.\n  Unfortunately, this bill does not help us with the affordability \npiece. I am focused, as many of my colleagues are, on an alternative, a \nstep-by-step approach to reduce our health care costs to allow \nbusinesses to buy across State lines, allow co-ops to be formed so that \nfishermen in my State or other coastal States or employees of a small \nbusiness can pool together to purchase affordable comprehensive \ncoverage.\n  Just as important is certainly the need to preserve the rights of \npatients to see the doctors of their choice. We must make sure we are \nprotecting Medicare coverage for seniors. We have to eliminate the \ndiscrimination based on preexisting conditions, ensure that expansion \nof government health programs will not result in restrictions in access \nto care because of reduced reimbursements to doctors and hospitals.\n  While this bill does attempt to address several of these issues--for \ninstance, the one about eliminating discrimination based on preexisting \nconditions--it delays the implementations of some of the more \nworthwhile provisions until the year 2014.\n  We have bipartisan support on many of these pieces individually. So \nwhy would we not try to work on those areas where we do have agreement, \nwhere we do have consensus rather than waiting until 2014?\n  I held a townhall meeting in Chugiak, AK, last week. It was a pretty \ntough night. We had winds that were howling off the mountains, snow all \nover the place, and real slick and icy roads. Over 200 people decided \nto brave the weather to come and speak out on the issue of health care \nreform and what is happening in Washington, DC.\n  I will tell you, the one thing those constituents stood and repeated \nover and over was: Don't pass health care reform that is going to raise \nour taxes, that is going to increase our premiums, and that will cut \nMedicare.\n  We need to listen to these folks. We need to listen to the American \npeople. We have an opportunity to do it right. There is a lot of good \nwork that goes on by a lot of good people in this body and outside this \nChamber. But we are at a point now where because of deadlines--\nartificial deadlines--we are forced to a process tomorrow evening where \nwe are going to have a vote on a cloture motion on the motion to \nproceed. As my colleague from Oklahoma pointed out, it is a bit of a \nshell. We think we are going to this health care bill that is 2,000-\nsome-odd pages, but, in fact, the vehicle we will be using on the \nmotion to proceed is not what this is. I am not going to suggest it is \nbait and switch, but it could be bait and switch.\n  I do believe our opportunity to share our concerns about what is \ncontained in this legislation is now. We need to take the time to \nexplain to our constituents the concerns we have, the problems we have, \nthe unintended consequences we believe are part and parcel of this \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time this evening and thank all \nmy colleagues for their coordinated efforts to help provide a little \nbit of insight to the American people on what we are dealing with in \nthe proposed legislation from the Democratic leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, I would like to say thank you for \npresiding. You drew the unlucky number tonight and I appreciate it.\n  We are embarking on a process that is going to start tomorrow night \nand people are going to cast a vote on a bill they have not read, and \nsaying we ought to go on with it.\n  For just a little history, 97.8 percent of the time in the Senate \nthat a cloture motion passed to proceed to the bill, the bill becomes \nlaw. That is an interesting statistic, especially when we are\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\ngoing to hear those who say they just want to have the debate. The fact \nis, that is not what is going to happen.\n  As one of the two practicing physicians in the Senate, I thought I \nwould spend a little bit of time tonight talking about what I see is \nwrong with our health care system as well as talk about what I see as \ngood about our health care system and then talk about the approach this \nbill takes. My staff has been through the vast majority of this bill. I \npersonally have not, but I will. I will talk about how it affects us.\n  What is the real problem in health care today? What is it that keeps \npeople from getting care? The No. 1 problem that keeps people from \ngetting care is cost. It costs too much. Fully either one-fourth or \none-third of every dollar we spend on health care does not help anybody \nget well and does not prevent anybody from getting sick.\n  There is an interesting study out by the Thomson Reuters report that \nsays that $600 billion to $850 billion is wasted annually in all \nAmerican health care.\n  When you break it down, it is broken down like this: 40 percent is \nhealth care waste, unwarranted treatment, overuse of antibiotics, use \nof diagnostic lab tests to protect against malpractice exposure. That \naccounts for $250 to $350 billion in annual health care spending. It is \nattributed to extra tests and procedures generated mainly from \ndefensive medicine or Medicare's fee-for-service system.\n  The second biggest factor out of this $800 billion we are wasting is \nhealth care fraud. It is 19 percent of health care waste--at least $125 \nbillion to $175 billion a year, and most of that is in government-run \nhealth care programs. Not the private--the private sector has less than \n1 percent of fraud. They also have a denial rate that is one-half to a \none-third of Medicare's rate in terms of denial of payment claims.\n  The third most important thing in terms of waste is administrative \ninefficiency. The large redundant volume of paperwork in the U.S. \nhealth care system accounts for $100 billion to $150 billion in \nspending annually.\n  The fourth most important area, 12 percent of health care waste is \nhealth provider errors, errors we make caused by me as the doctor, or a \nhospital, that causes us to spend money we should not have to spend.\n  Six percent of the health care waste is preventable conditions, such \nas somebody with diabetes getting their blood sugar out of control and \nending up in the hospital; whereas if they had good care, coordinated \ncare, it wouldn't have happened.\n  Of course, No. 6 is 6 percent of health care waste, and that is lack \nof coordinated care, where we do not coordinate the care, where doctors \ndon't talk to one another, doctors don't talk to the hospital, doctors \ndon't get all the information, so consequently we waste money.\n  So the first problem that plagues us is that cost is too high. We \nfully know that $1 out of every $3 we spend on health care is not \nhelping health care. That is our pot of gold. That is where we lower \nthe cost. Just think what health care would cost if it costs one-third \nless today or if it costs the same for the next 5 years. That means we \ncould cover everybody who is not covered for free and have about $400 \nbillion left over if we just went after where the pot of gold is.\n  The second problem with our health care system is we have \ndisconnected the purchase of health care from the payment of health \ncare, so that when I go to make a purchase I no longer use the \ndiscrimination that I use in everything else that I purchase, such as \nseeing if it is of value to me. I don't ask what it costs, I don't ask \nif it is the best way to get this, if it is the most economical way to \nget there. I don't question to make sure--are you sure I have to have \nthis done? I don't necessarily get a second opinion. I don't ask, if it \nhas to be done, where is the best place as far as efficiency and \ndollars to get it done.\n  The reason we don't ask those questions is because most of the time \nthe money isn't coming out of our pocket because we have this perceived \nfalse belief that our insurance company or the government is paying for \nit. If our insurance company is paying for it, we are paying for it \nbecause for every 3.5 percent cost our company is paying for insurance, \n2 percent of that would have been our wages. And for every $1 that we \nspend on Medicare, our grandchildren and our children are paying into \nthat fund to pay for our Medicare. In fact, it does cost us, but we \nhave disconnected that cost.\n  The third thing we have done is we have a Tax Code that says if you \nare fortunate enough to have your employer pay for your health care \nbenefits, you get $2,700 more in tax benefit than everybody who doesn't \nhave their employer paying for their insurance. You get about $100 in \ntax benefit if you don't get your insurance through your employer. So \nwe have a 27-fold discrimination that advantages those whose employer \npays for their health care versus those who have to buy it on their own \nor their employer doesn't offer it.\n  That is wrong. It is not fair. It is unequal treatment, and it \ncreates this maldistribution. But, even having said that, the cost for \nan individual plan versus the plan bought through your employer, if you \nbuy it in a nationwide marketplace, if you could, it would be 20 \npercent less than what you could buy it for through your employer. \nThose are the real statistics.\n  Then the fourth thing I see that is wrong, as both a patient--I ought \nto stop here in a minute and tell everybody, at 61, almost 62 years of \nage, I am a two-time cancer survivor. I have had malignant melanoma and \nmetastatic colon cancer. I also have atrial fibrillation. I have been a \npatient. I have been on the other side of my stethoscope as a patient.\n  What I see is, we have limited the options for people in this \ncountry. If your employer buys your health insurance, you have very \nlimited options. You get take it or leave it most of the time. Here is \nwhat we are providing: You get to take it. If you don't take it, then \nyou have to go outside and you loose that $2,700 advantage, so it comes \nout of your pocket.\n  We don't have the freedom to choose within our employer. We also have \nthe States. We heard the Senator from Maine talking about the greatly \nincreased costs in Maine. There is a reason Maine has the massive \ninflation in their health care insurance. They created the State plan \nthat caused it, that truly limited the competition. So they have seen \nthe results of limited competition because of what they installed. But \nevery State has an insurance commission that both decides who is \neligible to sell in the State but also follows the mandates; here is \nwhat the minimum is that you have to buy in your State.\n  Then, of course, if you have Medicaid, you have limited options \nbecause 40 percent of the physicians in this country will not see you. \nIf you have Medicare, you have limited options because now about 15 \npercent of physicians, fast rising to 30 or 40 percent of the \nphysicians in this country, aren't going to see you.\n  Then if you have VA, you get VA and that is it. You don't get to \nchoose your doctor or you don't even get to choose your location. Here \nis where you will be, no matter how many miles it is, and here is the \ndoctor you will see. The same thing with TRICARE essentially because \nTRICARE has limited coverage in terms of availability of all the \nphysicians.\n  The fifth thing I see that is wrong is there is an absolute lack of \ntransparency as to what something costs and what you can expect as far \nas quality outcome. That makes it hard to know how to buy, where to \nbuy, or who to buy from. Who do you trust? So if there is no \ntransparency in either quality or price, you are going to have a tough \ntime making a decision. All of the things I am describing describe a \nlack of liberty, a lack of freedom.\n\n  We have government mandates. Have you ever gone to a hospital--this \nis a great question. One of my constituents wrote in and told me this, \nand I never had thought about it. Go to a hospital in the middle of the \nday and try to get a parking spot. Then go to a hospital at 10 o'clock \nat night, and the parking lot is almost empty. What you are seeing in \nthe difference in the parking lot is the administrative bureaucratic \noverhead that is required in a hospital to manage the mandates that the \ngovernment has put or the insurance company has put on the hospital.\n  If you look at it, fully one-third of the people in every hospital in \nthis country don't do anything to help anybody get well. They are \nfilling out forms, they are pushing the paper,\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\nmuch like this study I mentioned from Thomson Reuters.\n  Then we have the insurance mandate. What is wrong? If, in fact, you \nhave a preexisting illness, you don't get insured. That is wrong. We \nneed to fix that. Or if you get sick, insurance companies have figured \nout a way to drop you. That can't be right. That is why you bought \ninsurance in the first place, and that is not just in the health \ninsurance industry. Try filing a claim for a new roof on your house and \nsee what your insurance costs do next year or if they will insure you. \nWe get hail all the time in Oklahoma and we get roof damage and a lot \nof times if you have that 2 out of 10 years, they will not even \nreinsure you. So you have to go find somebody else.\n  It is a practice of risk management that they are using that doesn't \nthink about the potential market of who their customer is. So I agree \nwe ought to fix those things.\n  Then we have the costs. Already the Senator from North Dakota tonight \ntalked about drug prices. The one thing he didn't tell everybody is \nthat the reason drugs are cheaper in Canada is because they threaten \nnot to honor intellectual property of this country.\n  There is a real good way to make sure drug prices go down. Both the \nBush administration failed on this and the Clinton administration \nfailed on this--and this administration. If Canada wants to tell our \ndrug companies what price they will pay, then we will tell them what we \nwill pay for their lumber, and we will tell them what we will pay for \nanything else they want to import to our country. But we put all the \nfocus on the drug companies instead.\n  So I am going to get to my point. The other thing that is wrong is, \non average it costs $1 billion per new drug just to go through the FDA \nprocess in this country because we have such a litigious society, that \nit costs two to three times more to approve a drug in this country than \nit does anywhere else in the world.\n  We have drugs that are fantastic drugs that are made by companies in \nthis country that are not allowed to be sold in this country that have \npassed all the safety and efficacy standards of the European common \nmarket, but they can't get them through our Food and Drug \nAdministration because the Food and Drug Administration is worried \nabout somebody criticizing them if they ever make a mistake. They met \nthe standards, did it right, recalled it, now they are afraid to \napprove anything because they are afraid somebody will be critical of \nthem.\n  Another thing that is wrong is we have the lack of any real market \nforces. Insurance companies really don't have to compete.\n  They really don't have to compete. The government sets the price for \neverything, essentially, because Medicare says what they will pay and \neverything else is priced off that.\n  Here is another thing that is wrong with our health care system. We \nare starting to experience it. There is a maldistribution of physicians \nboth in terms of geographic location and physician specialty. One in 50 \ngraduates of med schools last year went into primary care. Everybody \nelse went into specialty and subspecialty residencies. Why did that \nhappen? The reason it happened is because the earning power of somebody \nwho has 7 years of medical training is one-third of somebody who has 8 \nor 8\\1/2\\ or 9. How did that happen? Because Medicare set the payment \nrates. Medicare set the payment rates, so they created a \nmaldistribution in terms of the payment for physicians.\n  Another thing I noticed as a practicing physician and as a patient is \nthat our whole system right now has its emphasis on sick care, not on \npreventing disease, not on prevention, not on the maintenance of \nchronic disease. We wait until people get sick and treat them. That is \nexpensive. The reason it is that way is because Medicare won't pay for \nprevention. They refuse to pay for prevention. If you sit down with a \npatient in your office, a Medicare patient, and spend the time to go \nthrough the risk factors and the lifestyle changes and their medicines, \nthe things they need to do, you will not be compensated enough to pay \nthe electricity bill for that office visit. So what has happened is we \nhave incentivized people not to spend time with the patient. We have \nincentivized them to see more patients for shorter periods of time and \nnot listen to the patient and not spend the time on prevention because \nour dollars have been incentivized against it.\n  Then, finally, government systems are designed to be defrauded. If \nyou think about it, it is easy to make $500,000 a month off Medicare; \nit is hard to get caught. All you have to do is know a whole lot about \nmedicine, have a little bit of guts, and set up a vacant office \nsomewhere and put one computer in it and run everything over the line, \nand you can rip off Medicare like crazy. We know the drug dealers in \nFlorida are starting to shift away from drugs and into Medicare fraud \nbecause it is easier to do. They can make more money. It is harder to \nget caught, and when you do, the penalties are much less. It is \ndesigned to be defrauded, but we haven't changed that.\n  I have talked about the problems. Let me talk about what is great \nabout American health care.\n  I want to make the point in a minute that the worst thing we can do \nin trying to fix what is wrong is destroy what is right. We have the \ngreatest acute care anyplace in the world. If you get sick, there is no \nbetter place in the world to get sick than in the United States. I \ndon't care where you are. The statistics bear that out. There is no \nquestion. If you get cancer in this country, you have a 50-percent \ngreater likelihood of being alive 5 years from now than anywhere else \nin the world. It really doesn't matter what type cancer. There are some \ndifferences on some, but overall you are 50 percent more likely to be \nalive.\n  The third thing that is great about our country is, innovation in \nhealth care is two-thirds of the world. Actually, last year it was 74 \npercent of all innovation in health care came out of this economy. We \nhave invested in the research. We have the scientists. We have the \nresearchers who have pulled together technology, thought, experience, \nand research, and come up with great innovations that make big \ndifferences in life expectancy and quality.\n  The other thing is we have a very skilled workforce. We have some \nshortages. Our nursing shortage has been created by the government \nbecause we created a health care system that has both hospice care and \nhome health care, but we made the only way that can effectively work is \nthrough registered nurses. So we sucked all the registered nurses out \nof the hospitals because of time constraints and lack of holiday work \nand lack of shift work. The best nurses want to go where they don't \nhave any of those things. We created a shortage when we could have \ncreated a different class of somebody doing home health care rather \nthan an RN. But that is what we have done. We have created this sucking \nsound, as Ross Perot used to say, and sucked the nurses out of the \nhospitals. Now we have this critical shortage of nurses in our country \nbecause of what the government did.\n  The other thing besides the skilled workforce, the nurse \npractitioners, the PAs, nurses, physical therapists, pharmacists, \nradiologists, doctors, surgical nurses--they are great in this country.\n  Then we have great medicines. If you think about it, the combination \nof medicines that saved my life with metastatic colon cancer were all \ndeveloped here. Six months of chemotherapy, of being sick every day, \nhas been worth every morning I see the Sun. It is this research, the \ninvestment in NIH, the quality of research, the committed doctors who \nwill do the research, committed doctors who will take care of you when \nyou are sick and you don't feel like communicating with anybody, but \nyet they are patient with you--they love you, they nurture you. We have \na great system here.\n  If you have a cardiovascular event, this is the best place in the \nworld to have one. If you have a heart attack, a stroke, if you get \ncancer, if you have an acute fracture of a limb or joint degeneration, \nthis is the best place in the world to have it.\n  So I have outlined the problems, which are big, and the things that \nare good. What do we do with that? Our goal ought to be to not destroy \nall these good things while we fix the things that are not good.\n  How did we get in trouble? How did we get to where we have the \nhighest percentage of our GDP, this thing that really limits people in \ncare, cost--how\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\ndid we get where we are? Why is it? Part of it has been innovation. \nAbout 30 percent of the cost increase we see in our country is because \nof innovation. It takes money to get innovation. When innovation comes \nout, we have to pay for the research that was not paid for upfront. \nAbout 30 percent of the health care inflation we see is from new \nproducts, new innovation, new ideas, new treatments, new strategies or \nprocedures. But the rest of it goes back to this Thomson Reuters, where \nwe have this inefficient delivery system of health care.\n  A question I asked my staff--and we did the research--what was health \ncare inflation before 1970? Do you realize that most of the time it was \nless than the regular increase in inflation? What was the difference? \nWhat happened? What happened is the government got involved in health \ncare. We created demand that was price-controlled demand, and all of a \nsudden the bubble started squeezing up.\n  The other point I wish to make is that most people don't realize that \n61 percent of the health care in this country today is run through the \ngovernment. If we have a problem with health care, we have to look at \nnot where the 39 percent of it is but where the 61 percent is. Let me \nexplain what that is. That is Medicare, TRICARE, VA, Medicaid, Indian \nHealth Service, SCHIP, DOD, and FEHPB. That accounts for 61 percent of \nthe people in this country who have health care. They are getting it \nthrough the government now. Our answer is more government? Our answer \nto the solution is more government?\n  What should our goals be? Our goals should include access for \neverybody; affordable prices; liberty to choose what is best for you \nand yours, not limited by your State, not limited by the Federal \nGovernment, it should be your choice; freedom to choose your caregiver. \nYou don't get that in Medicaid. You don't get that at the VA. You don't \nget that at Indian Health Service. You limitedly get it through \nMedicaid. Another goal is security in your health care, knowing that no \nmatter what happens, you will have health care. Those are things I \nthink the Presiding Officer would agree with.\n  I am joined on the floor by the other physician in the Senate, \nSenator Barrasso from Wyoming. I welcome him.\n  I wanted to spend 1 additional second outlining a few things.\n  Here is the bill we have on the floor, the Reid substitute. I will \nnot talk about the parliamentary shenanigans that have gone along with \nwhat we are doing. The fact is, we are going to have a debate on health \ncare. It couldn't have been said any better than by Senator Snowe. \nEvery major piece of legislation that has affected most people in this \ncountry has occurred on a bipartisan basis. If this gets passed, you \nwill see a revolt in this country because it is not what the vast \nmajority across party lines want to see. We need to meet in the middle.\n  Just so I can tell you what is in here or what is not in here, there \nis no provision in here guaranteeing that taxpayers will not finance \nabortion. There is no provision prohibiting the rationing of health \ncare. You will see rationing of health care with this bill. We are \nseeing it now in Medicare more every day. CMS is not supposed to be \ndoing it, but they have a reason not to do it. There is a law that says \nthey are not supposed to do it, but it doesn't prohibit them. Now they \nare rationing about 17 things. They have made a decision on practicing \nmedicine. You will see that.\n  There is zero number of Senators who are going to be required to \nenroll in the health care bill we will put everybody else on. There are \nnine new taxes created in this bill, nine new separate taxes. There are \n13 pages in the bill's table of contents, single-spaced. This bill \nweighs 20.8 pounds. There are 36 pages in the CBO explanation of what \nthey think it might or might not do. It has 70 new government programs. \nThink about what that means in terms of bureaucracy and then think \nabout your choices, about who you want taking care of you and whether \nyou and that caretaker, that physician are going to get to decide what \nis best for you or some of these 70 new government agencies. And 1,697 \ntimes in this legislation we allow the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to create, determine, and define critical things in this bill \nand write the regulations--1,697 times. There are going to be 1,697 new \nsets of regulations in health care in this bill alone. There are 2,074 \npages. There are 2.5 million people who will lose their health \ninsurance with this bill who have it today. They are going to get moved \ninto some government program. There are still going to be 24 million \npeople left without health insurance, if this is fully implemented, \naccording to CBO. This bill costs $6.8 million a word. It is $1.2 \nbillion per page. Ten billion will be needed every year for the IRS \njust to follow the regulations for the tax collection in this bill. \nThat isn't even considered in the CBO score. There is going to be $8 \nbillion in taxes levied on uninsured individuals. There is going to be \nat a minimum $25 billion a year in increased mandates on States for \nMedicaid; there is $28 billion in new taxes on employers not providing \ngovernment-approved plans; there is $100 billion of fraud annually in \nMedicare; there is $118 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage; there is \n$465 billion in total cuts to Medicare; there is $494 billion in \nrevenue from new taxes and fees levied on individuals, on American \nfamilies, and businesses. Mr. President, $2.5 trillion is the non-Enron \naccounting cost for this bill.\n\n  Finally, there is $12 trillion worth of national debt today, and this \nbill by itself will take it to $15 trillion in 10 years. It will \nincrease the national debt in less than 10 years by $3 trillion.\n  So with 61 percent of the health care in this country already \nsupplied by the government--and either bankrupt or going bankrupt or \nnot giving the care that is promised; look at Native American care--we \nare going to do more government health care.\n  Senator McCain had a great analogy the other day on this bill. This \nbill starts collecting taxes right away. The American people need to \nknow the reason there is the delay in the onset of the benefits in this \nbill. It is because that is the only way they can make it score and \nlook like it is not spending the amount of money it is spending.\n  But he used this analogy and I thought it was really great: This bill \nis like you buying a new home; you go get your mortgage, and you start \npaying on your mortgage, and you get ready to move in the house, and \nthey say: Uh-oh, the deal was you can move in in 5 years, because that \nis when the benefits start, 5 years from now. But we want you to pay on \nit for 5 years before you get to move into it.\n  None of us would do that. Yet that is exactly what this bill does. It \nis not a bait and switch. It is just deceptive, and it is dishonest in \nits accounting. And, of course, Washington has been dishonest. We use \nEnron accounting. Anything that makes it look less expensive or us look \nbetter, that is how we account for it.\n  Finally, I would say this, and then I will yield to my colleague and \nfellow physician, Senator Barrasso.\n  Of the things that are wrong with health care in America and the \nthings that are right--the things that are right are because we have a \npatient-centered system; the things that are wrong are associated with \na government-centered system.\n  This is a government-centered health care fix, and it is not even a \nfix. It does not address malpractice costs. It is somewhere between \n$100 billion and $175 billion a year in tests we are ordering that \npeople do not need because we refuse to address the tort system in this \nbill.\n  What we need is a patient-centered result. What we need is meeting in \nthe middle to solve this problem for the American people.\n  Abraham Lincoln said: America will never be lost by being destroyed \nfrom the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be \nbecause we have destroyed ourselves.\n  This bill is the path to destruction for health care in America. \nEighty percent of the people in this country will get along just fine \nwith this bill. Twenty percent are going to suffer drastically under \nthis bill because it totally ignores the clinical practice of the art \nof medicine. Everything is based on a government-run, government-\nmandated, government-controlled fiat that takes away your liberty, \ntakes away your choice, takes away your freedom; and now we will move \nphysicians from having to be 100-percent advocates for the patient to \nan\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\nadvocate for the government first and the patient second. That is the \nfirst health care outcome we could have.\n  Senator Barrasso.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, continuing along this line--because both \nof us have practiced medicine--I took care of families in Wyoming as an \northopedic surgeon for the last 25 years; Dr. Coburn in Oklahoma for \nlonger than that. We know there are things that need to be corrected. \nThere are improvements that need to be made. We need to fix what is \nwrong with the system, and that is what I hear every weekend when I go \nhome. It is what I have talked about in the surgeons' lounge in the \nhospital. That is what I have talked about in the office with my \npatients. So we need to fix what is wrong with the health care system. \nBut whatever we do, we have to make sure we do not make matters worse. \nSo I say to my friend from Oklahoma, absolutely, my concerns are that \nthis absolutely is going to make matters worse. It is going to increase \npremiums for families who have insurance. It is going to take almost \n$500 billion away from our seniors who depend upon Medicare for their \nhealth care. It is going to raise taxes on everyone in America--not \njust on people above a certain income level, on everyone.\n  They all are going to be impacted when you look at all the taxes that \nare going to be thrown on this. It is going to be passed along. People \nin America understand that. People know exactly what is happening here. \nThat is why when I had a telephone townhall meeting earlier this week \nand asked: ``Is this the right way or the wrong way? Do you think you \nare going to pay more?'' Everybody thinks they are going to pay more. \nWhen asked: Do you think your system is going to get better or worse? \nThey think it is going to get worse. Americans do not want to pay more \nand get less. That is not the value we as Americans want. It is not \nwhat we expect.\n  People say: Don't cut my Medicare. Especially, if you are going to \ntry to do anything with Medicare, do it to save Medicare, which is \nalready going to go broke in the year 2017. Don't do it to start some \nwhole new, big government program. They say: Don't raise my taxes. \nPeople want to know what is going to happen to them, what is going to \nhappen to their family.\n  What happens if they get sick? Well, they look at this and they say: \nWe want practical, commonsense health solutions, not higher insurance \npremiums, not higher taxes, not Medicare cuts, not more government \ncontrol over health care decisions. We want to have lower costs, \nimproved access to providers, more choices. That is the whole crux of \nwhy we are doing health care reform, at least that is what I was told 9 \nor 10 months ago. When they said: We need health care reform. I said: \nYes, we do.\n  I served 5 years in the Wyoming State Senate. We did major pieces of \nlegislation, always in a bipartisan manner, as the senior Senator from \nMaine has said. Now we are trying to find a way where somebody is \ntrying to get just the minimum number of votes to pass this--not \nbecause they want to say, let's see what we have that will work for \npeople.\n  As doctors, we try to find solutions that work for people. We do not \nsay: What is the very minimum we can do? That is what we are seeing \nhere. We are saying: What can we do to get it right? What this bill is \nsaying is: What can we do to get 60 votes, the minimum we can do to get \nthis, to drag it over the next step along the line--not to solve the \nhealth care issue that faces our country.\n  We know we need to deal with access to care, quality of care, and the \ncost of care. As my colleague from Oklahoma said earlier, it is the \ncost of care that needs the attention right now. Eighty-five percent of \npeople like the care they have but they do not like the cost of that \ncare. So what can we do to help get that cost down?\n  Everything I read and everything I know and everything I study and \neverything I believe from my years of practicing medicine and taking \ncare of patients tells me this is going to drive the cost up for \neveryone in the country. And that is not just me.\n  The dean of Harvard Medical School said it just the other day. He \ngave the whole thing a failing grade. He said those ``people who favor \nthe legislation are engaged in collective denial.'' And he went on to \nsay that when you talk about the problems of cost and access and \nquality--with the cost, he said, this ``will markedly accelerate \nnational health-care spending rather than restrain it'' and will ``do \nlittle or nothing to improve quality.''\n  Well, if you are going to spend much more money, you ought to get \nincreased quality. But the problem is not that we are not spending \nenough money. We are spending enough money in the system. Half of all \nthe money we spend in this country for health care goes for just 5 \npercent of the people--people who eat too much, exercise too little, \nand smoke. But there is nothing in this bill anywhere that gives an \nincentive to those individuals, to that one person to say: Hey, look, \nwe want you to quit smoking. We want to help you lose weight. We want \nto help you get your cholesterol under control, through exercise get \nyour diabetes under control, get your blood sugar down. There is \nnothing that gives an incentive to any one individual.\n  Now, there is a lot of money in here for roadways and streetlights \nand jungle gyms to encourage community health. But that does not work. \nWhat works better is an individual incentive to some person to say you \nare going to save this much money, get this much money, if you take \nresponsibility for your own health. A lot of people try to do that on \ntheir own. But those are the 95 percent, not the 5 percent who are \ncosting this country 50 percent of its health care dollars.\n  But I will ask my colleague from Oklahoma, do you see anything in \nhere that focuses on that individual patient, a patient-centered \napproach, as opposed to a government-centered approach or an insurance \ncompany-centered approach? I see nothing here that is really focused on \nthe individual patient, giving them incentives, giving them \nopportunities, giving that individual, American citizen more control, \nmore freedom of choice, to help stay healthy and keep down the cost of \ntheir care.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, in answer to my colleague's question, \nthere is not an incentive. This bill is full of mandates. And what it \ndoes not mandate it sets up panels to mandate. It sets up panels of \nbureaucrats to mandate. The real difference on this bill--and I believe \nwe have big problems with the insurance industry, but I do not think \nyou eliminate it. I think what you do is you clean it up and make it \nhave to be competitive and fair and open and honest. What the bill does \nis it mandates.\n  Just this week, the Preventative Services Task Force came out with \nnew recommendations for mammograms. If you are only thinking about \ncost, they are great recommendations. If you are looking at it only \nfrom cost--how do we most effectively spend the dollars--their \nrecommendations are absolutely right. But if you are thinking about \nhealth, their recommendations are absolutely wrong.\n  You ask the thousands upon thousands of women last year under age 50 \nwho had their breast cancer diagnosed early with a mammogram what they \nthink about the Preventative Services Task Force's recommendation and \nlisten to what they have to say. What they are going to say and what \nthey are going to tell us is that would have made me odd woman out \nbecause I would not have had a mammogram. I am talking not high-risk \npatients. What they are talking about not screening--and that is what \nthe majority of these mammograms find, with no symptoms, no increased \nrisk--you are going to see that multiplied one-hundredfold in this \nsystem.\n  I know the Senator is old enough to have been trained in medicine the \nsame way I was. There are three real tenets in medicine. The three \ntenets they drill into you are--the first thing is do not hurt anybody. \nWhatever you do, try not to hurt anybody. And in the practice of \nmedicine and the art of medicine sometimes that happens, we do hurt \npeople. Sometimes we hurt them on purpose to try to get them better. \nBut the first is to do no harm.\n  The second is to listen to the patient. Well, the patient at this \ntime in America is the American citizenry, where 85 percent of the \npeople pretty well like what they have, and they want the good kept as \nwe fix what is wrong.\n  Finally, the third tenet of medicine that almost every doctor is \ntaught is,\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\nif it has already been done and it is not working, do not do it again, \nand do not keep doing it.\n  Well, let me tell you something. Medicaid is not working. Indian \nhealth care is not working. Medicare is broke. The States are broke \nunder the weight of Medicaid. We should give great pause as we break \nthe three tenets of medicine in hopes of saying we reformed health \ncare.\n  When President Obama spoke to us under a joint session of Congress, \nthis is what I believe he should have said. This is an important matter \nfor America. It is important to us economically. It affects every \nindividual in this country. And what he should have said is: I have not \nbeen leading very well on this because we are way over here on one side \non this issue, and I am going to admit I have not been leading very \nwell. But here is what I am going to do. I am going to bring us \ntogether in the middle where we can all agree on--it is kind of like \nSenator Enzi's 80-percent rule. It is a great rule. Senator Enzi has \njoined us. He is the ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee. I want to bring us together and find something \non which 80 percent of us can agree.\n  Had he done that, he would have been a hero in solving the problems \nin which we find ourselves. Instead, we are going to try to pass \nsomething that, before we are through with it, the vast majority of \nAmericans are not going to want. And if you do pass it, and he does \nsign it, they are going to revolt.\n  So as our friend Lamar Alexander said: What we ought to do is start \nover. We ought to fix one step at a time the things we know are most \nimportant, as the author and promoter of association health plans \nsuggests, where we increase the buying power; transparency in the \ninsurance market; risk reevaluation so people can't cherry-pick; \neliminate preexisting illnesses so they can't cancel insurance. All of \nthose things we can do without creating all of these new programs, all \nthese 1,697 times that the Secretary of HHS is going to write the rules \nand regulations.\n\n  I thank Senator Barrasso, No. 1, for his insight and experience. I \nwould leave our colleague, the senior Senator from Wyoming, with this \nthought: You have two doctors down here who happen to be Senators, who \nhave well over 50 years of practice experience. I had a business career \nin the health industry prior to going into medicine. We diagnosis this \nbill as sick. We diagnosis it as something that should be pulled from \nthe market, just as the FDA pulled Vioxx. It will not solve the \nproblem; it will make the patient sicker.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to thank the two doctors for their \ncomments. I have been enthralled with what they have been saying. They \nhave been doing a series of programs to help people understand what we \ncould do with health care and how health care is being done. I am glad \nthey point out that vast difference. Obviously, it was a very effective \nprogram. It was so effective that the other side decided to have a show \ntoo. They put up the two lawyers, and it shows one of the problems.\n  When the President did speak to us at the joint session, he talked \nabout medical malpractice reform and how he was going to do it the next \nday. The only problem is what he was referring to was a bill I did with \nSenator Baucus that was ignored in the HELP Committee and it was \nignored in the Gang of 6 and it was ignored in the Finance Committee, \nsomething that would have gotten some medical malpractice reform going. \nI think that only saves about $54 billion. That is still a lot of money \nto me. It is a lot of money even in this bill, although this is a $1 \ntrillion bill.\n  I appreciate the doctors. I particularly appreciate my colleague from \nWyoming who has been here all day adding comments from his medical \nbackground and making a substantial contribution to having the people \nof America understand this bill. But the people of America understand \nthe bill better than the people in this Chamber. That is the problem. \nIn August there were town meetings and people were appalled at the \nnumber of people who wanted to go to those town meetings and the way \nthey wanted to speak, and they explained to us why this method won't \nwork. It wasn't because anybody organized them. If Republicans were \nthat good at organization, we would still be in the majority. These \nwere people who were concerned about health care and where it was \ngoing. They had read a lot about what had been said, and they are still \nreading about it, and they are still mad. This isn't where they want to \ngo. The average person in America thought we were going to cut their \nhealth care costs or at least keep them from escalating. That isn't \nwhat this bill does. This bill builds a whole bunch of new programs and \ntaxes people and steals from Medicare. That is not where the country \nwants to go. I know that is not where the seniors want to go. I have \nbeen surprised at the AARP endorsing the bill. Their members don't \nthink so. Their members are appalled at what is in here and how it is \ngoing to affect Medicare.\n  But my real intent tonight is to discuss this bill and how the \nincrease in health care costs raises taxes and particularly affects \nsmall businesses. It makes them less competitive. Small businesses \nacross America are the engine of the economy. I don't know how many \ntimes I hear that around here--the engine of the economy. If small \nbusiness is growing, the economy is growing. If small business is \nstagnant, people are still losing jobs in big businesses, and it is \nusually the ones who lose the jobs in big businesses that eventually \nget absorbed into the small businesses. It is a shift of a brain trust \nand it makes the small businesses grow and they stay the engine in the \neconomy.\n  As many of my colleagues know, before I came to the Senate I was a \nsmall business owner. My wife and I owned three small shoe stores in \nWyoming and Montana. When I talk about small business, I don't talk \nabout it in the vacuum of the Senate floor; I speak from my life \nexperience. I know what it is like to manage a small business, to keep \nthe books, to pay the vendors, and always to serve your customers. In \nthe Small Business Committee I like to remind them that even though the \nFederal definition of small business is 500 employees or less, the real \nengines of the economy are much smaller than that. Some of them are the \nones that are just starting, where the owner of the business sweeps the \nsidewalk, cleans the toilets, waits on customers, and does the books, \nand definitely not in that order. That is the small business. That is a \nsmall business growing. Those are the kinds of businesses that becomes \nthe big businesses. A lot of them fail. A lot of them know they are \ntaking a risk, but thank goodness they are willing to take that kind of \nrisk. They never expect the government to add to their risk, but they \nknow it does.\n  I faced the challenges of making payroll and trying to negotiate \ngood, affordable benefits for my employees. I have had that experience \nof sitting bolt upright in the middle of the night and saying, Tomorrow \nis payroll. How am I going to meet payroll? Sometimes you do it without \npaying yourself, but the business keeps going.\n  I have to say in a small business the employees are very close to the \nbusiness. They understand how tenuous it is. They work and they \nparticipate and in the good businesses, they are all like family. So \nthey don't have some of the same choices that the big, flexible \ncompanies do. I see where a company in Virginia is about to lay off--\nAmerica On Line is about to lay off 2,500 people. The person who lays \nthem off, do you think they know those 2,500 people? No, they won't \nknow those 2,500 people. I suppose that makes it a lot easier. But in \nsmall business, they know their people. They want to do whatever they \ncan to keep that brain trust, that skill, that ability around, and they \nsacrifice a lot to get to do that.\n  As a former small business owner, I also understand that if we pass \nthis bill, it will harm the engine of economic growth, and it will be a \ndisaster for millions of Americans. This bill will impose $493 billion \nin new taxes, and those fall disproportionately on the backs of small \nbusiness men and women.\n  For instance, the new $54 billion increase in the Medicare payroll \ntax will hit approximately one-third of the small business owners \nacross the country. These are the same businesses that\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\nemploy over 30 million Americans. So why would this affect them? Do \nthey make that much money? Well, that much money shows up on their \nbooks. Most of them are Subchapter S corporations, which means that \nevery dollar of profit becomes their own income, even though they have \nto take most of it and put it back into the business in order to keep \nthe business going and to grow the business. But some of them look like \nthey make a lot of money.\n  There are some businessmen in Gillette, WY, and they started a \nrestaurant. They now have six restaurants. I happened to be in one of \ntheir restaurants in Casper. Sanford's is the name of it. It is a \nbrandnew restaurant, and when I was there, the owner happened to be \nthere and he recognized me and he came over and visited. He knew we \nwere working on this. He said, You know, they keep piling stuff on us. \nThey think we are rich. Sometimes the things we have to file with the \ngovernment because of our Subchapter S corporation make us look rich \nand cost us a lot in taxes. We are helping them to keep this government \ngoing, but we don't get to put it in our pocket. He said, When we \nstarted that first business, we each had $200 in our pocket and we were \nable to borrow enough money to start that restaurant. Each restaurant \nthat we built has been a little fancier and a little nicer. The one you \nare sitting in right now cost $500 million to build. He said, You know, \nme and my partner still only have $200 bucks in our pocket. The rest of \nit we have had to plow back into the business. And when we plow it back \ninto the business, it creates more jobs. There are more people working. \nI will tell you, those are good jobs, too.\n\n  I don't understand at a time when small business owners are \nstruggling to pay their bills and to keep the lights on, the majority \nleader has decided we ought to increase their taxes. These businesses \nare fighting for their very survival. This bill makes it harder for \nthem. Small business owners are also health care consumers like the \nrest of us. They take prescription drugs to treat diseases such as \ncholesterol and hypertension from the stress they are under, and they \nmight also use a pacemaker or have a hip or a knee replaced. If this \nbill is passed, the prices they pay for all of those items will \nincrease. They increase for the employees they have too who have those \nsame things done.\n  This bill contains over $40 billion in new fees for prescription \ndrugs and medical devices. The nonpartisan Joint Commission on Taxation \nhas said these types of fees will ultimately be passed through--to \nwhom? To the consumer, meaning that the small business owner is going \nto pay more for his health care and for the health care of his \nemployees.\n  Many small businesses still manage to provide health insurance \ncoverage for their employees, despite the ever-increasing cost of \nhealth insurance. I understand how hard it is to pay those ever-\nincreasing costs. That is why I fought for years to help small \nbusinesses band together so they would be able to get the same kind of \ndiscounts that insurers typically provide for the large employers. How \nwould that work? Businesses would be able to band together through \ntheir associations across State lines, even nationwide, and build a big \nenough pool that they could effectively negotiate with the insurance \ncompanies or with the providers. I have to tell you, when I proposed \nthat, the insurance companies didn't like it. We went ahead with it \nanyway. I got it through committee. I brought it here to the floor of \nthe Senate, and I understand how hard it is to get health care reform \ndone. I had a bill that was filibustered on the motion to proceed. I \ngot 55 votes. I had three people who would have voted for it who \nweren't here. I got 55 votes. That wasn't enough. You have to have 60 \nin order to move on.\n  Here is the real irony. Olympia Snowe was ready to do the amendment \nthat probably would have taken care of 80 percent of the concerns of \nthe people, but because we couldn't do the motion to proceed, we \ncouldn't offer that amendment. We couldn't finish the bill. As a \nresult, there are no small business health plans that cross State \nlines. Yes, there are small business health plans. Ohio is the \nlaboratory that I used to work the idea. Ohio already had this kind of \nthing within its State boundaries. There is a lot of population in \nOhio. Wyoming doesn't have much population so we can't form these big \npools, but Ohio could. I looked at what they had done and it was \nmarvelous. It saved money. It gave more benefits than most of the \ninsurance plans in the State. You know what they said to me? We could \ndo better if we could cross that State line. If we could go nationwide \nor even across to one more State, we could do better for every one of \nour people, because we would have a little bigger pool and we could \nsave more money. They said, in the initial phase of this, you know \nwhere most of the money is saved? I said, No, where? They said, In \nadministrative costs. Each of those little businesses having to do \ntheir own buying, figuring, paying, costs a lot of money, about 38 \npercent of health care. That doesn't show up in premiums; that is a \ncost. Do you know what the Ohio small businesses were able to save? \nTwelve percent. Twelve percent. That is a huge savings, just in \nadministrative costs. But, no, we weren't able to pass that on to these \nsmall businesses. Instead, we are coming up with a way to tax them \nmore, regulate them more, which is not exactly my idea of how to fix \nhealth care.\n  Rather than lowering the costs, this Reid bill will actually increase \nthe cost of insurance by creating a new $60 billion tax on insurers. \nJust like the new taxes on drugs and devices, the cost of the new \ninsurance tax will be passed through to the consumers, meaning that \nsmall businesses will see their health insurance premiums go up even \nmore.\n  The damage this bill will do to small business is, unfortunately, not \nlimited to the new taxes it creates. The bill will also impose \nexpensive new mandates and requirements on insurance that will have the \neffect of dramatically increasing costs for small employers. One of the \nworst provisions dealing with insurance market reform is the so-called \nshared responsibility for employers. What the authors of the bill are \ntrying to hide behind and what sounds harmless is a $28 billion job-\nkilling tax on employers.\n  Under the bill, if an employer doesn't provide health insurance \nbenefits to any employee eligible for the new insurance subsidies, \nwhich includes families making up to $90,000 a year, then the employer \nhas to pay a fine. The penalty is equal to $750 per employee for all \nthe employees.\n  Let me say that again. If an employer doesn't provide benefits to an \nemployee eligible for the new insurance subsidies, which includes \nfamilies making up to $90,000 a year, that employer has to pay a fine. \nThe penalty is equal to $750 per employee for all the employees, not \njust the one eligible for a subsidy.\n  The nonpartisan scorekeepers at the CBO plus nationally recognized \neconomists have said the costs of this new tax bill will ultimately be \npaid by workers. Businesses that cannot afford to provide health \ninsurance will pass the costs of these new penalties on to their \nworkers in the form of stagnant or lower wages, reduced hours, and \neliminated jobs.\n  According to one recent study by the Heritage Foundation, this new \njob-killing tax will place more than 5 million low-income workers at \nrisk of losing their job, or having their hours reduced, and an \nadditional 10 million workers could see lower wages and reduced \nbenefits. That is what they have to do to stay in business.\n  The bill contains a narrow exemption for small businesses with 50 or \nfewer employees. Similar to many of the other poorly conceived \nprovisions of the bill, even this exemption is likely to create \nunintended and harmful consequences.\n  What is the likelihood that a small employer with 50 employees right \nnow will agree to expand their business if by adding that single extra \nemployee they expose themselves to this new job-killing tax? Small \nbusinesses are the engine of economic growth. I cannot say that enough. \nThey create the jobs in this country. But this provision will \ndiscourage the creation of new jobs.\n  Fifteen million Americans are currently unemployed and 19 percent of \nsmall businesses have reported that they reduced employment in their \nfirms in the last 3 months. If this bill is passed, the Reid job-\nkilling employer tax will mean that more Americans\n\n[[Page S11902]]\n\nwill lose their jobs. We ought to be concentrating on jobs. Instead, we \nare focusing on something that will kill jobs.\n  The Reid bill will also impose sweeping new regulations over the \nhealth insurance marketplace. Similar to most new regulatory schemes \nimposed on small businesses, this one will also mean increased costs \nfor small businesses.\n  Small business owners know the current market for health insurance is \nnot sustainable. According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation report, \ncosts for small businesses, those with less than 200 employees, rose by \n5 percent from 2008 to 2009, and they are expected to rise again next \nyear.\n  We all agree the status quo for health insurance is not acceptable. \nEqually unacceptable, however, should be any proposals that make the \ncurrent situation worse. Unfortunately, that is exactly what the Reid \nbill will do.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the administration's own \nactuaries, the National Association of State Insurance Commissioners, \nand at least six other private studies have all looked at provisions \nsimilar to what is in the Reid bill, and they all found that these \nprovisions will drive up health insurance costs.\n  Actuaries at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which did one of the \nstudies, estimated these provisions will increase premiums for small \nbusinesses by at least 20 percent. Last year, they had an increase of 5 \npercent. This is going to do 20 percent. I suspect most small \nbusinessmen will notice that, and they will also know where the blame \nlies. WellPoint, the largest Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan in the Nation, \nlooked at their actual claims experiences in the 14 States in which \nthey operate and concluded that the premiums for healthier small \nbusinesses will increase in all 14 States--in Nevada by as much as 108 \npercent.\n  The bill also eliminates consumer choices, requiring Americans to buy \nricher types of plans that cover more deductibles and out-of-pocket \nexpenses. These plans typically have much higher premiums. That is \nright. Washington is going to tell you what kind of insurance you have \nto have, even if it is a lot better than what you have now and you like \nwhat you have now. That is not good enough. Washington knows better for \nyou what you need in the way of health insurance. They are going to see \nthat you get it. Boy, are you going to get it. These plans typically \nhave much higher premiums. We have looked at the studies to see how \nmany people have the quality of insurance we are talking about at the \nlowest acceptable level. If you don't do that, you get fined. OK.\n  Well, these new mandates will make it more difficult for small \nbusinesses to adopt new, affordable, high-deductible health plans. \nThese plans, when combined with health savings accounts, have been \nenormously successful in recent years in helping small businesses \ncontrol health care costs. I know a secret here in the Senate. There \nare quite a few employees--particularly the younger ones--who did a \nlittle evaluation, because in the Senate everybody has the same choices \nand everybody gets to buy from the private market and everybody can \npick how much they want to pay in premiums compared to deductibles. You \ncan pay more premium, less deductible, or less premium and more \ndeductible. The two balance out. People know that. Some of the astute \nkids in my office took a look at buying the insurance as opposed to \ndoing the high deductible and putting it in a health savings account. \nThey found out they could take the money it would cost for the regular \nplan and, instead, buy this high deductible and take the difference and \nput it in a savings account. The savings account grows tax free. It has \nto be used for health care, but it pays for health care things as they \ncome up. In less than 3 years, the one putting in the least covered the \nentire deductible. So for the rest of the time, she would not have to \nput any more into that savings account. But she is smart. She said: I \nam putting that in there tax free, and someday I will need it. So she \nis continuing to grow that.\n  We have decided that is a bad deal. I will tell you, people around \nhere are smarter than us. They are figuring out how to save money on \nhealth insurance already. I don't think they are going to like that.\n  Another thing you can do as an employee here is have a flexible \nsavings account. That happens in a lot of businesses across the \ncountry. If you have company insurance, you can do a flexible savings \naccount. This bill is going to do away with that too. That is the way \nto do it if you know you are going to have health expenses the next \nyear that don't fall within your policy. You can put that money in the \nbank tax free and use it as those bills come due.\n  We are going to limit that, and that limit isn't going to have any \nfluctuation dealing with inflation, so in 2 or 3 years that program is \ngone. I don't know why these ones that encourage people to save and \nplan for the future are such bad ideas.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 11 percent of small \nbusiness employees are enrolled in HSAs. Average HSA premiums for small \nbusinesses are 20 percent lower than the traditional PPO plans, and the \nnumber of employers offering HSAs has nearly doubled over the last 3 \nyears.\n  If you work for Starbucks, that is one of the small companies--not \nreally. But Starbucks provides insurance to their people. They do it \nthrough HSAs. We are talking about getting rid of that, saying it is \nnot good enough. There are going to be upset people.\n  The new mandates in the bill will prevent some high-deductible health \nplans from being sold because they do not provide a rich enough \nbenefit.\n  Small businesses are not just purchasers of health care, they are \nalso providers. Doctors, home health aides, and nursing home owners are \nall small business owners. They have a significant stake in how this \nbill turns out. You can tell from the two practitioners we have here \nwho understand and had small businesses, they understand how this \nworks. That is without even getting into the fact that the government, \nin Medicaid and Medicare, cuts what they pay so it is below their cost. \nYou know how hard it is to run a business below cost? It is impossible. \nYou have to shift the cost somewhere else so the people under private \ninsurance pick up the costs.\n\n  I am reminded of some farmers who decided they could make a killing \nand drive the truck over to North Dakota and buy some eggs for just 24 \ncents a dozen. They could bring them back to their home State and they \ncould sell them for a lot more. Of course, when they sold them and \nfigured in the expense of picking them up, they found out they were \nonly getting 20 cents a dozen for them. If that is the case, you cannot \njust buy a bigger truck and solve the problem. That is what doctors are \nfinding. They are saying: I cannot afford to take Medicaid patients or \nMedicare patients. If you cannot see a doctor, you don't have any \ninsurance at all. That is where we are driving this thing.\n  Unfortunately, a number of the provisions in the Reid bill will \ndevastate these small health provider businesses. The bill cuts over \n$460 billion from Medicare over the next 10 years, slashing Medicare \npayments to hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies.\n  The Reid bill will cut over $15 billion in Medicare payments to the \nnursing homes. In a rural State such as mine, this level of cut will \ndestroy many small business nursing homes and force the closure of the \nfacilities that currently provide nursing home care to hundreds of \nMedicare patients.\n  Connie Jenkins, the executive director of the Star Valley Senior \nCenter, south of Jackson, WY--a lot of people know where Jackson is, \nover on the western side of the State; it is the home of the Grand \nTeton National Park, below Yellowstone National Park. The director \nrecently wrote to me about the important role nursing homes play in \nrural small towns in Wyoming. She noted that many small communities \ndepend on nursing facilities to provide a large portion of the \navailable jobs. She wrote that ``in a rural State, such as ours, \nclosing of nursing homes would mean families traveling further to visit \nloved ones and, in some cases, loss of access altogether.'' It is \nimportant to be near the people who are in a nursing home. We have \ngreat distances and very small towns.\n  The Reid bill would also cut more than $40 billion in Medicare \npayments to home health agencies. According to the analysis done by one \nindustry association, this level of cuts could put\n\n[[Page S11903]]\n\nnearly 70 percent of all home health agencies at risk of having to \nclose their doors.\n  Home health agencies provide valuable assistance to disabled \nindividuals, allowing them to receive their care in their home. It is a \nlot cheaper than a nursing home. If these cuts are enacted and these \nagencies are forced to close, the patients will have to go back into \ninstitutional facilities to receive their care. In addition to \ndevastating these small businesses, this proposal would clearly break \nthe President's promise to protect Medicare beneficiaries and not \nreduce their benefits.\n  Many doctors, such as my colleague, John Barrasso, who has been on \nthe Senate floor all day, have also been small business owners. Doctors \nare currently facing a 21-percent reduction in Medicare payments that \nis slated to go into effect in January. Despite cutting $460 billion \nfrom the Medicare Program, the Reid bill does nothing to fix the \nMedicare payment formula for physicians. Since 40 percent of doctors \nwill not take Medicaid patients, that is now moved into Medicare, and I \nthink 20 percent will not take Medicare patients. How would you like \nasking for an appointment and they say: Are you Medicare? And if you \nare, we are not taking you.\n  It can happen. That is not health insurance at all. Also, it is \nfascinating that Medicare doesn't have catastrophic coverage. We will \ntalk about that. Unlike the Federal Government, small business owners \ncannot lose money on every Medicare patient and then hope to make it up \non volume. A 21-percent payment cut is not sustainable, and it \nhighlights why we need to fix the broken Medicare physician payment \nformula. Rather than stealing $460 billion from Medicare to create a \nnew entitlement program for the uninsured, we should use those moneys \nto strengthen and improve Medicare.\n  Medicare is going broke. You saw the charts over there earlier. It is \ngoing broke. We are going to take $460 billion from it. Oh, but don't \nworry. The bill has a little provision in there where we are going to \nform a commission that, every year, will give us suggestions on how we \nought to cut Medicare so that it stays solvent.\n  I don't know any other way you can put that: Cut Medicare to stay \nsolvent. We had to form a commission to do that after we steal $460 \nbillion from the program. It cannot afford to have that taken out.\n  Another interesting thing on that commission is they already made a \ndeal with the hospitals, and they cannot cut them, and the doctors were \nsupposed to have a deal, although I think the deal has been broken \nbecause the low payments did not get fixed and the medical malpractice \ndid not get included as they were promised. So I don't know if they are \nstill in there. In exchange, they were supposed to not get any cuts.\n  The pharmaceutical companies were not supposed to get any cuts. I \nwould love to have the time to explain the deal they have. Do you know \nwhom that leaves? That leaves the nursing homes, the home health, and \nthe Medicare patients themselves. They are going to pick up those costs \nthat are each year prescribed to us to pass to save Medicare. Medicare \nmoney should go to Medicare.\n  The Reid bill also drives up health care costs for small businesses \nby its massive expansion of Medicaid. This bill includes the largest \nexpansion of the Medicaid Program since it was created in 1965. In \naddition to trapping 15 million low-income Americans in the worst \nhealth care program in America, this Medicaid expansion will also \nincrease costs for many small businesses.\n  Medicaid uses government price controls to set private rates far \nbelow what private insurers pay, often below the cost of what it costs \nto provide the care. According to one estimate, Medicaid pays only 60 \npercent of the rates paid by private insurers. This forces doctors to \nmake up for their losses on Medicaid patients by increasing their costs \nto other purchasers. According to a recent estimate by the accounting \nfirm Milliman, inadequate Medicaid payment rates resulted in physicians \nshifting $23.7 billion in costs onto private sector purchasers.\n  Enrolling 15 million more Americans into the broken Medicaid Program \nwill only worsen this cost shift. That means if this bill is enacted, \nsmall business owners will see their health care costs increase as \nphysicians and hospitals struggle to make up for inadequate payments \nfor many more Medicaid patients.\n  In addition to doctors and hospitals, States also cannot afford to \npay for this expansion of the Medicaid Program. The Reid bill imposes \napproximately $25 billion in new unfunded Medicaid costs on State \nbudgets at a time when the States are facing a worse economic crisis in \ngeneral than perhaps our economic crisis because they cannot just print \nthe money.\n  When we were working with the Gang of 6, we had a table that showed \nhow the $25 billion was distributed among the different States. The CBO \nestimate of the $25 billion never changed. But every day, we got a new \nsheet and the different States paid different amounts. Did you know \nthat finally New York and Nevada got theirs down to what they thought \nwas a workable level? I don't know if that is actually the way it will \ncome out if people are just jimmying the numbers.\n  What this will mean for small businesses will be even higher taxes \nand fees, as States struggle to close the estimated $22 billion budget \nshortfall they will face in fiscal year 2011. According to the National \nAssociation of State Budget Officers, States have already enacted $23.8 \nbillion in new taxes and fees in the current fiscal year. These numbers \nare only expected to increase as States see no end in sight to their \ncurrent fiscal crisis.\n  Increased State and Federal taxes, higher health care costs, and \nMedicare payment cuts are the results small businesses are most likely \nto see if the Senate passes the Reid health care reform bill. While \nthese would never be welcome changes, the Senate will be debating these \npolicies at a time when small businesses face their most severe \neconomic challenges since the Great Depression.\n  As I mentioned, unemployment is already at 10.2 percent. Even that \nnumber, which is the worst we have seen in 26 years, may actually \nunderstate the severity of the situation. The government estimates that \nup to 17.5 percent of the population may be entirely without a job or \nunderemployed.\n  Other economic indicators paint a grim picture for a potentially \njobless recovery. In October, new housing starts fell 10.6 percent, \nwhich is 30 percent lower than 1 year ago. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben \nBernanke recently noted that the ongoing financial crisis has led to \nthe reduction or elimination of bank credit lines for many small \nbusinesses. He also noted that the fraction of small businesses \nreporting difficulty in obtaining credit is near a record high, and \nthese conditions are expected to tighten further.\n  Small businesses are the engine of economic growth that can lead this \nNation out of its current economic crisis. Unfortunately, the Reid bill \nwill have the effect of sand being poured into the gears of that \nengine.\n  The recent statement of the National Federation of Retail Businesses \ndoes the best job of summarizing the impact of the Reid bill on small \nbusinesses. They said:\n\n       We oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     due to the amount of new taxes, the creation of new mandates, \n     and the establishment of new entitlement programs. There is \n     no doubt all these burdens will be paid for on the backs of \n     small business. It's clear to us that at the end of the day, \n     the costs to small business more than outweigh the benefits \n     they may have realized.\n\n  I see I have run a few minutes over. I apologize to the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/20/senate-section/article/S11903-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
