Mr. President, I welcome back my colleagues and hope they \nare as eager to get to work as I am.\n  During the week I spent in Nevada, I saw again how desperate our \nunemployment situation has become. As I talked to Nevadans, I heard \nover and over how they need us to help create conditions to help \nbusinesses create jobs. For example, I met one man in Reno who is 51 \nyears old. He said he\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\nhad never missed a payment on his home since he had bought it many \nyears ago. He was going to this month because he was unemployed and \ncouldn't find a job, and he had worked very hard to try to find a job. \nBut now, like 14 percent of Nevadans, he is out of work and can't find \na new job. There are just too many people looking for too few jobs. Now \nhe cannot make his mortgage payment, as I have indicated.\n\n  He is the kind of person we need to keep in mind when we talk about \ncreating jobs. His family is the kind of family we need to keep in mind \nwhen we talk about helping the unemployed with emergency aid. This man \nknows he will not get rich off his unemployment check, but it might \nhelp him keep a roof over his head.\n  Those unemployment benefits we are working to extend--for every job \nthat becomes available, five people line up for that job. And for every \n$1 we spend in unemployment benefits, $1.61 is returned to the economy \nbecause that money is spiraled into doing a lot of good things because \nthey can pay their rent, make their house payment, buy some clothes.\n  I repeat what I have said here before: Mark Zandi, who was, during \nthe Presidential run, John McCain's chief economic adviser, said the \nmost important money we could spend right now is for unemployment \nbenefits.\n  As to my friend in Reno, NV, his struggle, his fears--what keeps this \nman up at night--is what we should remember when the other side \npretends this is more about politics than it is about people.\n  This work period, like every work period, will be about jobs--the \nwork period here in the Senate--how to create them, how to save them, \nand how to prevent another crisis such as the one that killed them in \nthe first place.\n  We are going to build on momentum we have already seen from the \neconomic recovery plan, also known as the stimulus. This jobs crisis \nwas not created in a day, and it will not be solved overnight. But in a \nshort time, we have come a long way.\n  Three million Americans who are going to work today have the Recovery \nAct to thank for their jobs. In Nevada, the Recovery Act created or \nsaved more than 4,000 jobs this spring, and as more projects get \nunderway, it will create even more jobs this summer. And don't forget \nthat the stimulus also cut taxes for families, small businesses, \nstudents, home buyers, and the unemployed.\n  But it is just a step, a first step. Over the next month, we are \ngoing to do everything we can to make a few more big steps. One of \nthese steps will be to pass the small business jobs bill. It is now on \nthe floor. We know the best way to create jobs, innovate, and help our \neconomy recover is through the private sector. We know the engine that \nruns the private sector is made up of small businesses. These \nbusinesses are the ones that have felt the most pain in this recession. \nTwo out of every three jobs we have lost were from small business. Our \nbill, which is fully paid for, will put people back to work through a \nnumber of initiatives.\n  First, it gives small business tax incentives to help them hire and \ngrow more people. Two, it increases Small Business Administration loan \nlimits. Three, it makes it easier for small businesses to export goods. \nAnd four, it creates a small business lending fund that will give small \nbanks more capital.\n  Another step we will take this month is the long overdue--it is long \noverdue; and I have talked about it a little bit this morning--\nextention of emergency unemployment insurance for so many who have been \nout of work for so long. It is more than 2 million people.\n  When millions of Americans lost their jobs, they lost their incomes, \ntheir homes, their savings, their gas money, their tuition payments, \nand on and on and on--all through no fault of their own. Democrats are \nnot about to turn our backs on out-of-work Americans, which is why we \nare trying to help them keep their heads above water in this crisis.\n  The third step is Wall Street reform. It is just as much a jobs bill \nas the first two I mentioned. We all know greed on Wall Street is what \ntriggered the recession, suffocated the job market, and robbed millions \nof their incomes. By cleaning up Wall Street, we are going to make sure \nbig bankers can never again gamble away our economy. We are going to \nmake sure there is not a next time.\n  Helping small businesses, helping the unemployed, and cracking down \non Wall Street are three equally important approaches to the same \nproblem--and to our No. 1 priority--jobs. But these three also have \nsomething else in common: A minority of Senators is standing in the \nway.\n  We have tried for months to help people. Nearly every Democrat has \nsaid yes, and nearly every Republican has said no. That opposition is \nstopping recovery in its tracks.\n  Every day we keep small businesses from creating jobs, or deny the \nunemployed the assistance they need, or let Wall Street get away with \nthe same tricks that nearly sank our economy, we are making a difficult \nsituation even worse. We are keeping people off payrolls, keeping \nbusinesses from hiring, and keeping our country from coming back \nstronger than ever.\n  Simply put, obstruction of these good bills is costing Americans \njobs. The other side thinks saying ``no'' helps them. But it sure does \nnot help the people we are supposed to represent.\n  I hope we will get our priorities straight this work period. It will \nbe a productive one if we do. The next time we go back home to talk to \nour constituents, we will be able to deliver better news, and they will \nbe able to tell us the same in return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5722-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, ordinarily Senators come to the floor \nto talk about the things that happen in Washington while we are here. \nToday I wish to talk about something that happened last week while we \nwere not here. I am referring, of course, to the President's truly \noutrageous decision to take advantage of Congress's absence last week \nto sneak Donald Berwick in as the new head of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  As is well known, Congress has a constitutional duty to examine \nPresidential nominees such as Dr. Berwick. But apparently the prospect \nof giving the American people an opportunity to hear this nominee \ndefend his past praise for government-run systems that ration health \ncare was worrisome enough for the administration that it sought to \nignore congressional oversight altogether.\n  As it turned out, the administration's plan backfired because even \nDemocrats are outraged at this blatant attempt to prevent the American \npeople from hearing this man talk about what he plans to do with \nMedicare and Medicaid. As usual, the administration wants to blame \nRepublicans for its failures. But in this case, the administration's \nfailure to respect the right of the American people to study Dr. \nBerwick's record is being criticized by just about everyone, including \nthe Democratic chairman of the committee in charge of reviewing his \nnomination.\n  Here is what Chairman Baucus said shortly after the appointment was \nmade. Senator Baucus said:\n\n       Senate confirmation of presidential appointees is an \n     essential process prescribed by the Constitution that serves \n     as a check on executive power and protects Montanans and all \n     Americans by ensuring that crucial questions are asked of the \n     nominee, and answered.\n\n  So despite what the administration wants people to think, this recess \nappointment had nothing whatsoever to do with Republicans. The fact is, \nRepublicans were looking forward to the debate. We welcomed the hearing \non Dr. Berwick, and anyone who looks at the facts knows any suggestion \nto the contrary is utter nonsense. So the charge is laughable.\n  This appointment had everything to do with the administration's fear \nof letting Americans hear Dr. Berwick's well-known views about \ngovernment-run care and about how he plans to implement the President's \nplan to cut $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare while limiting the choices \nseniors now enjoy.\n  Here is the irony in all of this: In an attempt to silence debate \nabout Dr. Berwick and its own plans for health\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\ncare, this nomination has only reignited the debate over the Democratic \nhealth care plan. By recess appointing a man who has sung the praises \nof the government-run British health care service, the administration \nis only inviting Americans to ask more questions about its own plans.\n  I would have thought that anyone would be able to understand the \nsignificance of getting answers from an avowed admirer of rationed care \nbefore putting him in charge of implementing this administration's $500 \nbillion Medicare cut.\n  But by denying the American people an opportunity to hear Dr. Berwick \ndefend his past statements and his future plans, the administration is \nnow forcing the Democrats who voted for the Democratic health care plan \nto defend Dr. Berwick and his views themselves. The administration may \nhave shielded this nominee temporarily, but it has only exposed \nDemocrats in Congress who voted for this bill and everything that \nfollows from it--including this truly outrageous appointment.\n  This appointment is the latest evidence of how little the \nadministration has concerned itself with the views of the public. When \na majority of Americans and an overwhelming majority of Kentuckians \nopposed its health care plan, they cut deals with Democratic Senators \nto squeeze it through Congress. Now they are not even bothering with \nCongress. They are unilaterally installing people such as Dr. Berwick \nto take charge of its plan for $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts.\n  This has been the administration's approach all along: Go around the \nAmerican people, and now go around Congress. The administration can try \nto blame Republicans for a debate they do not want to have. But by \ndenying Congress the ability to scrutinize this nominee, it only raises \nAmericans' suspicions about its health care plan and increases the \nburden on Democrats who supported it.\n  Back in March, Speaker Pelosi remarked that we would have to pass the \nhealth care bill to find out what is in it. This nomination is part of \nthe same arrogant approach. The same administration that forced this \nbill on an unwilling public has now forced Don Berwick on to anyone \nwith Medicare and Medicaid. Now Democrats who voted for this bill will \nhave to answer for his statements and for his views.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5723-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the speech which the Senate just heard \nfrom the minority leader on the Republican side is consistent with the \nRepublican position on health care reform. They opposed it. They voted \nagainst it. They want it to fail. They do not want to give this health \ncare reform a chance.\n  It is interesting that although they oppose health care reform, I \nhave yet to hear the first Republican Senator come to the floor and \nsuggest: Well, the first thing we need to do is to make sure we \neliminate--eliminate--the tax credits and deductions for America's \nsmall businesses to help pay for health insurance that were part of the \nhealth care reform plan.\n  I have never heard them say that. They opposed the plan. Do they \noppose the help we are going to give small businesses across America to \nafford health insurance for their employees? That is what repeal is all \nabout.\n  Secondly, I have never heard a Republican Senator come to the floor \nand say: We want to repeal the $250 check which will be sent to \nthousands of Americans currently under Social Security, Medicare \nprescription Part D, to help pay for the gap in coverage in the so-\ncalled doughnut hole. That was part of the health care reform plan. So \nthose who come to the floor asking for repeal of health care reform \nobviously want to repeal this check for senior citizens. I have not \nheard that said one time.\n  I have also been waiting for the Republicans who want to repeal \nhealth care reform to stand before the Senate and say, honestly, \nopenly: We want to eliminate health care insurance coverage for 30 \nmillion Americans who will have it for the first time in their lives--\n30 million uninsured Americans who will have health care insurance \ncoverage because of health care reform. To repeal health care reform is \nto repeal that coverage for 30 million Americans.\n  I have yet to hear the first Republican come to the floor and say \nthey want to repeal extending health insurance coverage and the peace \nof mind that comes with it. I am waiting for the first Republican who \nwants to repeal health care reform to stand before the Senate and say: \nWe want to take away the power given in this health care reform to \nindividuals so they can fight health care insurance companies that turn \ndown coverage for families because of preexisting conditions. It \nhappens every day in Illinois, in Oregon, in Arizona, in Kentucky.\n  The bill we passed gives American families a fighting chance against \nthose health insurance companies. Those who are calling for repeal want \nto take away the power of families to fight for health insurance \ncoverage when they need it the most.\n  I have yet to hear the first Republican who calls for repeal of \nhealth care reform go to families with kids in college and tell them: \nWe oppose that provision in health care reform which extends family \nhealth insurance coverage for young people until they reach the age of \n26. Those of us who have raised college-aged students know that is a \nblessing to have those kids--I call them kids--those young people under \nyour family health care plan after they graduate from college until \nthey reach the age of 26--a period of time when some of them are off \ntaking a trip of a lifetime after graduation or looking for a job and \ndo not have health insurance coverage.\n  I can recall calling my daughter Jennifer: ``This is Dad. I am so \nhappy you graduated from college. Do you have health insurance?'' ``Oh, \nDad, I feel fine. You know, I'm healthy and strong.'' ``No, Jennifer. \nYou need health insurance.''\n  The law we passed, the health insurance we passed, is going to give a \nfamily coverage to protect their kids until the age of 26. Those who \nwant to repeal it want to undo that provision. But I have yet to hear \nthem say that on the floor.\n  They have a different strategy. Senator DeMint of South Carolina made \nit clear when the health care reform debate started that the purpose of \nthe Republican effort was to defeat health care reform. In his words: \nWe want health care reform to be Barack Obama's Waterloo in politics. \nHe was very clear. They wanted the President to fail, they wanted \nhealth care reform to fail, and they still do. Their latest strategy \nwas to stop the President from putting in place a person to run the \nprogram--someone who would try to make it work, someone who would look \nat the things we have done in Congress and make sure they work in the \nreal world.\n\n  Last week, President Obama made a very sensible move, after waiting \npatiently for the Republicans to give us a chance to vote on a man to \nserve and to oversee Medicare and Medicaid as Administrator of CMS. His \nname is Dr. Donald Berwick.\n  CMS has been without a permanent Administrator since 2006, and it is \ntime this important position be held and filled for the good of \nAmerican families. This man, Dr. Berwick, is eminently qualified for \nthis role. He is a Harvard pediatrician and policy expert who was \ncommitted to improving health care long before our debate started and \nwho today is one of the foremost experts and leaders in health care \nquality and patient safety. The President appointed him last week when \nwe were gone because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the \nRepublicans, had made it clear they intended to elongate this debate on \nhis appointment as long as possible, to rehash argument after argument \ninstead of just giving us an up-or-down vote to let this man serve the \nNation\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\nand serve all of us who want quality health care.\n  Rather than work in a bipartisan way to get things right, to make \nsure we implement the health care reform that is decades overdue, the \nRepublicans took a political position and held to it. The President was \nright to come down on the side of helping American families deal with \nhealth care rather than to engage in this never-ending political \nbattle.\n  The Republicans delayed Dr. Berwick's nomination by bringing up the \nsame talking points and the same Republican arguments we have heard \nagain today and over and over again. They are entitled to their point \nof view, but Dr. Berwick is entitled to an up-or-down vote. The \nPresident decided he couldn't wait any longer and made this recess \nappointment.\n  By blocking nominees such as Dr. Berwick, the Republicans are \nblocking progress on improving health care in America. According to \nRollCall, a publication on Capitol Hill, the coordinated Republican \nmessage is called second opinion. I have seen some of my friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle come to the floor with large posters that \nsay ``Second Opinion.'' A Republican Senate aide says the effort is \nintended ``to draw attention to the consequences of the health care law \nthat the White House hopes people miss.''\n  Well, whose second opinion is this? It is the same opinion we have \nheard from Republicans from the start who consistently voted against \nhealth care reform and refused--refused during the course of the \ndebate--to put on the table any proposal which would extend health care \ncoverage to 52 million uninsured Americans, help to hold down the \ncosts, and give people a fighting chance against health insurance \ncompanies. Time and again, they criticized our efforts and never \nproposed a viable, comprehensive alternative.\n  Starting this year, we know children will never again be excluded \nfrom health insurance because of a preexisting condition. That is in \nhealth care reform. Adults will no longer be dropped just because they \nget sick. Young adults will be allowed to stay on their parents' plan, \nas I said earlier, until age 26. These are real changes we are going to \nsee this year. That is the way it should be--health insurance that is \nthere when you need it, not the kind of health insurance where you pay \npremiums for a lifetime and pray to God you don't go to the hospital \nand get a diagnosis that says you are headed in for a surgery or a \nlong-term illness and you are not going to have health insurance \ncoverage. That is the reality for too many American families.\n  The Republicans have never offered an alternative. They have voted \nagainst this consistently, and now they want to stop President Obama in \nevery effort to try to make this work for America.\n  I believe most Americans, even those who have questions about health \ncare reform, believe it deserves a chance. They believe we ought to \ngive it our best human efforts to make it work for America. They want \nto see us work together. They don't want to see these filibusters, they \ndon't want to see these blockages, and they don't want to see the \nconsistent policy of saying no to everything.\n  Don Berwick is a well-respected, accomplished, leading authority in \nhealth care. We are fortunate to have his expertise at the forefront of \nthe agency charged with making many of the changes in health care \ndelivery. He has the respect of Democratic and Republican leaders, \nincluding Mark McClellan, the CMS Administrator under President George \nW. Bush; Gail Wilensky, the CMS Administrator under President George \nH.W. Bush; Nancy Nielsen, immediate past president of the American \nMedical Association; Rich Umbdenstock, president and CEO of the \nAmerican Hospital Association; John Rother, executive vice president of \nthe AARP; and Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA. The list \ngoes on and on. He deserved a vote. The President deserves a team to \nmake the law work. The American people deserve something more from the \nRepublicans than the word ``no.'' That is all we have heard in this \nsession.\n  Now comes an election in just a few months, and the party of no is \nasking for another chance. This is the same party whose economic \npolicies drove us into this economic recession under the previous \nPresident. After driving that car in the ditch, as the President has \nsaid, they are asking in November for the American people to give them \nthe keys again and let them start it up all over. Well, we have learned \na bitter lesson, and we are not going to repeat it. With so many \nmillions of Americans out of work, with this economy struggling to \nsurvive, we cannot and should not return to the policies of the past. \nWe cannot accept no for an answer when it comes to moving America \nforward.\n  I am glad the President made this decision to make a recess \nappointment of Dr. Berwick. He deserved a vote on this floor. He \ndeserved a chance to have his day of service to our country. Sadly and \nunfortunately, the Republican policy of voting no and saying no to the \nPresident has led him to this conclusion and this interim appointment. \nI wish Dr. Berwick the best. We should now try to work with him to make \nthis policy even better, to make sure more Americans have the peace of \nmind of having affordable health insurance when their family needs it \nthe most.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Now let me set the record straight. Republicans have never said no to \nDr. Berwick. We have never blocked a vote on Dr. Berwick. There has \nnever been a vote called on Dr. Berwick. In fact, there has never even \nbeen a hearing on Dr. Berwick. Republicans have not stopped his \nnomination.\n  It is true there hasn't been a permanent director of the agency that \nDr. Berwick will now head since 2006. When Barack Obama became \nPresident on January 20, he could have corrected that problem. But I \nsuspect the reason he didn't nominate anyone to head CMS during the \ndebate on the health care bill is because if Dr. Berwick was his \nnominee, the last thing the President wanted was a discussion of Dr. \nBerwick's views on health care. His views are antithetical to the views \nof the majority of the American people, supporting rationing, as he \ndoes, and his love affair with the British single payer system, as he \nhas described it. This is not something the American people would have \ncountenanced. So Barack Obama, the President, rather than filling the \nposition, decided to hold off on nominating a person to head CMS until \nafter the health care debate was over.\n  Now, this is bait and switch. This is not the transparency that \nBarack Obama promised when he campaigned for the job of President. \nInstead, in my view, it is hiding the ball: Let's get health care \npassed, not tell anybody we are going to nominate Dr. Berwick to head \nCMS, and then, after the bill is passed--in fact, I think about 4 \nmonths after the bill is passed--nominate Dr. Berwick, and then have \nthe gall to say Republicans stopped his nomination. We haven't stopped \nhis nomination. There has been nothing for us to stop. There has been \nno vote.\n\n  I am on the Finance Committee. The chairman of the Finance Committee, \na Democrat, Max Baucus from Montana, was very upset about the fact that \nthe President appointed Dr. Berwick because he said: I haven't even had \na chance to call a hearing yet.\n  Republicans stopped the nomination? No, we didn't stop it. Has there \nbeen a vote on the floor of the Senate? No. Has there been an attempt \nto have a vote? No. So how could we have filibustered a nominee who \nhasn't had a hearing, when his name hasn't even been brought up in \ncommittee, and who hasn't been sent to the Senate floor for action?\n  Well, they say: We anticipated you would have objected to him. Yes, \nthat is true. Knowing all we know about him, you are right; a lot of us \nwould have objected to him. So bring him up for a vote, and let's have \nthe vote, up or down. If he has the votes to pass, he passes. If he \ndoesn't, then perhaps the American people's will has been expressed.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that the ranking Republican on the \nSenate Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley, requested a hearing for Dr. \nBerwick. He requested that it take place the week of June 21. Why? That \nwas before the hearings for the Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan. The \nreason Senator\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nGrassley did that was because he wanted to make sure for the several of \nus--there are three Republicans and I know at least one Democrat who \nserve on both the Judiciary Committee and the Finance Committee. He \nwanted to make sure we would have an opportunity to attend both \nhearings because we knew the time the Elena Kagan hearings were going \nto be held in the Judiciary Committee. He specifically requested that \nSenator Baucus schedule the hearing for Dr. Berwick the week of June \n21. He would have been happy to be there. I would have been happy to be \nthere.\n  For anybody to suggest that Republicans are to blame for the fact \nthat Dr. Berwick's nomination didn't come to a vote or wasn't brought \nto the Senate floor is sheer fantasy. We have not held up the \nnomination. We have not prevented a vote. We have not blocked the vote. \nYes, we have been critical of Dr. Berwick. Since when is that a crime? \nSince when is that the party of no?\n  Let me mention a few of the reasons we are critical of Dr. Berwick \nand why the American people are going to rue the day that the \nPresident, while we were gone from Washington over the July 4 recess, \nrecess-appointed Dr. Berwick. He didn't go through the regular Senate \nprocess. He made a recess appointment before Senators had an \nopportunity to have a hearing or to have a vote.\n  Well, I think I know some of the reasons. First of all, his radical \nviews on health care policy. I am not going to quote all of the things \nhe has said, but he did describe his love of the British single payer \nsystem in very poetic terms. He said he was in love with it. He has \ndescribed it in the most glowing terms. He said his preference is for \nabsolute caps on health care expenditures in the United States. He says \ncompetition is one of the biggest problems in American health care. He \nsays he believes in one-size-fits-all care. That is a direct quotation. \nEverything I have said here are quotations from different things he has \nwritten, all the way from 1992 through 2008.\n  We wanted to hear more about some of these views, especially since \nthe CMS, or Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the Department \nof Health Care that he will head up, is in charge of administering the \nhealth care law we passed, a law that does--let me just mention four \nspecific things it does, with a budget, as I said, larger than the \nPentagon budget. I think he has something like $803 billion in benefits \nthis fiscal year that he has the opportunity to dole out. So there is a \ngreat deal of power.\n  First of all, we know the bill establishes a Medicare commission \nwhich is given the responsibility of finding sources of excess cost \ngrowth, meaning tests and treatments that are too expensive or whose \ncoverage would mean too much government spending on seniors. There is \nan opportunity for rationing.\n  The law will redistribute Medicare payments to physicians based on \nhow much they spend treating seniors.\n  That is a way they can adjust the payments and, therefore, determine \ncare.\n  Third, it will rely on recommendations from the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force--that is the entity that last year recommended \nagainst mammograms for women under the age of 50--in order to set \npreventive health care benefits, which is another form of rationing.\n  Finally, it will authorize the Federal Government to use comparative \neffectiveness research, or CER, when making Medicare determinations. \nRepublicans tried to get on a simple amendment to that to say: OK, you \ncan compare effectiveness research but not to deny coverage based on \ncost. Our attempts to get that amendment passed were defeated. Why? \nBecause they wanted to leave the flexibility in the law for the head of \nCMS, now Dr. Berwick, to ration care.\n  What is done in Great Britain is what he says is good policy. He \nsaid:\n\n       It's not a formula for comfort; it's a formula for \n     constructive discomfort.\n\n  He described in several other ways the fact that this would be \nsomething people would not like but they would get used to it and have \nto abide by it. He said:\n\n       The decision is not whether or not we will ration care; the \n     decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.\n\n  Indeed, at least his eyes will be open--the people who make the \ndecisions on whether we can get health care for our families and what \nit is. He will know what is happening, but will we know until it is too \nlate? We didn't even have a chance to ask Dr. Berwick questions about \nthis because he never was given a hearing. We weren't given that \nopportunity. Instead, the President waits until we are out of town over \nthe Fourth of July recess and recess-appoints the individual so that he \ndoesn't have to have a hearing or a Senate vote.\n  Here is another comment from Dr. Berwick:\n\n       I would place a commitment to excellence--standardization \n     to the best-known method--above clinician autonomy as a rule \n     for care.\n\n  That means the doctor gets to decide what happens to the patient, \nalong with the patient, as opposed to standardization of the best known \nmethod, with a bunch of bureaucrats figuring out in a cookie-cutter way \nwhat kind of treatment is less costly and therefore best for people who \nreceive government-paid health care. True, this is the way it is done \nin some other countries that he thinks are great in terms of their \nhealth care system. That is not the way it ought to be in the United \nStates. By this individual now receiving this nomination and this \nappointment, he now will be the person who helps to determine that \nstandardization rather than the clinician autonomy we have today.\n  Again, Dr. Berwick will head the agency in charge of implementing \nmuch of the new health care law. He will have the responsibility to \ndetermine what your health care coverage entails. He is the person whom \nthe President appointed to reduce the government's health care costs. I \ncan guarantee you how that reduction will occur: it will occur when \nthey decide that standardization requires that the government only \napprove the following kinds of treatment or drugs or services, and too \nbad if you expected something greater than that.\n  Given Dr. Berwick's philosophy, public comments, and writings about \nrationing, I think we have a pretty clear picture of where he will look \nto achieve those savings.\n  In 1996, he wrote a book entitled ``New Rules.'' He and his coauthor \nrecommended ``protocols, guidelines, and algorithms for care,'' with \nthe ``common underlying notion that someone knows or can discover the \nbest way to carry out a task to reach a decision, and that improvement \ncan come from standardizing processes and behaviors to conform to this \nideal model.''\n  This is extraordinarily distressing when we are learning every day of \ninnovative ways physicians and scientists have come up with to treat \ndiseases and chronic conditions and illnesses--with new kinds of drugs, \nwith other kinds of treatment, avoiding surgery in many cases, and now, \nimportantly, using genomic research. The TGEN Institute in Phoenix, AZ, \nfor example, is pioneering work involving the human genome so that \nultimately we can determine what is best for each individual person in \nterms of a treatment. You may have breast cancer, for example, but \nphysicians know all breast cancers are not the same and they are not \nall treated the same way. One woman can be treated with a particular \nform of radiation or chemotherapy or surgery, and yet for another \nperson who seemingly has the same cancer, that treatment doesn't seem \nto work. Through human genome research, they basically map out each \nperson's gene history, family history, and gene makeup in such a way as \nto know whether various kinds of treatment will be accepted or \ntolerated or successfully completed for each patient. They can tailor \nthe treatments or the drugs for each particular patient.\n  If you have standardization of processes and behaviors to conform to \nthis ``ideal model,'' to quote Dr. Berwick, you are going to get away \nfrom the kinds of treatments that could really be breathtakingly \ninnovative for the future and could save many lives and improve our \nquality of life for as long as we live. This is the future. The future \nisn't cookie-cutter medicine where the doctor has to do exactly what \nsome group of bureaucrats says because they performed a test someplace \nand that was the most efficient way to treat the particular patient.\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\n  Another couple of things.\n  Dr. Berwick expressed his disapproval for costly cutting-edge medical \ntechnologies and has said prevention services such as ``annual \nphysicals, screening tests, and other measures'' are ``over-demanded.'' \nOne of the things we did in the health care legislation was provide a \nlot of different incentives for preventive care, for screening, to try \nto help people avoid illnesses on the theory that it would be a lot \ncheaper if we didn't do a lot of treatment that was unnecessary. If you \ncould identify in advance that an individual had a need for some \ntreatment, maybe you could catch the disease, say, the cancer, early \nand not have the expensive treatment, the end-of-life kind of care that \nis frequently very expensive.\n  Let me close with a couple of things. The Wall Street Journal \neditorialized about Dr. Berwick's vision, saying this:\n\n       Such a command-and-control vision is widespread among \n     America's technocratic medical left, but it is also \n     increasingly anachronistic amid today's breakneck medical \n     progress. There isn't a single ``ideal model'' in a world of \n     treatments tailored to the genetic patterns of specific \n     cancers, or for the artificial pancreas for individual \n     diabetics, or other innovations that are increasingly common. \n     This is nonetheless where Dr. Berwick . . . will look for his \n     ``savings.''\n\n  As CMS Administrator, Dr. Berwick will not only oversee billions in \nFederal spending but will be responsible for programs that cover \nmillions of lives. It is perplexing, to say the least, that such an \nimportant position would bypass Senate consideration, without even so \nmuch as holding a hearing.\n  Moreover, this appointment is just the latest self-contradiction of \nan administration that claimed it would be the most transparent in \nhistory. We now have another example of the lack of transparency--the \nPresident recess-appointing someone, I believe, in order to avoid \nhaving a hearing and to avoid having a debate that would inform the \nAmerican people of the kind of person the President was putting into \nthis enormously important position.\n  Mr. President, I express the same concern Leader McConnell expressed. \nWe regret that the President has seen fit to do this. I understand he \ncan appoint anybody he wants, but what I really resent is turning \naround and having a spokesman for the President say that somehow or \nother the fact that he didn't have a hearing or the fact that he never \nwas voted on is somehow the Republicans' fault. We had nothing to do \nwith the fact that he didn't have a hearing. We asked for a hearing. We \nhad nothing to do with the fact that he never had a vote. We never \nobjected to any vote. There has never been a question of having a vote. \nNobody ever said, in the Finance Committee or on the Senate floor, \nlet's vote on Dr. Berwick. We had nothing to object to. The President \ncan make the appointment if he wants to. We can still debate his \nqualifications even though he will now serve in this position. But to \nblame Republicans for having to do it in this nontransparent way is \nwrong, and I think Republicans are going to continue to demonstrate to \nthe American people why this is a nominee who should have been aired \nout in public rather than appointed during the July 4 recess.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the appointment by \nPresident Obama of Dr. Donald Berwick as Administrator of the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  I disagree, respectfully, with my distinguished colleague from \nArizona. I guess I agree that it is regrettable that this was a recess \nappointment, but I believe that on the part of the President it was \nboth prudent and necessary to make this a recess appointment, given, A, \nthe urgency of moving forward with health care reform and, B, the \nrelentless blockade the Republicans have maintained.\n  Dr. Berwick is perhaps the most qualified person in the country to \nwield the vast apparatus of the Federal health care bureaucracy toward \nthe comprehensive change we need, to lower the cost of health care, \nwhile improving the quality of health care.\n  In evaluating this urgency, I ask my colleague to consider the \nsituation we are in right now. We are in the midst of an accelerating \nand unsustainable rise in health care expenditures in America. In \n1955--the year I was born--we spent a little bit over $12 billion a \nyear on health care. That was the annual health care expenditure in the \nUnited States in 1955--$12 billion. Last year, we spent more than $2.5 \ntrillion. The increase over the previous year was $134 billion--from \n2008 to 2009, an increase of $134 billion, which is the largest year-\nto-year increase in history, by the way, and 200 times what we spent in \n1955--200 times. Anybody who is looking at this can see both the trend \nand the increasing acceleration of this curve. It is accelerating, it \nis unsustainable, and it adds up to, at this point, a stunning 17.3 \npercent of our national domestic product, our GDP, spent on health care \nevery year. No other nation even comes close to spending that much of \nits annual domestic product on health care.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, had we done nothing on health care, \nby 2016 a family of four would have faced more than $26,000 in premiums \nfor family health insurance--$26,000 per year in 2016 average costs. \nLast year, premiums for Medicare Advantage plans jumped an average of \n14.2 percent nationally--just in 1 year. So there is a clearly \nunmistakable case that our health care costs are out of control and we \nhave to do something about it.\n  The escalation, as I pointed out, is unsustainable and accelerating, \nbut it is not inevitable. Indeed, experts from across the ideological \nspectrum agree that a great deal of health care cost is simply waste--\nwaste resulting from an irrational, disorganized status quo that too \noften encourages the wrong choices by patients, payers, and by \nproviders of health care services. That status quo has to change.\n  As you consider our health care system, set aside for a moment the \nproblem of duplicative tests, the problem of lost medical records, the \nproblem of unnecessary treatments, and the problem of uncoordinated \ncare for patients working between multiple doctors. Set aside all those \nproblems and look just at the administrative overhead of our private \ninsurance market.\n  By way of reference, administrative costs for Medicare run about 3 to \n5 percent. Overhead for private insurers is an astounding 20 to 27 \npercent. A Commonwealth Fund report indicates that the private insurer \nadministrative costs more than doubled from just 2000 to 2006. In those \n6 years, the overhead, the administrative costs of the private \ninsurance industry, more than doubled, up 109 percent. The McKinsey \nGlobal Institute estimates that Americans spend roughly $128 billion \nannually just on what the report called ``excess administrative \noverhead.'' There is $128 billion that we pay for every year in excess \nadministrative overhead--not health care but administrative overhead--\nin our health care system in the private health insurance market.\n  On top of that, you have the duplicative tests, lost medical records, \nunnecessary treatment, and the uncoordinated care for patients with \nmultiple and chronic conditions. I won't dwell on those particular \ntopics because I have spoken about them so often on the Senate floor in \nthe past. My point is that because of all this waste in the system, the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers concludes that it should be \npossible to cut total health expenditures about 30 percent. Let me \nrepeat that quote.\n\n       It should be possible to cut total health expenditures \n     about 30 percent without worsening outcomes . . . which would \n     suggest that savings on the order of 5 percent of GDP could \n     be feasible.\n\n  Five percent of GDP is over $700 billion a year, and other experts \nagree. The New England Healthcare Institute reports as much as $850 \nbillion a year in excess cost ``can be eliminated without reducing the \nquality of care.'' Former Bush administration Treasury Secretary \nO'Neill has written that the excess cost is $1 trillion a year in our \nhealth care system. The Lewin Group, which is often cited in this \nChamber on both sides of the aisle as a respectable organization that \ndoes authoritative work in this area, finds that we burn over $1 \ntrillion a year through excess cost and waste.\n  So is it $700 billion a year in excess cost and waste, is it $850 \nbillion a year, is it $1 trillion or over a year in excess cost and \nwaste? Whatever it is, it is a big number, and we needed to do \nsomething about it. This Congress rose to the challenge in the health \ncare reform\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\nbill and passed what health economist David Cutler has called ``the \nmost significant action on medical spending ever proposed in the United \nStates.''\n  This isn't just a partisan view. Analysts of all stripes agree the \nreform law does more than any previous measure to begin to lift the \ndead weight of all this wasteful health care cost off our economy. The \nCommonwealth Fund has projected that the law will reduce the annual \ngrowth of national health expenditures--that is the amount that private \nand public sectors would otherwise spend on health care every year--by \n0.6 percentage points annually and nearly $600 billion over the next 10 \nyears. The Council of Economic Advisers writes that ``total slowing of \nprivate-sector cost growth'' will be approximately 1 percentage point \nper year--more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. That is just \nwhat they can prognosticate, what they can anticipate, what they can \nproject.\n  Here is something that is interesting. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman \nwrites:\n\n       There are many cost-saving efforts in the proposed reform, \n     but nobody knows how well any one of these efforts will work. \n     And as a result, official estimates don't give the plan much \n     credit for any of them. Realistically, health reform is \n     likely to do much better at controlling costs than any of the \n     official projections suggest.\n\n  Health reform is likely to do much better at controlling costs than \nany of the official projections suggest.\n  He is not alone. Other respected health economists--Len Nichols of \nGeorge Mason, Ken Thorpe of Emory, and Alan Garber of Stanford, \ndescribed the bill's cost controls as vital, a significant improvement \non the status quo. And MIT Professor Jonathan Gruber, one of our \nleading health economists, said of the bill's cost control measures:\n\n       I can't think of a thing to try that they didn't try. They \n     really make the best effort anyone has ever made. Everything \n     is in here. You couldn't have done better than they are \n     doing.\n\n  So that frames the picture for the appointment of Dr. Berwick because \nthe President's signature of our health care law was just the beginning \nof the reform project that lies ahead. This law gives those \nunprecedented tools to fight health care waste and inefficiency, but \nthose tools are meaningless, they are useless unless they are applied \nboth vigorously and wisely. Don Berwick is simply, hands down, the best \nperson to do that. He has vast experience, proven expertise, and he has \nearned the respect of colleagues in the public and private sectors and \non all sides of the ideological spectrum.\n  For instance, Dr. Nancy Nielsen, immediate past president of the \nAmerican Medical Association, said Dr. Berwick is ``widely known and \nwell-respected for his visionary leadership efforts that focus on \noptimizing the quality and safety of patient care in hospitals and \nacross health care settings.''\n  Gail Wilensky, the Administrator of CMS under President George H.W. \nBush, said Dr. Berwick ``has long-standing recognition for expertise \nand for not being a partisan individual, so I think that will assist \nhim in his dealings with Congress, both with the majority and hopefully \nthe minority, as well.''\n  Tom Scully, George W. Bush's CMS chief said:\n\n       You're not going to do any better than Don Berwick.\n\n  And Steven D. Findlay, health policy analyst at Consumers Union, has \napplauded what he calls ``a spectacular appointment.''\n\n       Don has been an intellectual force in health care for \n     decades. He helped forge many ideas incorporated in the new \n     health care law.\n\n  So given this chorus of praise from across the ideological spectrum \nand the urgency of the task at hand to control those costs, one might \nthink that bipartisan support for Dr. Berwick's nomination would be \nstrong and swift.\n  Well, you heard the Senator from Arizona. Unfortunately, my \nRepublican colleagues, regrettably, threaten the familiar old \nWashington playbook of delay and obstruction.\n  I have spoken many times about how the Republican minority has \ndelayed without substantive justification far too many of the \nPresident's executive branch nominees, jamming up the administration's \nability to administer the government; usually not because they have any \nobjection to the nominee but just to jam up the administration's \nability to administer the government.\n  On our Executive Calendar right here we have the names of everybody \nwho is waiting on the Senate floor languishing, waiting for a vote. \nThat doesn't even count all the names that are stuck in committees. \nThese are the people on the Senate floor waiting for a vote. Some have \nbeen on for months. Some of them have cleared committee unanimously \nwith full Republican support in the committee. Yet they are jammed up \nhere. That is the quagmire into which they were going to stick Dr. \nBerwick, notwithstanding the urgency of the need.\n  Since his nomination was first announced, the Republicans made clear \nthey would subject Dr. Berwick to this treatment. There is no doubt \nabout that. It was confirmed just now by the Senator from Arizona. A \nrecess appointment was the only way for the President to ensure that \nCMS is fully equipped to handle the vital and voluminous and immediate \ntasks that we have asked CMS to perform.\n  So why do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle clamor in \nopposition to Dr. Berwick, the foremost expert in the field of reducing \ncost by improving quality of care? There are innumerable ways to reduce \nhealth care costs by improving quality. Reducing and eliminating \nhospital-acquired infections is a perfect example. The North Carolina \nMedicaid effort to provide coordinated care of a medical home for \npeople who are high users of the health care system is another example.\n  My Republican colleagues, who so loudly championed cost control, now \nclaim this reducing cost by improving quality is rationing--rationing. \nWell, here is my question: Whose side are they on? One trillion dollars \na year in waste, and they are lining up to defend the waste and call \nefforts to restrain it rationing? Protecting you and your family from \nexpensive and dangerous hospital-acquired infections, that is \nrationing? Organizing complex care of people who have multiple \ndiagnoses and chronic conditions into coordinated medical homes, \nrationing? Whose side are they on when they attack the reforms, the \nquality improvement, cost-reducing reforms that are Dr. Berwick's \nsignature expertise?\n  One Senator even stood in this Chamber and said Dr. Berwick endorsed \nan end-of-life pathway to death. Oh boy, looks like the death panels \nare back. Dr. Berwick is not just a pioneer in health care quality \nimprovement, he is the pioneer. He was a lead author of the Institute \nof Medicine's watershed report, ``To Err Is Human,'' and the follow-on \nreport, ``Crossing the Quality Chasm.'' ``To Err Is Human'' launched \nthe quality movement in this country. That report exposed the \nbreathtaking fact that 100,000 Americans die needlessly in this country \nevery year from medical errors--100,000 Americans dead every year in \nthis country because of needless medical errors. Is getting rid of the \nerrors that killed those 100,000 Americans rationing? Don Berwick has \ndevoted his life to saving those lives. Whose side are my colleagues on \nwhen they oppose Dr. Berwick?\n\n  The connection between quality improvement and cost savings which Don \nBerwick has spent his career exploring is demonstrated by global \nmaternal mortality figures. Maternal mortality is a cold and \nstatistical way of saying moms who die in childbirth. We in the United \nStates are 39th in the world. Thirty-eight countries, including most of \nEurope, do a better job of keeping moms alive through childbirth. We \nwould be willing to spend money to get better at that, I would bet. But \nthe strange thing is the many medical errors and the process failures \nthat cause those deaths--and that cause us to be 39th in the world at \nmaternal mortality--also cause a lot of other complications which cost \nlots of money to treat and recover from. So if you make those quality \nimprovements, you save money. That is the win-win connection between \ncost saving and quality reform.\n  That is the area where Don Berwick specializes and has specialized \nfor years--improving care, eliminating process failures, and saving \ncost. But my Republican colleagues are standing against him and want to \ntalk about rationing. When it improves care, when it lowers maternal \nmortality, that is the kind of reform I think we could use. If\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\nyou are against that, and if you are against Dr. Berwick, whose side \nare you on?\n  Dr. Berwick founded the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, one of \nthe first organizations to promote systematic and sustainable health \ncare quality improvement. He has worked on quality initiatives as a \nboard member of the American Hospital Association, as chair of the \nAdvisory Council for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, \nand as a member of President Clinton's Advisory Commission on Consumer \nProtection and Quality. That is his work.\n  That is probably why Tom Scully, CMS Administrator under President \nGeorge W. Bush, said:\n\n       You are not going to do any better than Don Berwick.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues: Do we really need to raise the phony \nscarecrows of rationing, of death panels, of socialized medicine?\n  Do we really need to go there against $1 trillion in waste and \ninefficiency every year? Do you really want reform efforts to fail \nagainst 100,000 American lives lost every year due to avoidable medical \nerrors?\n  Do you really want reform efforts to fail against eliminating \nhospital-acquired infections and providing better coordinated care for \npatients who have multiple doctors and multiple conditions? Do you \nreally want the reform effort to fail? Is this how far we have fallen?\n  There is a huge window where we could work together on a win-win \npath, where we could improve the quality of health care for Americans \nwhile reducing its cost by coordinating the care better, by \ncoordinating electronic health records better, by avoiding hospital-\nacquired infections, by avoiding unnecessary care, by making sure \ndoctors know what the best evidence is for treatment as they have to \ntake on patients with multiple difficulties and symptoms. We could do \nthis together. This is a win-win, and Dr. Berwick is an expert with \nbipartisan public/private--or Republican and Democratic support and \nrecognition of his particular expertise in this area. I urge my \ncolleagues to treat Dr. Berwick as the highly qualified individual he \nis, not as an opportunity for political grandstanding--we do enough of \nthat around here--not as a way to wish failure on America in this vital \ntask that lies before us. At long last, my friends and colleagues, are \nwe not better than that?\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5728-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5728-S5729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A SECOND OPINION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, having just \nreturned from spending a wonderful week over the Fourth of July in \nWyoming, visiting with people across the Cowboy State at senior \ncenters, Kiwanis clubs, Rotary clubs, and repeatedly the issue came up \nof this appointment of Dr. Berwick to head Medicare and Medicaid.\n  My colleague who just left the floor talked about the playbook of \ndelay and obstruction. I will tell you that this recess appointment and \nthe overall appointment of Donald Berwick is absolutely a page out of \nthe playbook of the U.S. President of delay and obstruction.\n  Last year I came to this floor and said we should have somebody in \ncharge of Medicare and Medicaid. When this body is talking about \ncutting $500 billion from our seniors on Medicare, not to save Medicare \nbut to start a whole new government program, there ought to be somebody \nin charge of Medicare in this country who can answer the questions \nabout what are the impacts going to be. But the President of the United \nStates refused to name anyone.\n  At a time when this body was debating how to handle 16 million more \nAmericans jammed and crammed into Medicaid, a program where half the \ndoctors in the country will not see those patients, it is like giving \nsomebody a bus ticket when a bus isn't coming. Those people may have \ncoverage but they are not able to get care. There should have been \nsomebody in charge of Medicaid. I came to this floor and said: Mr. \nPresident, it is time to make someone take over the responsibilities, \nto be in charge of Medicare and Medicaid so they can come and explain \nto this Senate and this country what the impacts are going to be of the \ncuts in Medicare and the cramming of more and more people into \nMedicaid. But the President of the United States refused.\n  The playbook of delay and obstruction belongs to this administration. \nThe playbook of delay and obstruction is what led us here today, to a \nsituation where no one was even named to be in charge of Medicare and \nMedicaid for the United States until after an extremely unpopular and \nunwise health care bill was signed by the President of the United \nStates. Then and only then did the President of the United States \ndecide who he would want to put in charge of Medicare and Medicaid. To \nme, this is an insult to the American people, an insult that the \nAmerican people would never ever have an opportunity of having open \ncongressional hearings to have explained to them the positions of this \nman nominated to head Medicare and Medicaid for this country.\n  I think the President of the United States has made a mockery of his \npledge to be accountable as an administration, to be transparent as an \nadministration. That is what I heard at senior centers in Rock Springs, \nWY, and in Riverton, WY, at a Kiwanis club, people there as well as at \na meeting in Powell, WY, at the Rotary club. People all across Wyoming \nand all across the country are very concerned, saying how is this going \nto affect me personally. Seniors know if you take $500 billion away \nfrom their Medicare, not to help seniors, not to help Medicare, but to \nstart a whole new government program--they are very interested how that \nis going to work because that affects each and every one of them \npersonally.\n  I heard my colleague from Rhode Island talk about coordinated care. I \nam with him. We need to coordinate care. That is why I was surprised to \nsee Members of the Democratic side of this Senate vote to kill the \nprogram of Medicare Advantage for 10 million Americans. These are \nindividuals who signed up for Medicare Advantage because there is an \nadvantage. It actually helps with preventive medicine and it helps with \ncoordinated care. That is going away. Yet the President of the United \nStates did not have anybody in charge of Medicare or Medicaid to \nexplain what would be the impact of getting rid of Medicare Advantage \non those 10 million people who need coordinated care and needed \npreventive medicine.\n  When I hear my colleague from Rhode Island say if you are against Dr. \nBerwick, then whose side are you on, I would say I am on the side of \nthe people of Wyoming, the seniors of this country, the people who are \nseeing $500 billion of Medicare cut from them to start a whole new \ngovernment program. They realize it is not going to help them. That is \nwhy at town meetings and visits around the State of Wyoming people \nbelieve ultimately they are going to end up paying more for their care \nand are going to have less care available to them because of this very \nunpopular health care law. That is why, week after week, I come to the \nSenate floor to talk as a practicing physician, someone who has taken \ncare of patients for 25 years around the State of Wyoming, to give a \ndoctor's second opinion, to talk about what I see, as a physician, with \nthis health care law that ultimately I believe is going to be bad for \npatients, bad for payers--the people across this country who are going \nto pay the bill for this--and bad for providers, the nurses and doctors \nwho take care of the patients.\n  Here we now have appointed, without a hearing, without a debate, \nwithout this Senate having had a chance to vote, a Director of Medicare \nand Medicaid who has expressed many opinions that do fly in the face of \nand are way out of line with the opinions of the American people. So it \nis not a surprise you see headlines in places such as the New York \nTimes that say ``Tough Confirmation Battle Looming For Medicare \nNominee.'' That is in the New York Times.\n  The Boston Globe, the hometown paper where the nominee has been known \nto practice, ``Dangerous To Your Health,'' of Dr. Berwick.\n  What is this administration trying to hide? Why is this \nadministration unwilling to have hearings? Why is the administration \nnot allowing Dr. Berwick to come to Congress to explain to\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\nthe American people his opinions and his views? All we know is what we \nhave read, what we have seen from his speeches, the things he has \nwritten. Likely, it is because if those things were heard by the \nAmerican people this man may absolutely be unconfirmable.\n  If that is what the President wants, that is what the President got. \nBecause right now I will tell you the President of the United States \nhas his own health care rationing czar.\n  You say how can you imagine that sort of thing? Let's look at some of \nthese quotes from Dr. Berwick.\n\n       The decision is not whether or not we will ration care--the \n     decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.\n\n  This is not some long-ago quote. This is last year:\n\n       The decision is not whether or not we will ration care--the \n     decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.\n\n  This is what he says about the British health care system. He says:\n\n       I fell in love with the [national health system] . . . to \n     an American observer, the [National Health Service] is such a \n     seductress.\n\n  Who talks like that? He said:\n\n       The [National Health Service] is not just a national \n     treasure, it is a global treasure. As unabashed fans, we urge \n     a dialogue on possible forms of stabilization to better \n     provide NHS with the time, space, and constancy of purpose to \n     realize its enormous promise.\n\n  I will tell you as a practicing physician that the rates of cancer \nsurvival in the United States are much higher than in Britain. It is \nnot that our doctors are better, it is that people get care sooner--\nearly detection, prevention, early treatment. Those are the keys to \ncancer survivability. So what we know is that it is not that the \ndoctors in the United States are better than those in England, it is \nthat the patients in the United States get care where they do not in \nEngland. But, then again, Dr. Berwick loves the British health care \nsystem. He actually says:\n\n       I am romantic about the National Health Service; I love it.\n\n  That is what we have. We have a recess appointee who also went on to \nhave some ideas about wealth in the United States. He said:\n\n       Any health care funding plan that is just, equitable, \n     civilized and humane must redistribute wealth from the richer \n     among us to the poorer and less fortunate.\n\n  Here we have a recess appointee who will make decisions for hundreds \nand hundreds of billions of dollars, that impact the lives of the \nAmerican people, without ever having a Senate debate, without ever \nhaving a Senate hearing, without us ever having one word of testimony \nbecause the President of the United States believes that he knows \nbetter than the people of this country.\n  Dr. Berwick coauthored a book. He talked about one of the primary \nfunctions of health regulation is to ``constrain decentralized \nindividual decisionmaking.'' Let me say that again: ``Constrain \ndecentralized individual decisionmaking.'' Individuals? Humans? People \naround the communities. People in our home States. He says we want to \nconstrain local people making local decisions. And he says to weigh \npublic welfare against the choices of private consumers. For a \nconsumer, what is more important to them than their health?\n  This is not a one-party-only situation. Even Max Baucus, Senate \nFinance chairman, issued a statement critical of this end-around \ndecisionmaking by the President.\n  It is interesting how things change. When Barack Obama was a Member \nof the U.S. Senate, as he was not that long ago, the President at the \ntime, George W. Bush, made a recess appointment. This is what \nPresident, then Senator Obama, had to say of John Bolton. He said, \n``He's damaged goods.'' He said, ``He'll have less credibility.''\n  Don Berwick is damaged goods. He will have less credibility. I am not \ntalking about that with a couple of Senators, I am talking about it \nfrom the standpoint of the American people. The American people know \nand understand that the President of the United States is trying to \nhide something. That is why there has not been an open hearing. The \nRepublicans have been asking for an open hearing. The Republicans have \nbeen asking for a number of weeks for an open hearing. I have been \nasking that the President name somebody to this position since last \nyear but, no, in the playbook of delay and obstruction, the \nadministration has decided not to do that--don't name anybody until \nwell after the bill is signed into law and then don't allow that person \nto come to the Senate for a confirmation hearing.\n  What are they trying to hide from the American people? That is where \nwe are today. We are in a situation where the President of the United \nStates has made an appointment, a recess appointment without hearings, \nwithout the American people knowing or being able to ask the questions. \nWhat exactly are you going to do here, Dr. Berwick, when you cut $500 \nbillion from our seniors on Medicare? What is that impact going to be \non their lives when you cut money from hospice, when you cut money from \nnursing homes, when you cut from physical therapy, when you cut from \nrehab, when you cut money from hospitals, when you cut money from \nphysicians? We have more and more people becoming Medicare age every \nyear. Why is the President of the United States unwilling to have that \nindividual come to the Senate and explain to the American people how it \nis going to work? The people have a right to know.\n  That is why I am not surprised and was not surprised this past week \nin Wyoming--in Riverton, in Rock Springs, in Powell, as I traveled \naround the State--to have people coming up to me saying: What is going \nto happen to my Medicare, now that the President has made this recess \nappointment over the Fourth of July, when the Members of Congress are \nnot in Washington but are at home, visiting with the folks in their \ndistricts?\n  What is this going to mean for my health care or, as many others say, \nwhat does this mean for my mom or my dad? Those are questions that are \nnot going to be answered because the President of the United States has \ndecided to make a recess appointment at a time the American people have \nthe right to expect and deserve to know from a President who has \ncampaigned and promised, promised the American people, transparency and \nopenness and accountability, and now the American people realize they \nhave received none of those things.\n  So, again, as a physician I come to the Senate floor. I spent all day \nFriday at a Wyoming Medical Center visiting with people in Casper. \nSenators around the country went home and talked to people, in fact, \nmany back to where they worked. I went back to where I worked at the \nhospital, visited with doctors and nurses and patients as well. All are \nconcerned, concerned about this health care law that they believe is \ngoing to raise the cost of their health care, lower the quality; \nconcerned about a health care law that they believe is going to be bad \nfor them as patients, bad for the taxpayer because the costs are going \nto go up; bad for the providers, the nurses and doctors who take care \nof them; bad for the American people.\n  That is why so many of them, still today, believe this health care \nbill should be repealed and replaced with things that put patients in \ncharge, not insurance company bureaucracies, not Washington, DC \nbureaucrats; that would put patients in charge. That is what we need in \nthis country. That is the kind of health care the American people need. \nThat is what they are asking for. And when my colleague says: If you \nare against Dr. Berwick, then whose side are you on? I am on the side \nof the people I have taken care of all around the State of Wyoming for \nthe last 25 years.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5729-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5729-S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KAGAN NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is returning to Washington \nafter the Fourth of July holiday recess. The\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nweek before we left town, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, we held a \nhearing for President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan. The \nhearing lasted 4 days. The nominee responded to 695 questions. I wish \nto commend, in particular, the chairman of that committee, Senator \nPatrick Leahy, and the ranking member, Senator Jeff Sessions of \nAlabama. It was a fair and respectful hearing.\n  Last year President Obama made history with his nomination of Sonia \nSotomayor as the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court. Elena \nKagan is also an historic nominee. Last year she became our Nation's \nfirst female Solicitor General. That, of course, is the attorney \nrepresenting the United States of America before the highest Court in \nour land, the Supreme Court.\n  If she is confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court, it would make the \nfirst time in our Nation's history that three women have served \ntogether on the highest court in the land. That is clearly a mark of \nsocial progress in this great Nation.\n  Elena Kagan, of course, will be replacing a legal legend, Justice \nJohn Paul Stevens. A lifetime in the law and the courage to speak his \nmind made Justice Stevens a national treasure. So what did we learn \nfrom this hearing on Elena Kagan? First, we learned she is a highly \nintelligent, very charming and very funny, at times, individual.\n  She demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the law, an ability to try \nand find common ground on difficult issues, and, as I mentioned, a very \nhealthy sense of humor. These are qualities that served her well as \nSolicitor General of the United States, as the first woman to serve as \nDean of the Harvard Law School, as a law school professor, and as a \npolicy aide to former President William Clinton. They are valuable \nqualities that will serve her well on the Supreme Court.\n  Secondly, we learned that Elena Kagan has great respect for \nCongressional action and judicial precedent. In her opening statement \nshe said:\n\n       The Supreme Court is a wondrous institution. But the time I \n     spent in the other branches of government remind me that it \n     must also be a modest one, properly deferential to the \n     decisions of the American people and their elected \n     representatives.\n\n  In response to a question from Senator Dianne Feinstein of \nCalifornia, General Kagan said:\n\n       The operating presumption of our legal system is that a \n     judge respects precedent, and I think that that's an \n     enormously important principle of the legal system.\n\n  These qualities, a respect for precedent and deference to Congress, \nare essential for a Supreme Court Justice to have but, unfortunately, \nthey have been in short supply with our current Court. In case after \ncase in recent years, the Supreme Court has overturned longstanding \nprecedents and thumbed its nose at congressional decisions.\n  In many of these cases, the five conservative Justices on the Court \nhave acted not as neutral umpires, as one described himself, but as \ndesignated hitters going to bat, unfortunately, for some of the special \ninterests in America.\n  Let's take a couple of examples: The case of Citizens United versus \nthe Federal Elections Commission, which was handed down by the Supreme \nCourt earlier this year. In that case, a conservative 5-4 majority of \nthe Court demanded to hear arguments on an issue that was not even \nraised by the parties in the case.\n  They reversed decades of Supreme Court decisions that preceded them. \nThey ignored the will of Congress in passing the historic bipartisan \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance law, and they ruled that corporations \nand special interest groups could spend unlimited amounts of money to \naffect elections.\n  This decision by the Supreme Court, unfortunately, has the power to \ndrown out the voices of average Americans in our elections. Justice \nStevens, now retiring, whose vacancy we are seeking to fill, wrote \nthese powerful words in the dissent:\n\n       Essentially, five judges were unhappy with the limited \n     nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to \n     give themselves an opportunity to change the law.\n\n  Then there was the case of Lilly Ledbetter, who testified at the \nKagan hearing about her experience working as a manager at the Goodyear \ntire plant in Gadsden, AL. Lilly Ledbetter worked there for 19 years \nbut she did not know during that entire period of time she was being \npaid less than her male colleagues who did exactly the same job. It was \nnot until she was close to retirement that somebody finally told her \nhow much the men working alongside of her, doing exactly the same work, \nwere being paid. So as a result of that knowledge, she decided to bring \na case to ask for compensation, for this clear case of gender \ndiscrimination, where a woman was being paid less just because she was \na woman.\n  The Supreme Court came down with an amazing decision in the Lilly \nLedbetter case. Even though she had won her case before a jury, she \nwent before the Supreme Court and this familiar five-Justice group of \nconservative Justices said she should have filed the case alleging \ndiscrimination in pay within 180 days after the initial act of \ndiscrimination; in other words, within 6 months after the first male \ncolleague was paid more than she was paid, she should have filed a case \nfor discrimination.\n  You would think the Supreme Court Justices would at least understand \nthat in most American workplaces, a worker does not know what his \ncoworkers are being paid. It is not published, certainly is not \npublished when it comes to managers' salaries. It is rare that anybody \ncomes to know that.\n  So Lilly Ledbetter, a victim of discrimination for years, did not \nknow the man working right next to her, doing the same job, is being \npaid more. The Supreme Court said: Oh, that was a fatal flaw. The \ntechnical fact that she waited more than 6 months to file her \ndiscrimination case meant she was not entitled to recover.\n  By making that decision, the Supreme Court, which was guided by the \nprinciple of avoiding judicial activism and avoiding doing things on \ntheir own that violated precedent and congressional acts, decided to \noverturn judicial precedents and the express intent of Congress when it \npassed the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n  We also heard at the Kagan hearing from Jack Gross. He was another \nvictim of discrimination who helped put a human face on the \nconservative judicial activism on the current Supreme Court. Mr. Gross \nis not one of these wild-eyed liberals. He was a claims adjuster for an \ninsurance company in southern Iowa for over 23 years. I know the \ncompany well. A pretty conservative lot runs that company.\n  When he and all of the other supervisors at his company over the age \nof 50 were demoted and replaced with younger workers, would that raise \na question in your mind if you had been Mr. Gross, that perhaps your \nage had something to do with it? Like Ms. Ledbetter, Mr. Gross, who had \nbeen a loyal employee of this company for over 20 years, won a jury \nverdict, a jury verdict which said, yes, that company made a decision \nto discriminate against Jack Gross because of his age.\n  He ended up having that jury decision tossed out of Court at the \nSupreme Court right across the street. It is worth noting that very few \ndiscrimination victims win a jury verdict. Jack Gross did. Most victims \nhave their cases dismissed or settled long before it reaches that \npoint. But in the case of Jack Gross, the Supreme Court decided to \ninvent a new legal standard that stacks the deck against victims of \ndiscrimination even more.\n  Here is what Justice Stevens wrote in the dissent to that case:\n\n       The majority's inattention to prudential Court practices is \n     matched by its utter disregard of our precedent and Congress' \n     intent.\n\n  I think Elena Kagan's hearing demonstrates she will be a Justice who, \nlike the Justice she will replace, John Paul Stevens, will give proper \ndeference to Congress and respect to decisions of the Court.\n  There was a third lesson from the Kagan hearing. I found this \nsurprising. It was opening day. Here were Members of the Senate serving \non the Judiciary Committee who were stating what they hoped to see in a \nSupreme Court Justice. Many of them singled out a man whom I consider \nto be one of the real champions of justice and liberty who served on \nthe Court. Some of my colleagues across the aisle seemed to have \nforgotten in their opening statements the amazing legacy of Supreme \nCourt Justice Thurgood Marshall, a Justice for whom Elena Kagan had \nclerked.\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nThey truly went to a level that was close to guilt by association in \nattacking Elena Kagan because she had worked for Justice Marshall.\n  One of my Republican colleagues called Justice Marshall ``the epitome \nof a results-oriented judge'' and ``not what I would consider to be \nmainstream'' and someone who believed that ``the Supreme Court exists \nto advance the agenda of certain classes of litigants.''\n  Another Republican Senator called Thurgood Marshall a ``judicial \nactivist.'' I thought those characterizations were beyond the pale and \nsaid so in my opening statement. Thurgood Marshall is an American hero. \nThe airport in Baltimore is named after him and many schools. He \ndedicated his life to breaking down barriers of racial discrimination \nthat had haunted our country for centuries. Thurgood Marshall was the \nattorney who stood right across the street before the Supreme Court and \nargued the case of Brown v. Board of Education. That case, 56 years \nago, did more to change America and move us toward equality than any \nmodern decision by the Court.\n  Thurgood Marshall won more victories in the Supreme Court than nearly \nanyone else in the history of the United States. As an appeals court \njudge, Thurgood Marshall wrote 112 opinions, none of which were \noverturned by a higher court. Some may dismiss Justice Marshall's \npioneering work on civil rights as an example of empathy, a word which, \nunfortunately, has been given a negative connotation by some in this \nChamber. They may suggest that somehow, as a Black man who had been a \nvictim of discrimination himself, he had more passion when it came to \ncertain issues. I say to that, thank goodness.\n  I don't consider Brown v. Board of Education to be results-oriented \njudging. I consider it a courageous judgment that embraced our common \nhumanity and moved America dramatically forward. We should be grateful \nas a nation for the tenacity, integrity, and values of Thurgood \nMarshall.\n  In the words of John Payne, director-general of the NAACP Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund:\n\n       Thurgood Marshall helped America understand what democracy \n     really means.\n\n  Some of Elena Kagan's critics suggest she will have the same views \nand philosophy as Justice Marshall because she served as his law clerk. \nIn my personal opinion, we should be so fortunate. General Kagan made \nit clear at her hearing that she was determined to be her own person, \nnot to assume the persona of someone for whom she has worked in the \npast. Moreover, it is wrong to suggest that a Supreme Court law clerk \nis going to have the same views as the Justice for whom he or she \nclerked.\n  Exhibit A is Douglas Ginsburg. He sits on the D.C. Circuit and is one \nof the most conservative judges in America. Judge Ginsburg was \nnominated to the Supreme Court by President Reagan in 1987, after \nRobert Bork's nomination was defeated. Judge Ginsburg later withdrew \nhis nomination, but I think it is safe to say he does not share the \njudicial philosophy of Justice Thurgood Marshall whom he also served as \na law clerk.\n  A fourth lesson from the Kagan hearing is, if you don't have a good \ncase against the nominee on the merits, then pick an emotional issue \nand appeal on that ground. That is how some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle handled the issue of military recruitment at \nthe Harvard Law School when General Kagan was the law school dean. One \nof my Republican colleagues accused General Kagan of having ``a \nhostility to the military'' and alleged she broke the law in briefly \ndenying military access to the career services office. These \naccusations are not correct. Dean Kagan bent over backwards to show \nrespect and appreciation for the U.S. military and to comply with the \n1996 Solomon amendment that required the Defense Department to deny \nFederal funding to universities that prohibited military recruitment on \ncampus. Yes, Dean Kagan was a vocal opponent of the don't ask-don't \ntell policy. Most Members of Congress and a sizable majority of \nAmericans no longer support that discriminatory policy. But that does \nnot make Elena Kagan antimilitary.\n  Don't take my word for it. Listen to the words of Robert Merrill, the \nonly Active-Duty servicemember to receive a law degree from Harvard \nwhile Elena Kagan was dean. Here is what he wrote in the Washington \nPost:\n\n       If Elena Kagan is ``anti-military,'' she certainly didn't \n     show it. She treated the veterans at Harvard like VIPs, and \n     she was a fervent advocate of our veterans association. She \n     was decidedly against ``don't ask, don't tell,'' but that \n     never affected her treatment of those who had served. . . . \n     If anything, Kagan was an activist in ensuring that military \n     recruiters had viable access to students and facilities \n     despite the official ban. A Boston-area recruiter later told \n     me that the biggest hurdle he faced recruiting at Harvard Law \n     was trying to answer the students' strangely intellectual \n     questions.\n\n  During her 6 years as dean at Harvard, the military had full access \nto career services offices except for one semester after an appellate \ncourt struck down the Solomon amendment as unconstitutional. After that \ncourt decision, Dean Kagan decided to reinstate a system that had been \nin place nearly a quarter of a century prior to her becoming dean and \nthat had been deemed to be in compliance with the law. Under that \nsystem, military recruiters were given access to students and the \ncampus through the Harvard student veterans association.\n  During the year of Dean Kagan's deanship, when access to the Office \nof Career Services was briefly denied, more graduating students at \nHarvard joined the military than any year of the past decade.\n  When my Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee realized \nthey weren't getting much traction at the Kagan hearing with their \narguments about Harvard military recruiting, they brought out another \ntheme. They said General Kagan is just too political to be a Supreme \nCourt Justice because she spent 4 years working in the Clinton White \nHouse.\n  Considering that Elena Kagan's legal career spans nearly 25 years, \nthis 4-year argument seems a little bit hollow and stretched. In any \nevent, all three of President Bush's Supreme Court nominees--John \nRoberts, Samuel Alito, and Harriet Miers--had worked in political \npositions in the White House and Justice Department under Republican \nPresidents. I can't recall a single time a Republican Senator said that \nPresident Bush's nominees were too political.\n  Chief Justice Roberts worked in the Reagan White House for 4 years \nand as a political appointee in the Justice Department for 5 years. \nJustice Alito spent 9 years working in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush \nJustice Departments. Harriet Miers held a series of positions under \nPresident George W. Bush--for 5 years in the Bush White House and 6 \nyears when the President had been Governor of Texas. There was not a \nsingle word raised on the Republican side of the aisle about how \npolitical those Republican nominees were. Now they are trying to raise \nan argument against Elena Kagan that they didn't see in previous \nnominees.\n  I hope my colleagues will heed the advice of a man they extol when we \ndiscuss judicial nominations: President Bush's former judicial nominee, \nMiguel Estrada. Mr. Estrada wrote a letter on behalf of Elena Kagan, \none of his fellow classmates at Harvard Law School. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       I write in support of Elena Kagan's confirmation as an \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. \n     . . . Elena possesses a formidable intellect, an exemplary \n     temperament and a rare ability to disagree without being \n     disagreeable. She is calm under fire and mature and \n     deliberate in her judgments. . . . Elena Kagan is an \n     impeccably qualified nominee. Like Louis Brandeis, Felix \n     Frankfurter, Robert Jackson, Byron White, Lewis Powell and \n     William Rehnquist--none of whom arrived at the Court with \n     prior judicial service--she could become one of our great \n     Justices.\n\n  That was Miguel Estrada, a person whose virtues have been praised at \ngreat length by Republicans in the Senate. We also received a joint \nletter of support for Elena Kagan from the last eight Solicitor \nGenerals of the United States, including such conservative icons as \nKenneth Starr, Ted Olson, and Charles Fried.\n  In our service to the Senate, we are called on to cast hundreds if \nnot thousands of votes. Our late departed colleague, Robert C. Byrd, \ncast 18,000 votes. As I look back on my career of service in the House \nand the Senate, I can remember a few votes. I certainly remember every \nsingle vote I cast when I was asked to decide whether America should go \nto war. Those are the votes\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nthat keep one up at night wondering what is the right thing to do for \nthe Nation; what is the right thing to do for one's own conscience. We \nknow at the end of the day when we cast that vote, if we go forward \npeople will die. We hope the enemy will be the victims, but we know \neven under the best of circumstances, innocent Americans will also die. \nThose votes we think over for a long time.\n  In the Senate, next to votes on war, votes on Supreme Court Justices \nreach that same level of gravity and importance. We realize that man or \nwoman we choose to be on the Court is likely to be there after our \nSenate careers and after we are long forgotten; that those nine people \nsitting across the street, when five come together, can make decisions \nthat can impact America for generations to come. That is why it is so \ncritically important for us to take a careful review and to take a \ndeliberate approach when it comes to the selection of a Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  When the time comes--and I hope it comes soon, maybe within the next \nweek or two--I will be proud to cast a vote in favor of the nomination \nof Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. I sincerely hope she receives the \nbipartisan support she richly deserves.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman).

The deputy leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, under the pending \nnomination, to speak under the time allocated to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is going to vote \ntoday on the nomination of Sharon Coleman to be U.S. District Judge for \nthe Northern District of Illinois. We currently have at least five \nvacancies. She is an amazing, accomplished jurist who will fill one of \nthose vacancies with distinction, I am sure. She has devoted her entire \nlegal career to government service.\n  She was elected to be Cook County trial court judge in 1996, a \ncampaign where I first met her and her great family. She won retention \nelection in 2002. As a trial judge, she presided over 600 cases that \nwent to verdict.\n  In 2008, she received promotion. She was elected to the prestigious \nIllinois Appellate Court. She has a reputation for fairness and \nimpartiality and for having an outstanding judicial temperament.\n  Not surprisingly, all members of the American Bar Association \nevaluation committee gave Justice Coleman the highest possible rating \nof well qualified.\n  Before tenure on the bench, Justice Coleman served for 4 years as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in Chicago and for 8 years in the Cook County \nState Attorney's Office. As Cook County prosecutor, she handled a wide \nvariety of cases--from muggings to murders. She was promoted to be \nchief of the public interest bureau, where she supervised over 75 \nattorneys and created a special unit to protect senior citizens from \nexploitation and abuse.\n  As additional evidence of her commitment to the legal profession, she \nserved on the boards of numerous bar associations and public interest \norganizations in the great city of Chicago. She has received many \nawards for her work, including the prestigious C.F. Stradford Award \nfrom the Cook County State Attorney's Office, the Esther Rothstein \nAward from the Women's Bar Association of Illinois, and a ``Women of \nExcellence'' award from the Chicago Defender newspaper. Finally, I note \nthat Justice Coleman was one of the top candidates recommended to me by \nmy bipartisan merit selection committee I established last year to \nreview applications for judgeships in the northern district. This \nscreening committee is chaired by Abner Mikva, who served at the \nhighest levels of government in all three branches. Also, Senator \nBurris has joined me in supporting Justice Coleman.\n  I hope we can receive a very strong vote for her nomination when it \nis considered by the Senate in a few moments. The State of Illinois \nwill be very fortunate to have Justice Shirley Coleman to be serving on \nthe Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           NASA Authorization\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while we are waiting on other \nSenators who wish to speak on this judge, I wish to briefly inform the \nSenate that this coming Thursday, the full Commerce Committee will \nconsider a number of bills that it will mark up. Among them is the \nauthorization bill for NASA.\n  We are building consensus in what has otherwise been a consensusless \nposition of the future of the manned space program. The President had \nproposed one thing. He altered that. Different people have different \nideas. Different aerospace companies all looking to have a certain part \nof the manned space program also have their different ideas.\n  Out of this mix, we are trying to bring together Senators to build a \nconsensus in a bipartisan way; the space program is not only not \npartisan, it is not even bipartisan. It is nonpartisan--to be able to \ndo this in a fairly unanimous way.\n  I am happy to report to the Senate that I think we are getting there. \nI believe what we will have is the essence of the President's proposal. \nIt will still have the continuation of the President's proposal for \ncompetition among commercial space companies to deliver not only cargo \nto the International Space Station, of which the President recommended, \nand we will certainly\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\nauthorize extending the life of the space station to 2020, something on \nwhich we have spent $100 billion. It did not make sense, as was \nproposed before, to cut it out in 2015, something we spent that much \nmoney on and are just now completing its construction. These commercial \ncompanies would, in this authorization bill, have the direction as to \nhow they go about man rating their systems in order to have the safety, \nwhen you strap human beings on to rockets that defy the laws of \ngravity, to take a human being into low-Earth orbit to rendezvous and \ndock with the space station and to return safely. That is one thing.\n  The next thing on which we are building a consensus is to accelerate \nthe development of a heavy-lift vehicle. The President said no later \nthan 2015. We are going to authorize NASA to start in 2011 and to take \na lot of the existing technology and build upon that, make it evolvable \nwith a heavy-lift vehicle that would be in the range of 75 metric tons \nin order to get space assets in the low-Earth orbit to ultimately \nfulfill the President's goal as stated in his speech to the Kennedy \nSpace Center, which was to go to Mars by a flexible path. His specific \ntimeline was to rendezvous and land on an asteroid by 2025. We \naccelerate the development of the heavy-lift vehicle.\n  Because the hardware is there and ready, will be on the pad, we are \ngoing to authorize an additional flight of the space shuttle. This is \nthe shuttle that they call the ``launch on need.'' It is a second space \nshuttle that is on the pad for the remaining two, in case they get into \ntrouble. It becomes a rescue shuttle to get the marooned astronauts, \nwere that to be the case.\n  The fact is, they are doing so well now, and now that we are going to \nand from the space station on these final two missions, the likelihood \nof anything happening is de minimis and, therefore, we are going to \nauthorize the flying of that last shuttle, the launch on need, because \nwe believe there is a minimal risk. If something did happen on ascent--\nsuch as a piece of foam coming off and hitting the wing and knocking a \nhole in it, which was the cause of the destruction of the Space Shuttle \nColumbia back in 2003--then the astronauts would be able to take safe \nharbor in the International Space Station, and they would then be able \nto be returned to Earth by other vehicles, such as the Russian Soyuz, \nwhich is a permanent lifeboat that is attached--two of them--to the \nInternational Space Station.\n  We will continue in this authorization bill a robust research and \ndevelopment program. We will continue the President's recommendations \nfor his science budget, for his aeronautics budget of NASA, and all of \nthis will be within the amount of money the President has proposed.\n  This NASA authorization bill will be for 3 years. We are expecting \nthat we will be able to take this up this Thursday and to pass it out \nof the full Commerce Committee.\n  We, of course, in respect to the appropriations process, have been in \nclose consultation with our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. \nHow the authorization committee and the Appropriations Committee worked \ntogether has been a good example of considerable cooperation.\n  I wanted to bring that message to the Senate. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know--I assume we are on the confirmation \nof Sharon Coleman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. First, I am going to speak a little bit about the process \nof her nomination through the committee. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer would know about this because he has had probably the best \nattendance of anybody, including the chairman, on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and he has handled a number of these nominations.\n  We are going to proceed today on only 1 of the 22 judicial \nnominations that have been stalled on the Senate floor by Republican \nobstruction. This is a nominee we considered and voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously 3 months ago without objection.\n  Just so everybody will understand, even after being nominated to \nserve on a court, these well-qualified nominees have to put their lives \non hold. We have the hearing, they go through the committee \nunanimously, but then they wait and wait on the Senate floor. If the \nnominee is practicing law they cannot take on new clients. If they are \nwith a law firm, they have a hard time taking new cases as the law firm \nneeds to avoid any conflict of interest.\n  I cannot understand why this obstruction is happening. I have never \nseen anything like this in my 36 years in the Senate. No Republican \nSenator on the Judiciary Committee voted against this nomination. There \nare another dozen judicial nominations on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar that were reported by the Judiciary Committee without \nobjection, but they remain stalled by a Republican refusal to consent \nto final Senate action.\n  I tell people in my home State of Vermont I am sent here to vote yes \nor no, not to vote maybe. It seems to me everybody wants to vote maybe. \nThere is no good reason each of these pending nominations could not be \nconfirmed immediately. With so many nominations, despite ongoing \nvacancies and the need in the Northern District of Illinois for this \njudge, 3 months have passed without any explanation.\n  I predict that when we have the rollcall on this nomination it will \nbe confirmed with virtually no opposition, which makes it even more \ntragic. Also, it hurts the Federal judiciary. It hurts the credibility \nof the Federal judiciary. But I might say, especially on something like \nthis, where the Senate Republican leadership would not even consent to \na vote on the nomination until today, this certainly hurts the image of \nthe Senate. People cannot understand why, when we have something on \nwhich everybody agrees, why it cannot come to a vote.\n  We have the Senate Republican leadership refusing to enter into time \nagreements on pending judicial nominations that have the support from \nboth Democrats and Republicans, including nominations with bipartisan \nsupport from North Carolina and Tennessee and South Carolina and \nCalifornia and New York and Delaware and Virginia and Utah, Maryland, \nMinnesota, and Rhode Island. Every single Democrat is prepared to vote \non these nominations. They could vote on them tonight and are prepared \nto vote now. However, they continue to be held up by Republicans.\n  So I tell the people of North Carolina and Tennessee, South Carolina \nand California and New York and Delaware and Virginia and Utah and \nMaryland and Minnesota and Rhode Island, if you are wondering where \nyour judges are, they are being held up not by the Democrats but by the \nRepublicans.\n  In fact, the Senate is dramatically behind the pace I set for \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees in 2001 and 2002. In 2002, the \nsecond year of the Bush administration, the Democratic Senate \nmajority's hard work led to the confirmation of 72 Federal circuit and \ndistrict judges nominated by a President from the other party. In this \nsecond year of the Obama administration, we have confirmed just 23 so \nfar--72 for President Bush, 23 for President Obama.\n  In the first 2 years of the Bush administration, we confirmed 100 \nFederal circuit and district court judges. So far, in the first 2 years \nof the Obama administration, the Republican leadership has successfully \nblocked all but 35 of President Obama's Federal circuit and district \ncourt nominees--100 to 35.\n  Playing games with the Federal judiciary hurts everybody. During the \nfirst 2 years of President Bush's Presidency, I had the opportunity to \nserve for 17 months of as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I \nknew we had just come from a time where Republicans had pocket-\nfilibustered 61 of President Clinton's nominees to the judiciary. I \nsaid we ought to try stopping that, so in those 17 months that I had \nthe privilege to serve as chairman, I convinced the people in my caucus \nand others and we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees.\n  I mention this because in the first 48 months of President Bush's \nPresidency, actually barely half of that time, 17 months of that 48 \nmonths, there were Democrats in charge. For 31 months of this time \nthere were Republicans in charge. During the 17 months that the\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nDemocrats were in charge, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's \nnominees. During the 31 months the Republicans were in charge I think \nthey confirmed around the same number. So we showed our good faith, \neven though we had seen 61 of the Democratic President's nominees \npocket-filibustered.\n  At this date in President Clinton's second year in office the Senate \nhad confirmed 72 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees. At \nthis date in President Bush's second year in office, 57. Of course, we \nconfirmed 100 in all by the end of the year.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country continue to hover \naround 100. Of these, 43 vacancies have been declared by the \nnonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to be judicial \nemergencies. I cannot remember a time when we have had 43 judicial \nemergencies.\n  Sharon Coleman has been nominated to fill one of them, but we have \nhad to wait 3 months just to get to a vote on her. Ten nominations to \nfill other judicial emergency vacancies have been reported out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and they remain stalled in the Senate. Last \nyear, when Senate Republicans blocked President Obama's nominees, we \nconfirmed the fewest judges in 50 years, the fewest judges from any \nPresident, Republican or Democratic, in 50 years.\n  Speaking of another nominee, I said to President Obama when he asked \nwhy they were blocking everything he tried to do, I said: If you had \nnominated Moses the Lawgiver, there would be some who would try to \nblock the nomination. In fact, I said, at least somebody would say: \nWell, he can't produce a birth certificate.\n  This is playing games with the Federal judiciary. I don't know what \nthe benefits are. It certainly does not make the Senate look good. When \nyou think the Senate Republican leadership last year allowed only 12 \nFederal circuit and district court nominees to be considered and \nconfirmed, despite the availability of many more for final action--that \nis wrong. They have continued their obstruction throughout this year. \nBy every measure, this Republican obstructionism of our Federal \njudiciary is a disaster for the Federal courts and the American people. \nBut the good thing is Sharon Coleman is going to be confirmed today. \nAfter these unnecessary delays, she will be confirmed, and I \ncongratulate Sharon Coleman and her family on her confirmation.\n  She is currently a justice on the Illinois Appellate Court of \nChicago, having served previously as a judge on the Circuit Court of \nCook County, IL, as Deputy State's Attorney and Bureau Chief for the \nPublic Interest Bureau of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, as \nan assistant U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Illinois, and as \nan assistant State's attorney in Cook County.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated Justice Coleman ``well qualified.'' That is \nthe highest possible rating they could give her.\n  After she is confirmed, and she will be, there will be still 21 \njudicial nominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee that \nhave been stalled from Senate consideration by the Senate Republican \nleadership. For many months I have urged the Republican leader to work \nwith the majority leader to schedule immediate votes on consensus \nnominees. Going forward, we will have many who will be confirmed by our \ncommittee unanimously. We ought to get them to the Senate floor and \nvote on them. The Senate needs to be making better progress considering \nthe many pending judicial nomination awaiting final Senate action.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Illinois. I assume he wishes to \nspeak, and I will yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I thank the Senator from Vermont, the chairman. I thank \nhim for the wonderful job he has done trying to move our judges along. \nI agree with the Senator, the fact we have to go to a vote on this \ndistinguished nominee; it should be done by unanimous consent, and we \nshould not have had to take up this time. But if that is the will of \nthe body, then so be it.\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening in strong support of Judge Sharon \nJohnson Coleman, a proud resident of my home State of Illinois and of \ncourse a fellow Chicago south-sider. We are very proud of which side \nshe comes from in Chicago, west side or south side. Few appear from the \nnorth side. We don't have a deal with the east side because that is \nLake Michigan. We are proud of that.\n  She received her law degree from Washington University in St. Louis, \nand she has served as an assistant State's attorney, deputy State's \nattorney, and assistant U.S. attorney. She quickly proved she knew her \nway around the courtroom and could be very successful in the cases she \ntried.\n  From 1996 to 2008, she served as a circuit court judge in Cook \nCounty. She displayed a thorough understanding of the law and a fair \ntemperament that marked her as a model jurist.\n  She was assigned to the Child Protective Division for 2\\1/2\\ years \nand was a jury trial judge in the law division for almost a decade.\n  In 2008, Judge Coleman was elected to the Illinois Appellate Court. \nShe has served there ever since and is doing a tremendous job in her \ndeliberations.\n  I am proud to support her nomination to become a district judge for \nthe Northern District of Illinois. We are short of judges in that \ndistrict. The caseloads are heavy, and we can stand to have a few more \nof those nominees confirmed by this body.\n  Judge Coleman is an excellent jurist, and I place my full confidence \nin her as President Obama's nominee for this post. She has been \nsupported by all of our bar associations. She has won numerous awards \nand received recognition in her career. She has been a tremendous \nmember of the bar and of the judiciary.\n  I am asking my colleagues to join me in supporting her in this \nconfirmation. I agree with my chairman. These judges should be \nconfirmed so we can move on with some other important business of this \nbody.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Sharon Johnson Coleman, of Illinois, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the extension \nof unemployment benefits, something we talked about 2 weeks ago before \nwe left town. It is something we talked about the week before that and \nthe week before that. There has been a lot of talk, and there has been \ncontinued opposition from Senate Republicans.\n  I am incredulous that we have seen week after week after week--it has \nbeen 41 days since the Congress let unemployment insurance lapse. It \nwas on June 4, 41 days ago. It is not because a lot of us didn't want \nto see it happen. It is because of an obscure--less obscure to the \npublic than it was--60-vote rule. The Republicans did not just oppose \nthe unemployment benefits extension--there are a couple of Republicans \nwho voted for it, but of the 41 Republicans there was overwhelming \nopposition, virtually 90 percent of them--it is not just that they \nvoted no. Let them vote no. They actually filibustered. They actually \nblocked us from even voting on the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  It is unfair to the unemployed who face a difficult job market \nthrough no fault of their own, and it is bad economics. We know Senator \nMcCain, Presidential candidate McCain's economic adviser, among others, \npointed out that money going out for the extension of unemployment \nbenefits actually stimulates the economy better than any other dollars \ngoing into the economy. The money that goes to an unemployed teacher or \nan unemployed steelworker or an unemployed clerk or an unemployed \ncomputer programmer is money that is spent almost immediately because \nthey have bills they have to pay. That money goes right into the \ncommunity. We see a multiplier effect.\n  When the humanitarian response is to extend unemployment benefits, \nand the best economic policy response is to extend unemployment \nbenefits, most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--39 out \nof 41 of them, I believe--have voted no.\n  June unemployment was 9.5 percent. We know a year and a half ago \n700,000 Americans lost their jobs; 700,000 Americans lost their jobs \nthe month that Barack Obama became President. Things are better now. We \nare seeing job increases. In April, in Ohio, we had the biggest job \nincrease of any State in the country: 37,000 new jobs. But that is not \nclose to dealing with the unemployment brought on by the economic \npolicies of deregulating Wall Street, cutting taxes for the rich, and \nnot paying for anything--the war, the tax cuts, the bailouts to the \ndrug and insurance companies in the name of privatizing Medicare.\n  Never before has Congress cut off benefits when unemployment was so \nhigh. Until recently, it has always been a bipartisan extension of \nunemployment benefits. Overwhelming numbers of Republicans and \nDemocrats voted to extend unemployment benefits. I just keep trying to \nexplain to my colleagues who vote no on the unemployment benefits \nextension that this is not welfare, this is insurance. People pay into \nthe unemployment insurance fund and get benefits when they lose their \njobs. At the same time, nobody gets these benefits unless they actively \nseek work; unless they are sending out resumes, doing interviews, going \nand visiting businesses, employers, whatever they can do to try to find \njobs. Yet the Republicans continue to deny the extension for \nunemployment benefits.\n  Our workers deserve more than this crass political gamesmanship that \nan overwhelming number of Republican Senators are playing. July 1 was \none of the busiest days ever at the Summit County Department of Jobs \nand Family Services. It was the first of the month, and because of \nRepublican obstructionism--because they voted not just against \nextending unemployment benefits, they voted to filibuster our even \nconsidering these extension of benefits--because it was the first of \nthe month and because of Republican obstructionism, this body failed to \nextend unemployment benefits. Staff members at the Summit County \nDepartment of Jobs and Family Services typically assist 300 to 400 \nclients a day. On July 1 twice that number were served by midday, and \nfour times that number were seen by the close of business.\n  So a typical day of 300 or 400, 300-plus clients at the Summit County \nJobs and Family Services turned into 600 before midday, and 1,200 by \nthe close of business. The staff at the Department of Jobs and Family \nServices in Akron, led by Ms. Pat Divokey and County Executive Russ \nPry, is doing everything they can to help working middle-class Ohioans. \nBut when 90,000 Ohioans across the State are in need of an extension of \nunemployment benefits--90,000 people--it is time for this body to step \nup. Ninety thousand is a lot of people. It is almost hard to imagine.\n  I think what is important is to think about these 90,000 as \nindividual human beings. I wish to share a handful of letters I \nreceived from Ohioans--just three of them--to put a human face on this \nissue. It is incredible to me to think about this many people who are \nso unsure whether they are going to have any money to feed their kids, \nto pay their mortgage and their utility bills in the weeks ahead \nbecause of the 60-vote rule, and this body has not been able to extend \nunemployment benefits because of a Republican filibuster.\n  Let me read a letter from Judith of Franklin County. It is the county \nwhere Columbus is located, the State capital.\n\n       I am very disappointed that the unemployment extension has \n     not passed. I was laid off after working in my job for 20 \n     years. I have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree and I \n     have worked for 35 years since I graduated. I have never been \n     without a job until now.\n       I understand the growing budget deficit, but what are \n     working people supposed to do when we can't find a job?\n\n  These are not people who don't want to work. Whether they are in \nAlbuquerque or Santa Fe or whether they are in Truth or Consequences, \nthese are people who want to go to work. They are people who have \nworked their whole lives and are used to showing up to work. They can't \nfind jobs. I hear this prattle from the other side of the aisle that \nthis is some kind of welfare scheme. It is not. These people want to \nwork. Most people who are filing for unemployment are people who, No. \n1, have worked for years and, No. 2, continue to search for a job; they \ncannot get an unemployment extension unless they do.\n\n  The second letter is from Pat from the Mahoning Valley, in the \nYoungstown area:\n\n       I am a 25-year veteran of the accounting industry, but I \n     was recently laid off.\n       My employers have paid into the federal and state \n     unemployment funds for me for those 25 years that I worked.\n       And now for the first time I need to collect those benefits \n     until I secure new employment.\n       While Congress plays political games, I have bills to pay \n     and work to find.\n\n  Mr. President, he points out exactly this. He works in the accounting \nindustry. He understands it. He understands that it is good economics \nto extend these unemployment benefits to people who lost their jobs, \nand he understands fundamentally that for the 25 years he worked for \nthis accounting firm or for a number of accounting firms--I don't know \nwhether Pat is a man or a woman, so he or she was paying--Pat's \nemployer was paying into this insurance fund. So it is not welfare, in \nspite of what my Republican colleagues say.\n  You know, the other thing that is absolutely amazing in what Pat said \nand what Judith said about the growing budget deficit--the Presiding \nOfficer was in the House of Representatives for several years \nrepresenting a district in northern New Mexico. He saw year\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nafter year when the Republicans didn't care about the budget deficit. \nThey voted for hundreds of billions of dollars in spending for a war \nthat I know the Presiding Officer and I both voted against that was not \npaid for. They voted for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that \nwere not paid for. They voted for a giveaway to the drug and insurance \ncompanies--a bailout--in the name of Medicare privatization that was \nnot paid for. Again, they voted for these huge government expenditures \nand charged it to our grandchildren and said it was OK. But now that it \nis the unemployed middle-class, working Americans who are laid off, \nthey think we cannot do this because of the budget deficit.\n  What are their priorities of the Republican Senators who voted \nagainst the unemployment extension? They were willing to charge it to \nour grandchildren to fight the war in Iraq, they are willing to bail \nout the drug and insurance companies, and they were willing to charge \nit to our grandchildren when it came to tax cuts for the richest \nAmericans. When it came to workers losing their jobs, they are not \nwilling to move forward and help them. It is amazing.\n  The last letter comes from Jeff from Butler County, a conservative \ncounty north of Cincinnati in southwest Ohio, one of the most \nconservative counties in Ohio.\n\n       I worked at my job for 36 years till my employer shut down \n     our plant recently.\n       All those years I paid into unemployment.\n       While I'd prefer to have a job and earn a decent wage, I \n     now need unemployment benefits until that happens.\n       Think of the big picture. The people paying into the system \n     should be the first to receive benefits.\n\n  Jeff is right. He understands that he paid into unemployment for 36 \nyears, and now Republican Senators won't let him draw from that fund. I \njust don't get it when I think of what this does to people.\n  I guess I will close with this: I wish the Senators who voted no--and \nthere are 41--on the extension of unemployment--we have had several \nvotes and continue to fall 1 or 2 votes short--I wish they would sit \ndown with a family and listen to them, not respond but listen to a \nfamily where workers lost their jobs; listen to the woman talking about \nlosing health care, when she talks about telling her children that they \nare going to have their home foreclosed on and what are they going to \ndo; explain to their children--they have teenage children, say--explain \nto them that Mom and Dad lost their jobs and their insurance, and now \nthey have to move out of their house because they cannot afford it.\n  The children may ask: Where are we going to move?\n  They would say: We don't know that yet.\n  What school are we going to go to?\n  We don't know that yet.\n  That is why I come to the floor and read letters from people in Ohio. \nI wish Senators would listen to people in their States. We get a lot of \nmail. We come across a lot of numbers and statistics. I wish they would \npick up some of the letters they get. I know Senators all over this \ncountry are getting letters like this. There are very few States--maybe \nenergy States or heavy agricultural States--that haven't been afflicted \nwith unemployment the way California, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, New \nYork, Florida, and so many States have. Maybe they don't understand. \nBut those Senators from States that have high unemployment--and that is \nmost of the country--I wish they would read their letters and hear what \npeople are saying.\n  We are going to try again this week. I ask my colleagues to vote to \nextend unemployment benefits. It is morally the right thing to do in \nterms of economic policy. It is the right policy, and we should not \nwait any longer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5736-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

BYRD\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on Monday evening I came to the floor and \nspoke from the heart about my friend Senator Robert Byrd. I wanted to \ntake the opportunity to submit a more comprehensive statement about \nSenator Byrd and his legacy.\n  As I looked at his empty desk with flowers on it, I thought back to \nlast summer when we lost another giant, Senator Ted Kennedy. And what \ndistinguishes Senator Byrd, like Senator Kennedy, from others was his \nunbelievable, never-ending commitment to the people he represented and \nto this country.\n  It was never a question of Senator Byrd's length of service--though \nhis was exceptional but rather his fierce sense of fighting for West \nVirginians. As he told the New York Times in 2005, ``I'm proud I gave \nhope to my people.''\n  Senator Byrd was, of course, the Nation's longest-serving Senator. \nAnd he was a legend, for sure. When I came to here, I learned firsthand \nthat he always met with the incoming Senators, to give them an \nintroduction to the rules of the road, the procedures and dignity of \nthe Senate, and to share his reverence for the Constitution. The image \nthat I will always have of Robert C. Byrd is him reaching inside his \nsuit pocket and bringing out the Constitution, which along with the \nBible was what he cherished most.\n  Senator Byrd was a giant in the Senate and a champion for America's \nworking families. We will miss his eloquence, his sharp intellect, and \nhis passionate oratory.\n  He was one of our Nation's foremost historians of the Senate. He \nliterally wrote the book on the Senate, a four-volume history. And he \nwas not only an expert on the rules of the Senate, he was a fierce \ndefender of its traditions and its role in our democracy.\n  Senator Byrd fought to make sure every American had a chance to live \nthe American dream because he lived the American dream.\n  He was born in coal country in southern West Virginia, the youngest \nof five children. His mother died before he was a year old, and he was \nraised by his aunt and uncle on a farm with no telephone, electricity \nor running water.\n  He went on to graduate first in his high school class and married his \nhigh school sweetheart, Erma, to whom he was devoted throughout their \n68 years of marriage until her death in 2006. To support his wife and \ntwo daughters in the early years, he worked as a gas station attendant, \na grocery store clerk and as a welder in a shipyard during World War \nII.\n  A naturally gifted speaker, he was elected to the West Virginia House \nof Delegates in 1946 and to the West Virginia Senate in 1950. He won a \nseat in Congress in 1952 and his U.S. Senate seat 6 years later. He had \nsuch a passion for education that he remains the only American ever to \nearn a law degree while serving in Congress. President John F. Kennedy \npresented it to him at American University in 1963.\n  His career in Congress spanned 12 presidents, and he cast more 18,500 \nvotes in the Senate. He was Senate majority leader, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and President pro tempore of the Senate. He \nfought every day to make life better for the people of West Virginia \nand for all Americans.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, coming from the largest State in the \nUnion, we have had our share of problems. We have had floods and fires \nand droughts and pests. And every single time, after every earthquake \nor storm or other disaster, Senator Feinstein and I came to our \ncolleagues to say that California needed the help of the U.S. \ngovernment.\n  Every time we needed assistance, Senator Byrd, as the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, opened his doors and his heart to us, sharing \nhis experiences and helping us in all of these cases when we were so in \nneed. I am sure many of my colleagues can recount similar experiences. \nHe was always there for us.\n  And I remember so well his leadership in trying to bring the troops \nhome\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nfrom Iraq. Twenty-three of us had stood up and said no to that war, and \nafterwards, we worried very much about what would happen with our \ntroops in what was shaping up to be a long war with no exit strategy. \nOpening up his office here in the Capitol, Senator Byrd organized us, \nsaying, ``We need to talk about ways that we can bring this war to an \nend.''\n  He cared so much about everything he did here, from working to create \nopportunity for West Virginians and all Americans to maintaining the \ntraditions and the dignity of the Senate. And for me, just to have been \nin his presence and to watch him work has really been an amazing \nexperience, and so I am proud to pay tribute to him today.\n  Senator Byrd stayed here through thick and thin, with a cane or a \nwheelchair, through the sheer force of will, suffering to be in this \nplace that he loved so much and that he respected so much. There isn't \na Member on either side of the aisle that didn't respect Senator Byrd \nfor his intelligence, his strength, his extraordinary biography, and \nhis dedication to the people of his State.\n  What a legacy he leaves. It is a great loss for his family, for all \nof us in the Senate, for the people of his beloved State of West \nVirginia and for all Americans. I extend my deepest condolences to his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5737-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING CODE TALKER MOSE BELLMARD\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it was 2 years ago that I worked to pass \nand have signed into law by the President the Code Talkers Recognition \nAct, a bill to give Congressional Medals to the many Native American \nCode Talkers who served in World Wars I and II. Today, I wish to honor \nan original Code Talker, Mose Bellmard, a Kaw Indian who bravely served \nour country during World War I. As a veteran and ardent supporter of \nthe armed services, I always take pride when I have the opportunity to \nrecognize the service of fine Oklahomans like him.\n  Bellmard, considered by many to be one of the last hereditary chiefs \nof the Kaw Indians, was born on February 16, 1891, to Josephine and \nLeonard Bellmard in Indian territory. U.S. involvement in World War I \nbegan when Bellmard was 26, and, even though Native Americans were not \nyet considered full citizens of the United States, he was one of the \nfirst to volunteer. He trained at Fort Sill in Lawton, OK, was made a \n1st lieutenant with Company E in Oklahoma's 1st Infantry Unit.\n  After a few weeks of training, he deployed to the frontlines of the \nwar in France. The setting was dangerous, and a number of his men were \nquickly killed during routine patrols of their area. Upon \ninvestigation, Bellmard realized that the Germans had painted sections \nof barbed wire that allowed them to easily spot his patrolmen's \nmovements. Creatively, he thought to use a large bed mattress--instead \nof a person--to draw fire so his units could locate and neutralize the \nenemy. The scheme apparently worked, and in addition to saving lives \nhis unit was able to use the tactic to destroy a number of German gun \ninstallations along the Western front.\n  But this would not be Bellmard's only contribution to the war effort, \nnor would it be his most impactful. When Bellmard entered the war, the \nGermans had been able to decipher nearly every one of the Allies' \ncodes, making it difficult for them to operate in secrecy. Bellmard \nrecognized this problem, and as the leader of the Native American unit \nsaw a tremendous asset in his soldiers' diverse languages. These \nlanguages were completely foreign to Europeans and had never been \nwritten down. They were ideal candidates for new codes.\n  Lieutenant Bellmard suggested to his superiors that his unit's men be \nscattered throughout troop dispatch points as communications officers. \nThere, he reasoned, they would be able to disseminate orders in their \nnative tongues and then translate them back into English. His plan was \nput into practice and quickly proved to be reliable and secure. \nBellmard and his original Code Talkers of Oklahoma allowed many Allied \nforces to move safely through battle zones without fear of \ninterception, and to this date there are no records of the Central \nPowers ever cracking their ``code.''\n  Bellmard's suggestion carried over into World War II, during which \nCode Talkers were widely recruited and were critical to the Allied \nForces' victory in the Pacific theater. Bellmard's simple idea to use \nNative American tongues to thwart and confuse enemies proved a lasting \nand effective tool for the U.S. military. It is fitting he was promoted \nto the rank of captain for his role.\n  Unfortunately, Captain Bellmard died before we could thank him \npersonally for his contribution to our freedom. But our thanks are \nstill important, especially as we remember Independence Day and the \ncost of securing that freedom. We owe our sincere gratitude to all \nAmerican heroes like Mose Bellmard, and I pray that more emerge in \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5737-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL PHILIP C. SKUTA\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a close \nfriend of the Senate, COL Phil Skuta. Over the past 2 years, Colonel \nSkuta has served as the Director of the Marine Corps Liaison Office to \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Throughout Colonel Skuta's service in the Senate he has escorted 14 \nCODELs to 27 countries. I have traveled with Phil to visit our troops \nin Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\n  Last year, I had the privilege of spending Thanksgiving with the \nWyoming Army National Guard 115th Fires Brigade in Kuwait. With only 2 \nweeks' notice, Colonel Skuta and his team provided the support to \nexecute this trip. As a selfless leader, he did not task a junior \nofficer to take on the trip. He postponed his Thanksgiving plans with \nfamily to be with our troops in the Middle East.\n  Throughout these travels I got to know Colonel Skuta very well. \nColonel Skuta is a native of Williamsport, PA. Phil joined the Marine \nCorps in 1984 through the Platoon Leader's Class program while studying \nat the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.\n  From Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to Joint Guardian and \nIraqi Freedom, Colonel Skuta has led his marines through many trying \nand dangerous situations. On his most recent deployment, he led the \nSecond Battalion, Seventh Marines into Iraq to train and conduct \noperations with the Iraqi Security Forces. The 2d Battalion, seventh \nMarines' primary area of operations was Ramadi and west of the \nEuphrates River in Al Anbar province.\n  Throughout his career he has handed down from one marine to the next \nhis excellent leadership skills. Colonel Skuta's example will teach the \nnext generation that will come to know the Marine Corps. Under Phil's \nleadership, steady hand and sharp instincts, the USMC Senate liaison \nteam has well served General Conway and all marines.

Mr. President, today I recognize the exemplary \nwork of Allen Smith, Jr., of Helena, MT. This week, Al will be awarded \nthe American Association for Justice Partnership Award in recognition \nfor his work as the executive director of the Montana Trial Lawyers \nAssociation. I commend Al for all his work on behalf of the justice \nsystem and Montana's strong network of legal advocates.\n  The mission of the American Association of Justice is ``to promote a \nfair and effective justice system--and to support the work of attorneys \nin their efforts to ensure that any person who is injured by the \nmisconduct or negligence of others can obtain justice in America's \ncourtrooms, even when taking on the most powerful interests.'' I can \nthink of no one that reflects this mission more than Al Smith.\n  Since joining the team at the Montana Trial Lawyers Association in \n1997, Al has shown a commitment to promoting justice and fairness in \nour\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\ncountry's legal system. His desire to serve MTLA comes from his respect \nfor its members who, each day, work for justice by holding governments, \ncorporations, and other powers accountable to individuals. As MTLA \npresident Sydney McKenna wrote last year, ``[Al] articulate[s] in a \ncompelling way why the courts are necessary, that causes and damages \nare part of justice, and that justice matters.''\n  During the past 13 years serving as the executive director of the \nMontana Association, Al has worked hard to represent the bar in both \nState and Federal matters. I have had the privilege of working with Al \non a number of Federal initiatives and have always appreciated Al's \nthoughts on how Federal legislation could impact the rights of \nindividuals in the legal system.\n  Al also serves on the boards of directors for the National \nAssociation of Trial Lawyer Executives and A.W.A.R.E., a private, \nnonprofit organization providing quality, community-based services for \npersons with disabilities. Al served as the executive director and \nattorney for the Montana Advocacy Program, which works to protect and \nadvocate for the human, legal, and civil rights of Montanans with \ndisabilities. In 2009, Al was awarded the Montana Trial Lawyers \nAssociations Public Service Award. Al received the Annual Award for \nAdvocacy from the National Association for Rights Protection and \nAdvocacy in 1991. He received his bachelor's in political science from \nMontana State University and his juris doctor from the Hastings College \nof the Law at the University of California.\n  As a lifelong Montanan, Al has a deep appreciation for the State and \nall it has to offer. In his spare time, Al enjoys to hunt, fish, kayak, \nand climb Montana's beautiful mountains. Al is married to Marilyn, who \nwas born and raised in Anaconda, and together they have two children--\ndaughter Kait and son Ben.\n  I again congratulate Al for his recognition by the American \nAssociation for Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5738-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PHILLIP ORTIZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the life of Los Angeles County Highway Patrol Officer \nPhillip Ortiz. Officer Ortiz, a 28-year veteran of the Los Angeles \nCounty Highway Patrol, died on June 22, 2010, from being struck by a \nvehicle while in the line of duty. His loss should remind us all of the \nvery serious dangers that our law enforcement personnel face every day \nas they do their jobs. I would like to take a few moments to recognize \nOfficer Phillip Ortiz's life.\n  Officer Ortiz grew up in Santa Monica, CA, and joined the California \nHighway Patrol in August 1982 at the age of 21. Soon after, he \nsuccessfully completed motorcycle training and in 1982 was eventually \ntransferred to the West Los Angeles area where he remained for the rest \nof his career. He loved riding motorcycles both professionally and in \nhis personal time. Officer Ortiz had a distinguished career and was \nvery dedicated to the California Highway Patrol.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring \nOfficer Phillip Ortiz for his leadership and dedication to the safety \nof over 10 million Los Angeles County residents. He is survived by his \nwife and childhood sweetheart, Jessica; his parents, Irene and Claude \nClauser; and his sister, Anna, to whom I send my heartfelt condolence. \nOfficer Ortiz leaves a lasting legacy of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5738-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO OFELIA VALDEZ-YEAGER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the \ncareer accomplishments and service of Ofelia Valdez-Yeager as she \nretires from her position as chief administrative liaison to the \nRiverside County Superintendent of Schools.\n  Ofelia--a native of Tayoltita, Durango, Mexico--immigrated with her \nfamily to the United States in 1958. Although she began first grade as \na non-English-speaker, she completed the school year at the top of her \nclass--realizing her parents' high expectations for the academic \nachievement of their 10 children, even though they themselves had been \neducated only at the elementary level in Mexico.\n  Ofelia was admitted to the University of California, Riverside--UCR--\nin 1965 as one of the initial group of five Educational Opportunity \nProgram--EOP--students. After graduating in 1969 with a bachelor's \ndegree in Spanish and completing the requirements for an elementary \nteaching credential in 1971, she embarked upon a professional career \nthat has included work as an Upward Bound tutor and counselor, high \nschool counseling assistant, elementary school teacher, bilingual \nresource teacher, and consultant for several public agencies.\n  In 1992 Ofelia was elected to serve as the first Latina trustee on \nthe Riverside Unified School District Board; she was later elected vice \npresident of this same body. She expanded her commitment to public \nservice by accepting a part-time position as administrative assistant \nto the mayor--focusing her expertise and energies on youth, education, \nand crime issues. She also served as executive assistant to the \nsuperintendent of the Riverside Unified School District.\n  In addition to her current responsibilities as chief administrative \nliaison, Ofelia also serves on boards and committees of a number of \nlocal agencies and organizations, including the United Way, Concilio \nChild Development Centers, Fiesta de la Familia, Mission Inn \nFoundation, Raincross Group, Riverside County Library Foundation, \nRiverside Library and Museum Taskforce, UCR Medical School Community \nAdvisory, Riverside Community College Foundation, Hispanic Education \nFoundation, and the Riverside County Sheriff's Commission on \nRecruiting, Retention, and Diversity. As founder of the Latina Women's \nHealth Forum, as one of three founders of the Latina Network, and as a \nstrong influence behind the Nati Fuentes Centro de Ninos on the \nEastside, she continues to exert influence on education and community \npriorities.\n  In recognition of her professional contributions and service, Ofelia \nhas received the Hope Luminarias Award and the La Sierra University \nPresident's Community Service Citation. She has been named CHARO \nMinority Business Advocate of the Year and has been cited by the \nRiverside Press-Enterprise newspaper as one of the People Who Make a \nDifference.\n  It is my pleasure to recognize Ofelia Valdez-Yeager as she prepares \nto retire from the Office of the Superintendent, Riverside County \nSchools.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of an \nextraordinary real estate investor, philanthropist, Presidential \nadviser, civic leader and dear friend of mine, Walter Shorenstein. \nWalter passed away on June 24, 2010. He was 95 years old. Walter's \nlegendary entrepreneurship and civic involvement will benefit future \ngenerations of Americans for decades to come.\n  Walter Herbert Shorenstein was born into a hard-working middle class \nfamily in Glen Cove, New York on February 23, 1915. He briefly attended \nthe University of Pennsylvania before cutting his undergraduate studies \nshort in order to serve his country in World War II. During the war, \nWalter was stationed in North Africa, where he managed logistics and \nresources for troops in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Walter met his future \nwife Phyllis while serving as a major at Travis Air Force Base in \nCalifornia. They were married in 1945, and Walter began his real estate \ncareer upon moving to San Francisco in 1946.\n  Walter joined the commercial real estate firm, Milton Meyer & \nCompany, and became its only partner in 1951. He later purchased the \ncompany and in 1960, began rapidly expanding its holdings over the next \nthree decades. At various times, the company, which was renamed \nShorenstein Co. in 1989, has owned numerous notable buildings including \nthe Bank of America Tower in San Francisco, the John Hancock Center in \nChicago, and the Washington Harbour Complex in Washington, DC. The \nShorenstein Co., under the leadership of Walter's son, Douglas, \ncurrently controls roughly 30 million square feet of commercial real \nestate nationwide.\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\n  In addition to his exemplary business savvy, Walter was recognized \nfor his sharp intuition and diplomacy skills, and ultimately served as \nan adviser to three Presidents. President Lyndon Johnson appointed him \nto serve as an adviser on trade negotiations. President Jimmy Carter \nappointed Walter to the U.S. delegation that led peace talks between \nIsrael and Egypt in 1978, and to the Committee for the Preservation of \nthe White House. During the Clinton administration, Walter was \nappointed to serve on the board of directors of the Corporation for \nNational Service and the U.S. Commerce Department Industry Policy \nAdvisory Committee. In 1999, President Clinton presented Walter with \nthe Democratic National Committee's Lifetime Achievement Award for his \nactive service and commitment to the Democratic Party.\n  Later in life, Walter began donating both his time and money to \nlaudable civic efforts. In 1975, he led a group that placed 2,000 \nVietnamese orphans in loving homes in the United States. In 1993, he \nplayed a pivotal role in preventing the San Francisco Giants from \nmoving to Florida. A lifelong advocate for education, Walter \ncontributed heavily to several prestigious educational programs and \ninstitutes. Along with his wife, he founded the Joan Shorenstein Center \non the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University's \nKennedy School of Government, named for his talented daughter who lost \nher life to cancer in 1985. Walter also funded programs at Stanford \nUniversity's Asia-Pacific Research Center and the Institute of East \nAsian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.\n  Walter stood out as a driven entrepreneur who cared deeply for his \ncommunity. He will be remembered by his friends and colleagues not only \nfor his business savvy, but also for his tremendous sense of civic \nresponsibility. His vision and hard work greatly shaped and influenced \nthe city of San Francisco, and his civic contributions and leadership \nskills improved our Nation.\n  Walter is survived by his son Douglas; his daughter Carole \nShorenstein Hays; and his six grandchildren. My thoughts are with \nWalter's family at this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5739-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES KIMPEL\n\n Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today I honor Dr. James Kimpel who \nhas served our government for the last 13 years as director of the NOAA \nNational Severe Storms Laboratory, NSSL, in Norman, OK.\n  Dr. Kimpel held the position of director, where he oversaw research \nin weather radar, technology transfer from research to applications, \nand forecast and warning improvements. The activities that Dr. Kimpel \ncoordinated at NSSL helped save lives and property throughout the \nUnited States. During his tenure at the lab he provided the United \nStates with devoted and visionary leadership.\n  Through research and development during his 13 years as director, \nNSSL finished development of a Doppler weather radar technology that \nled to the birth of the national NEXRAD network, which consists of more \nthan 150 radar systems. The NEXRAD network was also upgraded from \nproprietary to open systems, which enabled dual-polarization upgrades. \nThese technological advancements will greatly increase precision when \nit comes to estimates of rainfall, delineation of rain from snow, and \nprovide a more exact estimate of hail size. Since its installation, the \nNEXRAD program has reduced tornado related deaths by 45 percent and \nreduced personal injuries by 40 percent.\n  Under the leadership of Dr. Kimpel, radar-based rainfall analyses \nwere created to improve flash flood and river forecasting. He was also \na key player in sparking interest and support for new facilities for \nNSSL that led to the construction of the National Weather Center \nbuilding, which is shared by the National Weather Service and the \nmeteorology enterprise at the University of Oklahoma.\n  During Dr. Kimpel's watch as the director, NSSL scientists had over \n600 archival, refereed journals published, were granted three patents \nand participated in four cooperative research and development \nagreements with private companies. He also played a large role while at \nthe University of Oklahoma as a full professor, dean of the College of \nGeosciences, provost, and senior vice president of the Norman campus.\n  Dr. Kimpel's service to our country goes far beyond the NSSL. As a \nmember of the U.S. Air Force, he served in Vietnam and earned the \nBronze Star Medal for his acts of courage and valor. He was also \nelected president of the American Meteorological Society, received the \nUniversity of Oklahoma Regents Alumni Award, and received the \nPresidential Rank Award-Meritorious Executive. He is a well-respected \nacademic, researcher, and mentor. He is also the proud father of five \nchildren and a grandfather to two grandchildren.\n  I give my highest regard to Dr. Kimpel and wish him the best. He has \ncontributed much not only to the State of Oklahoma, but to the United \nStates. The achievements and service of Dr. James F. Kimpel are worthy \nof celebration and commendation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5739-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING THE PINK ANGELS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \ndedication and tireless efforts of a group of approximately 50 men and \nwomen from the North Shore of Massachusetts called the Pink Angels. \nFormed in January 2005 as a group with the common goal of finding a \ncure for breast cancer, they have completed the Boston 3-Day Cancer \nWalk every year since.\n  They are survivors, daughters, wives, husbands, sisters, brothers and \nfriends of people stricken with breast cancer. When they first met, \nthey were strangers simply sharing their experience with the disease \nand now they have become lifelong friends. They began training together \nthat year in February, sharing stories and some tears, creating a bond \nthat holds a reservoir of strength, determination and hope. Their \nmutual support of one another during the training, the fundraising and \nultimately the 60-mile route allowed each of them to begin a \ntransformation from victim to warrior. Each has a different story that \nbrought them to the group but together they created a unity of purpose \nsignified by their crossing of the finish line as a group.\n  Since 2005, the Pink Angels walk around the city of Boston every \nyear. Many team members have also walked in Arizona, Cleveland, \nPhiladelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. In May \n2009, under the leadership of Joanne Seneta and Hilda Santos, they \nachieved a significant milestone by raising more than $1 million.\n  On July 23 in Framingham, MA, the Pink Angels will take flight again \nand on the 25th in Boston they will again cross the finish line as a \ngroup. I would like to thank them for their commitment to help find a \ncure for breast cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5739-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5739-S5740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN THEATER FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I congratulate and \ncommend the Contemporary American Theater Festival, CATF, in \nShepherdstown, WV, on its 20th season which began this past weekend on \nJuly 9. This renowned festival, presented in partnership with Shepherd \nUniversity, is an extraordinary event that runs for several weeks each \nsummer, bringing thousands of people to our beautiful State and \nhighlighting Shepherdstown's arts community.\n  More than two decades ago, Ed Herendeen had a dream of producing new \nworks in theater, so he came to Shepherdstown and did just that. He had \nthe vision and dedication to start and nurture this festival. And under \nEd's leadership, the theater festival continues to produce and develop \nnew American theater that not only examines current events and reflects \non national trends but also serves as a haven for contemporary \nplaywrights. This year, as it does every year, the festival confronts \nbold and controversial issues to prod the audience and explore new \nideas. Since its first season in 1991, CATF has produced 80 new \nAmerican plays and 30 world premieres.\n  A recent National Public Radio story described what the festival has \nmeant to the artists and the community:\n\n       The Contemporary American Theater Festival at Shepherd \n     University in\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\n     Shepherdstown is a dream for the writers of those plays. Over \n     the years, both up-and-coming playwrights and big names--like \n     Sam Shepard and Joyce Carol Oates--have premiered works \n     there. That's in large part due to the festival's hard-\n     working founder, Ed Herendeen. Herendeen founded the festival \n     20 years ago in partnership with Shepherd University. That \n     first season they did three plays and sold about 2,000 \n     tickets. Today, they do five professional plays and sell more \n     than 11,000 tickets. What's unusual about the festival is \n     that Herendeen says he's never tempted to do a popular play \n     in order to draw more people. The audience that the festival \n     has developed really is expecting it to do new plays.\n\n  In addition to its first-class performances, the festival offers \nlectures and discussion to enhance the audience's understanding of the \narts. Over the last 7 years, in partnership with the Appalachian \nEducation Initiative, AEI, the festival has hosted the Annual Elizabeth \nFrancis Teacher Training Institute, a professional development program \nfor high school teachers from West Virginia and other States across the \nregion. This is an opportunity to learn hands on from CATF's \nprofessional theater artists. Participants are immersed in the art and \ncraft of theater, gaining insight into acting, production, stage \nmanagement, marketing, and script analysis. This year, participants \nwill attend every play in the festival's 20th anniversary season, and \nhave a chance to meet and talk with actors, producers, and technicians \nwhile receiving graduate level credits for their coursework.\n  It is hard to overstate the extraordinary economic impact this \nfestival has on the entire region. The annual event brings people from \nmore than 20 States to West Virginia to enjoy theater, immerse \nthemselves in our community, and explore our beautiful natural \nsurroundings. And as the crowds fill our theaters, restaurants, shops, \nand hotels, their support creates employment and boosts local \nbusinesses.\n  In recent years, festival goers have contributed $3.2 million to the \nlocal economy with the average patron spending $132 on top of the price \nof tickets.\n  Today, I congratulate and thank Shepherd University President Suzanne \nShipley, Ed Herendeen, and their talented team for bringing such a \ntruly outstanding theater festival to the stage every year. The \nContemporary American Theater Festival in Shepherdstown is an enormous \nsource of pride for me and for every West Virginian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5740-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO VERMONT'S SOLDIERS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as we celebrate the 147th \nanniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, I celebrate the contributions \nVermont's brave citizens made to keep the Union whole.\n  As the Civil War began, President Lincoln sent a message to Governor \nErastus Fairbanks: ``Washington is in grave danger. What may we expect \nof Vermont?'' The Governor's reply: ``Vermont will do its full duty.''\n  Fairbanks called a special session of the State legislature and told \nlawmakers, ``The United States government must be sustained and the \nrebellion suppressed, at whatever cost of men and treasure.''\n  Vermonters fulfilled that pledge.\n  During the Battle of Gettysburg, waged from July 1 to July 3, 1863, \nVermonters fought heroically. Under the command of GEN George Stannard, \nVermonters ``broke the back of Pickett's charge,'' helping lead the \nUnion Army to victory in the decisive battle, says George Gunlock, a \nlocal historian in my State.\n  Another Vermonter, William Wells, won the Medal of Honor for leading \nhis men in a daring cavalry charge against Confederate lines during the \nBattle of Gettysburg. A statue was built in his honor in both \nGettysburg and in Burlington's Battery Park. Wells, who rose to the \nrank of general, served as Vermont's adjutant general after the Civil \nWar.\n  But it not so much the officers, but the brave men who served under \nthem, that we most remember, even at this historical distance.\n  Despite its small size, Vermont was a major contributor to the Union \nArmy.\n  In all, 33,200 Vermonters fought in the war, or more than 10 percent \nof the State's population at the time. Twenty-eight thousand Vermonters \nserved in the State militia and another 5,000 enlisted for Federal \nservice during the Civil War. At the time, the State's estimated \npopulation was 320,000.\n  According to historians, nearly half of the men in Vermont who were \nof military age signed on to serve their Nation.\n  Great sacrifice was exacted from these brave volunteers. Vermonters \nsuffered 5,194 deaths, during the Civil War, including 1,832 Vermonters \nkilled or mortally wounded in battle, 2,747 who died of disease or \nother causes and 615 who died while prisoners. More than 2,200 \nVermonters were taken prisoner during the war.\n  The history of the Vermonters who fought during the Civil War lives \non. The Vermont National Guard's 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, now \ndeployed in Afghanistan, uses a famous line from the Civil War--``Put \nthe Vermonters ahead''--as its motto today. The line comes from a \nfamous order by Union GEN John Sedgwick.\n  When the battle of Gettysburg began on July 1, 1863, Sedgwick's \nsoldiers were in Maryland, 35 miles from the battlefield. ``At dusk \norders came to move, but it was about 10 o'clock at night before the \ncolumn started for Gettysburg. It was on this occasion that General \nSedgwick issued his famous order: ``Put the Vermonters ahead and keep \nthe column well closed up.''\n  As we recognize the dedication of Vermont's soldiers in the Civil \nWar, so should we recognize the dedication and bravery of Vermont's \nsoldiers today, when more than 1,500 members of the Vermont National \nGuard are serving in the war zone in Afghanistan. Approaching July 4th, \nthe day which marks our Nation's independence, I want to celebrate the \ncourage of those brave men from Vermont who fought to preserve the \nNation in the Civil War, and the brave men and women who are answering \nour Nation's call today in the mountains and valleys of \nAfghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5740-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALICE KUNDERT\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act (``Stafford Act'') as an inadequate and ineffective legal \n     standard for federal response to a national disaster that \n     causes population displacement and significant damage to \n     property and infrastructure, and that overwhelms the \n     capacities of state and local governments to achieve \n     recovery; and\n       Whereas, such criticism is in part a reaction to the \n     provisions of the Stafford Act which do not require any \n     action remotely approaching a comprehensive, centralized, and \n     integrated disaster mitigation, response, and recovery \n     program with massive resources that can only be provided by \n     the federal government; and\n       Whereas, such criticism is in part a reaction to the \n     provisions of the Stafford Act which delegate the \n     responsibility for recovery to state governments and \n     establish a bureaucratic process for state requests for \n     federal assistance, which have led to confusion and inaction, \n     with essential assistance delayed and in many instances pleas \n     for help being ignored; and\n       Whereas, such criticism is in part a reaction to the \n     provisions of the Stafford Act which create neither an \n     individual right to assistance nor a process for governmental \n     accountability, thereby leaving people with few avenues of \n     legal recourse for disaster relief; and\n       Whereas, such criticism is in part a reaction to provisions \n     in the Stafford Act that do not address the specific material \n     and humanitarian needs of people struggling to restore their \n     lives and communities; and\n       Whereas, the Katrina Citizens Leadership Corps (``KCLC'') \n     has embarked on a course of developing policy recommendations \n     for amending the Stafford Act to achieve effective disaster \n     mitigation, response, and recovery; and\n       Whereas, the KCLC report, What It Takes to Rebuild a \n     Village after a Disaster: Stories from Internally Displaced \n     Children and Families of Hurricane Katrina (July 2007), \n     presents the recommendations for a national disaster standard \n     that support the fair and equitable restoration of lives and \n     communities harmed by a national disaster; and\n       Whereas, the KCLC, U.S. Conference of Mayors, United States \n     Senate Homeland Security Committee, and Internal Displacement \n     Project of Brookings Institution make recommendations that \n     can support unified work to improve the current legal \n     standard for addressing the country's response to a national \n     disaster: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to consider \n     recommendations to amend the Stafford Act regarding disaster \n     recovery in Louisiana; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-l26.

Pueblo was originally launched as a \n     United States Army cargo ship\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\n     in 1944 but was transferred to the United States Navy and \n     renamed the U.S.S. Pueblo in 1966; and\n       Whereas, The U.S.S. Pueblo was named for the city of \n     Pueblo, Colorado, and the county of Pueblo, Colorado, and was \n     the third ship in the naval fleet to bear the name Pueblo; \n     and\n       Whereas, After leaving Japan in early January 1968 on an \n     intelligence mission, the U.S.S. Pueblo was attacked by the \n     North Korean military on January 23, 1968; and\n       Whereas, According to United States Naval authorities and \n     the crew of the U.S.S. Pueblo, the ship was in international \n     waters at the time of the attack; and\n       Whereas, One crew member of the U.S.S. Pueblo was killed \n     during the attack, and eighty crew members and two civilian \n     oceanographers were captured and held for eleven months by \n     the North Korean government; and\n       Whereas, This year marks the forty-second anniversary of \n     North Korea's attack on the U.S.S. Pueblo and her crew; and\n       Whereas, The U.S.S. Pueblo is still in commission in the \n     United States Navy, but continues to be held by the North \n     Korean government and is currently a museum in Pyongyang, \n     North Korea: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     seventh General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That we, the members of the General Assembly, recognize \n     the bravery and sacrifice of the crew of the U.S.S.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 3565. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain Bureau of \nLand Management land in Mohave County, Arizona, to the Arizona Game and \nFish Commission, for use as a public shooting range; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Jon Kyl, in introducing a bill that would convey 315 acres of \nFederal land in Arizona to the Arizona Game and Fish Commission for use \nas a public shooting range. A similar bill was introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Congressman Trent Franks last year.\n  The construction of the Mohave Valley Shooting Range near Bullhead \nCity, AZ, is widely supported in the tri-state region and has several \nanticipated benefits. For example, local law enforcement agencies \nsupport the shooting range as a way to help maintain firearms \nqualifications. Mohave Community College has a Law Enforcement Academy \nthat would be significantly enhanced by this project. Also, the new \nrange will reduce instances of random shooting on sensitive public \nlands which followed the closure of a former Bullhead City shooting \nfacility in 1999.\n  In February 2010, after an arduous 12-year planning process, the BLM \napproved an administrative conveyance of federal land for the shooting \nrange under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. This decision was \nmade under an Environmental Assessment/Finding of No Significant \nImpact. Unfortunately, several tribal governments have appealed the \ndecision to the Interior Board of Land Appeals citing cultural impacts \nto the Boundary Cone Butte, which will undeservedly delay the project \nfor several more years. It is important to note that the project's \nEnvironmental Assessment offers several mitigation measures that \naddress tribal concerns, including the installation of sound dampening \nfeatures, requirements for noise monitoring to ensure compliance with \nState noise standards for shooting range facilities, limiting the \nfacility's footprint to protect culturally sensitive lands, and \nproviding for the relocation of species that would be disturbed.\n  The bill we have introduced would direct the BLM to complete the land \nconveyance without further delay. It also acknowledges the 2010 \nEnvironmental Assessment/Plan Amendment which was developed as part of \nthe project's 12-year planning effort. Mr. President, the Mohave Valley \nShooting Range project has lapsed for over a decade and the people of \nMohave County are still waiting to break ground. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 3568. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974/ create a Citrus \nDisease Research and Development Trust Fund to support research on \ndiseases impacting the citrus industry, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today it is my honor to \nintroduce a bill that would create the U.S. Citrus Disease Research and \nDevelopment Trust Fund. I am joined in this effort by my good friends, \nand fellow ``Citrus State Senators''--Sen. John Cornyn of\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\nTexas and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.\n  By introducing this bill, it is our collective goal to create a \nguaranteed source of funding for scientific research aimed at \naddressing diseases, invasive pests, and other challenges faced by the \nU.S. citrus industry. Most importantly, the scientific research \nsupported by my bill would benefit all citrus producers, regardless of \nwhere the citrus is growing.\n  Citrus growers in the U.S. shouldn't have to ask themselves if this \nis the year a disease or a pest will wipe them out. That's why having a \npermanent fund to help combat these threats just makes a lot of sense.\n  The most serious of these threats is citrus greening, a disease which \nkills the citrus tree and is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, an \ninsect no bigger than my fingernail. Because it attacks the tree and \nbecause it is so easily spread, this disease has the ability to wipe \nout the entire citrus industry.\n  My bill does not require new funding or create any new taxes--it is \nfunded by a portion of the existing import duties collected from \nimported citrus products. Specifically, the total amount of the fund \nmay not exceed $30 million dollars annually, which is only about half \nof the total duties presently collected on imported citrus products.\n  My bill is based on the model established by the Wool Trust Fund and \nadopts oversight and administrative controls for similar programs \nwithin the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that this bill is \nsigned into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 3569. A bill to improve the ability of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration to respond to releases of subsea oil and \ngas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are now on the 84th day of \nthe Deepwater Horizon spill. Along with the over 175 million gallons of \noil and natural gas that have gushed into the gulf, over 1 million \ngallons of dispersants have been applied, with 700,000 gallons applied \nunder the surface of the water. This is a method of using dispersants \nthat has been likened to a science experiment.\n  With each passing day, we see new images of oil washing up on the \nshores, onto our beaches, into the wetlands, coating the wildlife. We \nhave all seen it on television, and it is heartbreaking. But I worry \nmore about something else, something we do not see. For 2 months now, \nacademics, the media, and the public have asked about the possibility \nof vast amounts of oil miles away from the location of the spill.\n  Independent scientists from research institutions in my State, such \nas the University of South Florida and Florida State University, took \nto the water early on. They sent their own research vessels out there \nto find the answers. What they found confirmed the fears we have--what \nwe do not see, and that is detectable amounts of oil and hydrocarbons \nimpacting areas away from the spill. These hydrocarbons may not look \nlike what we imagined. We imagined ominous black clouds. But, in fact, \nwhat scientists pulled up from different depths in their water samples \noften came up clear, but just because you can't see the oil doesn't \nmean it is not there and it doesn't mean it is not having an impact.\n  A few weeks ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nreleased its first report on subsea oil. Our top ocean science agency \nhas been working to understand the impacts of subsurface hydrocarbons. \nWhile there is now some publicly available information on subsurface \noil, many unanswered questions remain. Is the subsurface oil down \nthere, and especially that which you can't see? Is it there because of \nthe use of dispersants? Does the large amount of pressure caused by the \nweight of the water column at such depths--as far as 5,000 feet--lead \nto these plumes of oil being subsurface? What is the effect of having \noil and gas throughout the water column as opposed to the oil floating \non the surface?\n  I believe it took so long to get any information because this is \nsomething we simply have not seen before. The last time this country \ndealt with a spill even near this magnitude was the Exxon Valdez spill. \nBut that was a tanker that leaked in a bay where all the oil was in the \nupper layers of the water column. The oil basically stayed afloat. \nHere, we have a situation where the oil is being released 5,000 feet \nbelow the surface of the gulf. It is being sprayed with dispersants, \nand that keeps much of it down in that fragile environment and away \nfrom view. But, of course, the many organisms that live down at those \ndepths are the base of the food web, and the impact of the dissolved \nand dispersed hydrocarbons on these critters is simply unknown.\n  We haven't even begun to deal with the question of the natural gas \nthat is also spewing out of the well. Some have estimated that as much \nas half of the volume coming out of the well is actually natural gas. \nSome of that is very probably dissolving, and it is possible that most \nof it is dissolving. But who knows how these chemicals are interacting \nwith it? If any of the natural gas is bubbling to the surface, it could \npose a threat to the health and the safety of wildlife, and it could \npose a health hazard to humans on the surface of the gulf.\n  As a result of all of this and so that we learn from this situation \nso we don't keep doing this same thing over and over, I am introducing \nthe Subsea Hydrocarbon Imagery and Planning Act. This bill will address \nsome of these gaps in our knowledge and understanding of what happens \nwhen oil and natural gas are released under the ocean.\n  This bill will direct NOAA to review its current protocols for \ndetecting and mapping subsea hydrocarbons. It would require them to \ndevelop priorities and to adopt a plan for the future by implementing a \nprogram within the Office of Response and Restoration dedicated to \nmapping subsea hydrocarbons and releasing what their trajectories are. \nState and local governments and the American people should have access \nto this information so they can plan accordingly. NOAA itself needs \nthis information for incorporation into its protocols for closing and \nopening fisheries. And the people in charge of managing this crisis \nneed this information so they can make informed decisions about how to \nproceed.\n  We are in the midst, as we know, of hurricane season. While we have \nnot seen this subsea oil with our eyes yet, a hurricane could make that \nworst-case scenario a reality.\n  Last week, during the recess, I spent some time with some of \nFlorida's best and brightest scientists who are studying this spill.\n  I spoke with researchers from Florida Gulf Coast University, Mote \nMarine Laboratory, and the University of Miami's Center for \nSoutheastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing. These institutions might \nhave the technology and expertise that could be used to detect and \nmonitor subsea oil and gas and measure its impact on fragile marine \nenvironments.\n  As we look to the future and as we are getting NOAA to adopt a plan, \nthat is a plan we need. This legislation--the Subsea Hydrocarbon \nImagery and Planning Act--will ensure that days in the future we will \nnot wonder how much oil and gas is out there, where it is, where it is \ngoing, and what its impacts will be because we will know.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate are going to support this effort. \nClearly, with what is going on, this well needs to be killed. There are \n60,000 barrels of oil a day gushing into the gulf, and this has been \ngoing on now closing in on 3 months.\n  Until the time the well is killed, they will continue to try to \nsiphon off as much as possible, and that is the process they are doing \nnow. They took off that one cap. All of that oil is gushing. They are \ngoing to try to put on another cap that will have a tighter seal that \nthey can get more to the surface.\n  In the meantime, all that oil on the surface--we have the skimmers--\nwe need to skim off and keep it from reaching the shore. If it gets on \nthe beach, that is one thing. We can get it off the beach. It harms all \nof the industries. It harms tourism. Clearly, the perception that there \nis oil harms fishing. But the real ecological damage is when it gets \npast the beach and it gets into the bays, the estuaries, and the marsh \ngrasses. Then it is so difficult to get out and it all the more \ncompounds the impact on the critters.\n  No. 1, kill the well.

Con. Res. 68\n\n       Whereas ``Freedom Summer'' was a campaign in Mississippi to \n     register African-American voters during the summer of 1964;\n       Whereas in 1964, most Black voters were disenfranchised by \n     law or practice in Mississippi;\n       Whereas this voting rights initiative was led by the \n     Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), with the \n     support of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), \n     which included the National Association for the Advancement \n     of Colored People (NAACP), the Congress of Racial Equality \n     (CORE), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference \n     (SCLC);\n       Whereas thousands of students and activists participated in \n     two week orientation sessions in preparation for the voter \n     registration drive in Mississippi;\n       Whereas in 1962, at 6.7 percent of the State's Black \n     population, Mississippi had one of the lowest percentages of \n     Black registered voters in the country;\n       Whereas three civil rights volunteers lost their lives in \n     their attempts to secure voting rights for Blacks;\n       Whereas Andrew Goodman was a White 20-year-old anthropology \n     major from Queens College who volunteered for the ``Freedom \n     Summer'' project;\n       Whereas James Chaney was a 21-year-old African-American \n     from Meridian, Mississippi, who became a civil rights \n     activist, joining the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in \n     1963 to work on voter registration and education;\n       Whereas Michael ``Mickey'' Schwerner was a 24-year-old \n     White man from Brooklyn, New York, who was a CORE field \n     secretary in Mississippi and a veteran of the civil rights \n     movement;\n       Whereas on the morning of June 21, 1964, the three men left \n     the CORE office in Meridian, Mississippi, and set out for \n     Longdale, Mississippi, where they were to investigate the \n     recent burning of the Mount Zion Methodist Church, a Black \n     church that had been functioning as a Freedom School for \n     education and voter registration;\n       Whereas the three civil rights workers were beaten, shot, \n     and killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan;\n       Whereas the national uproar in response to these brave \n     men's deaths helped raise the political capital necessary to \n     bring about passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; and\n       Whereas Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael \n     Schwerner's story will be told to millions of Americans and \n     their bravery will continue to inspire generations to come \n     through the issuance of a commemorative postage stamp: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the \n     United States Postal Service honoring civil rights workers \n     Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner, and the \n     ``Freedom Summer'' of 1964;\n       (2) the stamp honoring these three men should be based upon \n     the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) poster from 1964, \n     which was created by Danny Lyon, a prominent photographer of \n     the Civil Rights movement; and\n       (3) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/12/senate-section/article/S5748-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5748-S5749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4449.
