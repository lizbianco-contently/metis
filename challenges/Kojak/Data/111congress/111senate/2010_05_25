Madam President, as we look around the world, we have lots \nof issues that are extremely difficult ones. We have the Korean \nPeninsula situation that has drawn so much attention and rightfully so. \nWe now have our Secretary of State in China working on this and other \nissues, and the Secretary of the Treasury is there. We have a situation \nwhere it appears a South Korean Navy ship was sunk for no reason; that \ndealt with the security of North Korea. We have the oil spewing into \nthe gulf--thousands and thousands of barrels every day.\n  We have two wars we are watching closely, of course, in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We have the situation in Europe, where governments are \nstaggering because of financial problems. We have our own economy, \nwhich is doing better but certainly far from being where we want it to \nbe. Then, on the floor this week we have two extremely important issues \nto deal with. One is the supplemental appropriations bill that we have \ncombined with one given to us by the White House. We have the war \nspending, and then we have all the emergencies that came up during this \nyear. Every year, this is something we always do.\n  We have to figure out a way to get through these in the next couple \ndays. The House is going to act either tonight or tomorrow on an \nextenders bill--doing a lot of good things that our country and our \neconomy needs very badly. We realize the efforts we have to undertake \non the floor today, recognizing, of course, that we are not going to be \ndealing with all the issues I outlined, but we have important things to \ndo this week. It will take the cooperation of both sides to get it \ndone. I appreciate everybody's attention to the issues at hand but \nespecially during this week.\n  I hope it is not necessary that we are going to be in session during \nthe Memorial Day recess. There are a lot of issues we all have to take \ncare of at home. When we go home, it is not a question of sitting \naround the pool, sipping cold drinks. We have a lot of work to do. The \npeople we represent need to see us. Not everybody can come to \nWashington and meet with us. There are people out there whom we are \nfortunate to be able to meet with during the break. When we are stuck \nin Washington, many times they simply cannot afford to come here. We \nalso have the Memorial Day observances that are important to everybody, \nincluding the families of those who have lost loved ones. I hope \neveryone recognizes we have to try to get a lot of things done in the \nnext few days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/25/senate-section/article/S4165-8", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4165-S4166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, I wish to say a word about the \nadministration's health care plan. Along with most Americans, the \nentire Republican conference opposed this legislation. We listened to \nthe public and argued strenuously against its passage at every \nopportunity.\n  We also offered detailed reasons for our opposition, along with \ncommonsense alternative reforms aimed at lowering the cost of health \ncare without undermining the system we already have.\n  Since its passage, our arguments against the bill have been \nrepeatedly vindicated, even as the administration's many promises about \nthe bill have been called into question again and again. So Democrats \nmay have passed this bill, but the debate is far from over. It is \nimportant that Americans know the ways in which the promises they heard \naren't adding up.\n  The supporters of the bill said it would lower costs for families, \ntaxpayers and small businesses and that the President would not support \nany plan that ``adds one dime to the deficit.''\n  As it turned out, Medicare's own experts say the bill will actually \nincrease costs by more than $300 billion.\n  The pricetag Democrats used to sell the bill is dramatically lower \nthan the revised estimates that are now coming in. Sometime in the next \nseveral days, Democrats in Congress plan to add tens of billions of \ndollars more in health care spending on top of that, which, if they had \nbeen honest about it, would have been included in the original bill.\n  Needless to say, all this extra spending is money we don't have, and \nit goes straight to the deficit.\n\n  Take all this together, and it is no wonder that an overwhelming \nmajority of Americans continue to oppose this new law.\n  Tomorrow, Senator Barrasso will be on the floor offering what he \ncalls a second opinion on the bill. This is an important effort that I \nthink deserves and will continue to receive considerable attention. Dr. \nBarrasso is holding the supporters of the bill accountable for the \nassurances they gave the American people, who deserve to know the real \neffects and the real impact of this bill.\n  Related to all this, of course, are the methods the administration \nand its allies in Congress used to pass the bill. The cornhusker \nkickback may be a household phrase, but it is just one of the \nquestionable methods that were used to force it through against the \nwill of the public.\n  Another method was the stifling of critics, as was done by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  I have spoken out repeatedly on the gag order HHS issued against \nprivate companies for doing nothing more than informing seniors about \nprovisions of the bill that could affect their benefits.\n  Well, now you can add another layer of outrage to that unfortunate \nchapter in this debate because, just yesterday, I came across a recent \nflyer from the Department of Health and Human Services, which I am \nholding up, that does the very thing the administration didn't want \nprivate companies to do. They sent out a gag order against private \ncompanies saying you cannot express yourself about how this law would \naffect your beneficiaries. Now the government, at taxpayer's expense, \nis sending out--with our tax money--exactly the same thing to seniors \nthat they would not let a private company do.\n  This flyer purports to inform seniors about what the health care bill \nwould mean for them. Much of it directly contradicts what the \nadministration's own experts have said about the law. This flyer--\nprinted at taxpayers' expense and distributed to seniors--contradicts \nwhat the administration's own experts are saying about the health care \nbill. All this, as I said earlier, is bought and paid for by the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  This is a complete outrage. It is an absolute outrage. It is \nprecisely the kind of thing that Americans are so angry about at the \nmoment.\n  Here is the Federal Government telling a private business it can't \ncommunicate with its clients about important legislation and then doing \nthe very same thing itself, paid for with our tax money.\n  The administration's own Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services says seniors who use Medicare Advantage will lose \nbenefits as a result of this bill. Yet the flyer they are putting out \nsays absolutely nothing about that. Instead, it implies that nothing \nwill change for seniors.\n  But perhaps most egregious is the claim that a bill which cuts \nMedicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion will actually ``preserve and strengthen'' \nMedicare. What nonsense.\n  This is nothing short of government propaganda, paid for by the \ntaxpayer. I am sure Dr. Barrasso will have more to say about this in \nthe weeks ahead.\n  I commend to my colleagues a brochure that was put out by the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services and the message therein by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius--``Medicare \nand the New Health Care Law--What it Means for You.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/25/senate-section/article/S4166-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate began \nconsideration of the supplemental spending bill to fund the surge of \nforces into Afghanistan and our ongoing efforts in Iraq.\n  President Karzai was recently here to talk about the situation in \nAfghanistan, and during that same week General McChrystal briefed the \nArmed Services Committee on the conduct of the overall campaign.\n  One message that came through from both visits is that the surge in \nAfghanistan is not yet complete and the counterinsurgency strategy \nGeneral McChrystal has developed is still in its early stages. So it is \nimpossible to overstate the importance of supporting our troops in the \nfield.\n  In the coming year, the resolve of NATO forces in Afghanistan will be \ntested by the Taliban fighters. The Taliban leadership in Pakistan will \nbe watching with interest to see if this Congress and our country stand \nfirmly behind the counterinsurgency strategy and so will our Pakistani \npartners, elected governments in European capitals, and average \ncitizens in Afghanistan.\n  Low-level Taliban fighters in Afghanistan will ultimately have to \ndecide whether to side with a government that has yet to earn their \ntrust or Taliban leaders. They will be watching our efforts as they \nweigh whether to side with the Taliban leaders or their current \ngovernment in this fight. This is why we must keep up the pressure.\n  The stakes are as high as ever. We have seen that in recent weeks as \nthe Pakistani Taliban has attempted to strike us here at home and as \nthe Afghan Taliban has launched high visibility strikes at military \ninstallations in Kandahar and at Bagram. Afghan leaders who attend the \ncoming peace talks will be waiting to see if the United States can be \ntrusted to stay long enough to fulfill our promises of helping the \nsecurity forces of Afghanistan become operationally effective.\n  American forces have brought great pressure on the Taliban in \nAfghanistan. That must continue if General McChrystal's strategy is to \nsucceed. We must work together to help him ensure that the Taliban do \nnot return to power in Afghanistan and that Afghanistan does not again \nbecome a sanctuary for terrorists.\n  In short, we must pass this bill with bipartisan support and resist \nthe urge to slow it down or to use it as a mere vehicle for deficit \nspending on pet domestic projects that will only bog us down in a \npartisan fight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/25/senate-section/article/S4166-4", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4166-S4167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have conferred with the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye. There is no \nobjection that I ask unanimous consent to continue for a few minutes as \nin morning business. I make such a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Ending Discrimination\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support congressional action to move past \nthe policies that discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation \nagainst men and women serving and wanting to serve in our Nation's \nmilitary.\n  I commend Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nDefense Secretary Gates, and the President for their leadership on this \nimportant issue. America is defended by the finest military in the \nworld. There should be no place in America, including in our military, \nfor discrimination.\n  While the country and Congress work to move the country forward and \nopen the doors of opportunity to all Americans, some still choose to \nsow division and partisan conflict. How ironic that the policy of \nnondiscrimination that Elena Kagan sought to encourage while serving as \nthe Dean of Harvard Law School is poised to become the law of the land, \nwhile those who oppose her nomination continue to distort her lawful \nactions to ensure that the school followed its nondiscrimination \npolicy.\n  I support the reversal of the don't ask, don't tell policy. I hope \nall Senators will.\n  Two weeks ago, President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to succeed \nJustice John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. Much has been written and said about this nomination \nduring the last 2 weeks and more will be said over the next month, as \nwe prepare for the Judiciary Committee's hearing, which will begin on \nJune 28. So far, there has been far too much talk about the process and \ntoo much partisanship surrounding this important matter. Among the most \nserious constitutional duties entrusted to the Senate is the \nconfirmation of Supreme Court Justices. So let us refocus on the \nqualifications of this extraordinary nominee, remembering that a \nSupreme Court Justice is there not to serve a Republican or a \nDemocratic administration but all 300 million Americans.\n  When the President announced his choice back on May 10, he talked \nabout Solicitor General Kagan's legal mind, her intellect, her record \nof achievement, her temperament, her fairmindedness. No one can \nquestion the intelligence or the achievements of this woman. She is at \nthe top of the legal profession. She is no stranger to breaking glass \nceilings. She was the first woman to be dean of the prestigious Harvard \nLaw School. It was from Harvard Law School that she earned her law \ndegree magna cum laude. Previously, she earned a degree from Oxford \nUniversity and graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University. She \nclerked for two leading judicial figures--Judge Abner Mikva on the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and then on the \nSupreme Court for one of the most extraordinary lawyers and judges in \nAmerican history, Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n  As an advocate, Thurgood Marshall helped change America for the \nbetter by bringing cases that challenged racial discrimination. He won \nan extraordinary 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the Court, one of \nthe most outstanding records of advocacy before the Court, including \nthe landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education which helped bring an \nend to racial segregation in education in America, a blot on our \ncountry that was finally removed by that case.\n  Despite his obvious legal qualifications, when Thurgood Marshall was \nnominated to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals by President Kennedy \nin 1961, his nomination was stalled by opponents in the Senate before \nhe was eventually confirmed by a bipartisan vote of 54 to 16. He gave \nup that lifetime appointment when called upon by President Johnson to \nserve as Solicitor General of the United States, the top legal advocate \nfor the United States. Now, 40 years later, it is Elena Kagan who is \nserving as the Solicitor General of the United States, the first woman \nin America's history to serve as Solicitor General.\n  Two score and 3 years ago, President Johnson nominated Thurgood \nMarshall to be the first African American to serve on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. President Johnson said that it was ``the right thing to do, the \nright time to do it, the right man and the right place.'' President \nJohnson was right, and that nomination helped move the country forward. \nThe nomination was confirmed by a bipartisan Senate vote of 69-11.\n  The American people have now elected our first African-American \nPresident, a leader who is committed to the Constitution and rule of \nlaw. With his first selection to the Supreme Court, he named Justice \nSonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic to serve on the high Court. She was \nconfirmed last year and has been a welcome addition to the Supreme \nCourt. Now he has nominated only the fourth woman in the Court's \nhistory, a nominee who when confirmed will bring the Court to a new \nhigh water mark of three women serving as Justices. Yet Senate \nRepublicans seem to want to shift the standard from when the Senate was \nconsidering President Bush's nominees to the Supreme Court--John \nRoberts and Samuel Alito--and to apply a new standard to President \nObama's nomination of Elena Kagan.\n  I have long urged Presidents from both political parties to look \noutside what I have called the judicial monastery and not to feel \nrestricted to considering only Federal appellate judges as potential \nSupreme Court nominees. When confirmed, Elena Kagan will be the only \nmember of the Supreme Court who did not serve as a Federal appeals \ncourt judge. When confirmed, she will be the first nonsitting Federal \njudge to be confirmed to the Supreme Court in almost 30 years, since \nthe appointment of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  When the President introduced Elena Kagan to the country, I was \ninterested in him talking about learning from Justice Marshall that \n``behind law, there are stories--stories of people's lives as shaped by \nthe law, stories of people's lives as might be changed by the law.'' \nThe President said that her understanding of law is not merely \nintellectual or ideological but how it affects the lives of people.\n  We heard Solicitor General Kagan earlier this month talk about the \nimportance of upholding the rule of law and enabling all Americans to \nget a fair hearing. She said, ``law matters; because it keeps us safe, \nbecause it protects our most fundamental . . . freedoms; and because it \nis the foundation of our democracy.'' Like her, I believe law matters \nand matters in people's lives. The Constitution is our protection.\n\n  Since her nomination, Solicitor General Kagan has met with dozens of \nSenators. I understand she will conclude her meetings with the Senators \nserving on the Judiciary Committee in the coming weeks. We have each \nhad a chance to meet with her, speak with her, ask her questions, and \nlearn more about her. At our Judiciary Committee hearing next month, \nthe American people will have the chance to see her, hear her, and get \nto know her.\n  Fourteen months ago, the Senate considered Elena Kagan's impressive \nlegal credentials when we confirmed her in a bipartisan vote to be the \nSolicitor General of the United States, the Nation's top lawyer. The \nperson filling that vital post is informally referred to as the ``tenth \nJustice,'' because the Solicitor General works so closely on \nsignificant cases before the Supreme Court. Solicitor General Kagan has\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nnow argued a broad range of issues, including her successful defense of \nCongress's ability to protect children from pedophiles.\n  With this nomination, Elena Kagan follows in the footsteps of her \nmentor, Thurgood Marshall, who also was nominated to the Supreme Court \nfrom the position of Solicitor General. She broke the glass ceiling \nwhen she was appointed as the first woman to serve as Solicitor \nGeneral, as she did when she was named the first woman to serve as dean \nof the Harvard Law School. They are historic accomplishments. In fact, \nas dean, Elena Kagan worked well with all ideological components of the \nfaculty at Harvard. She took action to bring more conservative \nviewpoints to the institution and encouraged civil discourse. Those are \nskills that will be useful in what often appears to be a sharply \ndivided Supreme Court.\n  Having counseled the President to look outside the judicial \nmonastery, a recommendation I have made to every President since I have \nbeen here, beginning with President Ford, I was struck that the first \nwave of attacks by Senate Republicans to this nomination was that she \nlacked judicial experience. These attacks ignored Senate Republicans' \nown recent statements praising President Bush's nomination of Harriet \nMiers for being someone who had not served a judge, calling her a \n``wonderful choice'' who would ``fill very important gaps in the \nSupreme Court.'' Now that a Democratic President is nominating, they \nreverse themselves to contend that lack of judicial experience is a \nmatter for ``concern,'' is ``troubling,'' and a matter that ``warrants \ngreat scrutiny.'' Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that a foolish \nconsistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. They are not suffering \nhobgoblins, but the Senate Republicans are moving the goalposts, and \nshifting the standard from when the Senate considered the Roberts and \nAlito nominations. Republicans should not apply a double standard to \nthe nomination of this qualified woman.\n  Of course this Republican criticism ignores another key fact: They \nare themselves responsible for her lack of judicial experience. \nPresident Clinton nominated her to the DC Circuit in 1999 and it was \nSenate Republicans who refused to consider her nomination. Had they \ndone so she would have more than 10 years of judicial experience.\n  Republican Senate leadership staff was recently quoted as admitting \nthat these early attacks on Solicitor General Kagan's experience were \nreally just a ploy in what they view as a partisan game. `` `The lack \nof experience isn't the put-away shot,' the aide said. `It's the door \nwe use to get into her record.' '' This is from Roll Call, May 12, \n2010. I wish Senate Republicans would not approach our constitutional \nresponsibilities with respect to judicial confirmations as a partisan \ngame.\n  This feigned criticism of her that somehow she is unqualified because \nshe lacks judicial experience is ignorant of our history and \nconstitutional government. It is very recently that the path to the \nSupreme Court has become so narrow. Indeed, nearly half of our Supreme \nCourt Justices were nominated to the Court from a position other than a \njudgeship. Fifty-four of our 110 Supreme Court Justices were not \nserving as judges when nominated. Forty-one justices had no judicial \nexperience at all. Let me mention a few of the distinguished Justices \nwithout prior judicial experience: Chief Justice John Marshall, Justice \nLouis Brandeis, Justice Felix Frankfurter, Justice Byron White, Justice \nRobert Jackson, and Justice William Rehnquist.\n  Chastened after having been reminded of their recent support for \nPresident Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers, who had not been a judge, \nSenate Republicans abandoned this poll-driven line of attack. They are \nnow trying a different tack. They contend that the President should not \nbe nominating someone who has served in the government or his \nadministration.\n  Of course, Senate Republicans did not voice any such concern before \nthe American people elected President Obama. The most obvious example \nis, again, that of President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers. Senate \nRepublicans did not object to Ms. Miers' nomination because she had \nserved in the government or because she was serving as counsel to the \nPresident. They did not object that she was too close to the President \nand could not be independent. To the contrary, they objected and joined \nwith extreme right-wing activists to force the President to withdraw \nthat nomination because they feared they could not count on her enough. \nShe did not pass their ideological litmus test. They could not be \ncertain how she would vote and whether she would carry out their \njudicial agenda.\n  Nor did Senate Republicans express any concern when President Bush \nmade other nominations to the Federal courts from his close advisers \nand team. Senate Republicans supported his nominations of Brett \nKavanaugh, who was serving as his Cabinet Secretary, Jim Haynes, the \nloyal general counsel of the Defense Department, and Jay Bybee from his \nOffice of Legal Counsel. The issue I raised in connection with the \nnomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General was his \nunfettered loyalty to President Bush and his lack of independence. No \nRepublican joined in my concern then, but most soon after had to \nacknowledge that many of us had been right when we investigated White \nHouse influence in the firing of U.S. attorneys for political reasons. \nI hope that Senate Republicans will not apply a new standard to Elena \nKagan's nomination that was not applied when the Senate considered the \nnominations of those men.\n  Unlike these Republican critics, I have always championed judicial \nindependence. I think it is important the judicial nominees understand \nthat as judges they are not members of an administration, but they are \njudicial officers. They should not be political partisans but judges \nwho uphold the Constitution and the rule of law for all Americans. That \nis what Justice Stevens did in Hamdan, which held the Bush \nadministration's military tribunals unconstitutional, and tried to do \nin Citizens United, the Supreme Court's recent narrow decision in which \nfive Justices opened the door for massive corporate spending on \nelections. That is why the Supreme Court's intervention in the 2000 \npresidential election in Bush v. Gore was so jarring and wrong.\n  I welcome questions to the Solicitor General about judicial \nindependence. But let us be fair. Let us listen to her answers. Let us \nset this overheated rhetoric aside. Let us be fair to Solicitor General \nKagan, fair to her distinguished record. There is no basis to question \nher integrity, no reason to presume she would not be independent.\n  Thurgood Marshall was the Solicitor General of the United States when \nPresident Johnson nominated him to the Supreme Court. Does anyone think \nJustice Marshall lacked independence? Earl Warren had been designated \nto be Solicitor General when President Eisenhower nominated him to be \nChief Justice. Does anyone contend that Chief Justice Warren lacked \nindependence? Robert Jackson was serving as Attorney General when \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt nominated him. Does anyone contend that \nJustice Jackson lacked independence? Justice Byron White was serving as \nthe Deputy Attorney General when President Kennedy nominated him. Does \nanyone contend that Justice White lacked independence? And, of course, \nJohn Marshall was serving as Secretary of State when President Adams \nnominated him to be Chief Justice. Does anyone contend that Chief \nJustice Marshall, the person who established the principal of judicial \nreview, lacked independence? Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Alito and \nJustice Scalia all had significant experience working in the Justice \nDepartment but no Republican questioned their independence. In fact, \nSolicitor General Kagan is the 19th Supreme Court nominee to be named \ndirectly from a significant executive branch position.\n  Before someone questions the independence of this nominee, they \nshould have a basis. I know of none. No one should presume that this \nintelligent woman who has excelled during every part of her varied and \ndistinguished career lacks independence. I know of no basis for such \ncontention.\n  I look forward to the beginning of the Judiciary Committee hearings. \nI was amazed, flabbergasted to hear concerns about the schedule I set \nfor her nomination. I tried to set the same schedule as that I agreed \non for Justice Roberts during the Bush administration and\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nJustice Sotomayor during the Obama administration.\n  I have to admit, I did not hit it exactly. We are taking a day longer \nto begin hearings for Elena Kagan than for John Roberts or Sonia \nSotomayor. To do it exactly on the same day, we would have to start on \na Sunday, and I did not think that would be fair. So we are adding a \nday, and we are starting on a Monday.\n  I only note that when a Republican President nominated a man to the \nSupreme Court, the schedule was fine. When a Democratic President \nnominated women to the Supreme Court with exactly the same schedule, \nsuddenly it is not a fair schedule. Maybe I am old fashioned. Maybe I \nam influenced by my wife, my daughter, my three granddaughters. But I \nthink the rules ought to be the same for men and for women. That is why \nher schedule is the same.\n  Let us stop the crocodile tears on the other side about schedules. \nThey did not complain when it was a Republican man being nominated with \nthat schedule. Do not complain when a Democratic President nominates a \nwoman and it is the same schedule.\n  I look forward to these hearings. That is when Solicitor General \nKagan will finally be given the opportunity to answer questions and \nwill, based on all I know about her, give the American people and open-\nminded Senators confidence in her legal knowledge and abilities. I \nexpect that after reviewing her record and hearing from her during the \nJudiciary Committee's hearing, Senators on both sides of the aisle and \nthe American people will conclude that the President has nominated an \noutstanding future Justice.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the never-ending courtesy of \nthe Senator from Hawaii to a more junior Senator.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sessions amendment is the pending question \non the Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4173\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this will be the fourth time this year the \nSenate has faced an amendment from the Senator from Alabama which seeks \nto constrain discretionary spending. Each one of the amendments has \nbeen similar.\n  The Senator from Alabama uses last year's budget resolution as his \nstarting point. He argues that since Congress agreed to this level last \nyear that we should stick with it.\n  His goal is to mandate that the Congress hold the line on \ndiscretionary spending at these levels.\n  I would remind my colleagues that the Budget Committee had the \nability to make these caps binding when they passed this resolution \nlast year, but they chose not to.\n  Instead they put these notional targets in the resolution.\n  However, since the last time the Senate defeated the amendment, one \nimportant change has occurred. The Budget Committee has now reviewed \nthe President's budget request for fiscal year 2011 and has marked up a \nnew budget resolution. They have changed their recommendation.\n  Since the committee has determined the levels that it believes should \nbe adhered to, I am not sure what benefit the Senate would have in \nagreeing to the notional targets in last year's resolution.\n  Moreover, like the last three times, there simply is no justification \nfor the rest of the amendment.\n  We all understand that discretionary spending is likely to be frozen \nthis year as the President has proposed. Our Budget Committee \nrecommends it be cut by an additional $4 billion.\n  This proposal goes way beyond what the President or the Senate Budget \nCommittee recommends.\n  The President has proposed a modified spending freeze which caps non-\nsecurity related spending.\n  The president's proposal allows growth in Homeland Security; this \namendment does not assume growth.\n  The President has requested more than $732 billion in his budget for \nnational defense for fiscal year 2011, including the cost of war. This \namendment only allocates $614 billion.\n  While the proponents of this amendment note that it waives the $50 \nbillion war allowance, why does the amendment not support the full \nrequest? Some interpret the provision to mean if we want to support our \nmen and women deployed overseas we would need to get 60 votes.\n  Does the Senate really want national defense to be hostage to a 60-\nvote threshold?\n  This is not the same as President Obama's plan.\n  Over the three years in the Sessions amendment, the caps he would put \ninto place are $141 billion below President Obama's 3-year plan, $50 \nbillion below defense and $91 billion below non-defense spending. \nMoreover, this is not the Budget Committee's plan.\n  The Sessions amendment is $82 billion below the budget resolution \nwhich the committee adopted--including a cut of $50 billion from \nDefense over 3 years.\n  There can be no argument about this point.\n  The level in the Sessions amendment will require the Appropriations \nCommittee to cut defense spending in fiscal year 2011 by $9.5 billion \nand nondefense spending by about $11 billion.\n  If you vote for this measure while seeking program increases this \nyear, you can forget about such increases. Instead, in a budget that \nalready freezes nondefense spending, we will cut another $20 billion.\n  If we adopt the Sessions caps we will not be able to fund the \npriorities of our colleagues, and we will have to gut the President's \nagenda for discretionary spending, including education, green jobs, and \nhomeland security.\n  As I have said now several times before, the critical flaw in this \namendment is it fails to do anything serious about deficits. It fails \nto address the two principal reasons why our fiscal house is out of \nbalance.\n  It is a fact that the growth in the debt has resulted primarily from \nunchecked mandatory spending and massive tax cuts for the rich. This \namendment fails to respond to either of those two problems. In short, \nthis amendment is shooting at the wrong target.\n  Moreover, this amendment also wants to raise the threshold on \ndiscretionary spending increases to a 67-vote approval, allowing one-\nthird of the Senate to dictate to the majority.\n  We already have a threshold of 60 votes required to increase \ndiscretionary spending above the budget resolution.\n  I, for one, cannot believe the Senate wants to let a mere one-third \nof the Senate dictate to the other two-thirds whether there is a bona \nfide need for increased spending.\n  This is the wrong direction for this institution. Mandatory spending \nhas increased substantially the last few years.\n  Tax cuts for the rich have constrained revenues, but neither tax cuts \nnor mandatory spending increases would be subject to the 67-vote \nthreshold.\n  The Senator from Alabama says this approach worked to help balance \nthe budget in the 1990s; Well, that is only partially correct, and here \nis the difference.\n  In the 1990s our budget summits produced agreements to cap \ndiscretionary spending, but they also decreased mandatory spending and \nincreased revenues at the same time.\n  It was only by getting an agreement on all three areas of the budget \nat the same time that we were able to achieve a balanced budget.\n  Let's be clear. Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare happy to put a cap on discretionary spending, but they do not want \nto put policies in place to make sure we have enough revenues to reduce \nthe deficit.\n  Any honest budget analyst can tell you we will never achieve a \nbalanced budget just by freezing discretionary spending. We could \neliminate all discretionary spending increases for defense, other \nsecurity spending, and nondefense spending and still not balance the \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\n  Moreover, if we cut discretionary spending without reaching an \nagreement on mandatory spending and taxes, we will find it very hard to \nget those who do not want to address revenues to compromise.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that the deficit reduction commission \nis tasked with helping us get our financial house in order. They will \nlook at both revenue and spending and find the right balance to restore \nfiscal discipline.\n  They will make their recommendations to the Congress, and the \nMajority Leader has committed to bringing the recommendations of that \nCommission to the Senate for a vote.\n  Rather than rushing to address only one small portion of the issue, \nthe Senate should await the judgment of the Deficit Reduction \nCommission, which will cover all aspects of the problem.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I agree that everyone \nshould tighten their belts.\n  The problem with this amendment is that all the tightening will be \ndone on a small portion of spending, while revenues and mandatory \nspending will still be unchecked.\n  The Senate has already rejected this flawed plan three times this \nyear. This amendment has not gotten any better in the intervening \nperiod.\n  However, we know that it is not only out of step with the \nadministration, but it is also out of step with our Budget Committee.\n  It is still shooting at the wrong target. It still fails to address \nthe real causes of our deficits and national debt. It would provide far \nless funding than either the President or the Senate Budget Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues once again to vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Appointment of Conferees--H.r. 4173\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              START Treaty\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I rise today to speak about the New START treaty that \nPresident Obama and President Medvedev signed in Prague on April 8. In \nfulfilling the Senate's constitutional responsibility to offer our \nadvice and consent on the treaty, we must give it our diligent and \ntimely consideration.\n  I have previously spoken about the fundamental justification for the \nNew START treaty. It serves our national security interests. What I \nwant to address in this and succeeding statements are some of the more \nsignificant specifics of the treaty and the arguments we are likely to \nhear about them. Today, I am going to focus on the strength of the \ntreaty's monitoring and verification regime, which is established in \nthe treaty itself, given more detail in the Protocol, and even more \ndetail in the annexes.\n  The verification regime in the New START treaty is extensive, \nelaborate, and appropriate to the treaty's central limits and today's \nworld. Secretary Gates has testified that when we hear from the \nintelligence community, they will tell us they are confident they can \nmonitor it. The verification regime speaks strongly for ratification, \nand sooner rather than later.\n  Ronald Reagan once said, ``Trust but verify.'' The verification \nregime established by the treaty is the means for ensuring that Russia \nis complying with the limits on strategic nuclear arms in the treaty: \n800 deployed or nondeployed intercontinental ballistic missile \nlaunchers, submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers, and heavy \nbombers equipped for nuclear weapons.\n  Within that limit, each side can have 700 deployed ICBM missiles, \nSLBMs, which are, again, the submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and \nheavy bombers. We can each have 1,550 total warheads on the deployed \ndelivery vehicles.\n  The original START treaty, which expired in December, was widely \nvalued for its verification regime. It effectively ensured that \nmilitary significant violations of the treaty would be detected in a \ntimely way, and therefore be deterred.\n  It also gave us real insight into the Russians' strategic forces and \nhelped to establish a relationship of greater trust, transparency, \ncooperation, and confidence between our two nations.\n  The verification regime established by the New START treaty is \nmodeled on the original one, but it is updated because the central \nlimits of the treaty are different and because we are in different \ntimes. Our relationship with Russia is different. We are less \nsuspicious of Russian intentions and much less uncertain about Russian \ncapabilities.\n  But the bottom line is the same: the verification regime under the \nnew treaty will ensure compliance and sustain a more stable, \ntransparent, and cooperative relationship with the world's other great \nnuclear power.\n  A very strong foundation for monitoring and verification of the \ntreaty limits is established by the provision on the use of and non-\ninterference with National Technical Means of Verification, such as \nsatellites and remote sensing equipment. The provision in the New START \nis virtually identical to that of the original START Treaty. Without \nthe new treaty, we lose a major obstacle to Russian interference with \nNational Technical Means of Verification; without this check, they \nmight attempt to conceal their forces.\n  The New START treaty also provides for extensive exchanges of data on \nthe numbers, locations, and technical features of weapons systems and \nfacilities--including telemetry on up to five ICBM and SLBM launches \nper year. The U.S. and Russia will have to share large amounts of \ninformation on treaty-limited items, which has to be updated regularly. \nIn addition, the Russians will be obligated to provide us notifications \non the movements and production of their long-range missiles and \nlaunchers.\n  For the first time, Russia and the U.S. will also record and share \nunique identifiers on all ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers covered by \nthe treaty--not just mobile missiles, as in the original START treaty. \nThese unique identifiers--in effect, serial numbers--will go a long way \ntoward enabling us to track both deployed and nondeployed Russian \nmissiles. They also serve as a deterrent against treaty violation.\n  All the information we will receive forms the basis for further \nverification through on-site, short-notice inspections at Russian \noperating bases, storage facilities, test ranges, and conversion and \nelimination facilities. The treaty provides for 18 inspections per \nyear.\n  If the inspections don't match the information that has been shared, \nthat is a violation of the treaty. For instance, if we were to find a \ndeployed missile that had been identified by the Russians as \nnondeployed, that would be a violation. Thus, the inspections can serve \nas a deterrent against cheating, as well as providing yet another, \ncontinuously updated source of information on Russian forces.\n  Finally, the Bilateral Consultative Commission set up by the treaty \nis a forum for the two nations to raise and address issues of \ncompliance as well as implementation.\n  There can be little question that without these extensive \nverification measures, we will be less safe. To be sure, thanks to the \nverification regime of the original START treaty, we have extensive \nknowledge of Russian nuclear forces, and that will not disappear. We \nknow far more than we did in 1991. But that knowledge will degrade much \nfaster and more completely without the successor treaty's verification \nregime. Without the new treaty's verification regime in place, a major \nsource of strategic stability, transparency and communication with \nRussia would be lost.\n  Some critics, however, have suggested that there are monitoring gaps \nin the verification regime that call the New START treaty into \nquestion. Two\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\nissues in particular have been raised: the limitation on telemetry, and \nthe loss of portal and perimeter monitoring at the Votkinsk missile \nassembly facility in Russia. I want to say a little about each of \nthese. Both criticisms are, in my mind, misguided, though for different \nreasons.\n  The criticism of the treaty's provisions on telemetry appears to \nneglect relevant differences between the New START treaty and the old \nSTART treaty. Telemetry is the information generated and transmitted \nduring missile test flights. In the original START treaty, each side \nwas prohibited from encrypting or otherwise denying access to its \ntelemetry. The telemetric data helped us understand, for verification \npurposes, the capabilities of the missiles tested. The article-by-\narticle analysis of the original START treaty singled out missiles' \nthrow-weight and the number of reentry vehicles as central items \ntelemetry helped verify.\n  The New START treaty allows for a more limited exchange of telemetry, \non no more than five ICBM and SLBM launches each year. Critics have \nseized on this reduction. The limited telemetric exchanges under the \nnew treaty are an important source of ongoing transparency and \nconfidence-building between our two countries.\n  However, the simple fact is, as Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen \nhave both testified, we don't need telemetry to monitor compliance with \nthis treaty. Unlike the original START, the new treaty has no limits on \nmissile throw-weight. Hence, we don't need to verify compliance with \nsuch limits. We also don't need telemetry to help attribute a number of \nwarheads to a missile type. The new treaty doesn't use such an \nattribution rule the way the old treaty did. Instead, we actually count \nthe number of warheads on a missile. This is both more precise and \neliminates a problem we had run into with the old treaty's rule, which \nforced us to overcount the number of warheads that are actually on our \nmissiles.\n  The other alleged monitoring gap has to do with the loss of the \nperimeter-portal continuous monitoring system--or PPCMS--at Russia's \nVotkinsk missile production facility. That loss is unfortunate, but \nprobably inevitable after our previous administration expressed to the \nRussians its intention to bring the monitoring at Votkinsk to an end.\n  However, thanks to our existing knowledge of Russian missiles and \nlaunchers, the verification measures in the treaty, and our National \nTechnical Means, the treaty makes up for the loss of the Votkinsk \nportal monitoring. In particular, the new treaty requires the Russians \nto notify us 48 hours in advance of any missile leaving the Votkinsk \nfacility, which allows us to cue our National Technical Means.\n  They also must notify us when the missile arrives for deployment or \nstorage. In this way, we can in fact achieve birth-to-death insight \ninto their missiles. The unique identifiers and inspection system will \nalso deter cheating. Finally, the Russians are producing few enough \nmissiles, and their existing ones are few enough in number, that it is \nhard to envision a realistic breakout scenario.\n  The loss of the Votkinsk portal monitoring is thus unfortunate, but \ncompensated for by other provisions of the treaty. And if Members are \nconcerned about the loss of Votkinsk, think about how much worse it \nwould be if we didn't ratify the New START treaty--that is, the loss of \nall monitoring and verification measures and the treaty's central \nlimits themselves.\n  To sum up, our negotiators got a very good deal on verification, and \nI commend them. There simply are not monitoring gaps opened up by the \ntreaty. On the contrary, the verification regime established by the \ntreaty is a significant reason to support it. It serves to ensure \ncompliance with the central limits in the treaty. It also will pay off \nby boosting transparency and confidence in our relationship with Russia \nand sustaining our insight into Russian forces.\n  What would open up a significant monitoring gap over time would be \nthe failure to bring this treaty into force. For the same reason, we \nshould move without delay in our consideration of the treaty. The old \ntreaty expired last December. The longer we go before we establish the \nnew verification regime, the more our insight into Russian forces will \ndegrade. We need to diligently consider all the materials the \nadministration has furnished us. We also need to do it without \nunnecessary delay. There is no question we are better off with the \nverification regime under the new treaty than without it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

Mr. President, this is the fourth time in under 2 weeks \nthat Senator Grassley and I, with a large bipartisan coalition of \nSenators in the Senate--a coalition that spans the philosophical \nspectrum of membership in the Senate--has sought to pass this \nlegislation to finally end the stranglehold of secret holds.\n  The American people want accountability from their elected officials, \nbut there is simply no accountability when the Senate operates in \nsecret. The fact is, this has gone on for years and years, and it has \nbeen done on a bipartisan basis. Right now there are scores of \nqualified nominees for important positions in the administration and \nthe Federal courts who can't get a vote on the Senate floor--and it has \nalso taken place on a bipartisan basis for years and years--as Senator \nGrassley and I have tried to make the point over this decade that we \nhave been attacking secrecy in the Senate and that this has gone on in \na bipartisan fashion.\n  The fact is a secret hold is one of the most powerful tools a Member \nof the Senate has today. I would be the first to grant that the \nAmerican people have no idea what secret holds are. The fact is a \nsecret hold can effectively kill a nomination or piece of legislation, \nand it can be done without anyone--colleagues in the Senate or the \npublic--knowing who did it or why.\n  One of the points I also wish to make--and it hasn't been explored in \nthe discussion of secret holds--is a secret hold is a very powerful \nweapon that is also available to lobbyists. My guess is practically \nevery Senator has gotten a request from a lobbyist asking if the \nSenator would put a secret hold on a bill or a nomination in order to \nkill it without getting any public debate and without the lobbyist's \nfingerprints appearing anywhere. In fact, if you can get a Senator to \nput an anonymous hold on a bill, it is almost like hitting the lobbyist \njackpot. Not only is the Senator protected by a cloak of anonymity but \nso is the lobbyist. A secret hold can let lobbyists also play both \nsides of the street and can give lobbyists a victory for their clients \nwithout alienating potential future clients. Given the number of \ninstances where I have heard of a lobbyist asking for secret holds, I \nam of the view that secret holds are a stealth extension of the \nlobbying world in Washington, DC.\n  In the Senate there has been an effort to improve the rules and have \nstricter ethics requirements with respect to lobbyists. It is something \nof an irony if the Senate--which it has in the past--adopts a variety \nof changes to curtail lobbying without doing away with what, in my \nview, is one of the most powerful tools that is available to lobbyists, \nand that is the secret hold. So what Senator Grassley and I have been \nworking on over the past decade--and with this bipartisan coalition we \nhave been able to assemble in the Senate--is the desire, once and for \nall, to permanently eliminate the use of secret holds.\n  I also believe that given the Wall Street reform bill that was just \npassed in the Senate to bring greater openness and accountability to \nfinancial institutions, it seems to me for the Senate to be telling \nWall Street it has to operate in a more transparent, open way, this is \na pretty darn good time for the Senate to reform the way the Senate \ndoes its business. If we are going to set about the task of telling \nfolks on Wall Street to be more open and more accountable, certainly \nthe rules in the Senate ought to be changed to abolish the secret hold.\n  Under current Senate rules, it is still possible for Senators to use \na secret hold to block legislation or a nomination from coming to the \nfloor without having to give any reason. There is no openness or \naccountability to anybody when a Senator places a secret hold. My view \nis the Senate shouldn't have a double standard where we are passing \nlaws and rules to require greater openness and accountability of \nothers, and particularly American institutions such as Wall Street, \nwhile tolerating a practice that keeps both the public and colleagues \nin the Senate in the dark without accountability to anyone.\n  Under the proposal Senator Grassley and I have sought to pass--and I \nsee my good friend from Iowa here, and I noted that this is our fourth \nsuch effort in about 2 weeks to finally bring some sunlight to the way \nthe Senate does business--under our proposal, somebody--a Senator--is \ngoing to have to own a hold publicly within 2 days. That is a key \nchange because we have looked at the Executive Calendar, we have looked \nat all of the places where we might see someone actually publicly own \nup to having a hold, and Senator Grassley and I haven't seen that kind \nof transparency and accountability.\n  So under our proposal which we are seeking to pass this morning, \nevery hold--every hold--is going to have to have a public owner within \n2 days.\n  Let me give an example of how this would work. Let's say a Senator \nobjects to bringing up a nomination on behalf of a colleague. If the \nSenator behind the hold who, in effect, is kind of the culprit in all \nof this secrecy doesn't go public by putting a notice in the \nCongressional Record within 2 days, then the Senator who objected on \nthe floor on behalf of this culprit is going to be listed in the \nExecutive Calendar as having placed the hold. The Senator who is in \neffect covering up for the colleague will get the blame if the real \nculprit--the real Senator who is trying to protect secrecy--would not \ncome clean.\n  So, in effect, what Senator Grassley and I are seeking to do is put \npublic pressure and peer pressure to get Senators to reveal their hold. \nIf Senators keep objecting to legislation or nominations on behalf of \nother colleagues, pretty soon that Senator can get identified as \nresponsible for dozens of holds. We think--Senator Grassley and I and \nSenators Inhofe, Collins, Udall, Bennet and Merkley, a big group that \nis involved in this on a bipartisan basis--with this approach we are \ngoing to create public pressure because nobody here in the Senate is \ngoing to want to go down in history as being ``Senator hold.''\n  In my view, it will also create peer pressure on Senators to come \nclean about their holds. Let's say Senator Grassley is on the floor or \nI am on the floor when a unanimous consent is made and one of us has to \nobject on behalf of a colleague. We will go tell that colleague that he \nor she better come clean because we are not interested in having our \nnames put on the Executive Calendar as the one who is supporting this \nsecret hold.\n  I also believe the Grassley-Wyden approach cures other problems with \nthe current holds policy by shortening the time period before a hold \nmust be made public from the current 6 session days to 2 days. Our view \nis that 2 days is plenty of time for a Senator to determine whether to \ncontinue objecting\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nand make the objection public or to withdraw the objection.\n  Our bipartisan proposal also includes reforms that make it harder for \nSenators to place revolving holds on a nomination or bill. Senator \nGrassley and I have seen this problem, over this decade we have been \ninvolved in this. Senator Grassley mentioned the fact that we have \nalways said this is being done in a bipartisan way that there is a very \nserious problem of revolving holds, where in effect a hold is passed on \nto another Member of the Senate. First, we eliminate the ability of a \nSenator to lift a hold before the current 6-day period expires and \nnever has to disclose it. Under our proposal, if a Senator places a \nhold--even for 1 day, even for just a minute--that hold would have to \nbe disclosed. Second, by shortening the time period, it will be even \nmore difficult to keep finding new Senators to place new holds every 48 \nhours.\n  I want to close by expressing my appreciation to Senator Grassley, \nSenators Inhofe, Collins, and others on the other side who have worked \nfor this badly needed reform, to bring sunshine to the Senate. Senator \nGrassley and I have put more than a decade into this effort.\n  I also thank my colleagues on this side of the aisle, particularly \nSenators Bennet, Udall, and McCaskill, who have brought a tremendous \namount of new energy and passion to this cause.\n  Finally, after all this time, let us eliminate secret holds. Let's \nrequire public disclosure of all holds and ensure that there will be \nconsequences if the Senator fails to disclose secret holds. I ask for \nour colleagues' support. It is a bipartisan effort that Senator \nGrassley and I have pursued for many years to bring greater \ntransparency and accountability to the Senate by eliminating secret \nholds once and for all.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for \nkeeping up the fight. We have been at it for a long period of time. \nThere has been a dry spell recently when this has not been a major \nissue. So we didn't feel, when there wasn't an interest in getting rid \nof secrecy within the Senate, like bringing this up. But now there is \nall this concern about what is going on with so many holds in the \nSenate--either bills or nominations--and that it is influencing the \nproductivity of the Senate.\n  There has been a lot of discussion on the floor of the Senate about \nthis issue, so the opportunity is ripe once again. This is the fourth \nor fifth time in the last couple weeks we have been at it. I thank my \ncolleague from Oregon for keeping up the fight. I am glad to work with \nhim as a Republican, and a lot of other Republicans who support this \neffort of making the public's business more public, the Senate's \nbusiness more public.\n  Senator Wyden went into the details of the legislation, so I am not \ngoing to repeat that. But I want people to know that, from my side of \nthe aisle, he has given an accurate representation, through his \nexplanation, of the intent of our amendment. Without repeating that, I \nhave made it a practice for a long period of time--I don't know, it has \nbeen 10 or 12 years--that when I put a hold on a bill or put a hold on \na nomination, I have put a statement in the public record so that they \nknow the Senator from Iowa has done this and my reason for doing it.\n  I want to tell my colleagues who think we ought to maintain the \nadjective before the word ``hold,'' it hasn't done any harm to me. \nThere has been no retribution because of it. It has given people on a \ndifferent side of the fence on the issue that I am--with my having a \nhold on--the opportunity to know it is me, and they can come to me for \nwhatever reasons they want, and see whatever arrangements we can make, \nor whatever compromises were necessary to move things along; and they \nknew it was this Senator from Iowa and my rationale behind it. It gives \nus an opportunity to work out differences. That is what the Senate, \nbeing a deliberative body, is all about.\n  On the other hand, when this Senator from Iowa finds that somebody \nputs a hold on a nominee or a bill I have an interest in, and it is \nsecret, then this Senator can't go to the other Senator and say, what \nis the problem? What can we do to work out our differences? Then that \nimpedes the deliberative work of the Senate.\n  We feel there is nothing wrong with the process of a hold, except for \nthe adjective ``secret,'' which can legitimately be put in front of the \nword ``hold.'' We want to preserve the deliberative aspect of the \nSenate. We don't want anybody to pull a quick one on anybody. The hold \nprevents that from happening. But we ought to know who you are and why \nyou are doing it.\n  This legislation the Senator from Oregon and I have put forth will do \nexactly that. It is all about transparency and, with transparency, I \nthink you get accountability. That is what representative government is \nall about--accountability. The public ought to have a right to know \nwhere Senators take a stand. This legislation will permit that.\n  In the final analysis, if you are a Senator who has guts enough to \nput a hold on a bill, you ought to have guts enough to let us know who \nyou are. I hope that from now on the word ``secret'' is never anything \nthat is used in the Senate except on things dealing with privacy or \nnational security. Beyond that, the other 99.5 percent of the Senate's \nbusiness ought to be totally open to the public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues Senators Grassley \nand Wyden for wanting to solve a problem. I appreciate them being \nwilling to put some solutions forth.\n  I think it is important that we talk about the bigger picture when we \ntalk about secret holds. I want to make it clear that I am not \ninterested in holding anything in secret. As a matter of fact, whenever \nwe do it as part of Steering, we let the cloakroom know we are holding \na bill.\n  I think it is important that America knows what we are talking about \nhere. At this point in the Senate, 94 percent of all of the bills are \npassed by unanimous consent. So this is hardly a lack of productivity. \nWhat this means is that 94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate \nhave no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no \nonline disclosure and, very often, no score from the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  When I first took over the Steering Committee, one of the things I \nlearned quickly is that whenever we are having a break--if we are going \nfor a week, such as we are after this week--on my way to the airport I \nwould get a call from staff telling me there were dozens of requests to \npass bills by unanimous consent. They knew we were going out of town. A \nlot of them had pretty big pricetags on them. You don't get $13 \ntrillion in debt when you are doing things right. Part of the problem \nis that 94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate pass in secret. \nThe problem is not secret holds; it is the secret passing of bills, \nwhen often we don't even know who is requesting passage. If we didn't \nhave staff available at night when they run their so-called hotlines--\nwhich means the phone in your office rings and they ask if you will \nagree to pass a bill, and you have not read it and you don't know what \nit costs, but if you don't agree to pass it by unanimous consent, you \nare holding the bill.\n\n  If you ask to read it for a day or so, it is likely that some \nassociation is getting e-mails from either the Republican or Democrat \nside saying that Senator DeMint is holding this desperately needed \npiece of legislation, which nobody else has read.\n  I would be glad to work with my colleagues on dealing with this issue \nif they believe secret holds are a problem. I think that passing 94 \npercent of the bills without anybody reading them or knowing they are \nbeing passed is not a good way to do business. I think it is fair to \nhave some system where, first, you cannot secretly ask for a bill to be \npassed by unanimous consent. That is what goes on today.\n  We should look at the Coburn-McCaskill measure where, if you want \nsomething passed by unanimous consent in the dark of night, you have to \nput it on the Internet for at least 3 days, with a cost from the \nCongressional Budget Office, so that we know what we are getting into.\n  Again, I remind you that we don't have a problem in Washington of not\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\npassing enough bills or spending enough money. The problem we have is \nwe are passing bills that we don't even read that have pricetags that \nare running our country into a crushing debt. Again, I want to work \nwith my colleagues. But if you are opposed to secret holds, which are \nreally not a problem--and I am not aware of one where we don't know who \nis holding it. I have a problem with people asking that bills be passed \nin secret, and that 94 percent of the bills in this place get passed \nthat way.\n  There are a lot of pressing issues we face as a country, but one of \nthem is not secret holds. If we want to spend floor time debating it, I \nwant to be involved with that debate. We have no problem here with \nthings that are being slowed down. The problem we have is that every \nweek--like this week--we are adding to our spending and borrowing more \nmoney as a country, increasing our national debt, and we are expanding \nthe Federal Government. This is not something we need to speed up. We \nneed Members of the Senate to read bills. We don't need to be talking \nabout holding a bill when someone innocently asks to read a bill and to \nlet you know tomorrow.\n  Let's work on this. If you want bills to go through quickly, let's \nget rid of the secret passing of bills that have never been on the \nInternet or seen the light of day. This is something where I know my \ncolleagues are well intended, but the real problem is the secret bills \nand Members secretly asking to pass them. I will be glad to let you \nknow I am holding them.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question, without losing his \nright to the floor?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I will in a moment.\n  I will ask this: Could we include in your legislation the idea that \nwhenever somebody wants to pass a bill by unanimous consent, they have \nto come to the floor and say: I, Senator Jim DeMint, want to pass this \nbill, a bill I have not read, which has not been online for 3 days, \nwhich has no score from the CBO, and I desire to pass this bill with no \ndebate and no rollcall vote? If we would do that as individuals, I will \nbe glad to give up my right to any secret hold.\n  I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think the Senator and I are making some \nprogress because I was about to pose almost the same question to my \ncolleague.\n  I believe the Senator from South Carolina is talking about the \nCoburn-McCaskill proposal To make sure Senators have actually read \nlegislation. I have already indicated to Senators Coburn and McCaskill \nthat I am interested in being a cosponsor of this legislation. I think \nit is a constructive idea.\n  In effect, we are asking each other the same questions. I think the \nmeasure the Senator from South Carolina is talking about, the Coburn-\nMcCaskill measure, is an important one. I have indicated I will be a \ncosponsor.\n  By way of saving some time, would my colleague be willing now to let \nSenator Grassley and me advance our proposal to eliminate secret holds \ntoday, given the fact that we have gotten more than a decade's worth of \nwork, now that I have publicly acknowledged that I think the point the \nSenator from South Carolina has made, which is very much in line with \nthe Coburn-McCaskill measure, is a valid one? My hope would be that, \nafter putting more than a decade into this effort, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina would let us finally get a vote on this bipartisan \neffort to eliminate secret holds, with this public acknowledgment, at \nleast on my part, that I think the Senator's point is valid with \nrespect to Senators reading bills and I intend to be a cosponsor of the \nCoburn-McCaskill legislation.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for being willing to \nwork with colleagues. It is unfortunate that he has spent a decade on \nthis bill and missed the main point. The main problem is secret bills, \nnot secret holds. But if the Senator is willing to modify his amendment \nwith the Coburn-McCaskill language and if it includes revealing who is \ntrying to pass the bill, along with putting it online with a \nCongressional Budget Office score, I will be glad to support the \nSenator's efforts for this amendment. But I will not support the \nadoption of his amendment a la carte without the language being \nmodified to include the Coburn-McCaskill language and the revealing of \nwhoever is asking that bill be passed.\n  Again, I will enjoy working with my colleagues if this is important \nto them to get this amendment adopted. Again, I think there are \ncertainly more pressing issues, but I am not interested in holding \nanything secretly. If the Senator will work with us on modifying his \nlanguage, I think we can get this adopted and maybe even by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield again without giving \nup his right to the floor?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. WYDEN. My understanding from the sponsors--Senators Coburn and \nMcCaskill is they are not yet ready. In other words, we have been \ntalking with them. I have already indicated to Senator Coburn that I \nwould be a cosponsor of his proposal. We now have what amounts to not \njust a private acknowledgment that the point of the Senator from South \nCarolina is valid but a public one on the floor of the Senate.\n  I say to my colleague, my understanding from the sponsors is that \nthey are not yet ready to bring this before the Senate, and that is why \nI am hopeful that--given the acknowledgment that the Senator from South \nCarolina has a valid point with respect to making sure bills are \nactually read, my hope would be that the Senator from South Carolina \nwould let Senator Grassley and me go forward, finally have that vote, \ngiven the fact we have spent more than a decade laying the groundwork, \nand that we could at least make some progress today in the Senate.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I think if we waited \na decade for this amendment, we can spend another day or two to get it \nright. If the Senator is certainly supportive of their language, I know \ntheir legislative staff well enough that we can get this incorporated \nwith the language of the Senator from Oregon probably in a few hours \nand get this amendment done. I will be happy to help with that effort.\n  I thank the Senator for his interest in cooperating. I thank the \nPresiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withdraw his request?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I find myself agreeing with the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. I find myself agreeing--I am glad my colleague \nSenator Wyden also agrees. I raise this point, and I raise it for a \npoint of discussion and consideration, not to challenge the purpose of \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  It seems to me that if we all agree the Wyden-Grassley amendment is a \ngood approach and at least Senator Wyden and I and Senator McCaskill \nand Senator Coburn and Senator DeMint believe the McCaskill-Coburn \nmeasure is a good measure, why would you want to hold up the Grassley-\nWyden amendment? Is there a feeling that maybe the McCaskill-Coburn \nmeasure cannot rise and fall on its own? Then I think you might leave \nthe impression that there is some subterfuge to see that the Wyden-\nGrassley bill does not get adopted.\n  Since there is a consensus on all these points, I think we ought to \nbe able to move forward in a separate way and not use one good idea to \nleverage another good idea because if they are both good ideas, they \ncan stand on their own. In the process, we do not have to then raise \nany questions about the legitimacy of the second idea, which would be \nthe McCaskill-Coburn idea on reading legislation and making sure we \nhave a score and making sure it is brought up in an environment where \nthere is not secrecy. Again, what I said about secrecy in this body, it \nshould only affect national security and people's personal privacy. \nEverything else ought to be the public's business. It is the public's \nbusiness, and it ought to be public.\n  I raise the point that each item ought to stand by itself and that \nthe five of us--and there are more than five of us, but at least on the \nWyden-Grassley amendment, there seem to be at\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\nleast three people in this body speaking this morning who think it \nought to move forward, and there are at least three in this body, plus \ntwo others who are not here, McCaskill and Coburn, who feel the other \nidea ought to move forward. We ought to move forward separately with \nthe help of everybody involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me speak very briefly on secret holds \nand then make a unanimous-consent request.\n  I express again my appreciation to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley. He very often seems too logical for some of these \ndebates. I very much share his view.\n  The point is, we do have a great deal of consensus. We have had three \nSenators, in effect, talking over the last 20 minutes with no \nsubstantive disagreement. The reality is, eliminating secret holds and \nshining some sunlight in the Senate on how we do business, it is ready \nto go. It has been ready to go now four times in the last 10 days.\n  I very much appreciate Senator Grassley's comments today. We ought to \nhave a vote on it. I have tried to show my good will, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa has this morning, in saying that we \nhappen to think Senators Coburn and McCaskill and Senator DeMint's \ncomments reflect this--have a very good idea as well. I have told them \nprivately and again I state publicly this morning that it is my intent \nto be a cosponsor of the legislation. It is not yet ready to go, which \nis, in effect, what Senator Grassley has touched on.\n  Efforts to reform the Senate and do our business in public when the \nAmerican people are as angry as they are at the way Washington, DC, \ndoes business--one ought to have, as Senator Grassley says, the guts to \ngo public when one is trying to object to a bill or nomination.\n  My thanks to Senator Grassley for our decade-long push--10 years-plus \nin trying to do it--and also for the very constructive way he has tried \nto reach out to colleagues on both sides of the aisle. That is what I \nhave tried to do again this morning with my comments to Senator DeMint.\n  I note that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is also in \nsupport of the effort to get rid of secret holds. I thank him for his \nindulgence and for giving us this opportunity to speak on the floor of \nthe Senate this morning.\n  Senator Grassley and I are going to come back again and again until \nthis secret hold, which is an indefensible violation of the public's \nright to know, is finally buried. I thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/25/senate-section/article/S4176-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3305\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to talk about the oilspill in \nthe gulf and the continuing challenges it presents to us. I know some \nof my colleagues are going to be joining me in a few moments to talk \nabout this. I will ask consent for a colloquy. But I am going to make a \nfew comments about it and then, in recognition of Senator Inhofe's need \nto move to another commitment, I will ask unanimous consent at that \ntime.\n  I want to make absolutely certain that big oil polluters pay for \noilspills and not the taxpayers--not small business owners, not States \nor the Federal Government, which means the Federal taxpayers.\n  We have seen things get worse on the spill over the weekend. \nUnfortunately, things are, frankly, getting much worse than we would \nhave imagined when we first introduced this legislation. Today the \nUnited States declared a fishing disaster in three gulf States--in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Louisiana's fishing industry alone \nis $2.4 billion of seafood and supplies up to 40 percent of all the \nU.S. seafood in our country. It is, in my mind, a growing and \ncontinuing environmental and economic disaster.\n  Tragically, it seems to me, a $10 billion cap--we originally thought, \nbased upon the Exxon Valdez experience, where there were close to $4 \nbillion in claims 20 years ago, that was a cap that may have been an \nappropriate one. But in fact it seems to me the only way to ensure that \noil companies are held accountable for all of their potential damages, \nfor the proposition that a polluter pays at the end of the day, is to \nagree with the administration's statement and to raise from a cap of \n$75 million to an unlimited cap. I will be asking that in my unanimous \nconsent motion in a few minutes.\n  We heard already the objections to our legislation. We have even \nheard some claim that it is ``un-American'' to hold a multibillion \ndollar corporation accountable for the very disaster it caused. It \nboggles my mind, at least as one Senator, that there are those who \nbelieve that holding BP accountable for the disaster they created in \nthe gulf is un-American.\n  This is a chance to show if we stand with big oil companies or with \nsmall businesses, with fisheries, with coastal communities, with \ntourism, with hotels--with all of those individuals, fellow Americans \nwho are being hurt by this disaster. It is an opportunity to say do we \nstand with the American taxpayer or with corporate shareholders.\n  It seems to me the choice is pretty clear. Miles of coastline have \nalready been affected. Environmentally sensitive wetlands are \nincreasingly being under threat. We have seen that, despite the fact \nthat the rig was ``state of the art,'' it obviously was not too safe to \nfail.\n  Now the damage to the environment, to the economy of the gulf, to the \nfishermen, to the small businesses, to the Nation is mounting. I hope \nmy colleagues are ready to act, especially when we have the statements \nof BP, that have been reiterated, that they are going to subject \nthemselves--even though there is a legal cap of $75 million--not for \nthe cleanup, not for all the efforts that are underway--yes, that \nclearly is their responsibility--but a legal cap of $75 million for all \nof the liability, for all of those coastal communities and fishermen \nand seafood fishermen, shrimp fishermen, and commercial seafood \nprocessing plants, tourism, and a whole host of other elements that may \nbe affected, that they be limited to $75 million--less than 1 day of \nBP's profit. BP was making at the rate of $94 million a day. Seventy-\nfive million dollars would be less than 1 day of BP's profits.\n  If they say they are going to be responsible--and any companies \nsimilarly situated should be fully responsible, accountable and subject \nto that liability--what is the objection to raising the cap?\n  I hope everyone in the Chamber will do the right thing to hold big \noil accountable for the damages they caused. Damages are mounting. They \nstill have not stopped the leak. While BP says they will pay all \n``legitimate claims,'' their word is not legally binding. As a matter \nof fact, when they were before the Energy Committee, colleagues of mine \nasked them, clearly, questions and they began to equivocate as to what \nis a legitimate claim.\n  Today I asked the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, \nwho was before the Energy Committee, is there a consent agreement \nbetween the government and BP, that holds them--legally binding--to the \nproposition that they will be subject to all the liabilities they have \ncaused? And the answer was no. There is some letter, but even that \nletter is rather amorphous.\n  When I hear they are equivocating before the committee, and when I \nsee the experience we already had with Exxon--that made all similar \ntypes of statements and then litigated for 20 years--it seems to me \nthis clearly raises concerns that they will try to find a convenient \nloophole, a convenient way out once the public relations nightmare is \nover, a way to say no, as many of my colleagues seem to want to say no \nand stand on the side of big oil companies and stand in the way of \nlegislation that would raise the liability\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\ncaps to ensure that big oil polluters pay for the damage they caused.\n  I see, by example, one company, BP, made nearly $6 billion in \nprofits--not proceeds, profits--in 3 months of this year; when the top \n5 oil companies made nearly $25 billion in profits--not proceeds, \nprofits--in 3 months, and that somehow we are worried about them even \nwhen they caused the type of potentially enormous consequences that BP \nhas actually caused in this case, and we are not worried about those \ncommunities, our taxpayers, and our fragile ecosystem. It is a failure \nthat now threatens the entire gulf coast. It could go all the way to \nthe Florida Keys.\n  I appreciate the administration earlier today embraced the idea of \nunlimited liability. I commend them for that. I want to make sure BP \nends up committing to pay for this disaster, not by their words but by \na legal obligation to do so, and that is what we can create today. \nThere should be no legal wiggle room for oil companies that devastate \ncoastal businesses and communities now or in the future.\n  In view of that goal, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee be discharged of S. 3305, the \nBig Oil Bailout Prevention Unlimited Liability Act of 2010, that the \nSenate proceed to its consideration, that the only amendment in order \nbe the substitute amendment that is at the desk, that the substitute \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, first let me say I agree \nwith most of what the Senator from New Jersey is saying. He mentioned \nthe profits of the top five oil companies--Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, \nExxonMobil, and Chevron. They are the giants.\n  If we will recall, last week when I objected to the arbitrary figure, \nthe cap of $10 billion, it was because it was arbitrary. I quoted a lot \nof people in the administration saying we do not want to have--it \nshould not be an arbitrary cap. One of the complaints I had was, if you \ndo have an arbitrary cap and that was at $10 billion, that would mean \nonly the big five plus the national oil companies--Venezuela, China, \ncertainly--would be in a position to do this work offshore.\n  It is my feeling if you take the $10 billion off and make it totally \nunlimited, that could very well shut out even the five and leave \nnothing but national oil companies in a position to be doing it.\n  I believe we should increase the cap. I know there is unanimity in \nthat notion. We have to do it. The Secretary of Interior said this \nabout the $10 billion cap:\n\n       [I]t is important that we be thoughtful relative to that, \n     what that cap will be, because you don't want only the BP's \n     of the world essentially to be the ones that are involved in \n     these efforts.\n\n  I agree with 90 percent of what the Senator says, and with the \nSecretary of Interior, what he has said about this--that we need to \ndetermine how high that cap should be. It should be much higher. We \nhave plenty of time to do that. Let me emphasize there is no cap in \nterms of the cleanup damages. We are only talking about economic \ndamages here. There is no cap on cleanup damages. I think there should \nbe. At some point we have to arrive at a cap. A lot of people are \nworking on it. The administration is working on it, the Department of \nInterior is working on it, and we are working on it. I think we need to \nincrease that. For that reason we need to have the time to get that \ndone, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, first, I am disappointed because I \nappreciate what the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma said, but the \nreality is, the administration has been thoughtful. They have thought \nabout it. Today they announced, as well as was verified by the \nAssistant Attorney General at a hearing, that it is their view that in \nfact there should be an unlimited cap. So they have not equivocated \nabout an amount. They have now said it should be an unlimited cap; \nunlimited, just as BP has suggested that they are going to accept \nunlimited responsibility for the liability they have created as a \nresult of the spill in the gulf.\n  I have difficulties understanding, when we begin to talk about \nsizes--that if you are smaller but conduct yourself with the same \npotential risky consequences that end up polluting the gulf or anyplace \nelse as it is being polluted right now--that simply because you are \nsmaller but you take the same risks that you should have less \nliability, which means that then all of us as taxpayers--and I know a \nlot of people here do not want to see the Federal Government more \ninvolved. They want to see the Federal Government less involved until \nthey need the Federal Government and then they come clamoring to this \nChamber for money.\n  It seems to me if these companies--and the Senator only mentioned the \ntop five, but there are more that have good profits, but certainly the \ntop five. If they made $25 billion in 3 months, why in God's name \nshould I give them any of the taxpayers' money when they mess up, when \nthey pollute?\n  What Representative of what State is going to come here and say give \nus money because, by the way, we were harmed in this way or that way or \nthe other when in fact they are unwilling to hold the oil companies \nresponsible--with record profits? It is not acceptable.\n  If we say if you are not one of the big 5 but we are worried about \nthe next 10--they may be smaller but some of these entities that get \nreferred to as independents--you know, there is one that actually owns \na 25-percent stake in the well that is spilling in the gulf. They are \nvalued at $40 billion. I don't think for the average American that is a \nmom-or-pop.\n  The reality is, regardless of the size, the fundamental public policy \nquestion, if you take an activity that is risky, shouldn't you be \nresponsible for the consequences of your risky activity or do we shift \nthe responsibility to the general public and the taxpayer?\n  It is like what we just went through in the Wall Street debate. So \nwhen they hit it big on the oil well and everything goes well, they \nkeep the money. But when something goes wrong, the rest of us pay for \nthe consequences. I do not think the American taxpayers want to see \nthat. That is not what they have in mind as being responsive to their \ninterests.\n  So I know my colleague from New Jersey wanted to enter into a \ncolloquy with me. I would be happy to yield to him now.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend and colleague from New Jersey. When \nwe hear the objection, as we have heard it, we have now three times \noffered legislation to lift the $75 million liability cap for oil \ncompanies, and I have to shake my head as I hear what is being said. \nThe land that is drilled on is Federal land. It is land that everybody \nowns. It is our land. It is not their land. If you come into my yard \nand destroy my house, you pay for it because it is not the person who \ndid the damage who owns it.\n  It is shocking when I hear things such as ``arbitrary test''--\narbitrary. Whatever damage is caused ought to be paid for, very simply. \nSo we on this side, our side of the aisle, are united that we need to \ndo away with this cap. The liability is extensive. It ought to be paid \nfor, especially by people who can afford to pay.\n  When you think about it, these companies have to be reminded they are \nnot selling lawnmowers; they are extracting oil from our property. They \nare making billions and billions of dollars on it, almost shamefully. I \nlook at it and I remember that one time there was an excess profits tax \nin America. It was during World War II. It said companies that profited \nas a result of the war, as a result of the crisis, had to pay an extra \ntax on the profits they made. That is what we ought to be doing now. \nThese profits they make and the damage they create are an \nunconscionable twosome.\n  So those on the other side object each time we try to do something \nthat enables our country, the people, to recover the damage that was \nput upon\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nthem by either careless or reckless behavior by three companies united: \nBP, Transocean, Halliburton.\n  So there is no doubt about it. Shamelessly, they want to stick with \nbig oil while people across the country suffer from either damage or \ncosts that are moved over to them. Evidence continues to mount that big \noil cannot be trusted. BP's CEO said this spill is not very serious, a \nvery tiny amount, and the environmental impact would be very modest. He \nsaid it publicly.\n  Well, they want to downplay the damage, but they cannot hold it. They \ncannot make the public believe, they cannot make those who are \nresponsible for the measurement believe it. They do not want to pay the \nfull cost even though they are responsible for the full damage.\n  Transocean--it is amazing--tried to go to court citing an 1851 \nmaritime law to limit their liability. At the same time, we face \nbillions in monetary damages, far more than the Exxon Valdez spill, and \ndamage to industry is growing as tourism suffers. Twenty-two percent of \ngulf fisheries have been closed. Those responsible for messing it up \nmust be responsible fully for cleaning up--just like families do, just \nlike neighborhoods do, just like communities do.\n  With billions and billions of profits, we know big oil can afford to \nbail itself out, and they ought to pay for it, period. So we are \nstanding here once again asking our Republican colleagues a simple \nquestion: Whose side are you on? I think it is pretty evident. They are \non the side of big oil while we stand up for ordinary Americans trying \nto eke out a living in these very difficult times.\n  I hope there will be a reconsideration, and they will agree those who \ndo the damage ought to pay for the damage they created.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate my distinguished colleague from New Jersey \nwho has been a stalwart on this issue, as well as in the past, on the \nwhole question of the environment. The Senator is a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I appreciate his comments.\n  I know the Senator from Florida wanted to join us in a colloquy, as \nwell as the Senator from Illinois. So let me ask unanimous consent to \ncontinue the colloquy with first Senator Nelson, then Senator Durbin, \nand then I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Let me ask the Chair if, as I have the floor, if I \nyield to a colleague for a question, is that not permissible?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is permissible to yield for a question.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield to my colleague from Florida \nfor a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If I may ask the Senator from New Jersey a \nquestion, can the Senator believe once we got up the live feed, 5,000 \nfeet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, that once experts, \nspecialists, professors, were able to see what, in fact, had been told \nto us was only 1,000 barrels a day, was revised to 5,000; that many \nexperts in the country revised upwards, that it may be up as much as \nten times as much as 5,000 barrels a day?\n  Would the Senator acknowledge that those statements have been made?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I not only acknowledge that those statements have been \nmade, but I know the Senator and others, including myself, have raised \nthe fact that BP's credibility in this respect is not credible. In \nfact, scientists have gone into the gulf and made the determination \nthat at the rate that spill is taking place, it is far beyond what BP \ntold us. As a matter of fact, we have an interest in this regard not \nonly, of course, because of the environmental consequences but also \nbecause of the royalties we should be claiming on all of that oil that \nis being let out.\n  So the Senator is correct. This is one of the issues we are facing.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator would yield for a further \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, my question additionally to \nthe Senator from New Jersey would be, given the fact of the pictures we \nnow see of the devastation occurring in some of the marshlands in \nLouisiana, along with the shots of the few beaches that are now covered \nand the effect upon the wildlife, as well as the marine life--would the \nSenator say there is a great deal of concern among people all along the \ngulf coast, as well as the eastern seaboard of the United States, of \nwhat possibilities there are if there is that much oil in the gulf and \nwhat that could do to the economies of these coastal communities?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, I appreciate the Senator's question. The Senator \nhimself has at various times informed this body of something that he \nhas referred to as the loop current, which is, in essence, a natural \ncurrent that could very well take the oilspill from the region of the \ngulf and move it along the Senator's State in Florida and beyond.\n  This is an enormous concern. Already, as I said earlier, the U.S. \nGovernment has banned fishing products from three States, and the \nconsequences of that just in one dimension in terms of the seafood that \npart of the country generates for us domestically, both in terms of the \nbillions of dollars as well as the consumption of seafood is now one \nthat has been barred by the U.S. Government.\n  So we are increasingly seeing the consequences of this damage. There \nis real concern this could move in a direction that would be \nconsequential to other States as well.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. One final question, Madam President, if I \nmay----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. To the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Can the Senator from New Jersey believe the fact that we hear people \nbeing apologist for BP? It is clear we hope and pray this ``kill'' of \nthe well that is going to be attempted in the morning is going to be \nsuccessful. But on all the safety devices that did not work--and why \nwas the well not attempted to be killed 5 weeks ago? Yet would the \nSenator believe there are people out there who are actually being an \napologist for BP with the threat to the economy of the Southeastern \nUnited States as it is now?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, I appreciate the Senator's question and his \nconcern. I think it is the concern of many. The reality is, I have \nheard comments that to hold BP accountable is un-American. Well, I \nthink it is un-American to allow BP to go ahead, pollute the natural \nresources of the United States and not be held accountable in an \nunlimited fashion, which is the administration's position because they \nhave created enormous consequences which we have yet to fully \nunderstand--we have yet to fully understand.\n  I know the Senator from Illinois was just on a trip to the gulf.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield for a question.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask a question of the Senator from New \nJersey through the Chair. I know the Senator from New Jersey has been a \nleader on the whole question of liability and the damages that should \nbe paid by BP for what they have done as a result of this Deepwater \nHorizon rig blowing up, 11 innocent people killed. We should always \nremember that as the first casualty and now the ongoing damage.\n  I would ask the Senator from New Jersey, having just gone to the Gulf \nof Mexico yesterday with five of our Senate colleagues on a bipartisan \ntrip--the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar; Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, Janet Napolitano--is it not true that in the first 3 months \nof this year, British Petroleum reported profits of $5\\1/2\\ billion, up \n135 percent over the first quarter of last year?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes. British Petroleum made about $5.6 billion in the \nfirst 3 months in profits--not proceeds, profits. Right now the \nliability cap that exists under the law is $75 million, 1 day of BP's \nprofits, based on the first quarter's $94 million. So it is less than 1 \nday's profit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can ask another question through the chair of the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yesterday, during the course of this visit to Louisiana, \nthere was a very compelling moment when we met with those oystermen and \nfishermen and shrimpers and charter boat proprietors who were directly \naffected by the BP oilspill.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from New Jersey if he would comment \nor reflect on the following: There are approximately 20,000 shrimpers, \ncrab and oyster fishermen in Louisiana alone. If the $75 million in \ndamages were dedicated only to those seafood industry workers in that \none State, it would equate to roughly $3,500 per person.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from New Jersey, can there be any \njustice in that outcome; that BP would be limited in the amount they \nwould pay out, the $75 million, when we look at the fact that there are \nthose in similar professions in Alabama, in Mississippi, in Florida, \nand other States who are not even included in this calculation, if such \na small amount was all that was paid to those who have clearly been \ndirectly damaged by this spill?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, the Senator's question is well put. Justice could \nnot be achieved under the present cap. As a matter of fact, as I said \nearlier, today the United States declared a fishing disaster in three \nGulf States: Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Louisiana itself has \na $2.4 billion seafood industry, and it supplies up to 40 percent of \nall of the U.S. seafood.\n  Clearly, just that figure alone gives us a sense that all of those \nindividuals and communities and entities would not receive justice.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My last question to the Senator from New Jersey: How much \nshould the taxpayers of America pay for the negligence and wrongdoing \nof British Petroleum, this multibillion-dollar corporation?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Absolutely nothing. The only way to ensure the U.S. \ntaxpayer pays absolutely nothing, not just for the cleanup but in terms \nof consequences to communities that would exceed the liability cap that \nexists right now under the law and for which BP has made statements but \nno commitment, such as a consent agreement, which would be binding upon \nBP--the taxpayers should pay absolutely nothing--the way to do that is \nto raise it to an unlimited cap.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the parliamentary situation at the moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Wyden amendment \nNo. 4183.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand the Senator from Louisiana wants to speak \nand then the Senator from Wisconsin. I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the Senator from Louisiana, following the Senator from \nWisconsin, that I be put in line to speak for purposes of offering an \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I ask \nmy colleague from New Jersey, was the floor relinquished?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey relinquished the \nfloor.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous-consent request of the Senator \nfrom Arizona?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, I would propound a slight \nmodification and ask to be recognized for purposes of offering an \namendment following the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, I do not believe I will \nobject, if there is a unanimous-consent request pending, any of the \nMembers who are going to speak in the following order, as the Senator \nfrom Arizona suggested, it would be appropriate then to be recognized \nto object, would it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could the Senator restate his question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The Senator has propounded a series of Members to speak \nor offer amendments. If one of those Members offers a unanimous-consent \nrequest during their presentation, then there would be an opportunity \nto object notwithstanding the unanimous-consent request before us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I want to clarify, Senator \nInouye just left the floor and said he would return shortly. Before we \nset aside any pending amendment, I would like to have his assent to \nthat happening. If the Senator from Arizona would like to ask for \nrecognition and each of the Members to speak to their amendments, I \nhave no objection. But if that includes setting aside the pending \namendment and filing a new amendment, I would like to have Senator \nInouye on the floor before that decision is made.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I amend my unanimous-consent request that the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, followed by the Senator from Wisconsin, followed by me, \nfollowed by the Senator from Texas, all to speak, and if the Senator \nfrom Hawaii agrees, for purposes of proposing amendments which requires \nsetting aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, they would be speaking for \ndebate only until Senator Inouye returns on the question of offering \namendments. Will the Senator accept that language?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, if the Senator from \nHawaii consents to having the pending business set aside so that one of \nthe speakers can offer an amendment, I assume that would be acceptable.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Then I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Arizona?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3410\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I am overjoyed that I have been let into \nthis discussion considering that heavy oil is now getting into \nLouisiana marshland and is impacting my State and the State of Senator \nLandrieu more than any other in the country. It is an ongoing crisis. I \nwould like to spend a few minutes to get us out of Washington politics \nand back into focus on that real and ongoing crisis. Those fishermen \nfrom south Louisiana Senator Durbin talked about, that is what they are \nfocused on, that is what they are dealing with. Their way of life and \ntheir livelihood is absolutely threatened. That is what I would like us \nto focus on and deal with in a constructive way.\n  I agree with Senator Menendez and Senator Lautenberg and others that \nthe liability cap for economic damages which was set decades ago is way \noutdated. I have offered a permanent change to that to go into the \nfuture. In fact, my bill would set a cap for BP in this instance of $20 \nbillion because it is based on the last four quarters of the \nresponsible party's profits. For this instance, that is double the \nliability cap of the Menendez original bill.\n  Talking about UCing a permanent change of the law is, quite frankly, \npolitics. That isn't going to pass the Senate by unanimous consent. I \nwould like my version to pass by unanimous consent. I think it is a \nbetter approach, with all due respect, than the approach of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey. It would double the cap on BP than his original \nversion would. But that is going to get objected to as well.\n  In light of that, I have what I think is a constructive alternative \nwhich is to propose something to address this ongoing crisis. Oil is \nstill flowing in the gulf, more and more heavy oil getting beyond the \nLouisiana barrier islands, infiltrating the Louisiana marsh. How about \ntrying to deal with this ongoing crisis that the people of Louisiana \nface?\n  With that in mind, I have introduced a liability proposal that is at \nthe desk, that has been introduced, that could and should garner \nunanimous consent support. Let me outline what it is.\n  Several of the speakers--Senators Durbin, Lautenberg, and others--\nalleged that somehow there are folks in this Chamber who are being \nshrills for BP, who are defending BP. Personally, I didn't hear that. \nCertainly, that is not me. I represent the State of Louisiana, and we \nare dealing with this ongoing crisis and disaster much more than any \nother State in the Union. But let's attack this directly and try to \naddress--and I think we could and should\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\nbe able to do it by unanimous consent--this particular event.\n  My bill, S. 3410, does that. My bill mandates that the cap on \neconomic damages for BP for this event be lifted and that there be no \ncap. BP has said publicly that not once, not twice, but on numerous \noccasions, and has even put it in writing that they will disregard any \ncap. My bill would say: Fine, that is a contract offer, and we are \ngoing to accept it. That will be binding under legislation, under the \nlaw. Under S. 3410, we would remove any cap on BP for this incident.\n  In addition, the other half of this bill establishes an expedited \nclaims process because in this ongoing crisis in Louisiana, where \npeople continue to hurt because of this ongoing spill, ongoing flow, \nthey not only need their claim eventually paid in full, they need it to \nbegin to be paid immediately. In this bill we establish an \nadministrator to quickly and fairly resolve claims for economic \ndamages. We establish an office of deepwater claims compensation to \nexpedite that consideration. We set up offices within the gulf region \nto allow that claimant assistance, to advise people how to properly \nfile their claim and expedite getting a claim. The other half of the \nbill, besides lifting the liability cap for economic damages on BP for \nthis incident, expedites that claim process.\n  With that in mind, in the spirit of actually trying to act with \nregard to this ongoing crisis in the gulf that certainly affects my \nState, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 3410, my acceptance of liability and expedited \nclaims bill; that the bill be read a third time and passed and that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question before the \nruling is made?\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I wanted to tell the Senator from Louisiana, because \nwe had an opportunity yesterday when we went to his home State, \ntraveled there with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, we saw the spill from the air. We were at Port \nFourchon. We heard the testimony from fishermen. We heard the testimony \nfrom those who are in the charter business. We heard testimony from the \noystermen. We heard from parish mayors and heard their concerns about \nwhat will happen to them, their futures, their economic futures and \nthat of their families. The concerns that were raised, of course, were \nthat they be fully and fairly compensated.\n  Is it the Senator's intention, then, that the statements that have \nbeen made by the executives from British Petroleum, the sworn \ntestimonies we have had in the Energy Committee, and I know they have \ntestified in other committees, that the commitments from British \nPetroleum would be codified as waivers of the liability caps which the \nSenators from New Jersey have talked about? Is it correct, then, that \nit is the intention of the Senator from Louisiana that these \ncommitments would then be made enforceable under law so that the heart \nof this debate is understandably about not whether BP will pay but how \nlong it will take for the victims to be compensated?\n  Mr. VITTER. That is absolutely my intention. That is what this bill \nwould do. Several Senators on the other side correctly pointed out that \nwe should not depend on the goodwill of BP. So let's not depend on the \ngoodwill of BP. Let's fix it here. Let's fix it now. BP has made this \noffer. They have even put it in writing. My bill would direct the \nSecretary of the Interior to accept that offer and codify this in the \nlaw so that with regard to BP and with regard to this ongoing crisis, \nthere is no cap on economic damages.\n  The second half of the bill would set up an expedited claims process \nto ensure that the folks hurting on the ground in Louisiana and perhaps \neventually elsewhere are helped in a timely way.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. If I may follow up with the Senator from Louisiana on \nthe expedited claims process, this is something we heard yesterday, the \nconcerns from those saying they don't believe the claims process is \ntransparent, is efficient, is easy enough. Are there the translators \nnecessary to help those, for instance, Vietnamese shrimpers? Do we have \nthe processes in place? If I understand the intention of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana with the expedited claims process, it is designed to not \nonly make it more transparent but make it more readily accessible in \nterms of multiple resource centers; also establishes an advisory \ncommittee that consists of representatives of claimants of the \nresponsible parties. We heard yesterday that people who have been \naffected want to know they are dealing with somebody in a position of \nauthority to answer their questions, address their concerns. We \nunderstand that within this advisory committee on Deepwater Horizon \ncompensation, these individuals will advise the administrator.\n  There are also other provisions that are designed to protect the \ninterests of the claimants, one of which I think is very important; \nthat is, that those who may have filed incomplete claims because they \nsimply were not aware of all the information that is needed, are \nnotified by the administrator and allow the administrator to conduct \nhearings in a manner that best determines the rights of the parties.\n  I think it is critically important that these processes be put in \nplace. I stand with my colleague from Louisiana in supporting this \neffort, this measure, and ensuring that through this, BP is held \ndirectly accountable, and to make sure there is an accelerated path to \nrecovery for the growing number of victims in the gulf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Louisiana wish to renew \nhis unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes. I renew my unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator came up with \na proposal. It is 40 pages. I just saw it. I look forward to reading it \nand seeing whether it truly achieves the goal we mutually have. We are \nmoving the ball forward because both the Senator from Louisiana and the \nSenator from Alaska, who I understood originally opposed lifting the \ncap to an unlimited amount, now both believe the cap, at least in this \ninstance, should be lifted to an unlimited amount.\n  But reading the last 2 pages of the proposal we just got, and \nlistening to the words of the Senator from Louisiana, there is a \nsuggestion here that BP has, in essence, made a commitment or a \ncontract, yet we have nothing before us other than testimony about a \nsupposed willingness to pay all legitimate claims. They have \nequivocated when they have been asked before the committee, What does \n``legitimate'' mean, and several members asked them a series of \ndifferent elements of ``legitimate,'' and they would not commit to \nthat.\n  Secondly, the letter the Senator has in his legislation that he wants \nto propound to pass right now says BP is ``prepared'' to pay above $75 \nmillion. It does not say it ``shall'' pay above $75 million. It does \nnot say ``will'' pay. There is no legal obligation for them to do it. \nSo to consume that and say that is the basis under which we are making \nsome contractual relationship is a problem.\n  Finally, I think there is a problem between having legislation on a \nspecific incident versus raising the cap in general. What happens when, \nGod forbid, the next oilspill comes and a company is not taking the \nsame position? It seems to me what we want to do is raise the cap in an \nunlimited fashion against any major oil company so we do not simply \nhave to listen to their allegations that they are willing to pay any \nclaims but that, in fact, they have a legal obligation to do so.\n  So for all these reasons, and the fact that we just got this \nlegislation, and because of the concerns that I do not think it reaches \nwhat we need to accomplish, I will have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reclaiming my time, I am obviously \ndisappointed. I think we are seeing that maybe there is a difference \nwhen your State is in the nexus of this and your State is under attack \nfrom this oil. I want to fix a problem, not just make a\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\nspeech. We are not going to pass by unanimous consent a permanent \nchange to the liability cap. I have a version that I think should pass, \nand I am going to keep fighting for it. Senator Menendez has a \ndifferent version, and I am sure he will keep doing the same. I think \nmine is superior, but we can have that debate.\n  But as oil continues to gush from this well, as heavy oil continues \nto get behind the barrier islands of Louisiana and starts to infiltrate \nour marsh--which is an ecosystem issue 100 times worse than simply \nhitting our barrier islands and beaches--I would actually like to solve \nthe problem and not just come here to the floor and give a speech. My \nbill does that by focusing on this event and this company, BP, in a way \nthat we should all be able to agree on.\n  I commend the details of the bill to my colleagues. It does not \ndepend on the language of any BP letter. It takes that as a starting \npoint, and it removes all caps on economic damages for this event for \nthis company. Why don't we do that by UC? We should be able to.\n  In addition, it fixes a real ongoing problem by establishing an \nexpedited claims process. That is necessary too. Because it is great to \ntell these fishermen that your full claim will be paid eventually in \nthe long run, but as the old saying goes: We are all dead in the long \nrun. And they are looking to their next month's boat payment, their \nnext month's house payment.\n  So I commend this serious legislation, which we should pass \nimmediately, to my colleagues. Let's solve a problem. It is an ongoing \nproblem. It is an ongoing crisis that sure as heck affects my State. \nLet's just not make a speech.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Wyden amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4204\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthat amendment for the purpose of calling up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sorry. I was hoping Senator Inouye would give consent to \nthis. As I said, I am filling in. He left the floor. If the Senator \ncould withhold offering his amendment until he comes back.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, if I can respond to the Senator from \nIllinois, I will make my remarks, but I spoke to the Senator from \nHawaii prior to this, and I believe there is no objection. If I could, \nI will proceed and then at the conclusion I will renew my request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object at this moment, but I hope we can work it out \nvery shortly.\n  I just received word from staff that Senator Inouye approves of the \nSenator offering his amendment, so I withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Then, Madam President, I renew my unanimous-consent \nrequest to set aside the pending amendment for the purpose of calling \nup an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is amendment No. 4204, which is at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Merkley, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4204.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a plan for the safe, orderly, and expeditious \n    redeployment of the United States Armed Forces from Afghanistan)\n\n       At the end of chapter 10 of title I, add the following:\n\n\n  plan for safe, orderly, and expeditious redeployment of the united \n                  states armed forces from afghanistan\n\n       Sec. 1019.  (a) Plan Required.--Not later than December 31, \n     2010, the President shall submit to Congress a report setting \n     forth a plan for the safe, orderly, and expeditious \n     redeployment of United States Armed Forces and non-Afghan \n     military contractors from Afghanistan, together with a \n     timetable for the completion of that redeployment and \n     information regarding variables that could alter that \n     timetable.\n       (b) Form.--The report required by subsection (a) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf \nof myself, Senator Boxer, Senator Durbin, and Senator Merkley, that \nwould require the President to provide a flexible timetable for the \nresponsible drawdown of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The amendment is \nbased on legislation I have introduced in the Senate, as I mentioned, \nwith Senator Boxer, and also that Representative McGovern and \nRepresentative Jones have introduced in the House.\n  Our amendment would require the President to be clear about his \ntimeframe in Afghanistan. The President has already indicated that his \nsurge strategy in Afghanistan is time limited and he will begin \nredeploying troops in July 2011. All we are asking is that the \nPresident provide further details about how long he intends to leave \nour troops in Afghanistan, and about what variables could lead him to \nchange his mind about this timetable.\n  Before I go on, I want to explain what my amendment does not do. It \ndoes not set a specific date for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. It does \nnot require the President to actually redeploy troops. And it does not \nplace any restrictions on funding.\n  Rather, it simply requires the President to provide a timeline for \nthe redeployment of U.S. troops. That timeline is not binding. In fact, \nthe amendment directs the President to identify, as I said, what \nvariables, if any, would warrant the alteration of that timeline. \nSecretary Clinton has already testified that she anticipates it will \ntake 3 to 5 years to transition control to Afghan security forces.\n  My bill would simply require the President to lay this out clearly \nand specifically, and to spell out what, if any, conditions would \nwarrant a longer U.S. military presence. It allows him to provide some \nof this information in a classified annex, if that is appropriate.\n  Congress needs information about expected troop levels in order to \nproperly plan and pay for the war and to avoid future unpaid-for \nsupplemental spending bills such as the one we are now considering. \nFrankly, I had hoped the days of budget-busting supplemental war \nspending bills were in the past. We have already spent hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on this war and hundreds of billions more on Iraq. \nAt a time of massive deficits, economic upheaval, and major domestic \nneeds going unfilled, that level of deficit spending is simply \nunsustainable.\n  In fairness, unlike his predecessor, President Obama has attempted to \nprovide realistic budget estimates for war costs in the current and \nnext fiscal years. But beyond fiscal year 2011, the President's budget \nnumbers are unrealistically low. It would likely cost the American \ntaxpayer $300 billion to $500 billion to conduct the President's \nstrategy over and above the $300 billion we have already spent in \nAfghanistan.\n  I have serious concerns about this strategy, and I would be more than \nhappy to discuss those concerns with my colleagues on the floor. It is \nabout time we had a real debate in the Senate about this war. But I \nhope even those who support the administration's surge agree it should \nbe paid for. We cannot continue to do what the last administration did \nand add this massive cost to the national credit card.\n  Al-Qaida's stated goal is to bankrupt the United States of America. \nIf we keep running up debt to pay for the war, al-Qaida may well \nachieve its goal. If Congress cannot provide the will to pay for this \nwar, then we need to seriously ask ourselves, How much longer can we \nkeep fighting it?\n  By requiring the administration to provide its exit strategy, we can \nalso help to provide our men and women in uniform with greater \ncertainty about their deployments. After almost a decade of war, our \nservicemembers deserve to know how much longer our military operations \nin Afghanistan are expected to continue and, frankly, so do the \nAmerican people.\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\n  We have many priorities and many pressing needs, both domestically \nand abroad. The American people deserve more information about the \nadministration's plans in Afghanistan so they can evaluate those plans \nand weigh them against other priorities, including and especially the \nneed to target growing al-Qaida affiliates around the world.\n  Moreover, a timetable will help make clear to our partners in \nAfghanistan that our support is not unconditional and that we will not \ncontinue to bear the burden of our current military deployment \nindefinitely. That is an important message that the current flawed \nAfghan leadership needs to hear.\n  While I am disappointed by his decision to expand our military \ninvolvement in Afghanistan, I commend the President for setting a start \ndate for redeployment, namely, July 2011. Our allies have stated that \nit has helped ``focus the minds'' of our partners in Afghanistan and \naround the world. Having a start date is essential, but alone it is \ninsufficient. It should be accompanied by an end date too.\n  The President should convey to the American and Afghan people how \nlong he anticipates it will take to complete his military objectives. \nSo long as our large-scale military presence remains open-ended, al-\nQaida will have a valuable recruiting tool and our partners in \nAfghanistan will have an incentive to take a back seat, leaving U.S. \ntroops and U.S. taxpayers on the hook.\n  Again, my amendment is not about whether one of us supports the \nPresident or the troops. All of us support the troops and hope and wish \nthe President has success in Afghanistan. But no matter how we feel \nabout the President or about his approach in Afghanistan, I hope we can \nagree on the need for an exit strategy, as we approach the 9-year \nanniversary of a war that is showing no signs of winding down.\n  As I said before, I, for one, have serious doubts about the \nadministration's approach. In light of our own domestic needs, rising \ncasualty rates in Afghanistan, and the emergence of al-Qaida safe \nhavens around the world, an expensive, troop-intensive, nation-building \ncampaign just does not add up for me. But my amendment does not dictate \na particular strategy for Afghanistan. All it does is require the \nPresident to inform Congress and the American people about how long his \nmilitary strategy is expected to take.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4214\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and call up amendment No. 4214. And I thank the \ndistinguished managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Kyl, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Cornyn, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4214.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for National Guard support to secure the southern \n                   land border of the United States)\n\n       At the end of chapter 3 of title I, add the following:\n\n\nnational guard support to secure the southern land border of the united \n                                 states\n\n       Sec. 309.  (a) Additional Amount.--For an additional amount \n     under this chapter for the deployment of not fewer than 6,000 \n     National Guard personnel to perform operations and missions \n     under section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code, in the \n     States along the southern land border of the United States \n     for the purposes of assisting U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection in securing such border, $250,000,000.\n       (b) Offsetting Rescission.--The unobligated balance of each \n     amount appropriated or made available under the American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) \n     (other than under title X of division A of such Act) is \n     rescinded pro rata such that the aggregate amount of such \n     rescissions equals $250,000,000 in order to offset the amount \n     appropriated by subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the amendment would fund the immediate \ndeployment of 6,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to \nprovide additional security since the situation on the border has \ngreatly deteriorated during the last 18 months. The National Guard \ntroops would remain on the border until the Secretary of Defense, in \nconsultation with the Governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and \nTexas, determines that the Federal Government has achieved \n``operational control'' of the border.\n  Since I put this amendment together, we have been informed that the \nPresident will be asking for an additional $500 million to support \nborder security and up to 1,200 National Guard to be sent to the \nborder. I appreciate that. I think it is a recognition of the violence \non the border which has been really beyond description in some \nrespects, particularly on the Mexico side.\n  I appreciate the additional 1,200 Guard being sent, as well as an \nadditional $500 million, but it is simply not enough. We need 6,000. We \nneed 3,000 across the border and an additional 3,000 National Guard \ntroops on the Arizona-Mexico border. I say that because of my many \nvisits to the border, my conversations with the Border Patrol, and the \ntime it will take to train an additional 3,000 troops just for the \nArizona-Mexico border.\n  I have colleagues waiting with other amendments, but I hope my \ncolleagues appreciate the extent of the violence on the Mexican border \nand the dramatic increase in that violence that has taken place over \nthe last several years. There was a time not that long ago that someone \nwho wanted to come across our border illegally could do so if they were \nfortunate and would come across by themselves. That is no longer \npossible. We now have highly organized human smuggling rings and drug \ncartels that are working together. They are using the same routes, and \nunfortunately the so-called central corridor, the Arizona-Mexico \nborder, has been where a great degree of violence and certainly a \npreponderance or a majority of human smuggling and drug smuggling has \ntaken place.\n  I would refer two numbers to my colleagues. Last year, in the Tucson \nsector of the Arizona-Mexico border, there were over 1.2 million pounds \nof marijuana intercepted on that border, to the point where I was told \nthat the U.S. attorney didn't prosecute anything less than 500 pounds \nof marijuana intercepted. One other number: Last year on the Tucson \nsector of the Arizona-Mexico border, 241,000 illegal immigrants were \napprehended trying to cross the Mexico-Arizona border. If you figure we \ncatch one out of four, one out of five illegal immigrants who are \ncoming across, that is about a million people, a million illegal \nimmigrants coming across the Tucson sector, destroying people's \nproperty, destroying our wildlife refuges, and causing an environment \nof total insecurity amongst the citizens who live in the southern part \nof my State.\n  I understand the controversy associated with the legislation that was \npassed by the Arizona Legislature and signed by the Governor. By the \nway, that legislation is less severe than Federal law--certainly \nnothing like the Mexican law regarding treatment of illegal \nimmigrants--and it has been badly mischaracterized by administration \nofficials who have admitted they haven't even read the bill. But the \nimportant aspect here is that I support that legislation because the \nArizona Governor and Legislature acted in frustration because of the \nFederal Government's failure to carry out its responsibilities to \nsecure our border.\n  Again, 1.2 million pounds of marijuana, 241,000 illegal immigrants, \nand then the situation is compounded by the incredible violence--22,000 \nMexican citizens have been murdered on the Mexican side of the border \nin the last 3 years in the struggle between the Mexican Government and \nthe drug cartels. It was predicted by many of us, as we saw this \nviolence increase, that sooner or later it was going to spill over the \nborder or affect American citizens. Three American citizens were killed \non the Mexican side of the border as they made their way home to the \nUnited States. In March, a third-generation Arizona rancher was found \ndead on his property near the Mexican border, reportedly shot by a \nsuspect who may have illegally entered our country. So the point is, \nthis violence is at such a level that it makes a compelling argument \nfor us to secure our border.\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\n  I understand the liberal media and the mainstream media who have \ntalked about our situation in Arizona. Most of them have never been \nwithin about 100 miles of the border. But the point is that the \ncitizens in my State deserve the right to live a secure existence--not \nto be threatened, not to have their property overrun, not to have their \nhomes broken into. A mother came to me at a townhall meeting and said: \nI am afraid to drop my children off at the school bus stop.\n  This violence on the border is unspeakable. It is one of the least \nreported aspects of this whole issue, and I still am puzzled as to why. \nPeople are beheaded and their bodies hung at the overpass in Tijuana. A \nwedding took place not long ago, and the drug people came in and took \nthe groom, his brother, and a nephew, and their bodies were found a few \nhours later. A young man who was part of the capture of one of these \ndrug lords was lionized by the Mexican Government, and his whole family \nwas murdered. This is a degree of brutality that threatens the very \nexistence of the Mexican Government.\n  I am proud we are working with the Mexican Government. I hope all of \nour colleagues understand we have spent over $1 billion. The corruption \nlevel that exists in Mexico today reaches to the highest levels of \ngovernment. So really the only institution the government can rely on \nis the army.\n  When we send the Guard to the border, we are told the presence of the \nGuard has an effect on these drug cartels. By the way, the drug cartels \nare watching everything on the border. They have the most sophisticated \ncommunications. They have sophisticated intelligence capability, and \nthey are very efficient in their organization. So the Guard troops on \nthe border in the past have had a very salutary effect. That is why we \nneed 6,000 of them until such time as we can train additional Border \nPatrol and customs people to address this issue.\n  So I wish to emphasize to my colleagues that we should not forget, to \nstart with, that it is the United States of America that is creating \nthe demand for these drugs, and at some point we have to address that \nissue too. But in the meantime, this violence that is taking place in \nMexico on the Mexican side of the border, which has spilled over on our \nside, can only get worse until these drug cartels are brought under \ncontrol and the human smugglers are brought under control, and that \nwill only take place when our border is secure.\n  We can secure the border. The Yuma sector, as my colleague from \nArizona has pointed out, has taken measures, including incarceration of \nillegal immigrants, including increased fencing and surveillance. By \nthe way, UAVs are a very important part of this equation. So we have \nbeen able to drastically reduce the illegal activity, both drug and \nhuman smuggling, in the Yuma sector of the border. My colleague from \nTexas will testify that in, I believe it is the McAllen sector of \nTexas, there has been significant and dramatic improvement. In San \nDiego, there is dramatic improvement. So those who feel we can't secure \nour border, there are great examples of our ability to do so with \npeople, with fences, and with technology. We can do these things.\n  We have to get an additional 6,000 troops to the border before there \nare more tragedies such as happened with Rob Prince, the rancher from \nArizona, or the deputy all the way up in Pinal County, some 50 miles \nfrom the border, who was shot in the stomach, in pursuit of one of \nthese drug people, with an AK-47.\n  So I urge my colleagues and I urge all Americans to understand that \nwe in Arizona didn't want to have this law passed by the legislature. \nIt was done out of frustration because of the Federal Government's \nfailure to exercise its responsibility. It is a Federal responsibility, \nsomething that the Secretary of Homeland Security emphasized in a \nletter, when she was Governor of the State of Arizona, on March 11, \n2008. It says: Clearly, Operation Jump Start has been highly \neffective--on and on about how important the help in insuring the \nborder and bringing the Guard to the border has been. That is true \ntoday.\n  So the Arizona Legislature and Governor did not wish to pass this \nlegislation. It was enacted because the people of Arizona had an \ninsecure border and live, in many cases, in an insecure environment. An \nobligation we have to all of our citizens is to allow them to live in a \nsecure environment.\n  By the way, this law the Arizona Legislature passed is far less \nsevere in many respects than the Federal law and certainly far \ndifferent from the law in Mexico, which is very stringent in its \nprovisions and penalties for illegal immigration.\n  So we need relief in our State. We need relief in many places across \nthe border. The drug cartels have to be stopped. Working with Mexico, I \nbelieve we can, over time, bring the border under control and rid the \nscourge of these drug cartels and these human smugglers.\n  Let me finally say, because I know my colleagues are waiting, that \nthe treatment of human beings by these coyotes, these human smugglers, \nis atrocious, unspeakable. They take them and they pack them into--\nwell, the other day, a U-Haul rental truck was apprehended. Sixty-seven \nhuman beings were packed inside. They take them to these drop houses. \nThey hold them for ransom, and then after they are ransomed, sometimes \nthey mistreat them even further. The human rights abuses that are \ntaking place in these human smuggling rings is atrocious beyond \ndescription. That alone should compel us to get our borders secure and \nto provide for a legal system of immigration into our country.\n  We welcome immigrants. We welcome our Hispanic heritage. We cherish \nit. Spanish was spoken in our State of Arizona before English. But we \nhave to get the human smuggling and drug cartels under control because \nthe security of our citizens and our Nation depends on it. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, I believe with \nthe approval of the bill managers, to call up my amendment No. 4202, as \nmodified, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, I have not seen this \namendment and I am not familiar with what it would do, so for the \nmoment I would object until I have that opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this has been cleared by the majority \nbill manager, by Senator Inouye and his staff, I believe. Certainly the \nranking member has no objection. I didn't know I had to clear \namendments with all 100 Members of the Senate before I could even get \nthem called up. I am prepared to call it up so we can then consider it \nand then we can debate it and vote on it. But this does not seem like a \nway to make any progress on this important underlying legislation.\n  Well, I guess I will talk about it for a while.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I once more ask unanimous consent to \ncall up my amendment No. 4202, as modified, for consideration, and I \nask that the pending amendment be set aside for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, I will state the same \nobjection. I have not seen the amendment, and while I appreciate that \nthe bill managers may have agreed to it, the reality is, as I \nunderstand it, any Member of the Senate can rise to object.\n  I hope not to be compelled to object. But at this point, I will \nobject.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I reserve the right to object too. I \nhave been here a long time. That is the first time I have seen that \nfrom the Senator from New Jersey. If that is the way we are going to do \nbusiness here, this place will grind to a halt. I think it is \ndiscourteous of the Senator from New Jersey to do that. This place \nexists and runs mostly on comity. I hope that does not become a \npractice here or it will be practiced on this side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as you have heard, the President came to \nspeak to Republicans at lunch. We have talked about a lot of issues, \nincluding immigration reform and the like. Subsequent to that meeting, \nwe were informed by e-mail that the President\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\nhas made a major announcement with regard to the deployment of National \nGuard along the border.\n  This amendment, which deals with border security and will help the \nFederal Government live up to its responsibility for border security, \nis exactly the kind of response I think the President and certainly all \nof us who care about border security would find helpful.\n  Let me tell you what this amendment does. I know the Senator from New \nJersey is looking through the amendment, and perhaps we can have a \nfurther consideration of the amendment when he is through.\n  This amendment would strengthen border security along our southwest \nborder. While I appreciate the needs of States such as Arizona, we have \na number of States that share a common border with Mexico. We have to \nmake sure we have the human resources, tactical infrastructure, and \ntechnology employed in order to protect Americans along the border and \nhelp contain the terrible drug violence--drug war, literally--that is \nbeing fought within a short distance of American cities.\n  According to the El Paso Times, two young men were shot over the \nweekend in Juarez, one a nursing student at the University of Texas at \nEl Paso, and another was a former student--an engineering major--from \nthat same institution. Some news reports indicated that the two young \nmen were returning from a Boy Scout camp when they were confronted by a \nshooter with an AK-47, who shot both of them multiple times, killing \none of them.\n  I am really not sure my colleagues understand how close these \nkillings in Juarez are to the United States. It is like Minneapolis \nbeing across the river from St. Paul or Manhattan being across the \nriver from Brooklyn. That is the proximity of the 1,000 deaths that \nhave occurred so far this year in Juarez, on the Mexican side of the \ncommon border with El Paso. This may not capture headlines like those \nof other college campuses, but these deaths represent a terrible loss \nto our families, our communities, and our Nation. That is a reminder of \njust how dangerous this war is that is going on just across our border.\n  It also raises the issue of what is going to be necessary in order \nfor us to deal with our broken immigration system. I think the problem \nwe have with our immigration system is that it is simply not credible \nwhen it comes to border security. We know that last year the Department \nof Homeland Security reported that some 540,000 people were detained \ncoming across our border. We don't know how many made it across without \nbeing stopped and detained. All we can tell you is how many people \nactually were detained. It is commonly thought that between two and \nthree people are missed for every one who is caught and detained. That \nis not anyone's definition of border security.\n  What we need is more resources deployed along the border. The \nPresident's 2011 budget, for example, is a flat-line budget when it \ncomes to actually providing more boots on the ground, when it comes to \nadding to the Border Patrol and the various Federal agencies whose job \nit is to protect our country and secure the border.\n  The first thing my amendment does is it provides some help in the \nform of grants to State and local law enforcement, especially to those \nareas within 100 miles of the border. When the Federal Government \ndoesn't do its job, when they fail to employ sufficient resources in \norder to secure the border, that burden falls on State and local law \nenforcement officials, particularly those within 100 miles of the \nborder who feel the brunt of that absence of the Federal Government.\n  Under this $300 million grant program, these funds could be used to \npurchase equipment, particularly so they can have interoperable \ncommunications, hire additional investigators, detectives, and other \nlaw enforcement personnel, and they could be used to cover salaries and \nexpenses associated with border enforcement for the State and local \nofficials who are stepping up and doing the job the Federal Government \nis not doing.\n  Second, my amendment supports the southwest border task forces. It \nprovides $140 million to increase personnel and funding for the so-\ncalled HIDTA Program, or the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \nProgram, mainly in southwest border States. It also provides $44.7 \nmillion to the National Guard Counterdrug Program in the southwest \nborder States.\n  Third, my amendment provides additional support for U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection. It provides $144 million for the purchase of six \nadditional Predator B unmanned aerial vehicles and ground control \nstations and funding for UAV pilots and support staff. It provides \n$49.4 million to allow Customs and Border Protection to purchase 10 \nadditional helicopters for border enforcement. It allocates $180 \nmillion for border surveillance equipment and vehicles. It provides \n$200 million to hire 500 Customs and Border Patrol officers to staff \nsouthwest border ports of entry, as well as to fund infrastructure \nimprovements at high-volume ports of entry.\n  Fourth, my amendment provides additional support to the Drug \nEnforcement Administration. I had the opportunity the other day to have \na classified briefing from the DEA which I will not go into here, but \nsuffice it to say the Drug Enforcement Administration is fighting the \ngood fight both here and in Mexico trying to help fight and beat the \ncartels. But they need more help. This amendment provides $30.4 million \nto hire an additional 180 intelligence analysts and support personnel \nfor the DEA, and it would create four additional special investigative \nunits.\n  It provides $72 million to hire 281 special agents and investigators \nat the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to help \ninvestigate and track illegal firearms. One of the things you will \nrecall we heard from President Calderon is his concern about the \nweapons that are purchased in the United States and then bundled and \ntrafficked south of the border into Mexico and used by the cartels. \nThese ATF agents need additional help, and this amendment would provide \nthe money to hire 281 additional ATF agents in order to help prevent \nthe flow of weapons to the cartels south of the border.\n  Finally, my amendment supports U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement. It provides $375 million to fund 500 additional \ninvestigators, 400 additional intelligence analysts, and 500 additional \ndetention and removal officers. It provides $151 million to increase \ndetention capacity by 3,300 beds. It allocates $180 million for \nequipment and border enforcement technology. It provides $89 million to \nexpand repatriation programs that return illegal aliens to their home \ncountries.\n  The total pricetag for this amendment, which, as you can see, is \nrather detailed and breaks down into six different areas, is $2 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. But the first responsibility of the \nFederal Government is to keep our Nation safe, protect it. That is the \nNo. 1 job of the Federal Government. The Federal Government is not \ngetting the job done now. The brave men and women who, day-in and day-\nout, fight the cartels, the human smugglers, people who smuggle weapons \nillegally, need help. They need technology, training, and equipment, so \nthey can get the job done.\n  So that it is not necessary for other States to take matters into \ntheir own hands in the absence of the Federal Government living up to \nits responsibilities, I believe it is absolutely imperative that we \nspend this money for the security of our country, for the security of \nour border.\n  The good news is that, unlike a lot of spending that has happened \nhere in recent months and years, this is not deficit spending. I am not \nproposing that we spend it using borrowed money; rather, that we use \nfunds that were already appropriated by the stimulus package early in \n2009 in order to pay for this amendment. This is not spending our \nchildren's inheritance.\n  I believe this is acting responsibly in responding to the first \nobligation of the Federal Government, which is to keep our people safe, \nto protect our borders and our national sovereignty.\n  I thank my colleagues who signed on as original cosponsors, including \nSenators Hutchison, Kyl, and McCain. I hope all of my colleagues will \nsupport this amendment.\n  I see both the bill manager and the Senator from New Jersey. I don't \nknow whether he has had an opportunity to review the amendment. There \nis nothing particularly exotic or complex about it. It is rather \nstraightforward and deals with a real problem.\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Will the Senator yield before he offers the request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate that. I look at the Senator's proposed \namendment, and am I to understand that the Senator has $3.1 billion of \nrescissions to cover what he wants to do in his amendment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Responding to my colleague through the Chair, we were \ntold that it would take $3.1 billion in rescission authority to come up \nwith the $2 billion that would pay for the various provisions of the \nbill. I would be happy to explain that further, with our staffers \npresent, to further satisfy the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If my colleague will further yield, I understand what \nhe just said. There is $3.1 billion in rescission in the amendment; is \nthat fair to say?\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4175\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and I be permitted to call up amendment \nNo. 4175.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4175.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that parties responsible for the Deepwater Horizon \noil spill in the Gulf of Mexico shall reimburse the general fund of the \n      Treasury for costs incurred in responding to that oil spill)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       (b) Reimbursement.--\n       (1) Definition of responsible party.--In this subsection, \n     the term ``responsible party'' means a responsible party (as \n     defined in section 1001 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 \n     U.S.C. 2701)) with respect to the discharge of oil that began \n     in 2010 in connection with the explosion on, and sinking of, \n     the mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon in the \n     Gulf of Mexico.\n       (2) Liability and reimbursement.--Notwithstanding any \n     limitation on liability under section 1004 of the Oil \n     Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2704) or any other provision \n     of law, each responsible party--\n       (A) is liable for any costs incurred by the United States \n     under this Act relating to the discharge of oil that began in \n     2010 in connection with the explosion on, and sinking of, the \n     mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf \n     of Mexico; and\n       (B) shall, upon the demand of the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, reimburse the general fund of the Treasury for the \n     costs incurred under this Act relating to the discharge of \n     oil described in subparagraph (A), as well as the costs \n     incurred by the United States in administering \n     responsibilities under this Act and other applicable Federal \n     law relating to that discharge of oil.\n       (3) Failure to pay.--If a responsible party fails to pay a \n     demand of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this Act, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury shall request the Attorney \n     General to bring a civil action against the responsible party \n     (or a guarantor of the responsible party) in an appropriate \n     United States district court to recover the amount of the \n     demand, plus all costs incurred in obtaining payment, \n     including prejudgment interest, attorneys fees, and any other \n     administrative and adjudicative costs.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, this amendment is simple. It says \nthat the parties responsible for the gulf oilspill must reimburse the \ngovernment for every Federal dollar in this bill that goes to the \noilspill response. To me, it is just a statement of pure logic. I thank \nSenator Murray for joining me in cosponsoring this amendment.\n  It has been 36 days since BP's blown-out well began spewing damage \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nhundreds of thousands of barrels of oil uncontrollably into the Gulf of \nMexico, and there is no end in sight. The spill is causing unimaginable \ndevastation to wetlands, wildlife, and the way of life across the gulf. \nThe prospect of oil entering the Loop Current in Florida, hitting the \neast coast of Florida, is becoming more likely.\n  Now, President Obama--in addition to the funding provided for the \nwars in the supplemental and the Haiti disaster--has dispatched the \nCoast Guard, the Interior Department, the EPA, the Defense Department, \nand NOAA to the gulf to contain and clean up this disaster. Now we are \nabout to provide millions of dollars in emergency supplemental funding \nfor these efforts.\n\n  The question for us today is simple: Who should pay for this effort? \nShould the American taxpayers be asked to pay for it or should big oil, \nthe companies that caused this disaster, pay for it? I say it is the \nresponsibility of these companies. They were unprepared to deal with \nthis catastrophe. It was not our taxpayers. Therefore, the companies \nshould pay all the bills, as expected.\n  In the emergency supplemental, we often provide funds to deal with \nnatural disasters. When a flood, hurricane, or tornado hits, Americans \nare accustomed to lending a hand to their neighbors, whether in their \nState or other States. But the oilspill in the gulf is not a natural \ndisaster. It was caused either by neglect, recklessness, or otherwise \nby BP, Transocean, and Halliburton, all of which worked or had a large \npart of that drilling effort in the gulf. That is why my amendment \nrequires reimbursements by the oil companies, the parties responsible, \nfor any and all taxpayer funds spent on this response. It allows us to \nrespond in the gulf without delay while making clear that the money in \nthe bill is an advance, not a handout, for the oil companies.\n  The oil companies can afford to pay the taxpayers back. BP made more \nthan a $5 billion profit--more than $5 billion--in the first quarter of \nthis year alone. Although BP first avowed to pay all claims, they then \nadded a modifier, ``legitimate claims,'' and they are the ones who will \ndetermine the legitimacy of these claims.\n  Every single day it becomes clearer that BP stands for ``broken \npromises.'' If the taxpayers are left with the tab for cleaning up \nBP's, Transocean's, and Halliburton's mess, funds for other vital \nservices will simply dry up. It is common sense: Polluters must pay for \ntheir damage, not American taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4173\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wish to speak about the Sessions \namendment to the supplemental appropriations bill. This is the \namendment that would cap discretionary spending this year and for \nfuture years, irrespective of the needs of the government and the \nAmerican people.\n  I know our distinguished chairman, Senator Inouye, has already spoken \nabout it. I note this is the fourth time the Senate has been asked to \nvote on this amendment. The last three times it was defeated. Now we \nhave to vote on it again. Perhaps we should have a rule here that after \nthree strikes you are out.\n  The amendment uses last year's budget resolution as its starting \npoint. It will cut over $20 billion from the President's fiscal year \n2011 budget request.\n  I share the goal of the sponsors of this amendment to limit Federal \nspending. Since I have been in the Senate, I have voted for billions of \ndollars in cuts in Federal spending. But the way this amendment is \ndone, using a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel, it arbitrarily affects \nevery Federal program in ways that most certainly will come back to \nhaunt us.\n  Not only will critical programs from defense to education to foreign \npolicy be cut, the amendment requires a vote of three-fifths of the \nSenate for emergency spending, and in a mere 14 pages it seeks to \nbasically do away with the role of the Budget Committee.\n  I would hate to see a situation where, if we have a flood in \nMississippi, and for some reason or another a minority of Senators say: \nOur states didn't have a flood, so why should we vote for this? Or if \nthere were an earthquake in California and they need three-fifths, but \na minority of Senators has other priorities. That's not the way it \nshould work.\n  I must admit, I take a somewhat long view of it. I have not been here \nas long as our distinguished chairman has or our distinguished former \nchairman, Senator Byrd. But I have been here longer than everybody else \nin this body. I urge people to be careful what they wish for. It \nappears that requiring 60 votes and the gridlock we are currently \nexperiencing is not enough. The sponsors of this amendment want the \nbody to be held hostage to a minority of two-fifths. As the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee said earlier, it is the wrong direction \nfor the Senate to be going.\n  Let me focus my brief remarks specifically on the effect the Sessions \namendment would have on important national security programs funded in \nthe State and foreign operations budget for fiscal year 2011 which \nbegins on October 1.\n  The amendment would cut $1.1 billion from the President's State and \nforeign operations budget request. A cut of that size would have \nsignificant and, I suspect, unintended consequences.\n  I hope the proponents of this amendment or their constituents are not \namong those who want travel overseas and want their passports processed \nin a timely manner.\n  I hope they do not mind that our embassies are not fully staffed and \ncannot properly represent Americans abroad. I hope if something happens \nto them or their constituents in Mexico, Kenya, Turkey, or any other \nforeign place and there is not an American consular officer who can \nhelp them in an emergency, that they will not complain because their \namendment cut the funding for that consular officer's salary.\n  I hope it does not matter that we would only be able to fund a \nportion of the global health and food security initiatives which, among \nother things, provide funds for maternal and child health and to \nprevent and respond to outbreaks of deadly contagious diseases, such as \ncholera, Ebola, and the Asian flu.\n  I point out that these are not just threats in places halfway around \nthe world, they are only a plane trip away from our shores.\n  I hope the sponsors of this amendment are not concerned that it may \nmean we have to cut funding for exchange programs for students of \npredominantly Muslim countries where we are trying to show a different \nface of America, or democracy programs in the former Soviet Union or \ntraining programs for Iraqi police officers. There is a price for \neverything, and the funding for State and foreign operations is one of \nthe best bargains in the Federal budget.\n  Contrary to what some may believe, it consists of barely 1 percent of \nthe entire budget. Aside from the U.S. military, it is how the United \nStates exerts its influence around the globe. As we are trying to show \nin many parts of the globe, it is not just our military might that \ndefines America, it is our global reach in humanitarian emergencies and \ndiplomacy.\n  At a time when China is sharply increasing its spending for these \nsame types of activities and extending its sphere of influence to our \nhemisphere and around the world because they know it is in their \nNation's best interest to do so, do we really want to cut the funding \nthat enables the United States to compete? It makes no sense.\n  I note that even though it is in the State Department budget, top \nofficials at the Pentagon understand this very well. Secretary Gates \nand Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have both \nurged the Congress to fully fund the State and foreign operations \nbudget. They know these are areas where our diplomats can handle things \nbetter at far less cost and with longer lasting effects.\n  The sponsors of this amendment have supported the deployment of our \ntroops in Afghanistan and Iraq. They have voted to borrow the money--\nthe only\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\ntime, certainly, in my lifetime, that we have gone to war anywhere and \nnot paid for it. But military force alone, even though it is exerted \nthrough great sacrifice by the very brave men and women in our \nmilitary, can only provide the conditions for longer term economic and \npolitical stability in those countries. The State and Foreign \nOperations budget provides the funds to build that economic growth and \npolitical stability.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letters from both Secretary Gates and \nAdmiral Mullen be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. No one disagrees that we need to control spending. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nwork very hard to control spending. As a member of that committee I \nknow the votes I have cast to substantially cut spending. We need to \neliminate programs that are wasteful or can no longer be justified. We \nneed to be frugal about what new programs we fund.\n  But just as we are in a different world today than when I came to the \nSenate 35 years ago, the things we need to do to respond to the \nchallenges of today are different than they were 35 years ago. The way \nwe respond to those challenges is different than when the distinguished \nAppropriations chairman was gallantly fighting to protect our Nation in \nWorld War II--something which we all honor and the Nation has honored \nwhen he received the Congressional Medal of Honor. But he, like so many \nothers, tried to make the world safe for democracy, but I think he also \nwanted to make it a world where America could achieve its goals through \nthe strength of its ideas and not just through its military might.\n  This amendment is not going to make a dent in the Federal deficit by \ncutting $1.1 billion from the State and Foreign Operations budget. The \namendment, however well intentioned, would permit a small minority of \nthe Senate to dictate to the majority. It would limit the global \ninfluence of the United States. It would cede more of our influence to \nChina. It would diminish our ability to develop and access export \nmarkets that are vital to our economy and vital to increasing jobs here \nin the United States. At worst of all, it would weaken our security \nalliances.\n  I urge Senators to reject it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                                     Pentagon,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Apr 21, 2010.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for full funding of the President's FY 2011 foreign \n     affairs budget request (the 150 account) which, along with \n     defense, is a critical component of an integrated and \n     effective national security program.\n       I understand this year presents a challenging budget \n     environment, with competing domestic and international \n     pressures. However, I strongly believe a robust civilian \n     foreign affairs capability, coupled with a strong defense \n     capability, is essential to preserving U.S. national security \n     interests around the world.\n       State and USAID partners are critical to success in \n     Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. Our military and civilian \n     missions are integrated, and we depend upon our civilian \n     counterparts to help stabilize and rebuild after the fight. \n     As U.S. forces transition out of war zones, the U.S. \n     government needs our civilian agencies to be able to assume \n     critical functions. This allows us, for example, to draw down \n     U.S. forces in Iraq responsibly while ensuring hard-fought \n     gains are secured. Cuts to the 150 account will almost \n     certainly impact our efforts in these critical frontline \n     states.\n       In other parts of the world, the work performed by \n     diplomatic and development professionals helps build the \n     foundation for more stable, democratic and prosperous \n     societies. These are places where the potential for conflict \n     can be minimized, if not completely avoided, by State and \n     USAID programs--thereby lowering the likely need for \n     deployment of U.S. military assets.\n       In formulating his request for FY 2011, the President \n     carefully considered funding needs for the budget accounts \n     for both foreign affairs and national defense, taking into \n     account overall national security requirements as well as \n     economic conditions. I believe that full funding of these two \n     budget accounts is necessary for our national security and \n     for ensuring our continued leadership in the world. I hope \n     you will take this into account when acting upon the \n     President's FY 2011 budget request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert M. Gates.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As the Congress moves to finalize \n     the budget for FY 2011, I want to offer my strong support for \n     fully funding the Department of Defense and related agencies. \n     I also want to reinforce the views expressed in Secretary \n     Gates' letter of April 21 and Secretary Clinton's letter of \n     April 20 (copies attached) to Senator Kent Conrad, requesting \n     full funding of the Department of State and USAID. We are \n     living in times that require an integrated national security \n     program with budgets that fund the full spectrum of national \n     security efforts, including vitally important pre-conflict \n     and post-conflict civilian stabilization programs.\n       Diplomatic programs are critical to our long-term security. \n     I have been on record many times since 2005 expressing my \n     views of the importance of fully funding our diplomatic \n     efforts. As Chief of Naval Operations, I said that I would \n     hand over part of my budget to the State Department, ``in a \n     heartbeat, assuming it was spent in the right place.'' \n     Diplomatic efforts should always lead and shape our \n     international relationships, and I believe that our foreign \n     policy is still too dominated by our military. The diplomatic \n     and developmental capabilities of the United States have a \n     direct bearing on our ability to shape threats and reduce the \n     need for military action. It is my firm belief that \n     diplomatic programs as part of a coordinated strategy will \n     save money by reducing the likelihood of active military \n     conflict involving U.S. forces.\n       I am told that the Senate Budget Committee reduced the \n     international affairs budget by $4 billion, and I respect and \n     appreciate the tough choices the committee had to make. I \n     would ask that as you finalize the spending outlines for FY \n     2011, you underscore the importance of our civilian efforts \n     to the work of the Defense Department, and ultimately, to our \n     Nation's security. Because of the increasingly integrated \n     nature of our operations, a $4 billion decrement in State and \n     USAID budgets will have a negative impact on ongoing U.S. \n     military efforts, leading to higher costs through missed \n     diplomatic and developmental needs and opportunities. A \n     fully-integrated foreign policy requires a fully-resourced \n     approach. Our troops, Foreign Service officers and \n     development experts work side-by-side in unprecedented and \n     ever-increasing cooperation as they execute our strategic \n     programs. We need to continue to grow the important \n     capabilities that are unique to our non-military assets, \n     ensuring they have the resources to enhance our security and \n     advance our national interests, in both ongoing conflicts as \n     well as in preventative efforts.\n       As always, I appreciate your strong support of our men and \n     women in uniform, and appreciate your considering my \n     perspective as you finalize the FY 2011 budget.\n       The more significant the cuts, the longer military \n     operation will take and more and more lives are at risk.\n                                                      M. G. Mullen\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be added as a \ncosponsor of amendment No. 4179, offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum so I may discuss this matter with Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4218\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am not going to call up my amendment at \nthis time because I understand there is an objection on the other side. \nBut I\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\nam going to take advantage of this opportunity to discuss my amendment, \nwhich is No. 4218. This is an amendment I have offered on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Inhofe, Alexander, Brown, Brownback, Gregg, Snowe, \nCoburn, Bond, Murkowski, Voinovich, Burr, Begich, and Corker.\n  On April 22, a new Environmental Protection Agency regulation \nregarding lead paint abatement went into effect. Lead paint has been of \ngreat concern to me for a number of years. I actually joined with the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in holding field hearings on \nthe dangers of lead paint in older houses several years ago. It has \nlong been a concern of mine. I support the purpose of this rule because \nwe want to continue our efforts to rid toxic lead-based paint from our \nhomes.\n  I am deeply concerned, however, as are many of my colleagues, that \nthe EPA has completely botched the implementation of this rule. The \nrule requires that contractors who were hired to do work in homes that \nhave lead paint must first be certified to perform this work. We put \nthe cart before the horse with this rule and the result is that the EPA \nhas not ensured that there is a sufficient number of trainers to \nprovide the training and the certification for these contractors. That \nmeans many contractors simply cannot get the necessary certification in \nmost States.\n  The result is that small business men and women are losing out on \njobs at a time when many of them are in desperate need of work. \nIronically, it also means that lead paint that homeowners want removed \nor mitigated will not be.\n  In my State of Maine, for example, as of last week we have only three \nEPA trainers in the entire State to certify contractors. Just over 10 \npercent of the State's contractors have been certified. Hundreds of \nMaine's contractors have signed up for the training but they have been \nforced to wait. Their names are languishing on waiting lists, some for \nas long as 2 months.\n  It is hard to envision how much worse a job EPA could have done in \nrolling out this regulation and it is not as if EPA did not know this \nwas coming. EPA has had years to plan for the proper implementation of \nthis regulation. Unfortunately, the EPA's rule carries a big penalty \nfor contractors who do not get the required training. If contractors \nwho perform work in homes built before 1978 are not EPA certified, they \nface fines of up to $37,500 per violation per day. Many of the painters \nin my State doing this work don't earn $37,000 in an entire year. How \nunfair it is when it is the EPA's fault in many cases that they are not \ncertified. The lack of training and the EPA fines are creating a no-win \nsituation. If contractors who have not received the EPA training work \nin these older homes, they face the possibility of literally losing \ntheir businesses, of being fined out of existence, due to the severity \nof the EPA fines. Meanwhile, the lead paint remains, raising the threat \nof lead poisoning and its significant health impacts.\n  I have been trying to work with EPA officials since this problem \nfirst became evident to me in early March, but they have offered \nabsolutely no reasonable accommodations, no reasonable solutions. In \nfact, it took the EPA 7 weeks to even offer any ideas for getting more \ntrainers to the State of Maine--and even then the EPA's proposals were \nunworkable.\n  I come to the floor to offer a common sense solution to a problem \ncreated by Washington's poor planning. My bipartisan amendment, which \nis cosponsored by so many of my colleagues--and let me give the list \nagain. Senators Alexander, Inhofe, Brown, Brownback, Gregg, Snowe, \nCoburn, Bond, Murkowski, Voinovich, Burr, Begich, and Corker--would \nprohibit the EPA from imposing fines against contractors who have \nsigned up for the required training classes by September 30 of this \nyear. This delay will allow, I hope, adequate time for contractors to \ncomply with the law and to get the required training without fear of a \nfine that could well put them out of business.\n  To be clear, our amendment does not stop the EPA from punishing those \nwho willingly break the law and endanger a child's well-being. It \nsimply gives the EPA more time to ensure that there is a sufficient \nnumber of trainers in each State, and it simply protects that small \npainter, that small businessman, that small contractor, from unfairly \nbeing fined when it is the EPA's fault he or she cannot get the \nrequired training.\n  Inconceivably, I have heard the EPA say it has trained an adequate \nnumber of people in Maine, so let me give you the statistics for my \nState, because they are typical of many States. First, EPA estimates \nthat there are only 1,400 contractors in Maine. In fact, however, there \nare more than 20,000 contractors in our State; not 1,400, but 20,000 \npeople who need to be trained.\n  EPA makes another erroneous assumption. It assumes that all of these \npeople are part of large businesses and that only one person at each \nbusiness needs to be certified.\n  EPA also assumes that contractors specialize in doing just old homes \nor new homes. Completely false. That makes no sense at all in a rural \nState such as Maine, which has some of the oldest housing stock in the \ncountry and most painters are small shops, usually just an individual \nwho is self-employed. At most, he might be part of a small business \nwhere there are two or three people who are doing the work. In \naddition, these individuals work in mixed communities which have older \nhomes and newer homes. This is typical of every community in my State.\n  We cannot ask them to give up working in older homes simply because \nan economist at the EPA does not understand what our housing stock \nlooks like in Maine. Furthermore, most of the EPA's classes have been \nheld in the southern part of the State. It is not feasible for people \nto have to travel hundreds of miles in order to obtain this training. I \nhave heard that criticism and that problem from my colleagues in other \nStates as well, that the EPA is offering the classes only in cities and \nhas completely neglected the rural parts of their states.\n  My home State of Maine is not the only State trapped in this \nbureaucratic dilemma. An EPA evaluation from early May shows, for \nexample, that Hawaii only has two trainers. I cannot imagine how that \ncan work in Hawaii given the islands. That is not feasible. Mississippi \nhas only one trainer in the entire State. Three States--Louisiana, \nWyoming, and South Dakota--do not have a single EPA-certified trainer.\n  This is just not fair. It is not fair that these small contractors \nlive under the threat of these onerous fines that would put many of \nthem out of business, when it is not their fault they cannot obtain the \ntraining--it is EPA's fault.\n  All of us understand that lead is a dangerous toxin and we must work \nto do whatever we can to keep our homes and our children safe. But the \nburden should not fall upon the shoulders of small contractors and \nconstruction professionals, painters and others, who are trying their \nbest to comply with EPA's rule.\n  Spring is home renovation season in most States. The small business \nmen and women of Maine are just gearing up for the spring and summer \nmonths, and they are trying to recover from the great recession which \nhas been so hard on their businesses. The onerous and unfair fines of \nmore than $37,000 per day could put many of them out of business even \nas they wait for an EPA training class to become available.\n  As they are waiting, if they choose not to do this work, they are \nlosing income as well, and that is unfair. All I am attempting to do \nwith this amendment is provide the EPA with more time in order to \nincrease the number of certified trainers and the offering of these \nclasses.\n  With enough trainers, we can eventually ensure the success of this \nprogram. But without enough trainers, we are guaranteeing its failure \nand penalizing innocent contractors who are simply trying to make a \nliving and who have been unable to secure the training required by the \nEPA.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Kagan Nomination\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I rise today to discuss the President's nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan to be an\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\nAssociate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court \nconfirmation hearing for Solicitor General Kagan will begin on June 28. \nBut my consideration of her will not begin then. As so many of my \ncolleagues, I began considering her the day her nomination was \nannounced because I want to learn as much as I can about President \nObama's choice to fill one of the most important jobs in the land, a \njob as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Even though there are many questions we all still need to ask this \nnominee, and we do that in the hearings, I would like to speak today on \nhow she appears to me based on her initial job interview, the interview \nI had in my office, and the work that has been done so far to gather \ninformation about this nominee.\n  After meeting with her and hearing about her, I can tell you that I \nam very positive about her nomination. Solicitor General Kagan is an \nintellectual heavyweight who brings an incredibly broad variety of \nlegal experiences to this nomination. In so many of the legal jobs that \nshe has had, she has been a trailblazer.\n  In 2003 Kagan became the first woman in Harvard Law School's 186-year \nhistory to serve as dean. It is hard enough to manage lawyers, as I \nknow from my former job as county attorney, much less manage law \nprofessors. She did it with much aplomb.\n  In 2009 she became the first woman to serve as Solicitor General, the \nchief lawyer representing the interests of the American people before \nthe Supreme Court. One particularly interesting aspect of her \nbackground is that she has worked in all three branches of government. \nShe served as a Supreme Court clerk, as an adviser to then-Senator \nBiden when he was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and, \nof course, she has worked in two different Presidential \nadministrations: in the White House Counsel's Office as a domestic \npolicy adviser and now as Solicitor General.\n  When I look at her resume, I notice two things: One, she has an \nappreciation of how the law impacts the lives of ordinary Americans. \nWhen you are involved in considering the nitty-gritty details of \ndifferent policies, when you have to figure out where to compromise to \nprotect Americans, and where to hold firm on a piece of legislation or \na position you take, you have to know exactly what the consequences of \nyour recommendations will be. You have to think about the lives that \nwill be impacted.\n  The second thing I notice is she has a track record of listening to \ndifferent viewpoints and bringing people together, whether it was her \ntrack record of recruiting law talents while dean, whether it was \nconservative law professors or liberal law professors, or working with \nSenators from both parties on tobacco legislation. She has practical \nexperience reaching out to and working with people who have very \ndifferent beliefs and views than she does. That is increasingly \nimportant on a very divided Supreme Court.\n  Some of my colleagues have questioned whether she is fit to be a \nSupreme Court Justice because she has never been a judge. First, I have \nto wonder whether these same colleagues would have objected to putting, \nsay, Chief Justice Rehnquist on the Supreme Court--he was not a judge \nbefore--or Justice Brandeis or Justice Frankfurter because they did not \nhave any judicial experience. Would that have been the excuse, because \nthey were not nominated?\n  In fact, more than one-third of all Supreme Court Justices in the \nhistory of this great country were not judges before. If we think about \nthe Court right now, every single one of them came from what has been \ncalled the judicial monastery.\n  I think it is great that we actually have a nominated candidate that \ncame from a different part of the world, someone who was in the private \nsector, someone who has worked in the U.S. Government, who has managed \npeople, who has had to make tough decisions. I think that is a good \nthing. But, additionally, I think it is important that we bring someone \nwith that kind of perspective.\n  Solicitor General Kagan brings so many interesting legal experiences \nto the table. Beyond that, her current job, Solicitor General, is \nactually referred to as ``the Tenth Justice'' because it is such an \nimportant position. She represents the American people before the \nSupreme Court. That is incredibly important training for an \nindividual nominated to serve on the Court.\n\n  It is worth noting that the last Solicitor General who subsequently \nbecame a Supreme Court Justice was no other than Thurgood Marshall, \nElena Kagan's mentor and former boss. So I hope we can put to rest this \nidea that only judges are qualified to be Justices because if that were \nthe rule in this country, one-third of our Justices, so many of them \ngreat ones, as noted by people from both sides of the aisle, would \nnever have gotten to the Court.\n  I also want to talk about one other issue that has come up in the 2 \nweeks since Elena Kagan was nominated. I wish I did not have to talk \nabout this issue because it is not worthy of discussion in this great \nChamber. It is not something we would be normally talking about with a \nSupreme Court Justice.\n  But I learned last year, during Justice Sotomayor's hearings, that \nSupreme Court nominations truly bring out the ``silly season'' in \nWashington, DC. Last year, for example, there were stories and \ncomments, mostly anonymous it is worth noting, that questioned Justice \nSotomayor's judicial temperament.\n  According to one news story about the topic, ``[Judge Sotomayor] \ndevelop[ed] a reputation for asking tough questions at oral arguments \nand for being sometimes brusque and curt with lawyers who were not \nprepared to answer them.'' As I said last year, where I come from \nasking tough questions and having very little patience for unprepared \nlawyers is the very definition of being a judge. As a lawyer, you owe \nit to the bench and to your clients to be as well prepared as you can \nbe.\n  As Nina Totenberg said on National Public Radio:\n\n       If Sonia Sotomayor sometimes dominates oral argument at her \n     court--if she's feisty, even pushy--then she should fit right \n     in at the U.S. Supreme Court!\n\n  I think it was Justice Ginsburg during that time who commented: Well, \nlook at Breyer. Look at Scalia. She will fit right in.\n  This became an issue at our hearings and she was questioned about \nthis. I thought we had come to a time in our country where we could \nconfirm as many gruff, to-the-point female judges as we have confirmed \nmale judges.\n  Well, this year is no different. There was a lengthy article this \nweekend in one of our major newspapers about Elena Kagan's clothing, \ndescribing it as--I will say in rather critical terms, it talked about \nat length her leg-crossing style. Now I have to say, I took note of \nthis since it was compared to my leg-crossing style.\n  I have to say I never thought I would be discussing this in this \nChamber. But, in fact, this was a major article that stirred much \ncommentary all over the blogs. I do not think such an article was ever \nwritten about Chief Justice Roberts. I am trying to picture this, if he \nwas in a meeting with Senator Hatch, if there was a major article \nwritten about the two of them and who was crossing their legs and who \nwas crossing their ankles and how they were facing each other. I do not \nthink that happened.\n  Was such an article written about Justice Alito or was such an \narticle written about Justice Rehnquist when he was being considered by \nthis great body? It is my 50th birthday today, and I must admit, I \nthought we were somewhat beyond what happened to me when I was 10 years \nold in Beacon Heights Elementary School and decided one day to wear \nbell-bottom pants, flowered bell-bottom pants to fourth grade, and was \nkicked out of my class by Mrs. Quady. I was told: At Beacon Heights \nElementary School girls only wear dresses. I had to go home and change \nmy clothes.\n  Well, a lot has happened since those days in fourth grade. Now on my \n50th birthday, it is my hope that as we consider the Solicitor General \nof the United States, Elena Kagan, she will be considered on her \nmerits, she will be asked tough but fair questions; the questions \nshould not be where does she shop, but, rather, does she have the \nfirst-rate intellect, unimpeachable character, and judicial temperament \nto join the highest Court in the land.\n  That should be what we are talking about at the hearing. That should \nbe\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nwhat the press is focused on. That should be what my colleagues are to \ndecide on. Just think about how far we have come. When Sandra Day \nO'Connor graduated from law school 50-plus years ago, the only offer \nshe got from a law firm was for a position as a legal secretary.\n  Justice Ginsburg faced similar obstacles. When she entered Harvard in \nthe 1950s, she was one of only 9 women in a class of more than 500, and \none professor actually asked her to justify taking a place that could \nhave gone to a man. Later she was passed over for a prestigious \nclerkship despite her impressive credentials. In the course of more \nthan two centuries, 111 Justices have served on the Supreme Court. Only \nthree have been women. If confirmed, Elena Kagan would be the fourth \nand, for the first time in its history, three women would take places \non the bench when arguments are heard this fall. Let's focus on what \nmatters. Let's focus on the credentials, on the qualifications, on how \nshe answers the questions, not on how she crosses her legs.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4175, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask unanimous consent the Lautenberg amendment No. 4175 \nbe modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       (b) Reimbursement.--\n       (1) Definition of responsible party.--In this subsection, \n     the term ``responsible party'' means a responsible party (as \n     defined in section 1001 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 \n     U.S.C. 2701)) with respect to the discharge of oil that began \n     in 2010 in connection with the explosion on, and sinking of, \n     the mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon in the \n     Gulf of Mexico.\n       (2) Liability and reimbursement.--Each responsible party--\n       (A) is liable for any costs incurred by the United States \n     under this Act relating to the discharge of oil that began in \n     2010 in connection with the explosion on, and sinking of, the \n     mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf \n     of Mexico; and\n       (B) shall, upon the demand of the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, reimburse the general fund of the Treasury for the \n     costs incurred under this Act relating to the discharge of \n     oil described in subparagraph (A), as well as the costs \n     incurred by the United States in administering \n     responsibilities under this Act.\n       (3) Failure to pay.--If a responsible party fails to pay a \n     demand of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this Act, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury shall request the Attorney \n     General to bring a civil action against the responsible party \n     (or a guarantor of the responsible party) in an appropriate \n     United States district court to recover the amount of the \n     demand, plus all costs incurred in obtaining payment, \n     including prejudgment interest, attorneys fees, and any other \n     administrative and adjudicative costs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I had intended to ask unanimous consent to \nset aside an amendment in order to offer amendment 4191, but I \nunderstand there are certain Senators who want to review that amendment \nbefore that request is made. That is certainly a reasonable suggestion. \nI will withhold my request to offer the amendment. I hope I will have a \nchance to offer it later. I want to let my colleagues know what I \nintend to do.\n  This amendment would reestablish the moratorium on offshore oil and \ngas drilling in the North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, the South Atlantic \nand the Straits of Florida Planning Areas. As I am sure colleagues are \naware, several weeks ago the President indicated he would lift the \nmoratorium on offshore drilling along the Atlantic from the New Jersey-\nDelaware border south all the way to the Florida Keys, that he would \nalso lift the moratorium on parts of Alaska, but that he would maintain \na moratorium on the Pacific coast and on the North Atlantic. Since that \nannouncement has been made we all know what has happened in the Gulf of \nMexico. We have seen what happened with the BP oilspill--the loss of \nlife and the horrific impact it has had on the environment.\n  When the President announced his policy of additional offshore \ndrilling sites, he stated, through the Secretary of the Interior, that \nthere are places in the United States that are environmentally too \nsensitive to consider for new oil and gas exploration and production. \nHe cited the entire west coast of the continental United States and the \nNorth Atlantic. Those who are familiar with the mid-Atlantic know it is \nalso too sensitive an area from an environmental point of view to take \nthe risk on new offshore drilling. I mention this specifically because \nthere is a lease sale site--220--50 miles off the Virginia coast and 50 \nmiles due east of the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay, and just 60 miles \nfrom the border of the Assateague Island National Seashore that is \nactively being considered for oil exploration. Recently, the Department \nof Defense weighed in with objections to that because naval operations \nuse a large part of that area. It is about 2.9 million acres.\n  My point is that expected reserves there are minuscule compared to \nour national needs and the risk factors are significant. If we were to \nhave anywhere near the type of spill that happened in the gulf 50 miles \noff the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay, it would have a catastrophic \nimpact for generations to come on the Chesapeake Bay and on the beaches \nnot only in Maryland and Virginia but in Delaware and New Jersey. \nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the \nprevailing winds in our region blow toward the shore or along the shore \n72 percent of the time, making it much more likely that any spill that \nshort a distance from the shore would end up affecting our coastal \nareas. I say that knowing full well there is not much oil to drill for \nout there.\n  It is interesting to point out that 79 percent of our recoverable \noffshore oil and 82 percent of our recoverable offshore natural gas is \nalready open to drilling. The mineral companies already have \nsignificant areas where they can drill. There is only a small amount \nleft. More important, if we go after all of our known oil reserves we \nhave in this country, we have less than 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves, known reserves. But we consume 25 percent of the world's oil. \nIt is clear to all of us that we need to develop an energy policy that \nmakes us energy secure, that helps us create and save jobs in America \nand is friendly toward the environment. The best investment we can make \nis in conservation, alternative and renewable energy sources, and \nsafely developing resources on existing leases in order to accomplish \nthat.\n  For many years, there was a moratorium on offshore drilling. That \nmoratorium was imposed by Congress and by Executive Orders. But we were \nunable to extend the Congressional moratorium in 2008 and because of \nthe actions of the previous administration, that moratorium no longer \nexists. The purpose of this amendment is to say that none of the funds \nmade available in this act--and there are funds made available in this \nbill to deal with the oil spill issue--can be used for pre-leasing, \nleasing or any other activity off the Atlantic coast or the Straits of \nFlorida. The west coast is protected; the administration did not \npropose drilling there. So, too, is the North Atlantic. But to be as \nemphatic as possible, I included the North Atlantic Planning Area in my \namendment to send a message that we don't want drilling anywhere from \nMaine to the Florida Keys. Alaskans have their opinions on the way that \nthey believe drilling should be handled there. We can get to that \nlegislation separately. Certainly, with BP Oil currently under \ninvestigation, I hope it will be the unanimous view of this body that \nwe don't want to see any new areas drilled until after we have had a \nfull investigation into what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, to find \nout why we didn't have the regulatory system in place to protect our \nenvironment and protect public safety, to protect small businesses and \nproperty owners, and to protect taxpayers, why that regulatory system \nwas not in place.\n  Before we consider new areas, we certainly want to make sure we have \nreviewed the regulatory structure that is in place and taken the steps \nnecessary to fix it. This amendment would express our intention that \nuntil that is done, we don't want to see any new offshore drilling \nsites along the Atlantic coast.\n  I hope we go further. Quite frankly, I hope we go further and say we \nshould\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\nnot be doing any new drilling anywhere in this country until we find \nout what went wrong so that we have corrected that. I am talking about \noffshore drilling. We should at least be able to correct what was the \nmistake with regard to BP Oil and the Deepwater Horizon rig. But at a \nminimum, these areas along the Atlantic coast where we currently don't \ndrill should be off limits until we have completed the full review. \nThat is the purpose of my amendment. I hope the chairman and ranking \nmember will give me an opportunity to offer this amendment. I have \nheard from the Parliamentarian's Office that it would not be subject to \na Rule XVI point of order and I believe it is germane. I believe we \nhave a responsibility to act on this issue on this supplemental \nappropriations bill, because this truly is an urgent issue that has \nbecome much more urgent as a result of the spill in the gulf.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. For clarification, I know he expressed his sentiment that \nhe wishes to stop all drilling offshore. But for the purpose of this \namendment, it is confined to two areas, and it is only until such time \nas the investigations underway are completed; is that correct?\n  Mr. CARDIN. This amendment deals with the three Atlantic Planning \nAreas (North, Mid, and South) and the Straits of Florida Planning Area \nonly, and it only becomes operational as long as this supplemental \nappropriations bill is in effect--through the end of the current fiscal \nyear.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is a 1-year moratorium. It is not tied to the \ninvestigation?\n  Mr. CARDIN. No, it is not tied to the investigation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me make a couple comments about the comments of my \nfriend from Maryland concerning the opportunities we might have to \nexploit our resources in the United States. I hear quite often people \nsay that we only have 3 percent of the world's reserves. The only \nreason that figure is so low is because we can't go ahead and go after \nand define our recoverable reserves. CRS came out about 2 months ago \nwith a report that we are No. 1 in the world in recoverable reserves of \ngas, oil, and coal. We have done a study, not a part of any formal \nstudy, but to determine where we would be if we, like every other \ncountry in the world, would exploit our own resources, where we would \nbe in terms of our dependency on the Middle East for the ability to \nprovide the energy we need. In a short period, just on this North \nAmerican continent, Mexico, Canada, and ourselves, if we would lift all \nrestrictions we currently have, we would be able to be independent of \nthe Middle East.\n  A lot of people who are concerned about the national security \nramifications of our dependency on the Middle East are concerned about \nthe Middle East. They are not concerned about Canada or Mexico. They \nare not concerned about the North American continent.\n  For those people who don't want to drill offshore, certainly now is \nthe time to stand up and say: Look what happened down here, a horrible \ndisaster. But those people who have never wanted, at least in the 20 \nyears I have been here, to drill offshore or even in some of the other \nareas that are now off limits are people who don't think fossil fuels \nhave a place in our energy mix. Quite frankly, I am glad President \nObama has changed his position and is now recognizing that fossil \nfuels, more clean coal technology and therefore more coal, more gas, \nmore oil is something he would support. It is nice to talk about \nrenewables. It is wonderful. We have more windmills in Oklahoma than \nany State right now. But until technology gets to the point where we \ncan efficiently produce energy from renewables, we still have to run \nthis machine called America. We can't do it without fossil fuels.\n  I am a little bit prejudiced. I come from Oklahoma. We are one of the \nlargest producing States. Ours are mostly marginal wells, shallow \nwells. They are not the giant ones. That is the reason I have been on \nthe floor several times objecting to the Menendez limits or caps they \nare talking about putting on something that would be unrealistic, that \nwould shut down any opportunities for independents and confine all \noffshore drilling to the five majors plus the NOCs. That is the \nnational oil companies, mostly talking about China.\n  I am concerned about that. I know right now we would be in a position \nto do something, and we could become energy sufficient in the North \nAmerican continent within 5 years, if we would exploit our own energy \nresources.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4218\n\n  That is not the reason I am here this afternoon. I just happened to \ncome in. I wish to comment on amendment No. 4218 by Senator Collins. \nShe was here a little while ago. I had an amendment that would do \nessentially the same thing. It was the Inhofe-Collins amendment. This \nis the Collins-Inhofe amendment. It takes a slightly different \napproach. I support both amendments, although I am withdrawing mine in \nher favor.\n  This is the problem we have. On April 22, the EPA came out with a \nrule that made the statement that in the event you disturb any 6 square \nfeet of a building structure that is older than 1978, then you have to \nhave a permit from the EPA to become certified to work on such a \nbuilding. If you don't do it, there is a penalty provision of some \n$37,500 a day. Realistically, we know they would not fine somebody \n$37,500 a day. But unfortunately, a lot of the contractors who do that \nkind of work are individuals who don't know that is nothing but a bluff \nto keep people from doing things. We very much want to participate in \nthis dialog.\n  I think there may be a procedural problem that someone is whispering \nabout here; is that correct? OK, I am sorry. I forgot to ask to be \nconsidered as in morning business. I ask unanimous consent at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This is a problem. I used to be in this business on some \nscale. The smaller contractors are the ones who do the renovation \nbusiness. That means if they try to go out there and even replace one \nwindow, you can't replace the window without disturbing 6 square feet. \nTherefore, you would come under the provisions of this new rule, and \nyou would be subjecting yourself to a fine of $37,500.\n  So my bill that would have resolved the problem was not quite as good \nas the Collins bill, but it would have merely said that until such time \nas there are adequate numbers of people who are certified to do this \nwork, we would not enforce the law.\n  Well, the problem we are having right now is--and I have a list of \nthe different States--in my State of Oklahoma, there is only one \ncertified instructor. We have all these people wanting to take the \ncourse but they cannot get in, and they cannot do the work because of \nthe heavy fine provisions.\n  So what Senator Collins has done in her amendment is say that the \npenalty provision--the $37,500 a day--would be waived until September \n30. That would allow the EPA to get certified instructors into all the \nStates so the people who want to become certified can become \ncertified--in the meantime, not miss this summer's construction season. \nIt is a very simple thing. I can assure you, this is a huge jobs bill \nbecause right now these people are not working. We are talking about \nthousands and thousands, in just my State of Oklahoma, of \nsubcontractors who do this kind of work.\n  I strongly support the Collins-Inhofe amendment No. 4318. It is a \njobs bill. It is a bill of fairness.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, for clarification, I knew people were \nwalking around talking. I apologize to Senator Cardin. I have no \nobjection to him offering his amendment. I would say, I was wanting to \nget clarification on the amendment so I would know how I wanted to \nvote. That is all.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, we are about to go to a conference on the \nfinancial reform bill for Wall Street reform. I want to spend a few \nminutes to talk about some of the provisions that I think are extremely \nimportant to survive in conference.\n  What brought my attention to speak today is what is going on in \nEurope right now. You will hear people talk about this bill, and they \nwill say: Well, there is no problem anymore. We have straightened out \nthe mortgage problem. This all happened. Some kind of a typhoon came \nthrough here and wrecked the housing business. If we get that \nstraightened out, we can move right on.\n  I do not see it that way. I do not look at it as some kind of natural \ndisaster. Clearly, the housing bubble was a big part of it, but there \nwere still systemic problems in our financial system which have been \naround for quite a while. If you go back and look at the 1929 \nDepression, in 1933, the Senate of the United States and the House and \nthe President got together and we made rules and we made laws to \ncorrect it so it would never happen again. We passed a bill such as \nGlass-Steagall which basically said if you want to be a commercial \nbank, that is fine. But if you want to be a commercial bank, you cannot \nbe an investment bank. We put in the uptick rule on short selling. We \nput in margin requirements. We created the FDIC. The Congress of the \nUnited States legislated because it was such a serious problem.\n  For 50, 60 years we did not have a major problem. We had problems, \nbut not major problems. Think about before 1929. The 19th century was \nfull of bank panics. What happened? Why did we go through 50 or 60 \nyears without a problem?\n  I think when you look at it, you have to say we made some major \nmistakes during the late 1990s and into the 2000s in the way we carried \non our business in the financial market. One by one, we stripped away \nthese protections. It culminated in 1999 with the Graham-Leach-Bliley \nAct, which did away with Glass-Steagall. We allowed commercial banks to \nget into all kinds of businesses, all kinds of risky businesses. We \nallowed them to get into derivatives. Our regulators went home and \nsaid: Hey, look, we didn't need regulation. Let the free market work it \nout. Alan Greenspan and others were saying: Let the market work it out.\n  This was not just about housing. Housing is what set it off, but what \nreally set it off was we basically said, we do not need any regulators. \nWe decided to do play football, and we said: Do you know what. Those \nreferees on our football field keep blowing the whistle. How can we \nkeep playing when we have the referees blowing the whistle all the \ntime, closing things down? Let's get these referees off the field and \nlet the people play. We all know what happens in football, and we all \nsaw what happened here.\n  What concerns me the most is--I think we have done some good things \nto deal with the housing market and eliminating the housing bubble--\nwhat we see happening in Europe should send a real chill through the \nspine of everyone in this body. We have seen the EU and the IMF \nscramble to put together an almost $1 trillion emergency package to \nforestall a full-blown series of sovereign debt crises in one country \nafter another. Sound familiar? Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, AIG, and \non. Greece, Spain, Portugal. Sound familiar? We see what is happening \nthere.\n  German and French banks alone have more than $900 billion in exposure \nto Greece and other vulnerable Euro countries, including Ireland, \nPortugal, and Spain. Meanwhile, our top five banks have an estimated \n$2.5 trillion in exposures to Europe.\n  On the front page of today's Wall Street Journal there is an article \non how European banks are saddled with higher funding costs because of \nskepticism on whether the EU-IMF bailout plan will work.\n  I am a person who believes in the market. Look at what the market is \nsaying. The market is saying: You are going to have to pay a higher \nfunding cost. Do you know why? Because we are at risk. That is a sign. \nIt is not for people to sit around. We are at risk. Just like right \nnow, our major banks borrow at lower rates than every other bank in \nAmerica because people believe 75 basis points or 80 basis points--\nbecause people believe the market sends a clear message that they think \nthose banks are still too big to fail. So this is an example of what is \ngoing on in Europe and why we must make sure the bill that comes out of \nconference is strong and why we must make sure we have done away with \ntoo big to fail.\n\n  There are five issues I wish to talk about on the floor and go over \nthem. No. 1 is Merkley-Levin. People on the floor know that is a good \namendment, the President of the United States. The Volcker rule: Folks \nhave come to this floor and said the Volcker rule is already in this \nbill. Well, this bill says the Rocker rule is in here. The Volcker \nrule, as you will remember, says that commercial banks, banks, should \nnot be involved in proprietary trading.\n  If you want to be a commercial bank, be a commercial bank. That is \nwhat we set up when we set up Glass-Steagall. We said be a commercial \nbank. That is going to be a low-risk business. You may not get as high \na return if that is what you want to do, but do not get into these \nrisky things, do not get into this investment banking. Basically, what \nthis says is, do not get into the proprietary trading because \nproprietary trading can be risky. If you want to be a commercial bank, \nbe a commercial bank. So what the present bill says is that it supports \nthe Volcker rule. It says you can do proprietary trading, but then it \nsends it to the regulators, and says to the regulators, you can modify \nthis.\n  First of all, what is the Congress of the United States doing saying \nto regulators, you can modify this? The buck stops here with us. We \nshould lay down what the rules are. That is what we did in 1929. We \npassed laws. We made what the laws were. We do not turn them over to \nregulators. By the way, many of these regulators--not the people but \nthe people who were in those positions--were the reason why we got to \nwhere we are today, because they are the ones who pulled the referees \noff the field.\n  So one of the things we should look at clearly coming out of this \nconference is a strong Volcker rule, not one that can be modified by \nthe regulators, and that is basically the Merkley-Levin amendment.\n  The second thing is the provision by Senator Lincoln, the provision \non swaps dealers. The conference report should include Senator \nLincoln's provision to prohibit banks with swap dealers from receiving \nemergency Federal loans. Again, if you want to be a bank, be a bank. Do \nnot get into these high-risk businesses.\n  By forcing megabanks to spin off their swap dealer into an affiliate \nor separate company, section 716 of the Senate bill would help restore \nthe wall between the government-guaranteed part--the FDIC-insured \npart--of the financial system and those financial institutions, \nentities, that remain free to take on greater risk.\n  If you want to have risk, become an investment bank. Go into risky \nbusiness. Do not do that with commercial banks. Do not be luring our \ncommercial banks with up to, potentially, $2.5 trillion in exposure to \nEurope. How many derivatives? How much are they still in derivatives? \nThat is what this is about. Let's get them out of the risky business of \nderivatives.\n  Allowing massive derivatives dealers to be housed within banks \ncreates a moral hazard. Forcing banks to spin off large derivatives \ndealers would end this moral hazard and force swaps dealers to \nadequately price and capitalize the risks associated with these \nactivities. Again, commercial banks should be commercial banks. They \nshould not be in high-risk businesses.\n  Senator Collins' capital standards amendment. The conference report \nshould include some form of the Collins\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\namendment to ensure that bank holding companies and systemically \nsignificant nonbank financial institutions are subject to capital and \nleverage requirements as stringent as those that insured depository \ninstitutions face under existing prompt corrective action regulations. \nThat just makes good sense. Set up the same regulations.\n  This amendment would, therefore, raise the capital bar for our \nlargest financial institutions, requiring them to hold more committed \nand reliable forms of capital, namely, common equity and retained \nearnings. This makes good sense.\n  Representative Kanjorski's systemic risk amendment. The conference \nreport should include Representative Kanjorski's amendment to require \nthe council, following consultation with applicable prudential \nregulators, to take action against a financial institution that poses a \n``grave threat'' to U.S. financial stability. This just makes good \nsense.\n  These actions might include the imposition of enhanced capital and \nother prudential standards, activity restrictions, and the sale of \nassets or business lines, among others. This is what the regulators \nshould be doing. Hence, this amendment gives regulators added tools and \nauthority to impose strict standards and take preemptive actions \nagainst financial institutions that pose outsized risks to the overall \nsystem before a full-blown financial crisis occurs.\n  We cannot do what we have done before. We cannot say: Oh, everything \nis going great, and then one day wake up with this incredible hangover. \nWe cannot wait for a full-blown financial crisis. That is key. \nResolution is one thing--how to resolve it once you get there--but we \nhave to spend our time on prevention to make sure this never happens \nagain, we never get to that point.\n  Finally, Representative Speier's leverage amendment. The conference \nreport should include Representative Speier's amendment to require the \nFederal Reserve to set a minimum leverage level of 15 to 1 on all \nsystemically significant financial institutions. This is good financial \npractice.\n  A statutory leverage limit of this kind will ensure a capital floor \nfor our largest banks and help ensure that regulators do not miss the \nforest for the trees as they calibrate risk-based capital standards.\n  These are five important pieces to the puzzle that we should include \nin this financial regulatory reform when it comes back from the \nconference. This is our way to assure that never again do millions of \nAmericans find themselves out of work, millions of Americans find \nthemselves without a house, and that American taxpayers never again--\nnever again--will have to bail out the large banks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4191\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer amendment No. 4191.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4191.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for leasing activities in \n             certain areas of the outer Continental Shelf)\n\n       On page 81, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 30__.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     shall be used by the Secretary of the Interior for the \n     conduct of offshore preleasing, leasing, and related \n     activities in the North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, South \n     Atlantic, and Straits of Florida Planning Areas of the outer \n     Continental Shelf described in the memorandum entitled \n     ``Memorandum on Withdrawal of Certain Areas of the United \n     States Outer Continental Shelf from Leasing Disposition'', 34 \n     Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1111, dated June 12, 1998.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for allowing me the opportunity to offer this amendment. It \nimposes a moratorium on offshore drilling along the Atlantic coast and \nthe Straits of Florida. I have already talked about the amendment. I \nthank my colleagues for allowing it to be introduced.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, in a moment, I am going to ask for the \nregular order with respect to the Cornyn amendment for the purpose of \noffering a second-degree amendment to the Cornyn amendment with one \nadditional request for appropriations--namely, about $200 million for \nsome court personnel and related facilities to accommodate taking \nillegal immigrants who have violated the law by coming into the country \nillegally and, after processing through the court system with lawyers \navailable, incarcerating those people for 2 weeks or, if it is multiple \noffenses coming into the country illegally, for 30 days in most cases.\n  Where this has been done on the border, illegal immigration has \nalready come to a stop because going to jail represents a real \ndeterrent. To illustrate the difference between two sectors of the \nborder in Arizona, we can see how we could really make a difference for \na relatively small amount of money in controlling the border. It can be \ndone.\n  Arizona is divided into two halves. The eastern half is the Tucson \nsector; the western half, going into California for about 30 or 40 \nmiles, is the Yuma sector. Both have had huge problems with illegal \nimmigration.\n  In the last 5 years, illegal immigration in the Yuma sector has been \ncut by 94 percent. That is huge. There is one other sector on the \nborder somewhat similar, the Del Rio, TX, sector, where this Operation \nStreamline is also in effect. It has been cut dramatically there as \nwell.\n  In the other Arizona sector, Tucson, where Operation Streamline has \nnot been fully implemented, there are still about a quarter of a \nmillion people per year crossing the border who are apprehended. Nobody \nknows how many get across and are not apprehended. Estimates range from \nthree to four to five times as many. So in all likelihood, there are \nabout 1 million people crossing the border every year in the Tucson \nsector, about a quarter of whom are apprehended. We need to provide a \ndeterrent for those people so they realize they should not cross.\n  About 17 percent of the people who are apprehended when they try to \ncross illegally we find are criminals in the United States. They have \ncriminal records in the United States or are wanted for crimes here. \nObviously, those people do not want to be incarcerated when they are \ncaught. The remainder, the 83 percent, want to come here to work. They \njust want jobs. But they cannot be providing for their families back in \nMexico, El Salvador, or wherever they might be from if they are in \njail.\n  The Yuma sector experience has found that as a result, if they know \nfor a certainty that they are going to go to jail if they are caught, \nthey stop trying because it is simply not worth it to them, and they go \nsomeplace else on the border to try to come across. The number in Yuma \nis staggering. Five years ago, we were apprehending 118,500 immigrants. \nSo far this year, it is about 5,000.\n  I was there about 6 weeks ago. I talked with the head of the Border \nPatrol.\n  I said: What is it like just today?\n  He said: There is no activity.\n  I said: There has to be some.\n  He said: No. Most days, nobody tries to cross.\n  I said: That is pretty remarkable. Why?\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\n  He said: Three factors. We have 11 miles of double fencing in the \nYuma urban area, we have enough Border Patrol, and we have Operation \nStreamline.\n  There are some other assets. They have cameras. There are lights. The \nMarine Corps, which helps in the far eastern part of this sector near \nthe Barry Goldwater gunnery range, a place where jet airplanes fly and \ndrop bombs for practice, takes care of that. They have had pretty good \nluck there. But there are no pedestrian fences. It is all vehicle \nbarriers in that area. And there is some radar out there.\n  The bottom line is, with a combination of these things, what they \nhave found is they can secure the border. It is relatively \ninexpensive--I say ``relatively.'' You do have to have a defense \nlawyer, a prosecuting lawyer, a court clerk, a judge, a courtroom, and \nthen you have to lease the jail space. Those things can be done.\n  What we are hoping is that we can begin to apply this same concept to \nother sectors of the border and that in a relatively short period of \ntime, we can demonstrate that we can secure the border. When we do \nthat, not only will we have done what we are supposed to do as the \npeople who are in charge of enforcing the law, but then I think people \nwill have a much more open mind to consider other issues, such as \nelements of comprehensive immigration reform. As I have said, we do not \nneed comprehensive reform to secure the border, but we do need to \nsecure the border to get comprehensive immigration reform. And this is \na good-faith effort to do it.\n  We have provided the funding. I will read it. It is very brief. This \nis an additional amount to fully fund--it is called multiagency law \nenforcement initiatives; ``multi'' because it is both the Department of \nHomeland Security and Department of Justice.\n  These are already authorized under title II of the public law, but \nthis would be $200 million, $155 million available for the Department \nof Justice and the remainder, $45 million, available for the judiciary. \nThat is for courthouse renovation, administrative support, including \nhiring additional judges. The first part is hiring additional deputy \nU.S. marshals, constructing or leasing temporary detention space, and \nrelated needs of the Department of Homeland Security or Attorney \nGeneral.\n  At this time let me ask unanimous consent to return to regular order \nfor the Cornyn amendment, if that is the appropriate procedure for \noffering my amendment as a second-degree thereto.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4202\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4228 to Amendment No. 4202\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I then send to the desk amendment No. 4228. \nThis is a Kyl-McCain amendment that would be offered as a second-degree \namendment to the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 4228 to amendment No. \n     4202.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent further reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To appropriate $200,000,000 for a law enforcement initiative \n to address illegal crossings of the Southwest border, with an offset)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       (j) Operation Streamline.--For an additional amount to \n     fully fund multi-agency law enforcement initiatives that \n     address illegal crossings of the Southwest border, including \n     those in the Tucson Sector, as authorized under title II of \n     Division B and title III of Division C of Public Law 111-117, \n     $200,000,000, of which--\n       (1) $155,000,000 shall be available for the Department of \n     Justice for--\n       (A) hiring additional Deputy United States Marshals;\n       (B) constructing additional permanent and temporary \n     detention space; and\n       (C) established and other related needs of the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security and the Attorney General; and\n       (2) $45,000,000 shall be available for the Judiciary for--\n       (A) courthouse renovation;\n       (B) administrative support, including hiring additional \n     clerks for each District to process additional criminal \n     cases; and\n       (C) hiring additional judges.\n       (k) Offsetting Rescission.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 5 of the American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), \n     $200 million of the amounts appropriated or made available \n     under Division A of such Act that remain unobligated as of \n     the date of the enactment of this Act are hereby rescinded.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I see another colleague here wishing to speak. I have \nalready explained the amendment, but I will summarize it by saying we \nneed to control the border. I believe it can be done. The Yuma sector \nrepresents a good example of how it can be done.\n  I understand the President will be requesting some additional funding \nfor some additional personnel and so on. The Cornyn amendment would \nprovide funding specifically for some of the personnel who are needed \non the border and some of the related activity, both Federal and State. \nOur second-degree amendment, offered for Senator McCain and myself, \nwould simply add the funding necessary to implement the Operation \nStreamline portion of this that would provide the deterrent so people \nwould not want to cross the border illegally because if they got \ncaught, there would be a virtual certainty they would be incarcerated \nfor a relatively short period of time but more, obviously, than any of \nthem want to spend in jail.\n  For this deterrent to work we need this additional funding. I hope \nwhen we have an opportunity to vote my colleagues will ask any \nquestions. I am willing to discuss this on the Senate floor or \nprivately if they like. There is a lot of other information we can \nprovide that describes this. I think it is a reasonable approach and \ncertainly on this supplemental appropriation legislation--which helps \nto fund the military needs of our country, even the National Guard if \nthat is to be funded. This is a complement to that which I think is \ntotally appropriate in this particular legislation.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' indulgence and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                     In Praise of Steve Shackleton\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise once again to recognize one of \nour Nation's great Federal employees.\n  This weekend, Americans will be observing Memorial Day, which also \nmarks the unofficial start of summer. It is a tradition for families to \ngather at picnics and spend time together outdoors. Many will be \nvisiting parks, trails, and historical sites administered by the \nNational Park Service.\n  Every year, when Americans travel to our national parks--as many will \ndo this weekend they often take for granted the outstanding work \nperformed by National Park Service rangers.\n  The men and women who protect our National Park System and watch over \nthe safety of its visitors come from diverse backgrounds, yet they \nshare a dedication to public service and an abiding love for the land \nwe all so cherish.\n  The parks they administer on our behalf showcase the diversity of our \ncountry's splendid natural geography. From Yellowstone to the \nShenandoah, from the gates of the Arctic to the Great Smoky Mountains, \nthese parks provide a refuge for wildlife and preserve our natural and \ncultural heritage.\n  The experience of visiting these parks is often awe-inspiring. Surely \nall who have ever stood at the rim of the Grand Canyon or at the foot \nof a giant California Redwood felt their majesty and the stirrings of \ntranquility they inspire.\n  These parks, trails, and historic sites are an excellent place to \ntake children, where they can learn firsthand about nature and the \nimportance of conservation.\n  This is why I have been working with Senator Carper to establish the \nfirst State national historical park in Delaware, which would preserve \nsites important to our State's colonial history. Currently, Delaware is \nthe only State without a national park.\n  Indeed, our great national parks, with their pristine natural beauty \nand vast expanses of solitude, have stirred their souls of millions.\n  We have so much to learn from these parks, and so much to experience. \nTrue remain the words from Shakespeare, who wrote of the wilderness \nthat in it we may ``find tongues in trees, books\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\nin running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in every thing.''\n  Today, as my great Federal employee of the week, I have chosen to \nhonor one of the dedicated rangers who keep visitors to our national \nparks safe, informed, and able to experience the parks' wonders.\n  Steve Shackleton has been a national park ranger for over a quarter-\ncentury. He began his service in the 1980s at the Grand Teton National \nPark in Wyoming, where he worked in the areas of search and rescue, \nemergency medicine, and law enforcement. During that time, he spent six \nsummers fighting fires in California's Sierra National Forest.\n  Steve spent 14 years in Hawaii and Alaska working on resource \nprotection management. He holds bachelor's and master's of science \ndegrees in criminology from California State University in Fresno and a \nmaster's of public administration from the University of Alaska, \nAnchorage.\n  In the late 1990s, Steve came to Washington, where he spent 3 years \nworking in the National Park Service's legislative office and \nundertaking a fellowship right here in the U.S. Senate. Afterward, \nSteve became the superintendent of the Pinnacles National Monument in \nCalifornia's central coast region.\n  From 2004-2005, he participated in the OPM's Federal Senior Executive \nCandidate Development Program, which included study at Harvard's \nKennedy School of Government and Stanford's Graduate School of \nBusiness.\n  For the last 7 years, Steve served as the chief ranger at Yosemite \nNational Park. In that role, he directed the park's programs in law \nenforcement, wilderness management, fire prevention, search and rescue, \nand remote medicine.\n  This February, Steve was asked to return to Washington, where he now \nserves as the National Park Service's Associate Director for Visitors \nand Resource Protection.\n  Steve's love of nature and America's natural heritage can be traced \nto his father, Lee Shackleton, who himself had a long career as a park \nranger. Steve and his wife, Jane, have passed along this tradition of \ncaring for nature to their daughter, Dana, who is studying veterinary \nmedicine at the University of California, Davis.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the great work of \nSteve Shackleton and all of America's national park rangers. This \nsummer, they will continue to watch over the safety of visitors and \nserve as their guides to the splendor of our national parks.\n  The men and women of the National Park Service are all truly great \nFederal employees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4232\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the bill before us and also call up two amendments.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. COBURN. We have before us almost a $60 billion emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. This is about the eighth supplemental \nbill we have discussed since I have been in the Senate--some \nappropriate, some not.\n  But the thing that I think the American people need to know, given \nthe fact that this week our debt will be $13 trillion--this week--and \nthat does not count what we owe trust funds inside the government, \naccount money we have stolen from Social Security that will have to be \npaid back; it does not count money that has been taken from the oil \nrecovery fund that will have to be paid back; it does not count the \nmoney from the inland waterway trust fund and all of these other trust \nfunds. That is $13 trillion outside of what we have borrowed from \nourselves--$13 trillion.\n  So we have before us a bill that is an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill, and I thought it would be interesting for the \nAmerican people to see what the rules of the Senate say about what is \nan ``emergency'' because nobody can say the war is an emergency. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, there has been no emergency other than the fact \nthat we knew we were going to war. And the fact is, we have known that \nat least for the last 5 or 6 years. Nobody can say that.\n  But when you look at the definition we are supposed to follow--our \nown rules--about emergency designations, there are five \ncharacteristics, and those five characteristics are, one, it is \nnecessary, it is essential, and it is vital. Well, some of this bill is \nnecessary, some of it is essential, and some of it is vital--not all of \nit is by any means.\n  No. 2: Sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over \ntime. Well, this bill certainly does not meet that requirement, except \nfor a very small section of it.\n  An urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action. \nThere is no immediate action here on anything, except maybe the FEMA \nportion for both the upper Northeast and the flooding and Nashville, \nTN, and its flooding. But we have $900 million sitting in FEMA right \nnow that has not been spent that we can start spending, so we don't \nhave to pass $5 billion right now.\n  Unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated. Well, the war certainly \nwasn't unforeseen, it certainly wasn't unpredictable, and it certainly \nwasn't unanticipated. We have known it. So it certainly doesn't meet \nthat definition.\n  It is not permanent, it is not temporary in nature.\n  So we have what we are supposed to be following, and I would portend \nthat 98 percent of this bill doesn't meet the requirements of being an \nemergency designation. Yet why are we calling it an emergency \ndesignation? There is one real reason for that; that is, we don't have \nto confine it in with the total amount we are authorized to spend. This \nis outside of what we are going to spend. It is $60 billion that we are \ngoing to borrow. We are going to borrow it. We are going to borrow it \nfrom the children of the people who are in Afghanistan and Iraq who are \nfighting this war. The people in this body aren't going to pay it back. \nWe are going to kiss it goodbye and we are going to say: Here is your \npresent, grandchildren. Here is a present for the kids of the \nwarfighter who is over there today, who is sacrificing, his family is \nsacrificing, her family is sacrificing. But we are going to borrow it \nfrom them.\n  And it is not that we haven't done it. We made a big fanfare about \nthat we were going to institute pay-go; that we were not going to \nviolate pay-go; that pay-go was going to force discipline on us. So we \npassed a statute, and the President had a big signing--except here is \nwhat has happened since we have signed it.\n  It was signed into law on February 12.\n  On February 24, we violated pay-go. We said the rule doesn't apply; \nwe have a need; we are going to spend $46 billion. So we spent $46 \nbillion outside of the budget. We borrowed $46 billion. Oops.\n  March 2. We don't have the courage to eliminate lower priority parts \nof the government. We borrowed another $10 billion.\n  All of a sudden, on March 3, then we borrowed $99 billion. Pay-go \ndidn't count. We just said: We waive pay-go. Sixty votes of the Senate. \nWe have no fiscal discipline--$99 billion.\n  April 14. We borrowed $18 billion. Did it again.\n  So if you add those up--and that doesn't count the last one we did. I \nwill bring a more accurate chart tomorrow when I talk about the rest of \nthese amendments. But so far, we have borrowed $173 billion, when we \nsaid we are not going to borrow money anymore because we are going to \nhave pay-go that says that will force the discipline on us to put lower \npriorities off the spending line, to put higher priorities on.\n  So just since February 12--it is now late May--we have borrowed $173 \nbillion. We are going to add $60 billion here, and we have a tax \nextender package that is coming with another $230 billion. That is $563 \nbillion since February 12 that we are going to spend money--I \nunderstand the majority leader is on the floor. Would you like time, \nMr. Leader?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate my friend yielding. I am here. Why don't you \nproceed, and when I get the necessary--\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield to the leader.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. COBURN. So $\\1/2\\ trillion since we famously passed pay-go, and \nwe are going to waive it six times, and when we haven't waived it, we \nhave declared something an ``emergency'' so we do not have pay-go law \napplying. The budget rules go out the window because it is an \nemergency--except we do not meet the criteria for emergencies by our \nown definition.\n  So what is this all about? Is it about playing a shell game with the \nAmerican people, to say we are going to do one thing and then turn \naround and, before July 1, in 5 months--less than 5 months--we are \ngoing to borrow another $\\1/2\\ trillion after we tell the American \npeople: Oh, no, we are not going to do that anymore.\n  We have an emergency. There is no question this country has an \nemergency. Do you know what it is? It is a $13 trillion debt we have \ntoday that is going to be $23 trillion 8 years from now. We have a debt \nthat is going to suppress our GDP by 1\\1/2\\ to 2 percent in what we \ncould normally grow because the government's debt is such a burgeoning \nhangover on the capital markets. Yet we don't have the ability to do \nwhat we promised the American people we would do.\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\n  You know, I feel as if I ought to read the signing statement of \nPresident Obama when he signed pay-go and the statements of all of my \ncolleagues that said: This is the answer. Except that will not do any \ngood. The only answer is for the American people to hold us \naccountable. I obviously can't. For 5\\1/2\\ years, I have been trying to \ntamp down spending, to have us make a position that we are going to go \nto the lowest priority, cut the lowest priority out so we can fund the \nhighest priority, and we have refused to do that.\n  So does it have real consequences, what we are doing today? There is \nno question this bill is going to pass. There are votes in this body to \npass and add another $60 billion. What are the consequences? Well, the \nconsequences come about to our children.\n  You have seen this sign before. This is Madeline. This photo was shot \nof Madeline as she walked around Capitol Hill. I actually had a visit \nwith her and her parents. When we first put this up here, she was only \n$38,000 in debt. That was less than 6 months ago. Less than 6 months \nago, she only owed $38,000--per man, woman, and child in this country. \nShe is at $42,000 now. When we finish what we do before July 1, she \nwill be close to $50,000--per person in this country. If you \nextrapolate what the budgets are going to be over the next 8 years, she \nis going to be close to $200,000 in debt. And that does not count the \nunfunded liability.\n  When this little lady is 28 years old, her responsibility, both in \nterms of debt and unfunded liability, will be $1,113,000. We never \nthink about it in terms of young lives and how we are impacting them. \nWe can always rationalize away the ability to make hard choices. That \nis what we are doing. Does anybody in this body not think we couldn't \nsqueeze $60 billion out of $3 trillion? Could we not do that? Are there \nthings less important than fighting the war? Are there things that are \nmore important about our future and less important about irritating \nsome special interest group because their program did not get funded? \nWhich is it? I vote with the kids and the grandkids. They supposedly \nhave a voice, except we routinely ignore it. That is what we are doing \nwith this bill.\n  I am not saying we should not fund the war. I am not saying we should \nnot create the money for FEMA for the projects we need. I am not even \nsaying we should not help Haiti where we can. What I am saying is that \nwe ought to pay for it by making hard choices that every family right \nnow is making. They are having to make choices between what is an \nabsolute must and everything else that is not. They don't have the \nluxury of an unlimited debt service because their credit card company \nhas already said: You can't have any more. Their bank has already said: \nNo, you can't borrow any more. Their house and its equity has been \nmaxed out. They don't have any other choices. So they make the hard \nchoices.\n  We are kidding ourselves if we think we have another choice. We don't \nhave another choice. We are just delaying the time at which we make the \nchoice. The pain associated with delay is going to be twice as great as \nthe pain of doing it now.\n  John McCain and I are offering two amendments. The whole purpose of \nthe amendments is to give the body a couple of choices on how to pay \nfor this. It is not easy, it is not fun. But is it necessary? Is it \nnecessary for the health of our Nation? Is it necessary that we start \nacting in the way the American people expect us to, which means we are \ngoing to get rid of the things that are not as important as the things \nin this bill?\n  I understand that is novel because the Congress has only had one net \nrescission in the last 16 years. It occurred with the 1996 \nappropriations bill where we actually cut total government spending in \n1996. We had the will to do it. The appropriators had the will to do \nit. But we don't have that will anymore. The environment we face as a \ncountry is three or four times more severe for our future than it was \nin 1996.\n  So what is the disconnect? What is the disconnect that we would not \nmake hard choices? I am not going to say my choices are the best \nchoices; they are just my choices. But it ought to be rolled back to \nthe appropriators that this bill should have never come to the floor \nunpaid for. They know more about spending than anybody in this body. \nThey are more qualified to make the cuts. But they chose not to make \nthe cuts in lower priority items to pay for this bill.\n  What is the choice? The choice is to indenture our children and \ngrandchildren. That is the choice we are making. When we choose not to \ndo it, we are choosing proactively to indenture our children and \ngrandchildren. We are better than that.\n  What is so sacrosanct? Do you realize in 2 weeks in December we found \n640 instances of duplicate programs that had exactly the same goals \nwith multiple sets, 70 programs for food and nutrition for hungry \npeople. Why do we have 70 programs to help poor people get food? Nobody \ncan rationally explain why. We just have it. The reason we have 70 is \nbecause we used to have 40. We didn't have any metrics on it so \nsomebody thought we ought to have another program for feeding hungry \npeople. So we put another program together. Then we funded it. But we \ndidn't have any metrics on it. So then we did it again, and we continue \nto do it.\n  There are 640 different instances just like that, 70 programs to feed \nthe hungry across 6 different agencies--not just 1 but 6, none of them \nwith metrics, none of them working to see if they actually work, no \noversight hearings by the Appropriations Committee to see if they work \nor the authorizing committee to see if they work. We have 70.\n  There are 105 to incentivize kids to go into math, engineering, \nscience, and technology, 105 programs across 9 agencies. That is just 2 \nexamples out of the 640 sets of duplication we found.\n  Where are we going to eliminate some of that? When are we going to \naccomplish what the American people are asking us to do? It is not \nabout eliminating food for the hungry. It is not about eliminating \nincentives. It is about eliminating the management structure for 70 \nprograms or 105 programs so we can have one or two good ones, and we \ncan have metrics on them.\n  I yield to the majority leader.\n\n\n                            Cloture Motions\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have two cloture motions at the desk. I \nask that they be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motions having been presented \nunder rule XXII, the clerk will report the motions to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee-\n     reported substitute amendment to H.R. 4899, an act making \n     emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and \n     summer jobs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.\n         Harry Reid, Richard Durbin, John D.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. We now have cloture filed on a $60 billion bill. I don't \nknow what the intentions of the majority leader are but the fact is, we \nare going to limit debate. We have been on this bill about a day or a \nday and a half, $60 billion. We are going to cut off debate. We are \ngoing to attempt to limit amendments and limit the debate. This is a \ndebate this country ought to be having. This is an opportunity for us \nto do what the American people want us to do.\n  So 30 hours from now we will have a vote on cloture on this bill. We \nalso have cloture to end debate filed as well. What does that mean? \nThat means the American people are not going to get to hear everything \nthat is in the bill, No. 1. That means there will be a very limited \nnumber of amendments that will be actually voted on.\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\n  By rule, we are going to close off our responsibility to Madeline. We \nare going to say: Madeline, you don't count. We have to get out of \nhere. Don't you know Memorial Day vacation is coming? So we don't want \nto be here. We have codels leaving Saturday morning. That has to be \nmore important than saving the Republic so we don't end up like Greece.\n  We are only about 4 or 5 years behind them. We are only 4 or 5 years \nbehind Greece. We are going to see this tremendous money flow come into \nthis country because people are worried about Europe. We are going to \nsee it come in from Japan because people will be worried about Japan \nbeing able to pay their debts. We will feel all good and fuzzy for \nabout 2 years. After they inflate their currency or debase it or \ndefault, the money is going to flow right back out. Guess who is going \nto be looking over the abyss. The United States of America. We will be \nat the same point. What is the problem? The problem is their spending \nas a percentage of their GDP creates an environment where they can't \npay for their debt. That is where we are going to be.\n  My first degree was in accounting. I had a business career for 9 \nyears before medical school. I can tell my colleagues, if we truly \naccounted for the liabilities of this government, including Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac--we refuse to recognize their liability--our debt would \nbe far in excess of $13 trillion. So what we are going to do is say \nSenators' comfort is much more important than Madeline's future.\n  Let's talk for a minute about what the word ``indentured'' means. \nThat means you are under the control of somebody else. Your ability to \nhave free choice becomes limited because you are indentured. Is there \nany wonder why we have trouble bringing hard core sanctions against \nIran, when the Chinese own $900 billion of our debt and the Russians \nhave $800 billion? Our debt affects our foreign policy. Our ability to \nsupport our military is jeopardized by the very fact that we are making \na decision today to pay $33 billion for the war effort in Afghanistan \nby not paying for it. We are jeopardizing our long-term future.\n  The other ironic thing in this bill, this body just passed a \nfinancial regulatory reform bill, but we created a commission called \nthe Financial Inquiry Commission. In this bill we are appropriating on \nan emergency basis $1.8 million for that inquiry commission that is \ngoing to give us what went wrong and what we need to do about it in \nDecember. We have already figured out we don't need them; We passed a \nbill without that knowledge, without that look, without that in-depth \nanalysis of what went wrong because we had to get it done. Yet we are \ngoing to continue to fund a Financial Inquiry Commission that we are \nnot going to do anything with the results of, and we are going to call \nit an emergency.\n  How ludicrous is that? The whole purpose of the Financial Inquiry \nCommission was to guide Congress in what to do. We have already ignored \nthem. We have already decided what we are going to do. That bill is in \nconference. We are going to pass a financial regulatory reform bill \nultimately that is devoid of the recommendations of that commission. \nBut we are going to do the typical Washington thing. We are going to \ncontinue to fund the commission, even though we are not going to use \nits results. Why is that?\n  What does just $1.8 million out of a $60 billion bill, what does that \nmean for her? Multiply that times thousands of times every year, the \nstuff that we are doing that isn't a priority. Nobody can agree it is \nstill a priority that we ought to borrow $1.8 million to fund that \ncommission. You can't argue that is still a priority because we have \nalready made up our minds on financial regulation reform. But that \nhappens thousands of times a year, billions and billions and billions \nof dollars.\n  These two amendments are tough amendments. I am not deceiving myself \nto think that all of a sudden grown-ups are going to show up in the \nSenate. They are not. Let me tell my colleagues what they do. The first \namendment will reduce our own budget. We gave ourselves a nice stellar \nraise, not salarywise but for our own budgets. We are going to reduce \nthat budget for Members of Congress.\n  We are going to disclose on the Senate Web site the cost of borrowing \nmoney and how many times we violate our own rules, pay-go. There should \nbe nobody who voted for pay-go who votes against that because if it is \ngood enough for us to use, it is good enough for the American people to \nsee.\n  We are going to dispose of unneeded and unused Federal Government \nproperty, whether it is military, whether it is buildings, whether it \nis lands--things we do not use, do not need but we are spending $8 \nbillion a year taking care of. We can get tremendous savings from that. \nThat is what any other right-minded person would do. They would get rid \nof the stuff they are not using so they do not continue to send money \ndown a rat hole.\n  We are going to rescind uncommitted and unspent Federal funds. We \nhave hundreds of billions of dollars setting that are not even in the \npipeline, and we are going to borrow more rather than more efficiently \nuse money we have. That is the first amendment; it is $60 billion, \n$60.5 billion.\n  The second amendment is $59.6 billion. It is a 1-year freeze on \nbonuses and raises and other salary increases for Federal employees. \nThey make 45 percent more than everybody else in this country doing \nexactly the same thing, on average. We are going to cap the total \nnumber of Federal employees. We have added 180,000 Federal employees in \nthe last 18 months--180,000.\n  We are going to collect unpaid taxes from Federal employees. We have \nFederal employees who are working today who owe the Federal Government \n$3 billion. We ought to collect that money. It ought to come out of \ntheir paychecks. That is undisputed debt; that is not the disputed \nportion. That is the undisputed portion of what they owe the IRS. For \neverything except DOD we are going to ask for a 5-percent efficiency \ngain in administration. Do more with less. Everybody else in this \ncountry is doing more with less, except the Federal Government. We are \ngoing to say: No, we cannot do that? Why not? It is interesting, on the \nDebt Commission we had a good discussion with Dave Cote, who is the CEO \nof Honeywell, explaining that every year they do more with less. They \nspend less dollars to get more out. They have less people to produce \nthe same amount. It is called efficiency. It is called productivity--\nexcept we will not apply that to our own government employees.\n  We are going to reduce nonessential government travel. It is billions \nof dollars a year. If we are in a financial pinch--and I would love for \nsomebody to debate me that we are not--why would we not limit travel to \nthat which is only essential?\n  We are going to rescind money that Chairman Obey in the House \nrecognized on the WIC Program is not being used. We are going to strike \n$68 million in U.N. emergency funding for the next fiscal year. Most of \nthe Members of this body voted for an amendment that required \ntransparency in the U.N. We give them over $6 billion a year. Twenty-\nsix percent of the budget for U.N. peacekeeping is ours; we pay for it. \nYet with an audit of their moneys, half of their moneys--over 60 \npercent of it--was found to be fraudulent. So we passed an amendment \nout of the Senate, unanimously, that required transparency from the \nU.N., except when it got to the conference committee it was not there \nanymore.\n  I will tell you, the American people deserve to know where their \nmoney is being wasted at the U.N. So we ought to clip that. We ought to \ncut that back. We ought to say: You give us transparency; we will give \nyou money. You do not give us transparency; we will not give you money.\n  We are going to eliminate bonuses for poor contractor performance. Do \nyou realize the Federal Government pays bonuses for companies that \nnever complete their contracts? Two years ago, the Pentagon paid out $4 \nbillion in bonuses to contractors who did not meet the standards for \nthe bonus, but they paid them anyway. Well, that makes a joke of the \ncontracting process. It also makes a joke out of us that we would allow \nthat to continue to happen.\n  So on these two amendments you will have plenty of opportunity with \nwhich to make a decision on whether you want to be on the side of \nMadeline or on the side of the elitism in Washington--the group that \ndoes not care what America thinks. We know better. The group that says: \nWe are not in an emergency. We are not in a problem. We can continue to \nspend money and not make hard choices.\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\n  There is an emergency, and the emergency is our very survival, our \neconomic survival, our survival as a republic.\n  I will close with the following: If you study the Roman Empire or if \nyou study the Athenian Empire, you will find common threads among both. \nThe No. 1 common thread is they fell after they became indentured in \ntheir own fiscal policies. They could no longer support their military. \nTheir elected bodies refused to make tough choices.\n  We are sitting here saying: Europe, you have to make tough choices. \nYou have to get your spending in line with your productivity. We are \ntalking with a hollow ring to our voice because if there is anybody who \nneeds to get their spending in priority, it is us. I am not against \npaying for the war. I am not against supporting our troops. I am not \nagainst the FEMA money we need. I am against us not paying for it, and \nI am very disappointed we have cloture filed this evening because what \nthat means is the American people are not going to see how we as \nindividual Members vote on tough choices.\n  I am going to have two tough choices out there. It remains to be seen \nwhether we get a chance to vote on them through the majority's ability \nto cut off debate. But we ought to. We ought to do what is the best, \nright thing for the country. We ought to be able to come together and \nagree we should not abuse the emergency designation; that we should not \nabuse pay-go; that, in fact, we should not delay making the hard \nchoices because the choices are just going to get harder. They are \ngoing to get harder every year we do not do this.\n  Now is the time to start doing it. If we choose not to, then what we \nare saying is: Madeline, as to your future, we are going to steal it \nfrom you. We are going to steal opportunities for a future like we have \nhad. We are going to take those, and we are going to indenture her to \nan economy that does not grow, with opportunities for an education that \nwill be limited, including the ability to own her own home. All those \nthings will come around.\n  We only have three ways to get out of the problem we are in. The \nfirst way is we can default. Everybody says: Oh, no, you cannot say \nthat. You cannot talk about that. Well, when Moody's is getting ready \nto downgrade our bonds from AAA, that is the first sign we are moving \nin that direction.\n  The second thing we can do is have the Federal Reserve inflate our \nway out of it to where that means the life savings of everybody are \ngoing to be debased, and their purchasing power is going to go away or \nmarkedly be reduced.\n  Or we can do the third thing: Not let either of those two bad things \nhappen by making hard choices ourselves on what we need to be doing--by \neliminating the junk, the waste, the duplication, and the fraud in the \nFederal Government. It is there. It is there to the tune of $300 \nbillion a year.\n  So when this extender package comes--whether it comes this week or \nnext week or the week when we come back--there is plenty of money to \npay for it, too, if we will just stand and be counted, not as Senators \nbut as Americans who would like to see the future bright for their \nMadelines.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to strongly \nsupport the legislation called the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act. With \nall we have seen in the gulf coast over the past several weeks, I have \nto say I am more committed than ever in moving forward on three fronts \nto protect our taxpayers, our families, and all of our workers across \nthe country.\n  First of all, I am going to keep working to hold BP accountable and \nmake sure taxpayers in Washington State and across the country are not \nleft holding the bag for this devastation. This is exactly what the Big \nOil Bailout Prevention Act is going to do.\n  Secondly, I am going to fight to guarantee that what we are seeing in \nthe gulf coast is never allowed to happen on the west coast.\n  Third, I am going to make sure BP, Transocean, and all industry \nowners and operators are doing everything possible to protect their \nworkers and make sure tragedies like this do not ever happen again. \nHere are the facts:\n  On April 20, 2010, there was a massive blowout and explosion on a BP \noil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven workers are still missing \nand presumed dead, and 17 more were injured. That explosion caused a \ngushing spill that has now poured hundreds of thousands of barrels of \noil into the gulf and threatens still to spill millions more. It has, \nas we all know, created an environmental and economic tragedy the \nmagnitude of which we are only just beginning to comprehend.\n  It is threatening entire communities and industry, and now the oil \nand chemical dispersants that are being sprayed into the gulf have the \npotential to kill underwater wildlife and create underwater ``dead \nzones'' for decades to come.\n  Those are the facts. Now, the questions are: Who should be \nresponsible for this cleanup? Who should bear the burden for big oil's \nmistakes? Should it be the taxpayers, families, and small business \nowners who are already being asked to bear so much today or should it \nbe the companies responsible for this spill, including BP--a company, \nby the way, that made $6.1 billion in profit in the first 3 months of \n2010 alone.\n  I cosponsored the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act because, to me, the \nanswer is pretty clear: I believe BP needs to be held accountable for \nthe environmental and economic damage of this spill. I am going to \nfight to make sure taxpayers do not end up losing a single dime to pay \nfor the mess this big oil company created.\n  To me, this is an issue of fundamental fairness. If an oil company \ncauses a spill, they should be the one to clean it up and pay for it--\nnot taxpayers. This bill I am talking about this evening eliminates the \ncurrent $75 million cap on oil company liability so taxpayers will \nnever be left holding the bag for big oil's mistakes.\n  This is straightforward, it is common sense, and it is fair. I have \nto say, I am extremely disappointed this commonsense bill continues to \nbe blocked by some Republicans every time we bring it up. But I want \nyou to know, I am going to keep fighting for the Big Oil Bailout \nPrevention Act to pass, and I am going to keep fighting so families and \ntaxpayers in Washington State and across the country do not end up \nholding the bag.\n  The bottom line is this: If oil companies are going to make billions \nof dollars in profits when times are good, they should not be allowed \nto leave taxpayers hanging when they create a problem.\n  The Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act writes this commonsense policy \ninto law, and I urge every Senator to side with our taxpayers and \nsupport this important legislation. But I do not think that is enough. \nI have always been opposed to drilling off the coast of my home State \nof Washington, and this tragedy is just one more very painful reminder \nof the potential consequences of opening up our west coast to drilling.\n  The economic and environmental devastation that was caused by the \nExxon Valdez disaster 20 years ago is now still impacting industry in \nmy home State of Washington. Our coastal region supports over 150,000 \njobs, and it generates almost $10 billion in economic activity, all of \nwhich would be threatened if drilling were to happen off our west \ncoast.\n  That is why I am going to keep fighting for legislation that bans \ndrilling off the west coast and makes sure big oil companies are never \nallowed to roll the dice with Washington State's economy and our \nenvironment.\n  We need to hold big oil accountable and we need to make sure that \ndisasters such as this never happen again, but we also have to remember \nthe workers who were killed and injured in this horrible tragedy. We \ncannot forget this is an issue that is larger than this one tragedy. \nThe entire oil and gas industry has a deplorable record of worker and \nworkplace safety. We have to make sure every worker is treated properly \nand protected, and that companies that mistreat their workers are held \naccountable.\n  We know the oil industry is able to operate under stricter safety \nstandards\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nand regulations because they are already doing just that in Europe and \nin Australia, and even in Contra Costa County, CA, where the county has \na set of stricter guidelines that have now reduced injuries and \nfatality rates. But we also know that worker safety should not be \nmeasured just by injury rates. We should be looking at reducing \ndangerous conditions--conditions such as fires or hazardous spills or \nreleases of toxic gases. Then when accidents do happen, we have to \nrecord them, we need to learn from them, and we need to build on a \nprogram to prevent them from ever happening again; and we need to make \nsure our workers are treated with respect and their rights are \nprotected.\n  That is exactly why I am so concerned about the recent reports of \nvery callous and unacceptable treatment of Transocean workers in the \nhours following that April 20 explosion. Those reports suggest that \nTransocean put their bottom line above safety standards, above \nenvironmental impact, and the well-being of their workers. I have \ncalled on the company to release copies of legal waivers that surviving \ncrew members of the Deepwater Horizon were reportedly forced to sign \nfollowing that oil rig explosion. I am going to stay on top of this to \nmake sure that Transocean produces those requested documents so we can \nget to the bottom of exactly how this situation was handled.\n  Workers everywhere ought to be confident that their employers are \nputting their safety first, and companies that betray that trust have \nto be held accountable. So I am going to work to make sure that \nhappens, and I am going to continue fighting to keep drilling away from \nthe Washington State coastline. I am going to keep pushing for this \nbill to make sure taxpayers don't have to pay for big oil's mistakes.\n  Anyone deciding whether to support this legislation ought to ask \nthemselves a few simple questions: Who are you fighting for? Who are \nyou trying to help? Are you here to protect and shield big oil \ncompanies or are you going to fight for our families and our taxpayers? \nI support this legislation because, to me, the answer is pretty clear. \nI urge all of our colleagues to allow this bill to pass so our \ntaxpayers in my home State of Washington and across the country can be \nprotected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Senate Daily Digest proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer some \namendments and to call up several amendments regarding the emergency \ndisaster loan program and SBA disaster loan relief on the underlying \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily set \naside to call up amendment No. 4179, which should be at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4179.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To allow the Administrator of the Small Business \n Administration to create or save jobs by providing interest relief on \n  certain outstanding disaster loans relating to damage caused by the \n     2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes or the 2008 Gulf Coast hurricanes)\n\n       On page 74, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n                               CHAPTER 12\n\n                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES\n\n                     Small Business Administration\n\n                     disaster loans program account\n\n       From unobligated balances in the appropriations account \n     appropriated under this heading, up to $100,000,000 shall be \n     available to the Administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration to waive the payment, for a period of not more \n     than 3 years, of not more than $15,000 in interest on loans \n     made under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     636(b)): Provided, That funds made available under this \n     heading may be used for any business located in an area \n     affected by a hurricane occurring during 2005 or 2008 for \n     which the President declared a major disaster under section \n     401 of the Robert T.

Res. 13 (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on \n     the budget for fiscal year 2010: Provided further, That the \n     amount made available under this heading is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 4(g) of the \n     Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139; 2 \n     U.S.C. 933(g)).\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have a series of amendments that will, \nI believe, give some direct relief and support to individuals and \nbusinesses that are struggling with the disaster that is going on in \nthe gulf area, as the Presiding Officer and everyone is aware. We have \na terrible situation on our hands. I know the Federal Government, \nparticularly the Coast Guard and the Department of the Interior, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and others are doing everything they \ncan to stop the flow of this oil and to cap this well. While it is BP's \nresponsibility, it is also our responsibility to make sure it gets done \nas soon as possible, and I know that is being worked on at many \ndifferent levels.\n  But in the meantime, as the Presiding Officer can imagine, there is a \ntremendous amount of angst on behalf of the families and businesses \nalong the gulf coast. Many have already, unfortunately, been directly \naffected in a very negative way.\n  So many of us have been working now for weeks thinking about what \nthings we could do that could give some direct relief and support and \nhelp that didn't cost the Federal Government a huge amount of money, \nbecause we understand we are in fiscal times of constraint, but we also \nneed to give help to people, and some confidence, now knowing that BP \nhas said, and under the law will be required, to pick up the full tab \non this.\n  The first amendment will allow the Small Business Administration--and \nthey already have funding to do this and are supportive of this \namendment--to provide relief of up to $15,000 of interest on current \nloans that are outstanding from previous disasters. Because when we \nthink about it, one of the most troubling aspects of this is that this \nemergency is happening in the same place that Katrina and Rita took \nplace--along the gulf coast--so businesses that are still trying to pay \noff loans from the last disaster are now, unfortunately, having to \ncontemplate the idea that they may have to take out additional economic \ninjury loans to help them through this. What I think we can do is \nallocate some money we already have allocated in that budget for this \npurpose, and it would be a tremendous help.\n  That is what the first amendment does. It would also require the SBA \nto prioritize applications for businesses with fewer than 50 employees \nor less, and businesses impacted by this recent Deepwater Horizon \nspill. It gives some targeted relief, and it could be significant. Some \nof these businesses could waive basically almost all of their interest \nassociated with their loans which could cut their payments either\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\nin half or by three-quarters. According to some of the analyses we have \ndone, there are about 11,700 loans outstanding in the gulf, so that \nwould be a great help.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4180\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside to call up another amendment that is at the desk, \namendment No. 4180, disaster loan referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4180.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To defer payments of principal and interest on disaster loans \n              relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2002. DISASTER LOANS.\n\n       For any loan under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 636(b)) made as a result of the discharge of oil \n     that began in 2010 in connection with the explosion on, and \n     sinking of, the mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater \n     Horizon, the Administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration shall defer payments of principal and interest \n     for not longer than 1 year after the date of disbursement of \n     the loan. For a loan described in this section, the \n     Administrator shall accept as collateral, where practicable, \n     the interest of the applicant in a claim against British \n     Petroleum relating to the discharge of oil.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment is another tool we can \nuse to give help to these businesses along the gulf coast. It would \nactually set up a relatively new procedure but based on past action.\n  This procedure would allow the SBA, in giving out an economic damage \nloan, to substitute the collateral that is normally required, which \nwould be a house or some asset--a boat or something else--to substitute \nthat for the pending BP claim, so that it is technically a loan, but it \nis acting as a cash advance, to keep businesses in business, to keep \nlights on, to keep mortgages being paid. I understand the SBA is \nlooking closely at this and may very well want to do it, and this would \nauthorize it.\n  That is the essence of this amendment, which is to give up to $2 \nmillion in what would be technically a loan, but with these changes I \nam proposing would actually act as more of an advance, because no \ninterest or principle would be due for a year. Then, of course, we hope \nthat by then, and maybe even before then, BP meets all of its \nobligations and all of its claims. A year may be enough time and, if \nnot, we have language that would extend it.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4184, As Modified\n\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside to call up amendment No. 4184.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 4184 be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4184, as modified.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a very important amendment, and \nit is something that our delegation has actually been working on for \nquite some time, and we have actually passed it before in the Senate, \nwhich is a happy circumstance.\n  This language has been unfortunately taken out in conference on \nseveral occasions by the Corps of Engineers, so I am thinking now that \nthis disaster has maybe helped them to rethink the worthiness of this \namendment, because, again, it doesn't add any money to the Federal \nbudget. This amendment will allow beneficial use of dredged material, \nso when the Corps of Engineers spends the $170 million we give it every \nyear to dredge our channels, to keep our navigation channels open, they \ncan take that dredged material and use it for a beneficial use. That \nmight be restoring a marsh. It might be building a levee, and it might \nbe stopping oil from hitting the coastline, which would be a very good \nuse, in my mind, of that beneficial dredge material.\n  Right now, our State has a pending request to the Corps of Engineers \nto try to help us build--not provide--well, we want them to provide \nboom, but the boom isn't working very well, to be honest. We need them \nto do some dredging, potentially a long number of miles, but strategic \ndredging and building sand barriers to keep that oil from these \nprecious marshlands and estuary areas. This does not meet that full \nrequest, but it does allow the Corps of Engineers in the budget \nauthority they already have to use some of that dredge material in a \nvery strategic way, and if we can pass this bill this week and get this \nlanguage to the President's desk very soon, which I hope we can, within \na few weeks it is possible this could go right to work in the gulf.\n  That is the essence of that amendment. It will help protect our \nwetlands, again, within the budget constraints already in the \nPresident's budget.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4213\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside to call up amendment No. 4213.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4213.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide authority to the Secretary of the Interior to \n immediately fund projects under the Coastal Impact Assistance Program \n                         on an emergency basis)\n\n       On page 81, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 30__. COASTAL IMPACT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1356a) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Emergency Funding.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In response to a spill of national \n     significance under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. \n     2701 et seq.), at the request of a producing State or coastal \n     political subdivision and notwithstanding the requirements of \n     part 12 of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations (or a \n     successor regulation), the Secretary may immediately disburse \n     funds allocated under this section for 1 or more individual \n     projects that are--\n       ``(A) consistent with subsection (d); and\n       ``(B) specifically designed to respond to the spill of \n     national significance.\n       ``(2) Approval by secretary.--The Secretary may, in the \n     sole discretion of the Secretary, approve, on a project by \n     project basis, the immediate disbursal of the funds under \n     paragraph (1).\n       ``(3) State requirements.--\n       ``(A) Additional information.--If the Secretary approves a \n     project for funding under this subsection that is included in \n     a plan previously approved under subsection (c), not later \n     than 180 days after the date of the funding approval, the \n     producing State or coastal political subdivision shall submit \n     to the Secretary any additional information that the \n     Secretary determines to be necessary to ensure compliance \n     with subsection (d).\n       ``(B) Amendment to plan.--If the Secretary approves a \n     project for funding under\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\n     this subsection that is not included in a plan previously \n     approved under subsection (c), not later than 180 days after \n     the date of the funding approval, the producing State or \n     coastal political subdivision shall submit to the Secretary \n     for approval an amendment to the plan that includes any \n     projects funded under paragraph (1).\n       ``(C) Limitation.--If a producing State or coastal \n     political subdivision does not submit the additional \n     information or amendments to the plan required by this \n     paragraph by the deadlines specified in this paragraph, the \n     Secretary shall not disburse any additional funds to the \n     producing State or the coastal political subdivisions until \n     the date on which the additional information or amendment to \n     the plan has been approved by the Secretary.''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this is another I think smart action \nthis Congress could take to help the gulf coast and particularly the \nState of Louisiana.\n  Before the Presiding Officer got to the Senate, in one of our last \nenergy bills we were able to fund a very important program called the \nCoastal Impact Assistance Program. It is a precursor to the revenue-\nsharing program I helped to implement some years ago, although the \nmoney from that program hasn't yet started to flow. This was almost \nlike a downpayment. It took some money from the Federal budget that we \nhad made available, actually quite a bit--$1 billion--and divided it on \na formula based on production and miles of coastline to the four gulf \ncoast States that are bearing the brunt of this production, which is \nvery obvious, painfully obvious today.\n  The happy news is we got that program passed and the money has been \nfunded to the agency. The sad news is, it is still tied up in red tape. \nSo my amendment would expedite the dispersal of these funds, \nparticularly to States where programs have already been approved by the \nFederal agencies in charge and when these programs can be shown to be \nof use in fighting this current oilspill. The Presiding Officer knows, \nbecause he has heard me give this speech 10 times in committee and at \nleast 25 times on the floor, if Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama \nand Texas had had some of this money from offshore oil and gas that has \ngone almost all to the Treasury of the United States, we could have \nbefore now done some things to build up our barrier islands, protect \nour coastlines, protect our marshes, but we have been shortchanged year \nafter year after year. This amendment is not going to fix that problem, \nbut it will say that for the money Congress has already appropriated \nfor this program, it could be expedited to the States that have their \nprograms already approved, and that would be the State of Louisiana \nwhich is in, unfortunately, the eye of this storm as well.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4182\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside so that I may call up an amendment No. 4182.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4182.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Army to use certain funds for \n the construction of authorized restoration projects in the Louisiana \n              coastal area ecosystem restoration program)\n\n       On page 30, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4__. LOUISIANA COASTAL AREA.\n\n       Of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made available \n     under this chapter, the Secretary of the Army shall use \n     $19,000,000 for the construction of authorized restoration \n     projects under the Louisiana coastal area ecosystem \n     restoration program authorized under title VII of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-114; 121 \n     Stat. 1270).\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. This amendment will cost $19 million, but in some ways \nit is simply advancing what the President already has in his budget for \nthese very important projects. President Obama should get a tremendous \namount of credit for being the first President in the last decade or \nmore--actually, the last 15 or 16 years--to actually fund a \nconstruction project on Louisiana's coast--a wetlands construction \nproject. All we have been doing for the last 35 years is studying the \nsituation. It has been very difficult for our delegation, and maybe it \nwon't be so difficult, now that people have watched us go through \nKatrina and Rita, and now the oilspill, to understand the impact we \nhave been talking about.\n  It is hard to even say this, but neither President Clinton nor \nPresident Bush--although we had many plans that had been approved--ever \nsent any money for construction and for new programs for the wetlands. \nWe finally got President Obama, to his credit, to send in his budget to \nus this year $19 million for the purpose of protecting vulnerable \ncoastal wetlands and strengthening the resiliency of that coast. So \nwhile we have a score of $19 million--and I know we are trying to keep \nthe bill to a minimum--it is almost as if we might spend it now, and \nsave it later, as long as we don't respend the $19 million. It is in \nthe President's budget. It would be good to get that signal now from \nthe Congress that these programs can go forward.\n  I hope the administration will take a strong look at this. They have \nalready gotten a tremendous amount of credit, as they deserve, from the \npeople of Louisiana for even putting in the President's budget this $19 \nmillion, because we definitely need it. This would help us accelerate \nthat. I hope we can get that done.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4234\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so that I may call up a final amendment, No. 4234.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that will provide \nsome additional funding for technical assistance grants--disaster \nassistance--for the gulf coast. The President had a fairly robust \npackage represented in this bill--I think $118 million. I hope I am \ncorrect about that. It was a good package of aid. I think it needs to \nbe made more robust.\n  In one section in particular, the President suggested that we spend \n$5 million along the gulf coast giving technical assistance to \norganizations and nonprofits to help these individuals, many who cannot \nafford, as you know, to hire a lawyer to process paperwork or hire an \naccountant to process the paperwork. After Katrina and Rita, we found \nit was very helpful to spend a little bit of money and give grants to \nsome of these nonprofit groups that can work with large communities of \npeople who are affected--the Vietnamese fishing community is a good \nexample--so that each of the 100 fishermen don't have to go out--I am \nnot trying to put lawyers out of business, and I don't want to get in \ntrouble with them, but it is not necessary, and it can be a waste of \nmoney to hire lawyers and accountants to process what should be a \nsimple claim. Even simple claims can be complicated in some of these \nsituations. That is basically what this amendment does. I think it \nwould provide more funding for claims across the gulf coast. I think we \ncan use $5 million across Louisiana alone. My amendment would raise \nthat number to $20 million.\n  Those are basically what these four or five amendments will do.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know my good friend Bob Casey is here \nto speak, so I will be just a few more minutes. This is on a separate \nsubject, but one that is very important.\n  We have several disasters going on in this country and around the \nworld. One is the one I just spoke about--most important to me and the \none that has captured the world's attention as oil continues to flow in \nthe gulf. We have to do more and we have to be more focused. We have to \nhold BP's feet to the fire to get this well shut off. The best\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\nscientists in the world need to be working on this. I have assurances \nfrom Secretary Salazar that they are.\n  New technologies need to be deployed quickly, and the cleaning \nprocess needs to be expedited and streamlined so that not one person, \none boat owner, or one business goes out of business, or one fisherman \ngoes broke because of this situation.\n  Across the ocean, in Haiti, a great disaster occurred not that long \nago, as you will remember. So many things have happened since then, and \nsometimes the world's attention gets turned. I wish to turn it back for \na minute. The people of Haiti live in one of the poorest countries in \nthe world and the Western Hemisphere. It is a country that is close \nculturally to many of us in the United States--particularly people I \nrepresent in Louisiana. We have many Haitian families in New Orleans. \nWe have a close tie with Haiti. We are not a Caribbean state, but we \nfeel a little Caribbean and tropical at times, since we are in the \nSouth. We have a lot of business with Haiti and with many of our \nsouthern neighbors. We have longstanding musical and art connections. \nOur heart has gone out to Haiti, plus the people of Louisiana and the \ngulf coast, who have experienced tremendous disasters. We can empathize \nwith what they are going through in the aftermath of the earthquake.\n  I will make three points about this Haiti rebuilding. In New Orleans, \nwhen my brother was sworn in as mayor a few weeks ago, he said: Ladies \nand gentlemen, citizens of New Orleans, the day of recovery and \nrestoration needs to be over. The day of creating needs to begin. We \nneed to create a new city--a new city that is more fair, just, and \nopen. He said that we have to think about using the opportunity of the \nrevenues that have come to create something new and better that wasn't \nhere before for the people who deserve it. I think that is a great call \nof a very visionary leader.\n  The same is true for Haiti. While Haiti, for a time, will recover and \ntry to stabilize itself, at some point it needs to think about creating \na new kind of Haiti. In my view, and in the view of many Senators and \nMembers of Congress, many NGOs and many members of the Haitian \nDiaspora, one of the most important cornerstones that should be laid \ndown is a free, universal, publicly funded school system for the \nchildren of Haiti, which represents 50 percent of its population today \nand 100 percent of its future. I will repeat that. Fifty percent of the \npopulation today--one of the youngest nations on Earth--and 100 percent \nof Haiti's future. The shame of it is, before the earthquake, less than \n50 percent of the children went to school. They didn't have an \nopportunity to go to school. Of that 50 percent who were enrolled in \nschool, the shame of it is that the enrollment fees and the tuition \nfees ate up anywhere from 50 percent to 60 percent of the household \nincome.\n  So when people say where is the capital in Haiti, the capital was \nbeing spent on poorly run, poorly licensed, nonquality schools that \nwere too expensive and not doing the job. We need to help them create a \nnew Haiti with the money the Americans have already given and donors \nhave pledged. We are not required or expected to fund it and our \ntaxpayers cannot do that. But we can put up our support and voice and \nuse a portion of the money we are going to give and say if you are \ngoing to spend American taxpayer dollars, spend it well, creating a \nnew, more just Haiti and begin by building a school system.\n  That is what one of my amendments tomorrow will do--when I lay it \ndown--for Haiti and what some of us are working on.\n  The second thing is a little more sensitive and maybe not as popular \na subject. I will say a word about it anyway. In Haiti, there is a \nterrible and very unjust system that exists. I am not an expert, but I \nhave learned a lot in the last few weeks as I have studied it. It is \ncalled the restavec system. It is a system of domestic servitude, where \npoor children are basically given up by their families to go work for a \nslightly wealthier family. Restavec children have no rights. They are \nforced to work very long hours. Most restage children have never seen \nthe front door of a school. It is a system that has gone on in Haiti \nfor too long, and it needs to come to an end. I hope that the Senate of \nthe United States will not pass up the opportunity to express a strong \nvoice to the Government of Haiti, to our partners around the world, to \ngood people of good will everywhere, to put pressure on the Haitian \ngovernment. To some, it may not be that necessary. Many people there \nwant this to change. It is a system that people are not comfortable \ntalking about, but it exists. There are a lot of studies on it, and we \nwill talk about it in the days to come. We must make a strong statement \non that while this bill is on the floor.\n  I see my colleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania, here. I yield the \nfloor and look forward to discussing and offering these amendments on \nthe disaster in New Orleans, in Louisiana, and the Gulf Coast, and on \nthe disaster in Haiti tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, first, I commend the work of Senator \nLandrieu, who always brings passion and commitment to so many issues. \nOf course, those that relate to our State of Louisiana are always at \nthe top of the list. We are grateful for that and for her speaking out \non the people of Haiti. We are honored to be able to hear that tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Potential of Children\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I think if there is one way to describe, \nsummarize, or encapsulate the feelings that are not only I think \nprevalent in the Senate or in the Congress but throughout the country, \nwhen we think of our children and all children, I think we have a basic \nbelief that every single child in America is born with a light inside \nthem. For some children, of course, because of their circumstance, the \nfamily they come from, the situation into which they are born, that \nlight is as bright as it can be; it is incandescent. You cannot see the \nlimits of it. It is blinding that they are so full of potential and \nability and they don't need as much help. They are going to be fine \nbecause of the brightness of that light--the measure of their \npotential.\n  For other children, they are born with a bright light, but it doesn't \nshine quite as brightly, because of all kinds of circumstances. We have \nall experienced this in our lives and in our own families and with \npeople we have encountered. Many elected officials have talked to their \nconstituents about this. I have always believed that the obligation of \na public official, no matter where you are, no matter what level of \ngovernment, or no matter what degree of responsibility you have, has a \nbasic obligation to make sure that the light inside of every child is \nrealized, or the potential that that light indicates is realized. We \nhave to do that every day one way or another.\n\n  We had a hearing today in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee on early education. As a country, we have not met the \nobligation I believe we should meet to provide children with learning \nat the early stages of their lives. First grade and second grade are \nreally too late. They need to be exposed to early learning \nopportunities earlier.\n  A lot of States are doing this. There are a lot of good examples out \nthere. But we have not made a national commitment to providing early \nlearning opportunities. That is one thing we should do for a child to \nmake sure the light of his or her potential is realized, to make sure \nthey learn at a young age. It is determinative of their whole life. It \nactually has an impact on the skill of our workforce many years later.\n  Secondly--not in this order--we should make sure they have enough to \neat and get proper nutrition. Again, this happens to be what we are \nworking on. The Child Nutrition Act is up for reauthorization. We are \ngoing to have a chance to enact another piece of legislation that will \ncontinue that commitment to making sure more and more of our children \nhave access to nutritious foods in school and otherwise.\n  We have made a lot of progress. Among the three I just mentioned, \nmaybe the one we made the most progress on is health care for children. \nYou cannot say the light inside a child\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\nwill reach its potential if that child does not have health care.\n  Fortunately, we are at a point now where we not only have 7 million \nchildren covered under the children's health insurance program, but \nthat is going to grow to 14 million in just a couple of years. That is \na remarkable achievement, but it is not enough if we cover 14 million. \nThere still will be millions more, depending on what estimate is out \nthere, but many millions more who will not be covered even as a result \nof the health care bill we passed. We have more work to do on health \ncare.\n  If we are doing the right things as public officials, no matter where \nwe are, whether it is at the level of the Federal Government or all the \nway down to local, county, and State governments, we should make sure \nwe are doing the job on health care for children. We are not there, but \nwe have made a lot of progress.\n  Make sure we are providing children with enough to eat, nutrition--we \nhave a long way to go on that issue, but we have made progress.\n  Thirdly, we will make sure every child has early learning \nopportunities. We have made a lot of progress and still have a ways to \ngo.\n  There actually is a fourth, at least the way I analyze it. The fourth \nis so fundamental that we sometimes forget about it. It is not just \nhealth care and nutrition and early learning; the fourth is basic \nsafety, protecting children from the horrors of this Earth, from people \nwho prey upon them in so many different ways, from the so many horrific \nways children are abused and neglected and left behind and are victims \nof violence.\n  Unfortunately and increasingly, that degree of violence, as it \nrelates to children or young people, even through the high school \nyears, is becoming more and more apparent and more and more egregious \nin our schools. We are talking about this whole concept of bullying \nabout which we are hearing a lot. I realize some will say: That has \nbeen happening for years. Every generation has had kids picked on in \nschool. So why is this any different?\n  It is different today. The numbers are up, but the degree of cruelty \nand violence, in my judgment, is way up. We had a terrible example of \nthat in Massachusetts a couple of months ago. I can point to several \nother States and many examples. It is true in my home State of \nPennsylvania as well. In Pennsylvania and throughout the country, \nviolence, bullying, and harassment in schools is a growing problem for \nall children. It is not restricted to one State or one locality or one \nsituation.\n  It is true for all children but especially--and the evidence on this \npart of the problem is overwhelming and really disturbing--the violence \nand bullying as it relates to children who happen to be gay, lesbian, \nbisexual, or transgender. We all know about the acronym GLBT. That is \nhappening in greater numbers. We cannot just lament it and say: That is \ntoo bad, but it happens over time. It has been happening for \ngenerations. It is too bad there is not a lot we can do about it.\n  The adults--and especially the adults who happen to be public \nofficials who have the opportunity to vote or appropriate dollars or \ntake action--have to do something.\n  Some would say: That is a State and local school district issue. The \nFederal Government does not need to get involved.\n  We have seen in the past where sometimes, if we do not take action or \nat least demonstrate leadership or at least create conditions where we \ndiminish the likelihood that a child, especially a child who happens to \nbe gay or lesbian, for example--they will not be the victims of \nviolence if we do something about it. There is no one bill we can pass \nthat will eliminate it. I understand that. But I think the idea that we \ncan't do anything about it is really dishonest, at best. We ought to do \nsomething about it.\n  According to the Department of Education--just listen to these \nnumbers--one in three schoolchildren is affected by bullying or \nharassment in grades 6 through 10. That is one number.\n  According to a separate study by the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight \nEducation Network--known by the acronym GLSEN--less than half--and this \nrelates to Pennsylvania only--less than half of Pennsylvania students \nsaid they felt safe in school. It is a problem across the board for all \nchildren but especially and most disturbingly for children who happen \nto be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.\n  Relentless bullying results in long-term consequences for the well-\nbeing of its victims. Just as before when I talked about the long-term \nimpact of no health care or no nutrition or no early learning, this, \ntoo, has long-term consequences for that child, for that school, for \nthat child's family, for that community, and, guess what, long term for \nall of us because it will affect whether that child reaches their \npotential, whether they have a skill level that is commensurate with \ntheir ability and their potential or whether they fall short of that \nbecause they were beaten or bullied when they were a child and they \ncould not learn, and because they could not learn they did not do as \nwell in school, and because they did not do well in school, they did \nnot get the job or have the skill level they could have had. If only we \nhad acted and tried to do something about this situation.\n  Here are some of the long-term consequences for that child:\n  Students who are bullied have a decreased interest in school. Some of \nthese are self-evident, but we need to remind ourselves what they are. \nThat is obvious, but it is a big problem.\n  Students who are bullied may be absent from school. It makes sense. \nWhy would you want to go to school if you are getting beaten up and \nharassed every day and nobody is helping? That is part of the problem.\n  When they are in the classroom, they have a harder time \nconcentrating. I cannot even imagine. We talk about how hard it is to \nconcentrate when a child does not have enough to eat. The pain of not \nhaving enough to eat prevents them from learning and growing as a \nstudent. If you are a victim of violence, you are literally in pain at \njust the anticipation of when you leave that classroom to walk down the \nhallway, that same guy or group of people is going to make you the \nvictim, yet again, of harassment or bullying. It does not even have to \nbe physical. Just the verbal abuse, just the intimidation is enough to \nhave an impact on that child.\n  We know bullying and the threat of violence is a common experience \nfor young people who identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or \ntransgender, or who are perceived to be by their peers. People make \ncomments about someone, and then they attack them, and then they become \na victim.\n  These are not just children or young people who are someone else's \nchild or someone else's problem; these are God's children. No matter \nwho they are, they are God's children.\n\n  It is the ultimate form of betrayal--just like domestic violence is--\nwhen someone who lives in a home and is supposed to love the person is \nbeating them up. That is an easy example to remember about what \nbetrayal means.\n  Even in the context of a school, a child goes to school to learn. The \nimplication is that while they are learning, they will be safe and \nactually nurtured, especially if they are very young, that they will be \nsurrounded by people who will help them and educate them but also \nprotect them. Yet they go into that environment to learn and to grow, \nand they are the victims of violence, and no one in that institution \nhelps them or they help them too late or they say: It is not my problem \nor it is the parents' problem or the school district's problem or \nsomeone else's problem. That would be one of my definitions of betrayal \nof a child in that circumstance.\n  A recent study of LGBT teens reported that 9 in 10 reported \nharassment in the last year. Mr. President, 9 in 10. I don't care if it \nwas 1 in 10 or if it was 5 in 10 or 6 in 10--that would be bad enough. \nBut 9 in 10 in this one survey. And 3 out of 5 students reported \nfeeling unsafe in school. When I was a kid, I never felt unsafe in \nschool. I have no recollection of ever having that feeling in my life. \nThese kids feel it every day. One-third of students said they skipped \nschool in the last month because they felt unsafe coming to school. \nTalk about consequences--missing school because they feel they are \ngoing to be beaten up or harassed.\n  Perhaps one of the most disturbing statistics is a third of all \nstudents said teachers and administrators rarely intervened in these \ncases. Some will say\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\nit is a generalization. I understand it is a generalization, but \napparently it is happening out there in far too many cases. Of course, \none case is enough. It is one thing to feel intimidated, scared, and \nfearful. It is another one to feel that no one around you in positions \nof authority will help you.\n  We often talk in this country--and, of course, in Washington as \nwell--about freedom, the great freedoms we have in America: the freedom \nto make your own way, to be an entrepreneur, to find your way in life, \nto start your own business, to make your own money, to travel where you \nwant, to say what you want, freedom of speech--all these great freedoms \nwe have, and thank goodness we have them. Thank goodness people were \nwilling to die for those freedoms in our history and up to the present \nday. Men and women are serving in combat to preserve our freedoms.\n  We talk about freedom, but sometimes we forget another element of the \nissue of freedom. Just like adults have the right to free speech and \nthe right to assembly and all the constitutional rights we celebrate, \nyoung people have rights, too, or at least they should. One of the \nrights, one of the freedoms they should be allowed to enjoy is the \nfreedom from fear. We have heard that expression before, ``the freedom \nfrom fear.'' These children I just described do not have that freedom. \nThey are not free, even in this land where we celebrate freedom every \nday of the week. We have an obligation to take action to make sure that \nbasic right is protected against those who would deny them that \nfreedom--the freedom to be free from fear.\n  We have to do something about this problem. We cannot do everything. \nNot one bill will solve this problem. But I think we can enact a couple \npieces of legislation which will have a positive impact.\n  Tomorrow, I will be introducing the Safe Schools Improvement Act. It \nwill do a couple of things for this problem. It will give schools and \ndistricts the resources to do at least three things. They ought to do a \nlot more than this, but we are going to try to help them with at least \nthese three:\n  First, develop comprehensive student conduct policies that prohibit \nbullying and harassment. If you do not have a conduct policy in place, \nyou have to do it if we pass this Federal legislation.\n  Secondly, it will help to implement prevention strategies and \nprofessional development. We have to do more in prevention, and we have \nto make sure those in charge, those who have authority are, in fact, \ntrained to identify and to deal with and then to punish those who are \nguilty of this kind of bullying and harassment.\n  Thirdly, the Safe Schools Improvement Act will require that schools \nand districts maintain and report data regarding incidents of bullying \nand harassment. It is very important to document this, to keep good \nrecords so we know exactly what is happening, so when a parent shows up \nat a school and says: Well, before my child was beaten and harassed, \nwas it happening before? We shouldn't have the school saying: Well, we \nare not sure. We had some reports. They should document those incidents \nand there should be a uniform way of documenting what is an example or \na reportable act of violence.\n  There is other legislation as well that many others and I are \ncosponsoring--the Student Nondiscrimination Act. That is a bill \nintroduced last week by Senator Franken to expand Federal civil rights \nstatutes to include a right for students against discrimination in \nschool on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  It is almost hard to believe that we would have to enact either of \nthese bills, that we would have to even introduce them, but we need \nboth. We need to insist that schools do a better job, and adults at the \nlocal level do a better job, and that we are all working on this \nproblem.\n  We also need to make sure that discrimination laws are enforced as it \nrelates to children and young people--students--in our schools. We have \nto do this because it is a real problem.\n  Young people who happen to be gay or lesbian or bisexual or \ntransgender need help from all of us. They need our support. I, and I \nknow many others, will continue to work to protect every child so that \nat a minimum they feel safe and supported while they are in school, a \nplace where they should have a reasonable expectation of safety and \nsecurity. We are not talking about every moment of their life. We are \nnot talking about when they are on the street alone. Those are \nsituations where we worry as well. But at least--at least--we ought to \nbe able to say that when a child or a young person is in school they \nwill be protected from bullying or harassment or violence. That is the \nleast we ought to be able to say, and we are a long way from saying \nthat.\n  Again, I will conclude by saying that I will go back to the original \npoint I made, which was that every child born in this country has a \nlight inside them, and there is no way the light of that child can \nshine to its full potential if they do not have the basic protections \nand the basic freedom from fear we are talking about here. No child \nshould have to go through their day, no matter who they are, to being a \nvictim of this kind of bullying and harassment and violence. It is the \nultimate, or certainly one of the ways our society betrays children.\n  We can put a stop to it. We can raise awareness, we can put a \nspotlight on this issue and do all we can to protect our children--our \nyoung people in grade school and in high schools--across America.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a year and a half ago, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations began a review of the causes of the \nfinancial crisis. The subcommittee, which I chair, sought to answer a \nfundamental question about a crisis that was, at that moment, \nthreatening to bring on a second Great Depression, and that has cost \nmillions of Americans their jobs, their homes, their businesses and \ntheir savings. The question we sought to answer: How did this happen? \nAnd we asked that question so that we could inform our colleagues and \nthe public on steps we might take to protect ourselves from the danger \nof future crises.\n  The subcommittee examined millions of pages of documents, interviewed \nhundreds of witnesses, and conducted four hearings with more than 30 \nhours of testimony. What we learned was sobering:\n  We learned that mortgage lenders such as Washington Mutual Bank \nsought to boost their short-term profits by making increasingly risky \nmortgage loans to borrowers increasingly unlikely to be able to repay \nthem. WaMu, as it was known, made hundreds of billions of dollars of \nloans, many of which were laced with fraudulent borrower information, \nand then packaged and sold these loans, dumping toxic assets into the \nfinancial system like a polluter dumping poison into a river.\n  We learned that regulators such as the Office of Thrift Supervision \nidentified problems at WaMu on many occasions but failed to act against \nthem, and in fact hindered other Federal regulators like the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation from taking action.\n  We learned that credit rating agencies, institutions that investors \ndepended upon to make accurate, impartial assessments of the risks that \nassets carried, failed completely in this task. This failure was caused \nby faulty risk models and inadequate data, and by competitive pressures \nas the credit rating agencies sought to obtain or enlarge their market \nshare and please the investment banks that were paying them for their \ncredit ratings. Because credit rating agencies were paid by the \nfinancial institutions selling the financial products being rated, \nconflicts of interest undermined the ratings process and led to a slew \nof inflated AAA ratings for high-risk products whose ratings were later \ndowngraded, many to junk status.\n  We also learned that investment banks such as Goldman Sachs helped \nfeed the conveyor belt of toxic assets that nearly brought economic \nruin.\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\n Goldman Sachs repeatedly put its own interests and profits ahead of \nthe interests of its clients and our communities. Its misuse of exotic \nand complex financial structures helped spread toxic mortgages \nthroughout the financial system. And when the system finally collapsed \nunder the weight of those toxic mortgages, Goldman profited from the \ncollapse.\n  The lesson of our findings is that this disaster was manmade. And yet \nperhaps the most stunning finding came from our hearings themselves, \nwhen top executives from institutions that collectively destroyed \nmillions of jobs and billions of dollars' of wealth repeatedly dodged \nresponsibility, saying the mistakes were someone else's, that they had \ndone nothing wrong, that those who questioned their actions simply \nfailed to understand how the financial system worked. Mr. President, if \nWall Street refuses to take responsibility for its actions, it is \nincumbent on us to take responsibility for putting a cop back on the \nbeat on Wall Street.\n  The bill we approved last week contains many important provisions \nthat directly address the problems revealed in our investigation. Begin \nwith the lenders. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this \nlegislation will create is an important tool to protect borrowers and \nthe financial system from the abusive lending at banks such as WaMu \nthat helped bring about the crisis. Thanks to an amendment offered by \nSenator Merkley, which I was proud to cosponsor, lenders will no longer \nbe able to pocket a quick profit by selling a ``liar loan,'' requiring \nno documentation of wages or the ability to repay. Under Senator \nMerkley's amendment, borrowers will be required to provide reliable \nevidence of their income, either through a W-2, tax return, or other \nsuch record. The amendment would also require lenders to verify \nborrower income.\n  Together, those provisions essentially impose a ban on so-called \nstated-income loans, which is exactly what is needed. Negative \namortization loans, in which borrowers can spend years making payments \nso small that they end up owing thousands of dollars more than the \noriginal loan amount, should also become rare. Putting a cop on the \nbeat means protecting all of us from the consequences of reckless \nbehavior by those who seek short-term gain at the expense of financial \nstability.\n  It is also significant that lenders will be required to retain some \nof the risk they create by keeping a portion of the mortgages they \nsecuritize on their own books, ending the current situation in which \nlenders can make risky loans and then dump all that risk into the \nfinancial system. Under the Senate bill, securitizers of high-risk \nmortgages will have to retain at least a 5 percent interest in any \nmortgage-backed securities they issue. Mortgages that are very safe--\nsuch as 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages with a historical default rate of \n1 to 2 percent--will be exempted from this credit risk retention \nrequirement. Securitizers using mortgages with a credit risk that is \nabove the 1- to 2-percent default rate for traditional mortgages, but \nbelow the 5-percent or more default rate associated with high-risk \nmortgages, will have some risk retention requirement but one that is \nless than the 5-percent requirement for high-risk mortgages. These risk \nretention requirements are essential to rebuild investor confidence in \nour mortgage-backed securities markets. This bill also addresses many \nof the regulatory failures our investigation identified. The Office of \nThrift Supervision, which failed so badly in its oversight \nresponsibilities, is dissolved under this bill. The Federal Reserve \nwould be given important authority to oversee the largest financial \ninstitutions, regardless of their legal status as bank holding \ncompanies, investment banks or other entities, offering powerful \nprotection against risks to the stability of the financial system that \nwent unrecognized through the web of Federal regulation during this \ncrisis. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would be charged with \nending high-risk mortgages that not only hurt consumers, but undermined \nthe safety and soundness of U.S. banks and mortgage lenders.\n  This legislation includes substantial reform of credit rating \nagencies. These agencies will now be liable to civil suits by private \nparties for the quality of their analytical process, and required to \ninstitute internal controls, devote sufficient resources, and improve \ntraining and competence to improve the accuracy of their ratings. The \nSecurities and Exchange Commission will establish a new office to \noversee the agencies, another example of how we would put a cop back on \nthe beat. And thanks to the amendment offered by Senator Franken, which \nI cosponsored, the bill has addressed the dangerous conflict of \ninterest under which the supposedly impartial analysis of financial \ninstruments is paid for by the issuers of those financial instruments. \nWhile it would have been cleaner also to strike the existing statutory \nban on SEC oversight of the substance of ratings and the procedures and \nmethodologies used to produce those ratings, the Senate bill as written \nessentially overrides that ban and enables the SEC to exercise the \noversight needed to ensure credit ratings are derived in a reasonable \nand impartial manner.\n  We had an opportunity as well to address the issues identified in our \ninvestigation with the actions of investment banks such as Goldman \nSachs. This legislation makes some progress there. Importantly, the \nlegislation will bring the shadowy derivatives market into the light, \nrequiring virtually all derivatives to be disclosed to regulators, that \nmost undergo a standardized clearing process, and that derivatives \ndealers meet capital requirements that ensure, if their risky bets \nfail, they can cover the losses from their own accounts, and not--as, \nfor instance, AIG did--come to taxpayers for a bailout.\n  One major failing during the debate on the bill was the Senate's \nfailure to approve Senator Dorgan's amendment to ban ``naked'' credit \ndefault swaps, the ultimate gamble in the casino that Wall Street has \nconstructed in recent years. That amendment included a provision I had \nsought to ban synthetic asset backed securities that magnify risk \nwithout providing any economic benefit. The Dorgan amendment would have \nreduced the high-risk, conflicts-ridden practices that too often are a \npart of Wall Street today and would have rebuilt investor confidence in \nour markets. I regret that the Senate did not see fit to add that \nprovision to the bill.\n  Of course, I wish the Senate had been allowed to consider the \namendment that Senator Merkley and I offered to rein in proprietary \ntrading and address the conflicts of interest that have become business \nas usual on Wall Street. We had offered our amendment to a Brownback \namendment that was already pending on the floor. I am very disappointed \nthat Senator Brownback decided to withdraw his amendment, which meant \nthe Merkley-Levin amendment could not get a vote. The Dodd bill \nincludes a provision requiring regulators to study and implement \nrestrictions on proprietary trading, which is a step in the right \ndirection. But we have missed an opportunity to strengthen that \nprovision by putting in a statute, without the ability of agencies to \nmodify, prohibitions on risky trading by banks, and strict limits on \nsuch trading by nonbanks. Of prime importance, our amendment would have \nended the conflicts of interest that now allow financial institutions \nto assemble and sell complex financial instruments--even instruments \nwith a significant possibility of failure--and then bet that those \ninstruments will fail, profiting from bets against the very instruments \nthey constructed and from the clients they convinced to purchase those \nproducts.\n  Mr. President, I do not understand how Senators can be shown the \ndamaging conflicts of interest identified by our investigation and not \nsee the need to address those conflicts. If we do not address them, we \nwill have poorly served our constituents and missed a chance to make a \nfuture financial crisis less likely.\n  I have some additional regrets about the legislation. Amendments I \nhad drafted to impose a 1-year cooling off period before financial \nregulators can take jobs at the financial institutions they regulated, \nand to repair damage from a Supreme Court decision known as Gustafson \nhad been included in a planned managers' amendment, but that amendment \nnever received a vote. Important amendments to strengthen the authority \nof the FDIC, close the London loophole that allows foreign trading \nterminals to be established in the United States to trade U.S. \ncommodities without complying with U.S. trading rules, require \nregistration of\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\nprivate equity and venture capital funds, reverse the Stoneridge \ndecision barring shareholder suits against those who aid and abet \nfinancial fraud, and other important issues were also not acted upon or \ngiven a vote. I hope these issues will be addressed in conference.\n  Still, taken as a whole, the legislation we approved is an important \nstep toward policing Wall Street and rebuilding Main Street's defenses \nfrom Wall Street's excesses. The millions of pages of documents and \nlong hours of testimony gathered by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations present a detailed history of the financial crisis. But \nall that complexity tells a pretty simple story, really, one of \nunbridled greed that created unheeded risk, risk that exploded into the \nworst recession in decades. Wall Street may not have learned the \nlessons of that story, but the rest of the country has. We must act. We \nmust put the cop back on the Wall Street beat, or once again suffer the \nconsequences of Wall Street's greed. Hopefully, the Senate-House \nconference will get us closer to that goal.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my opposition \nto the Restoring America's Financial Stability Act, which the Senate \npassed last week. It is now clear that over the past decade or so, \ncertain factors played a critical role in leading our Nation into the \nfinancial crisis that first reached critical mass and arrested the \ncredit markets in 2007, subsequently leading to the collapse of some of \nour largest financial services firms, and culminated with a crash of \nthe stock market in late 2008 and again in early 2009. These underlying \nfactors and resulting events produced a widespread crisis and a \ndevastating recession with massive job loss and sustained record \nunemployment, all of which continue to be felt by families throughout \nOhio and States across America. In response, we in Congress have taken \nup legislation that supposedly aims to correct what went wrong and \nrestore safety, soundness, and stability to our financial markets to \nfoster recovery and fortify the foundation for a strong economy.\n  Why, then, have I opposed the passage of this legislation? Simply \nput, because it does not get the job done. This legislation fails to \naddress the root causes of our current crisis, while severely \noverreaching in its expanded regulation of businesses large and small \nthroughout the economy. While I was disappointed that a bill this \nlarge, technical, and consequential was not properly and carefully \nvetted through the committee process, and was then subject to political \nabuse by the majority, I voted to bring the bill to the Senate floor \nbecause I believe the American people wanted us to debate the issues \nsurrounding the financial collapse and bring forth legislation that \nwould work to minimize the possibility of a future collapse caused by \nthe same weaknesses. Although I was pleased with the debate process on \nthe Senate floor--Senators were allotted time to offer amendments, \ndebate was substantial, and amendments were germane--this reform \nlegislation ignores the root causes of the collapse and ultimately \nfails to repair and strengthen our financial system.\n  First, the bill fails to address the main catalysts of the financial \nmeltdown, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose push to acquire subprime \nmortgages--spurred by Congress--helped produce a bubble that burst and \nsent shockwaves across global financial markets, sending the U.S. and \nglobal economies into a tailspin. These now-government-owned \ninstitutions, which failed in the midst of the financial crisis, \ncontinue to drain taxpayers for billions of dollars. Just this month, \nFannie and Freddie requested an additional $19 billion of taxpayer \nmoneys to fund operations, bringing the total government assistance to \nroughly $145 billion, or an average of $7.6 billion per month. \nMoreover, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently \nestimated that over the next decade, Fannie and Freddie could cost \ntaxpayers almost $400 billion. Yet these two giant, systemically risky \ninstitutions, whose bailouts far outsize any of those given to other \nfinancial institutions, are ignored in this bill.\n  Second, at the heart of this crisis were residential home loans \nwritten to borrowers who did not have the ability to pay their \nmortgages. When these borrowers defaulted on a massive scale, \nwidespread investment securities based on their mortgages lost \nsignificant value, sending investors panicking and retreating while \nportfolios collapsed and credit froze. These loans were made in large \npart because of poor underwriting standards and a failure by many \nlenders and brokers to ensure that buyers had the means to repay their \nloans. During the debate on this bill, my colleague Senator Bob Corker \noffered a commonsense amendment to establish sound underwriting \nstandards, including a minimum down payment, full documentation, and \nproof of income and ability to pay back the mortgage. Amazingly, my \ncolleagues rejected this amendment, and thus virtually nothing in this \nbill addresses this problem.\n  Third, the new consumer protection bureau created by this bill is too \nwide in its regulatory scope and I believe it will saddle businesses \nwith new and often unnecessary burdens. It is granted authority to \nreach its tentacles like an octopus into various sectors of the economy \nand pull businesses that were not part of the problem under new \ngovernment regulation. Attempts by some of my colleagues to curtail the \nlargely unchecked reach of this new regulator were rejected.\n  Finally, new regulations related to over-the-counter derivatives fail \nto adequately protect businesses across Ohio and other States that use \nthese risk management tools. Some of these businesses could be forced \nto divert capital away from investments and job creation and instead \npost margins with the clearinghouses that will oversee these contracts. \nI have also heard many of these companies complain that they will now \nbe forced to use less customized derivative products, which would \nresult in more--rather than less--risk to these companies. As \nbusinesses sideline more capital, they become less liquid; as they face \nmore risk, they become less creditworthy, and in turn have less access \nto credit. I am fearful that these new burdens on businesses will do \nlittle or nothing to prevent future collapses, and serve only to slow \nany eventual economic recovery. In addition, under the Senate bill, \nbanks that commonly provide these financial products for businesses \nwould be prohibited from doing so any longer, and I am concerned that \nthe unintended consequence of this ban could be that businesses will \nseek these products from foreign financial firms, which operate beyond \nthe scope of U.S. regulation.\n  In sum, not only does the Restoring America's Financial Stability Act \nfail to address the root causes of the problem, it also overreaches in \nits regulation, which will cost Ohioans jobs, hurt businesses that are \nnot connected with the meltdown, and harm credit at a time when job \nrecovery is still just inching forward. I am disappointed that many of \nthe amendments offered by my colleagues that would have addressed these \nissues, as well as my other concerns with the bill, were not adopted. I \nhope that this Senate bill will be improved in the conference committee \nbefore it is returned to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/25/senate-section/article/S4208-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4208-S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING COLONEL JOHN KELLEY SPRINGER\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

I hope \nthat memories of John and his efforts to advance the health and safety \nof this Nation can provide comfort during this difficult time.\n  A resident of Sunapee, New Hampshire, John was the President of the \nDartmouth Class of 1953.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that today I honor \ntwo brave policemen from West Memphis, Sergeant Brandon Paudert and \nOfficer Bill Evans, and pay tribute to their lives and service to their \ncommunity.\n  Sergeant Paudert and Officer Evans lost their lives in the line of \nduty doing what they loved most: protecting their community. They were \nboth part of the West Memphis Police Department's drug interdiction \nteam, a specialized unit that fought drug trafficking on Arkansas's \nhighways. They were on the front lines in the war against drugs, \nfighting to keep our streets clean and our children safe.\n  Sergeant Paudert's sense of duty was in his blood--his father, Bob \nPaudert, is West Memphis's police chief. Sergeant Paudert's loved ones \ndescribed him as a kind, honorable man, devoted to his family and the \nforce. He married his high school sweetheart, Kim, whom he had dated \nsince they were just 14 years old, and had three children whom he loved \ndearly. He was always there for friends and fellow officers, lifting up \ntheir spirits and lending a hand when one was needed.\n  Officer Evans shared Sergeant Paudert's call to serve; he was a \nfourth-generation law enforcement official, with both his father and \nhis grandfather serving in the Crittenden County Sheriff's Department. \nHe was the team's ``maintenance man'' with an ability to fix anything \nhe encountered, and had a wonderful sense of humor, always able to get \na laugh out of his colleagues and friends. A father of two with a \nfiance, those who knew him said Evans lived his life by a simple code: \n``Enjoy your life. Love your family. Enjoy your work.''\n  I join all Arkansans in lifting up the family and friends of Sergeant \nPaudert and Officer Evans during this difficult time. In a fitting \ntribute, a sign on the fence of the West Memphis High School's football \nfield says: ``Fallen, so we can stand.'' These two heroes may have \nfallen, but we will continue to stand for the values and principles for \nwhich they so selflessly gave their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/25/senate-section/article/S4209-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. MORRIS W. SELF\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the heroic \nservice of Dr. Morris W. Self of Pagosa Springs, CO. Dr. Self, a \nretired civil engineer, was recently honored by France for his brave \nservice during World War II. This past month, the French Consul General \nin Los Angeles bestowed on him the National Order of the Legion of \nHonor, France's highest award, in the rank of Chevalier, or Knight, in \nappreciation for his distinguished service.\n  Morris was born in St. Paul, MN, in December 1921. During high \nschool, he was active in several sports and served as president of the \nstudent government. At 18, Morris joined the Minnesota National Guard \nand trained with the 101st Coast Artillery Unit. After the U.S. entered \nthe war in 1941, he enrolled in the Engineer Officer Candidate School. \nHe was commissioned as a combat engineer with the rank of 2nd \nlieutenant in July 1942. Lieutenant Self was deployed to the United \nKingdom in November 1943 with the 348th Combat Engineering Battalion to \nprepare for the Normandy landings.\n  On D-day, Lieutenant Self's unit landed on Omaha Beach at 7:30 a.m. \nunder intense enemy fire. He was 23 years old at the time. Lieutenant \nSelf led an infantry unit in clearing beach areas of enemy \nfortifications. His reconnaissance patrol cleared mines and located \nbooby traps under enemy fire.\n  On June 7, Lieutenant Self continued to clear the beach of mines. \nThat day, he saw several landing crafts hit by enemy fire begin to \nsink. After quickly assessing the situation, Lieutenant Self swam 200 \nyards from shore to look for survivors. On this first trip, he helped \nthree men to shore with lifejackets and by creating a makeshift raft. \nThen he went back to save more. After finding a long rope and attaching \nit to shore, Lieutenant Self and Lieutenant Walter Sidlowksi of \nBrooklyn, NY, found a rubber raft and ferried three more groups of \nsurvivors to safety. They were in the frigid water of the English \nChannel for about 2 hours.\n  Lieutenant Self and his unit continued to clear beach areas for the \nnext several months. In December 1944, the 348th was moved to the \nArdennes area in Belgium to fight back against the German offensive \nduring the Battle of the Bulge and to help rebuild the community. He \nreturned to the U.S. in September 1945 and was discharged that \nDecember.\n  Prior to this most recent award, Lieutenant Self was awarded the \nBronze Star Medal for heroic actions at Omaha Beach, the French Croix \nde Guerre with Bronze Star, and the Presidential Unit Citation. \nLieutenant Self later attended the University of Minnesota and earned a \ncivil engineering degree, a master's, and a doctorate in civil \nengineering. He was married to Ruth Mar in 1947, and they have three \nchildren: Ted Alan, Douglas, and Jenann.\n  I would like again to congratulate Dr. Self on his receipt of the \nesteemed Legion of Honor award and thank him for his selfless service \nto our country. His bravery, on D-day, and for months after, is a \ntestament to the courage and conviction that American soldiers brought \nto a dreadful war. We are humbled by his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/25/senate-section/article/S4209-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING HOWE MILITARY SCHOOL CLASS OF 2010\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain public land \nin and around historic mining townsites located in the State of Nevada, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Nevada Mining Townsite Conveyance Act of 2010. \nThe residents of the towns Ione and Gold Point in Nevada have asked for \nour help in settling longstanding trespass issues that have seriously \naffected these communities for decades. This bill would convey 682 \nacres managed by the Bureau of Land Management's, BLM, Tonopah Field \nOffice to clear up decades old confusion over property ownership in \nthese two historic mining towns.\n  Ione and Gold Point were founded in central Nevada during the last \nhalf of the nineteenth century. Like other early towns in Nevada, they \nendured the boom and bust cycle so common to mining camps. A very long \ntime ago both of these towns were surveyed and approved for townships, \nbut through some misfortune the proof of patent was never recorded by \nthe U.S. Government Land Office and title for the land was never \ntransferred. Nevertheless, these towns have been continuously occupied \nfor over 100 years.\n  Many residents in Ione and Gold Point live on the same land that \ntheir families settled on decades earlier. These citizens have paid \ntheir property taxes and made improvements to their properties. They \nhave rehabilitated historic structures and built new ones. Regrettably, \nthe historical documents by which these citizens claim possession do \nnot satisfy modern requirements for demonstrating lawful ownership of \ntheir properties. Because these documents are legally insufficient and \nhave been deemed invalid, the BLM retains legal ownership of the land. \nThus, the BLM has determined that these residents of Ione and Gold \nPoint and their homes are in trespass on Federal land.\n  This situation is untenable. Local residents, the counties, and the \nBLM recognize that many of these citizens have substantial rights to \nthe lands in question; however, there is no readily available procedure \nby which the BLM can adjudicate their claims. This puts the BLM at odds \nwith the local residents and the county governments. It also impedes \nefforts to improve basic community services such as fire protection, \nand water supply and treatment facilities.\n  In the simplest terms, our legislation will convey any unencumbered \nproperty rights in the contested townsites to the counties and in turn \nthe counties will use the procedures outlined in the 2001 state mining \ntownsite law to consider residents' property claims and pass these \nlands to the rightful owners.\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\nIn order to accomplish the transfer of the townsites, this bill \nestablishes a process for the BLM to determine the validity of any \nexisting mining claims in Ione and Gold Point and to convey to the \ncounties all surface ownership rights and any subsurface rights not \nsubject to valid mining claims. Valid mining claims will not be \nconveyed to the counties, but they will be subject to various \nrestrictions designed to protect the home owners in Ione and Gold \nPoint.\n   I would like to thank Nye and Esmeralda counties, the Nevada State \nLegislature, the Bureau of Land Management, and the residents of Ione \nand Gold Point for their cooperation and hard work in resolving this \ncomplex problem. We are pleased to bring this legislation to the \ncommittee and we look forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, \nRanking Member Murkowski and the other distinguished members to move \nthis bill through the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide emergency operating funds for public \ntransportation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, millions of Americans rely on transit to go \nabout their daily lives.\n  Many of them are poor, elderly, or disabled.\n  For some, transit is more than a convenience--it is absolutely vital.\n  Unfortunately, in communities across the Nation, transit has become a \ncasualty of the economic downturn.\n  Service cuts, fare increases, and layoffs--the result of tight \nbudgets nationwide--have become an epidemic, disconnecting people from \ntheir jobs, placing huge burdens on already disadvantaged populations, \nand reducing quality of life for millions of American families.\n  The American Public Transportation Association recently found that 84 \npercent of transit systems either have enacted or are contemplating \nfare hikes or reductions in service.\n  The transit crisis is having an impact on the American people.\n  In 2008, transit ridership reached 10.7 billion riders, the highest \nlevel since 1956 and a 38 percent increase since 1995.\n  But last year, ridership fell by half a billion.\n  This has serious implications for national priorities like reducing \ntraffic congestion, addressing climate change, enhancing our energy \nsecurity, and restoring our economic competitiveness.\n  Of course, it has serious implications on the lives of ordinary \nAmericans.\n  Young people are finding it harder to get to school.\n  Low-income families, forced to pay more for less service, are losing \nwhat is often their only option for getting to work.\n  The elderly and disabled, robbed of their mobility, can't access \nhealth care facilities.\n  Many who have long relied on transit are being forced to purchase \ncars, adding to congestion on our roads, pollution in our skies, and \nthe economic burden already weighing heavy on working families.\n  We need more transit service, not less.\n  Now, my preference would be to pass a significant infrastructure and \njobs bill, one that would invest billions in our infrastructure, our \nroadways, and our transit systems.\n  That approach would create hundreds of thousands of good construction \njobs while simultaneously making critical long-term investments in our \nnation's future productivity and economic growth.\n  But even if we can't do that, we can't afford to turn our backs on \nthe transit crisis.\n  Therefore, today I rise to introduce the Public Transportation \nPreservation Act of 2010.\n  This legislation will provide $2 billion in emergency funding to \ntransit agencies across the nation so that we can minimize disruptions \nin service, fare increases, and layoffs.\n  It is not nearly enough money to give America the transit system it \nneeds and deserves.\n  But I hope it will be enough to stop the bleeding and allow millions \nof Americans who rely on transit to maintain their ability to go to \nwork, get to the doctor, and go about their daily lives without \nsignificant disruption.\n  Senators Menendez, Durbin, Schumer, Lautenberg, Brown of Ohio, Reed, \nand Gillibrand have joined this bill as original co-sponsors.\n  I thank them for their commitment to public transportation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us on behalf of those who rely on \ntransit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 3414. A bill to ensure that the Dietary Supplement Health and \nEducation Act of 1994 and other requirements for dietary supplements \nunder the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration are fully \nimplemented and enforced, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am joining with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Dietary \nSupplement Full Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2010. Forty \npercent of Americans regularly take supplements--and I am one of them. \nWe are taking charge of our own health. We are developing healthier \nhabits. We are waking up to the fact that we don't live to eat, we eat \nto live--and we need to be mindful of what we put into our bodies.\n  Countless people have told me how they have been helped by dietary \nsupplements. Consumers want alternatives. They want less invasive, less \nexpensive options. They don't want to just cure disease, they want to \nprevent disease. They want to feel good--and to look good.\n  As you know, I have long championed the cause of health prevention, \nand I strongly believe that safe, properly labeled dietary supplements \ncan be an important part of a healthy lifestyle. In 1994, I introduced \nthe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act--DSHEA--along with my \ngood friend Senator Hatch, and we revolutionized the way that \nsupplements are regulated and sold in the United States.\n  DSHEA struck an important balance. On the one hand, it recognized the \nimportance of enhancing consumer access to vitamins, minerals, and \nother dietary supplements, and it recognized the virtues of scientific \nresearch and education on the benefits and risk of supplements. On the \nother hand, it recognized the need for important regulatory safeguards \nto protect consumer health, including new safety standards, penalties \nfor mislabeling or adulterating dietary supplements, and rules to \nensure the scientific substantiation of claims regarding dietary \nsupplements. As a result, over the last 15 years, Americans have \nenjoyed unprecedented access to a range of safe products that help \nimprove their health.\n  In 2006, Congress identified a need for additional regulatory \nsafeguards, and we passed a law that requires manufacturers, packers, \nand distributors of dietary supplements to report to FDA serious \nadverse events associated with the use of supplements. Dietary \nsupplement manufacturers are also now required to register their \nbusinesses with FDA under the BioTerrorism law we passed in 2002. S. \n510, the food safety legislation approved by the Senate HELP Committee \nlast year, which I hope will soon be considered on the Senate floor, \ncontains additional provisions that apply to dietary supplements. The \nlegislation gives FDA the authority to revoke the registration of a \ndietary supplement facility in certain instances, and it authorizes FDA \nto initiate a mandatory recall of any food, including a dietary \nsupplement, that will cause serious adverse health consequences or \ndeath.\n  In short, Congress has been active in passing laws that promote \naccess to dietary supplements, but also ensure those products are safe \nfor their intended uses. I am proud of our record on this issue, and I \nbelieve we have established a regulatory framework that is in the best \ninterest of the American people and their long term health.\n  I am concerned, however, that not enough is being done to fully \nimplement and enforce these dietary supplement laws. I am very pleased \nthat FDA recently issued final regulations on current Good \nManufacturing Practice for dietary supplements, but it took them nearly \n15 years to get those rules on the books. In the fall of 2004, FDA \nopened a docket and held a public meeting on new dietary ingredients, \nbut it has still not produced guidance on that issue. Perhaps most \nalarming, there are still scores of illegal products being sold in this \ncountry that masquerade as dietary supplements. Some bad actors simply \nslap a dietary supplement label on illegal products in the hopes that \nthe supplement label will help those products evade notice by FDA or \nthe label will help promote sales. These products are clearly not \ndietary supplements and both consumers and the legitimate dietary \nsupplement industry have a right to be upset about their sale. I am \nencouraged that President Obama's FDA has been sending Warning Letters \non some of these illegal products, but more needs to be done. Part of \nthe problem is that FDA's dietary supplement program has been under-\nresourced. But part of the problem is that enforcement of DSHEA has not \nbeen made a priority.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce the Dietary Supplement Full \nImplementation and Enforcement Act of 2010. This is an updated version \nof a bill that Senator Hatch and I introduced in\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\nthe 108th Congress. I am grateful that the Senator from Utah joins me \nagain today in introducing this important legislation. Its basic goal \nis to give FDA the resources it needs to fully implement and enforce \nour dietary supplement laws, but also to hold FDA accountable for what \nit does with those resources.\n  According to FDA, full implementation of the laws governing the \nregulation of dietary supplement will require substantial additional \nresources. My bill authorizes FDA to receive the necessary sums to \nimplement and enforce the law. It also authorizes the Office of Dietary \nSupplements at NIH to receive additional sums to expand research and \ndevelopment of consumer information on dietary supplements.\n  On the implementation front, the bill requires FDA to issue guidance \nthat clarifies for consumers and industry FDA's expectations with \nregard to its new dietary ingredient premarket notification program.\n  On the enforcement front, the bill directs FDA to inspect facilities \nto ensure compliance with the new dietary supplement good manufacturing \npractice regulations; to use the authority under DSHEA to protect the \npublic from unsafe dietary supplements; and to ensure that claims made \nfor dietary supplements are truthful, non-misleading and substantiated. \nIt also requires FDA to notify the Drug Enforcement Administration if \nFDA objects to a new dietary ingredient notification because the \nproduct may contain an anabolic steroid or an analogue of an anabolic \nsteroid.\n  On the accountability front, the bill requires the Secretary of the \nHealth and Human Services to submit an annual report to Congress that \nlists, among other things, how many people at FDA worked on supplement-\nrelated issues in the prior years; the number of times FDA inspected \ndietary supplement facilities; the number of times FDA issued a warning \nletter or initiated an enforcement action because a manufacturer was \nnot in compliance; the number of times FDA objected to the marketing of \na new dietary ingredient; and the number of dietary supplement claims \nthe FDA determined to be false, misleading, or not substantiated.\n  The bottom line is that dietary supplements offer tremendous health \nbenefits to Americans, but it is not fair to consumers, the FDA, or the \npeople who make supplements if we don't take action to clarify our \ncurrent regulatory requirements, to better inform everyone about the \nbenefits and risk of these products, and to clear the market of the \nclearly illegal or spiked products that masquerade as supplements. The \nbill that Senator Hatch and I have developed is an important and \nmeasured response to these challenges. I am heartened that a number of \norganizations that are deeply concerned about these issues have \nendorsed our bill, including, among others, the United Natural Products \nAlliance, the Natural Products Association, the Council for Responsible \nNutrition, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the American \nHerbal Products Association, the Major League Baseball Players \nAssociation, and the NFL Players Association. The bill recognizes the \nneed to implement and enforce current law in this area rather than \nsimply discard the important balance we struck in 1994. And it is \ngrounded in the firm belief that safe, properly labeled dietary \nsupplements remain a vital part of our collective effort to help all \nAmericans improve their health.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and I are \nintroducing the Dietary Supplement Full Implementation and Enforcement \nAct of 2010, which is similar to the legislation we introduced in the \n108th Congress.\n  Our goal in introducing this commonsense bill is to ensure that the \nFood and Drug Administration properly implements and enforces existing \ndietary supplement laws--namely the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health \nEducation Act, DSHEA, and the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription \nDrug Consumer Protection Act of 2006. This is important to protect the \n150,000,000 Americans who regularly take dietary supplements and to \nremove ``bad actor'' companies from the marketplace.\n  This issue is extremely important because the laws already on the \nbooks are sufficient if the FDA has the resources and the will to fully \nenforce them. Indeed, previous FDA commissioners--Dr. Jane Henney, Dr. \nMark McClellan, Dr. Lester Crawford and Dr. Andy von Eschenbach--have \nall stated as much in Senate hearings and in my meetings with them. \nMoreover, current FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg has assured me \nthat she will work with me to ensure these laws are enforced.\n  Bottom line: the FDA already has the regulatory authority it needs \nunder current law.\n  That is why I will not support any changes to existing dietary \nsupplement laws until the legislation we are introducing today has been \napproved by both the House and the Senate and signed into law by the \nPresident. We also need to ensure this legislation is fully funded by \nthis Congress and enforced by the FDA with the full backing of this \nAdministration. It is important to give FDA the resources it needs to \naccomplish both tasks. The legislation that we are introducing today \nwill do just that.\n  Senator Harkin and I have asked our colleagues on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee to provide the FDA with the funds it needs to \nfully implement DSHEA. We will continue to work diligently to help them \nsucceed in that task.\n  As you know, DSHEA clarified the FDA's regulatory authority over \ndietary supplements while ensuring that Americans will continue to have \naccess to safe dietary supplements and helpful information about these \nproducts. It passed the Senate twice by unanimous consent. The \nlegislation we are introducing today includes a Sense of the Congress \nand outlines the methods the FDA should use to better implement and \nenforce laws related to dietary supplements. It further requires the \ndietary supplement industry to redouble its efforts to comply with the \nlaw and cooperate with the FDA.\n  To provide the FDA with the resources necessary to regulate \ncompliance with dietary supplement laws, this bill directs the agency \nto use part of its 2010 Fiscal Year Budget for that purpose. It also \nauthorizes the National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary \nSupplements to expand research and develop more consumer information on \ndietary supplements.\n  Furthermore, the legislation requires the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services (HHS) to submit an annual report to Congress, starting \nno later than January 31, 2011, regarding HHS activities on dietary \nsupplements. Finally, it directs the FDA to issue its New Dietary \nIngredient (NDI) guidance, as recommended by the General Accountability \nOffice, within 180 days and requires the FDA to share any information \non tainted NDI with the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n  It is my sincere hope that all my colleagues will support this effort \nto ensure that dietary supplement consumers and manufacturers are \nprotected and properly regulated. Our constituents deserve no less.\n  This legislation is supported by the Major League Baseball and NFL \nplayers associations, the Natural Products Association, the United \nNatural Products Alliance, Council for Responsible Nutrition, American \nHerbal Products Association and the Consumer Health Care Products \nAssociation.\n  I hope that each of you will see the wisdom in supporting this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      NFL Players Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2010.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin, Chairman,\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Senator Hatch: The issue of the \n     public disclosure--and regulation--of dietary supplements \n     remains a critically important concern to the NFLPA. As for \n     all professional athletes, professional football players rely \n     on supplement label information to educate themselves on the \n     nature of the ingredients contained therein. Without complete \n     and precise label disclosure of all ingredients contained in \n     a particular supplement, players can face sanctions--and even \n     career-ending sanctions--if unlisted ingredients would \n     violate League-Player drug-testing regimes.\n       Thus, the Association welcomes the introduction of the \n     Dietary Supplement full implementation and enforcement act of \n     2010,\n\n[[Page S4217]]\n\n     which focuses on providing the FDA with sufficient resources \n     to play its role in overseeing the supplement marketplace.\n       We endorse your legislation, salute your leadership, and \n     will work with you to realize enactment of this important \n     measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               DeMaurice F.

Tom Harkin, Chairman,\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, U.S. \n         Senate, 428 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Senator Hatch: Over the last \n     several years, the Major League Baseball Players Association \n     has shared with you our concerns about the federal \n     government's regulation of dietary supplements. There are \n     still far too many supplements available in the United States \n     that contain pharmaceuticals, steroids and other dangerous \n     ingredients. And, too often, what is actually inside the \n     bottle is not listed on the label. This unfortunate reality \n     is especially problematic for professional athletes. Players \n     have been suspended, their careers jeopardized, for doing \n     nothing more than taking a supplement purchased at a national \n     nutrition store, only to learn later that the product \n     contained an ingredient not listed on the label that violated \n     drug testing protocols.\n       The Dietary Supplement Full Implementation and Enforcement \n     Act of 2010 will address one of the biggest obstacles to \n     improved safety--an overall lack of enforcement. We \n     understand your concern that imposing new obligations and \n     requirements on legitimate supplement companies alone will \n     not rid the marketplace of adulterated products. By providing \n     the FDA with both additional resources and increased \n     accountability, your legislation should help make possible a \n     goal we all share--a reliable supplement marketplace.\n       The Association endorses the bill, and we look forward to \n     working with you throughout the legislative process on \n     additional measures to improve enforcement and ensure product \n     safety and label accuracy. Users of dietary supplements, be \n     they professional athletes or not, deserve the same promise \n     made to those who consume traditional food--the assurance \n     that the products they take, that are sold without \n     restriction to adults and children throughout the country, \n     are safe and the products' labels can be trusted.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael S. Weiner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    Natural Products AssociationTM,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2010.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Hatch: On behalf of the Natural \n     Products Association (NPA), I commend your leadership and \n     bipartisan efforts to craft sensible legislation that will \n     strengthen the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) ability \n     to fully enforce the current laws governing the regulation of \n     dietary supplements. Founded in 1936, NPA is the nation's \n     largest and oldest trade association dedicated to the natural \n     products industry, representing more than 10,000 retail, \n     manufacturing, wholesaler, and distribution outlets of \n     natural products, including dietary supplements, foods, and \n     health/beauty aids.\n       NPA supports the Dietary Supplement Full Implementation and \n     Enforcement Act of 2010 as it appropriately recognizes that \n     the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of \n     1994 grants the FDA more than adequate statutory authority to \n     regulate supplements. While some have called for new \n     regulations on supplements, you understand that the real need \n     to fully enforce the statutes already on the books.\n       Historically, concurrent with the passage of DSHEA, the FDA \n     experienced budget cuts, and lacked the resources to \n     effectively regulate all the industries under its watch. To \n     ensure that the FDA is able to carry out the law as Congress \n     intended, this legislation authorizes an increase in funding \n     for FDA to implement DSHEA. The Dietary Supplement Full \n     Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2010 strengthens FDA's \n     ability to enforce DSHEA, tightens product-specific \n     enforcement, requires the release of the long-awaited New \n     Dietary Ingredient (NDI) guidance, and holds the FDA \n     accountable for filing annual reports to Congress about how \n     they are regulating dietary supplements.\n       Additionally we are supportive of the doubling of funding \n     given to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) to expand \n     research and consumer information about dietary supplements. \n     An increase in funding for ODS is especially important \n     because dietary supplements come from natural ingredients and \n     cannot be patented. While this ensures that these products \n     are readily and affordably available, it takes away the \n     ability of manufacturers to recoup research costs.\n       Again, we applaud your introduction of the Dietary \n     Supplement Full Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2010, \n     and look forward to working with you in enacting this \n     important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                     John Gay,\n\n                                            Executive Director and\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           United Natural Products\n\n\n                                                     Alliance,\n\n                                 Salt Lake City, UT, May 24, 2010.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Senator Hatch: The United Natural \n     Products Alliance (UNPA), an association of dietary \n     supplement and functional food companies that share a \n     commitment to providing consumers with natural health \n     products of superior quality, benefit, and reliability, \n     wishes to express its appreciation to you for your work to \n     develop the Dietary Supplement Full Implementation and \n     Enforcement Act of 2010. We are very supportive of this \n     legislation and of your continued hard work to ensure that \n     consumers have access to safe, high-quality dietary \n     supplements and information about those products.\n       In 1994, you both led the effort to enact legislation that \n     would establish in law a rational and transparent framework \n     for the regulation of dietary supplements. As documented by \n     the Committee on Labor and Human Resources in the report \n     accompanying your bill, the Dietary Supplement Health and \n     Education Act (DSHEA) (S. 784), the Food and Drug \n     Administration had shown an animosity toward supplement \n     products through a series of divergent regulatory actions and \n     unpublished policies that consumers rightly concluded \n     threatened their access to supplement products. The \n     tremendous citizen reaction to those policies supported your \n     conclusion that the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act \n     needed to be amended.\n       DSHEA was passed, not once, but twice, by the Senate, and \n     once by the House of Representatives, all by unanimous \n     consent--testimony to the significance of this legislation. \n     In fact, when President Clinton signed DSHEA into law in \n     1994, he noted that ``In an era of greater consciousness \n     among people about the impact of what they eat on how they \n     live, indeed, how long they live, it is appropriate that we \n     have finally reformed the way government treats consumers and \n     these supplements in a way that encourages good health.''\n       DSHEA had several important components, a few of which I \n     will mention in the context of your new legislation. First, \n     it established the simple principle that all dietary \n     supplements on the market in the United States at the time of \n     enactment would be presumed to be dietary supplements in the \n     future, unless there were violations of other parts of the \n     law. For new ingredients sold after that date, a manufacturer \n     was required to submit a ``New Dietary Ingredient'' (NDI) \n     notification to the FDA in advance of marketing. Second, as \n     part of DSHEA's numerous provisions to ensure the safety of \n     supplement products, the law authorized issuance of current \n     Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMPs) regulations specific to \n     supplements. The law established the requirements for \n     labeling, product claims and supporting substantiation. And, \n     it established at the National Institutes of Health an Office \n     of Dietary Supplements (ODS) to conduct research, provide \n     consumer information on supplements and act as an advisor to \n     other federal agencies.\n       In the years following enactment of DSHEA, by any objective \n     measure, FDA was slow to implement the law. Very few warning \n     letters were issued. Very few enforcement actions were \n     taken--despite the fact that for many years you worked \n     together to provide FDA with additional resources to act \n     against products that were clearly violations of the law. The \n     cGMPs were not issued for 13 years--resulting in unwarranted \n     criticism that dietary supplements are ``not regulated''. \n     Likewise, uncertainty arose whether some products contained \n     old or new ingredients under the law, and guidance on New \n     Dietary Ingredients has not been forthcoming from FDA. This \n     must change.\n       It has become clear that there has been a lack of \n     enforcement against clear violations of the law and that this \n     is largely due to two factors: a lack of focus by the agency; \n     and a competition for resources that has drained funding into \n     other areas. Your bill would rectify that situation and \n     return needed attention to appropriate implementation of \n     DSHEA and successor laws such as the 2006 Dietary Supplement \n     and Non-Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act. \n     Specifically, we find beneficial the provisions that would \n     provide Congress with a professional judgment estimate of the \n     costs to implement the laws addressing dietary supplement \n     regulation. This will allow Congress, and specifically the \n     Appropriations Committees, the ability to evaluate the \n     adequacy of the agency's funding and that of the Office of \n     Dietary Supplements. We also highlight the need for \n     provisions urging increased FDA efforts to conduct \n     inspections under the new cGMPs, evaluate claims \n     (prioritizing with those that are clear violations of the \n     law), promptly issuing guidance on NDIs, and notifying the \n     Drug Enforcement Administration if NDI notification suggests \n     that the substance may contain anabolic steroids or their \n     analogues which by definition are not dietary supplements. In \n     addition, the Annual Accountability Report on the Regulation \n     of Dietary\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\n     Supplements which your bill would require will yield valuable \n     information showing the adequacy of dietary supplement \n     regulatory efforts.\n       Finally, we recognize our responsibility as representatives \n     of the regulated industry to comply fully with the laws \n     regulating dietary supplements, and we pledge to continue our \n     efforts to work cooperatively with the government to develop \n     and implement rational policies that will assure American \n     consumers the safe products upon which they have come to \n     rely. As a central part of our mission, UNPA has made efforts \n     to educate ingredient suppliers, manufacturers and retailers \n     about key components of the dietary supplement laws and how \n     they should be implemented. We always strive to partner with \n     the government (including both the FDA and the Federal Trade \n     Commission) in these activities. Good examples of these \n     efforts are the numerous seminars we conduct, including five \n     focused specifically on the new cGMP regulations. We invite \n     you to review this in more detail at www.UNPA.org.\n       Thank you for your leadership role on behalf of the 150 \n     million Americans who regularly use dietary supplement \n     products.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Loren D. Israelsen,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Council for Responsible Nutrition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2010.\n     Re S. 3414--Dietary Supplement Full Implementation and \n         Enforcement Act\n\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Hatch: On behalf of the Council \n     for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) and its members, I am writing \n     to express our support for S. 3414, the Dietary Supplement \n     Full Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2010 (DSFIEA). We \n     want to thank you for your commitment to legislative and \n     regulatory initiatives that would help to fully fund, \n     implement and enforce the Dietary Supplement Health and \n     Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, and this legislation is an \n     example of your commitment to consumers and the dietary \n     supplement industry to assure access to safe and beneficial \n     supplement products. The work that you and your colleagues \n     have devoted to providing FDA with tools and resources to \n     reinforce its authority in regulating the supplement industry \n     under DSHEA is commendable and CRN stands in support of your \n     efforts.\n       This legislation will help to ensure that the agency has \n     sufficient focus and resources at its disposal to implement a \n     law--DSHEA--which already provides FDA with ample authority \n     to ensure consumer safety, while still providing consumers \n     access to the products they seek. It will provide increased \n     funding for FDA, and in particular to the dietary supplement \n     programs within the Center for Food Safety & Applied \n     Nutrition (CFSAN). The legislation also directs the agency to \n     provide annual reports to Congress making itself accountable \n     for enforcing key provisions of the law, just as the industry \n     is responsible for complying with them. While some critics of \n     the dietary supplement industry have called for new laws to \n     change the way dietary supplements are regulated, this \n     legislation acknowledges that DSHEA carefully balanced \n     consumer access with consumer protection and seeks to make \n     the existing law work through real efforts to implement it. \n     Having more laws, without enforcement, only disadvantages the \n     responsible members of industry who do comply with the law \n     because it is the law and because it's the right thing to do \n     for their consumers, and gives rogue companies more laws to \n     violate. The better approach is to have a robust and \n     accountable FDA empowered and staffed to enforce the current \n     law that will level the playing field for all members of the \n     marketplace. As previous FDA Commissioners have testified to \n     Congress, DSHEA provides more than adequate authority for \n     government while still allowing consumers appropriate access \n     to the products and health information they demand.\n       More than 150 million Americans use dietary supplements, \n     and these consumers demand a strong industry that is \n     appropriately regulated. We hope Congress will give this \n     legislation expedient and thoughtful consideration on its way \n     to passage.

This bill is the most recent \n     example of your continued leadership in support of dietary \n     supplements.\n       The ``Dietary Supplement Full Implementation and \n     Enforcement Act of 2010'' strengthens FDA's ability to \n     enforce the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act \n     (DSHEA), expands research, calls for the release of the long-\n     awaited New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) guidance, and requires \n     the filing of an annual report to Congress on the \n     implementation and enforcement of DSHEA.\n       Critically, your bill also authorizes the funds needed for \n     the full implementation of DSHEA. In the years following \n     passage of the act, chronic budget shortfalls took a toll on \n     FDA, including funding for the Office of Dietary Supplements \n     (ODS). Authorizing these funds is an important step in making \n     sure ODS has the resources it needs.\n       Again, we applaud your introduction of the Dietary \n     Supplement Full Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2010, \n     and look forward to working with you to enact this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Linda A.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to the importation of prescription drugs and to amend part \nD of title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to negotiate covered part D drug prices on \nbehalf of Medicare beneficiaries; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fair Pricing \nfor Prescription Drugs Act to help make prescription drugs more \naffordable for all Americans. This legislation endorses the excellent \nwork that my colleague Senator Dorgan of North Dakota has done to \npromote importing prescription drugs from other industrialized \ncountries. And it includes companion language to Congressman Welch's \nbill to call on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate \ndrug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Here in the \nSenate, several of my colleagues, most recently Senator Bill Nelson of \nFlorida, have tirelessly pushed the need for negotiation of drug \nprices. I am proud to have stood with my colleagues on these issues \nover the last decade--and feel strongly that Congress must move quickly \nto ensure that all Americans--whether they purchase private health \ninsurance or are enrolled in Medicare--have fairly priced prescription \ndrugs.\n  Allowing for importation of prescription drugs and price negotiation \nfor Medicare Part D are common sense policies, These are changes that \nCongress can make to drastically improve the affordability of \nprescription drugs for our constituents, save the government money, and \nfurther enhance the health reform law passed earlier this year. I was \npleased to be a part of that historic effort, but the health reform law \nwas not perfect and did not go as far as it could have to reduce \nprescription drug prices for consumers. I have heard from thousands of \nWisconsinites about the need for health reform during my time in the \nSenate. The health reform law empowers consumers and small businesses \nfor the first time in our history to demand more for their health care \ndollar. These changes will\n\n[[Page S4219]]\n\nimprove the affordability of health insurance and medical care for \nindividuals and families. But I also continue to hear from \nWisconsinites about the burden of rising prescription drug costs. They \nneed our help.\n  One of the fastest ways to reduce prescription drug costs is to allow \nfor importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs from other \nindustrialized nations like Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and \nEuropean countries. Americans pay some of the highest prices for the \nsame prescription drugs that are sold 33 to 55 percent less in other \ncountries. Americans are now importing more than $1 billion in \nprescription drugs from Canada alone. In these tough economic times, \nand with equally safe but more affordable drugs just over the border, \nit is no wonder that Americans are going to such lengths to buy the \nprescriptions they need.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2007 that allowing \nimportation of prescription drugs would save consumers upwards of $50 \nbillion. Just last year, the CBO reviewed their original estimate of \ngovernment savings as a result of this policy, concluding that the \ngovernment would nearly double its expected savings to over $19 \nbillion.\n  We do a lot of things in Congress that leave our constituents \nscratching their heads. Well, now we have a chance to show them we are \nlistening to them, that we understand their concerns, and that we want \nto bring down Federal spending while ensuring the prescriptions drugs \nthey need are more affordable.\n  We can also do more to ensure affordable prescription drugs for \nMedicare beneficiaries by calling on the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to negotiate drug prices for Medicare Part D enrollees. Mr. \nPresident, I opposed the legislation that created the Medicare Part D \ndrug benefit because I did not believe the program would provide \nadequate financial relief for Medicare beneficiaries facing high \nprescription drug costs. This legislation actually included a provision \nwhich explicitly forbade the Secretary from negotiating with drug \nmanufacturers on behalf of seniors' interests. We should have done \nbetter for our seniors. And they are living with the consequence of \nthat decision today--with ever-rising prescription drug costs.\n  The health reform law will provide some relief, particularly for the \ndreaded ``donut hole'' of Medicare Part D. But health reform does not \nspeak to the other glaring shortfall of the Medicare Part D program--\nthat the government is prohibited from negotiating for better drug \nprices for beneficiaries.\n  Negotiating on behalf of beneficiaries is hardly a radical idea, Mr. \nPresident. The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, negotiates on drug \nprices and spends considerably less than the Medicare program on the \nsame drugs. The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare released a study that found that VA drug prices are, on \naverage, 48 percent lower than Medicare Part D prices for the top 10 \nprescribed drugs. NCPSSM estimates that billions could be saved \nannually by requiring the Secretary to negotiate drug prices for \nMedicare Part D. With the government on the hook for over $50 billion \nin drug costs for Part D alone, it is simply irresponsible to not \naggressively seek new savings from negotiating prices. Focusing on \nlowering the price of prescription drugs rather than subsidizing \ninsurance and pharmaceutical companies will not only provide relief for \nthe sick, but will save taxpayer dollars.\n  Changing how we purchase prescription drugs by allowing importation \nfrom industrialized countries and negotiation on pricing for Medicare \nPart D is a clear and simple way to reduce prescription drug costs, \nreduce government spending, and keep Americans healthier. I am thankful \nfor the leadership that my colleagues have shown in introducing \nlegislation on these topics, and add my voice, and my bill, to theirs \nin our combined effort to answer the demands of our constituents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Casey, and Mr. \n        Brown of Ohio):\n  S. 3418. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to \nspecifically include, in programs of the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration, programs to research, prevent, and \naddress the harmful consequences of pathological and other problem \ngambling, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Comprehensive \nProblem Gambling Act, a bill I introduced just moments ago with Senator \nMike Johanns. This bill would establish and implement programs targeted \nat preventing, treating, and researching problem gambling.\n  Currently, the Federal Government provides millions of dollars to \ntreat alcohol and drug addiction, but does not dedicate resources to \ntreat the effects of problem gambling, which can destroy a person's \ncareer and financial standing, disrupt marriages and personal \nrelationships, and encourage participation in criminal activity.\n  Over the past decade, gaming and gambling has grown significantly in \nthe United States. According to the National Council on Problem \nGambling, approximately 6 to 9 million American adults are problem \ngamblers.\n  The recent economic downturn only compounds this situation as many \nStates consider relaxing gaming laws in an effort to raise state \nrevenues. At the same time, the Federal Government and most states have \ndevoted very little, if any, resources to the prevention and treatment \nof compulsive gambling. In fact, no Federal agency is currently \nresponsible for coordinating efforts for treatment and prevention. \nPrevention and treatment programs have been proven to save money by \ndecreasing the severity and prevalence of problem gambling, but cash-\nstrapped states are struggling just to maintain funding for pre-\nexisting programs.\n  I believe that if State governments benefit from gambling and lottery \nproceeds, then those governments have an obligation to provide \nassistance to those suffering from a gambling addiction. I am proud \nthat the State of Oregon understands this concept and has one of the \nmost comprehensive treatment systems in the country.\n  Through Oregon's Gambling Treatment Fund, one percent of Oregon \nLottery revenues are transferred to the Oregon Department of Human \nServices for the administration of problem gambling services. However, \ndecreasing lottery revenues has resulted in reduced treatment dollars.\n  I'd like to share the story of one of my constituents. For Toni, \ngambling started out as a fun trip to Reno or Las Vegas. She began \nplaying video poker on occasion, and when she ran out of money, she \nwould simply go home. But then the casinos brought in ATM machines, and \nshe no longer had to leave the facility to access money. She could stay \nfor hours, and did. Gambling quickly went from being a fun activity to \nan escape from problems and stresses in her life.\n  Before long, gambling had consumed Toni's life. She gambled away her \nlife savings and went through credit card after credit card, racking up \nthe cash advance limits and borrowing money from family members to pay \nit off. She tried to quit numerous times, but, as she describes it, the \nurge to gamble was much stronger than she was. Eventually, she couldn't \ndo it anymore. She couldn't stop thinking about how she was going to \nget her next ``fix''. She ``felt about as low as you can go.'' She knew \nshe had to get help.\n  Toni sought treatment in May 2009, and will soon reach the one year \ngoal she set with her counselor to be gambling-free. However, she \ncontinues to face the long-term impacts of her gambling. Toni and her \nfamily live paycheck to paycheck and she worries that the debt she has \naccrued could cause her family to lose their house if the bank decides \nto raise interest on their mortgage. But Toni sees hope in her future \nbecause she had access to treatment and critical support services. \nWhile Toni has been able to start her own recovery, thousands of \nindividuals across the country continue to struggle with their gambling \naddictions because there are so few prevention and treatment resources \nin place.\n  Unfortunately, the lack of education and research surrounding this \nissue has made it difficult to allot the appropriate resources to \naddress these problems. The Comprehensive Problem Gambling Act would \nprovide $14.2 million in competitive grants annually for 5 years to \nnon-profits, universities, state agencies, and tribal governments\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\nfor prevention, research, and treatment of problem gambling.\n  Recent studies show conclusively that every $1 spent on treatment \nsaves more than $2 in social costs. This legislation is a minimal \ninvestment with life-changing returns.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Toni and the countless \nother individuals who struggle without supports by cosponsoring the \nComprehensive Problem Gambling Act of 2010.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to exclude from consumer credit reports medical debt \nthat has been in collection and has been fully paid or settled, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to propose legislation to \naddress the problem of medical debt and credit scores. While historic \nhealth reform legislation enacted this year sets us on a path towards \nending the crushing problem of Americans who lack health insurance, the \nchallenges of our health care billing system remain a work in progress. \nOne of those problems arises when our system of third-party payment \nleads to errors in billing and payments that, through no fault of the \nborrower, nevertheless undermine a borrower's credit scores. The \nborrower then must pay more for a home, a car, or his or her credit \ncard, and in some cases, cannot at all get the loan he or she needs and \ndeserves. To address this unfair burden, I have introduced the Medical \nDebt Relief Act.\n  Unlike consumer debt, Americans do not get to choose when accidents \nor medical emergencies happen. Medical debt is not the result of \nirresponsible consumer spending and is a not an indicator of poor \ncredit. According to the Commonwealth Fund, accrued medical debt \nplagued nearly 72 million adults in 2007, and over 28 million American \nconsumers were harassed by collection agencies for unpaid medical bills \nthat same year. Research done by the Federal Reserve has found that \nmedical bills make up the majority of non-credit card related accounts \nin collection and found on credit reports.\n  Nor is the problem of medical debt in relation to credit scores \nsimply a question of whether one has insurance or not. Rather, medical \ndebt credit challenges are a direct function of the nature of our \ninsurance system. Because of the third-party payment system of \ninsurance, medical debt is far more likely to be in dispute, \ninconsistently reported, mired in the complex medical payment \nbureaucracy, or transferred to collections without the consumer's \nknowledge. It can often take months, if not years, to adjudicate these \nclaims. Unfortunately, even one negative medical collection mark can \ndamage a consumer's credit score, thereby costing the consumer higher \ninterest rates on automobile loans, home loans, and credit cards. It \ncan even block the consumer from making purchases entirely. Sadly, even \nafter the consumer has\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\npaid off or settled delinquent medical debt, the negative mark on the \ncredit report continues to plague the consumer for years.\n  The Medical Debt Relief Act is a straight forward solution to this \nproblem. It would require the removal from a consumer's credit report \nthose medical-related debts that have been fully paid. Companion \nlegislation has already been introduced in the House by Rep. Mary Jo \nKilroy and presently enjoys the support of 70 cosponsors. This \nlegislation is also supported by the Consumer's Union, National \nConsumer Law Center and the National Association of Consumer Advocates.\n  I am honored today to be joined by Senators Dorgan, Schumer, \nMenendez, and Harkin in this effort to fix this important problem in \nhow Americans access credit. This is common sense legislation that will \noffer tangible relief to the ordinary Americans who work hard, pay \ntheir bills, and want to borrow money at reasonable rates to finance \nthe next step in their American dream. I urge my colleagues to join us \nin the effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3419\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) medical debt is unique, and Americans do not choose \n     when accidents happen or when illness strikes;\n       (2) medical debt collection issues affect both insured and \n     uninsured consumers;\n       (3) according to credit evaluators, medical debt \n     collections are more likely to be in dispute, inconsistently \n     reported, and of questionable value in predicting future \n     payment performance because it is atypical and nonpredictive;\n       (4) nevertheless, medical debt that has been completely \n     paid off or settled can significantly damage the credit score \n     of a consumer for years;\n       (5) as a result, consumers may be denied credit or pay \n     higher interest rates when buying a home or obtaining a \n     credit card;\n       (6) healthcare providers are increasingly turning to \n     outside collection agencies to help secure payment from \n     patients, coming at the expense of the consumer, because \n     medical debts are not typically reported unless they become \n     assigned to collections;\n       (7) in fact, medical bills account for more than half of \n     all non-credit related collection actions reported to \n     consumer credit reporting agencies;\n       (8) the issue of medical debt affects millions of \n     consumers;\n       (9) according to the Commonwealth Fund, medical bill \n     problems or accrued medical debt affects roughly 72,000,000 \n     working-age adults in America; and\n       (10) in 2007, 28,000,000 working-age American adults were \n     contacted by a collection agency for unpaid medical bills.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to exclude from \n     consumer credit reports medical debt that had been \n     characterized as debt in collection for credit reporting \n     purposes and has been fully paid or settled.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT.\n\n       (a) Medical Debt Defined.--Section 603 of the Fair Credit \n     Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(y) Medical Debt.--The term `medical debt' means a debt \n     described in section 604(g)(1)(C).''.\n       (b) Exclusion for Paid or Settled Medical Debt.--Section \n     605(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681c(a)) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) Any information related to a fully paid or settled \n     medical debt that had been characterized as delinquent, \n     charged off, or in collection which, from the date of payment \n     or settlement, antedates the report by more than 45 days.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 3420.

A bill to provide the President with expedited consideration \nof proposals for cancellation of certain budget items; to the Committee \non the Budget.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Veto Wasteful \nSpending and Protect Taxpayers Act of 2010 which establishes a \nconstitutional line-item veto by creating an expedited rescissions \nprocess.\n  Yesterday, the Obama administration unveiled the Reduce Unnecessary \nSpending Act of 2010. This legislation is very similar to my proposal \nwhich I first introduced in 2006. They both provide for an expedited \nrescission process. The line-item veto is not a panacea for record \nlevel deficits, but it will provide the President with the necessary \ntool to reduce wasteful spending.\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\n  Both bills will give the President the ability to target projects \nthat have been added in spending bills that benefit special interests \nor are not necessary. I applaud President Obama for addressing this \nissue.\n  I have been a long-time advocate of the line-item veto. It has been a \nsuccessful tool at the state level and I think it can effectively \nreduce spending on the Federal level. We have made progress with \nearmark reform and I think expedited rescission would result in further \nspending reductions.\n  The major difference between my legislation and the Administration's \nproposal is that the Veto Wasteful Spending and Protect Taxpayers Act \nof 2010 would allow the President to suspend and propose cancellation \nfor discretionary spending, new direct spending, and limited tax \nbenefits. The Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010 focuses on \ndiscretionary spending. If we really want to tackle wasteful spending, \nI think we need to look at new entitlement spending and limited tax \nbenefits, not just discretionary spending.\n  In 1996, the Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law \nthe Line Item Veto Act, P.L. 104-130. Two years later, however, in \nClinton v. City of New York the Supreme Court concluded that the method \nused to give the President line-item veto authority was \nunconstitutional. The Court noted that presidents may only sign or veto \nentire acts of Congress. The Constitution does not authorize presidents \nto enact, to amend or to repeal statutes.\n  We can restore the line item veto and be consistent with the \nConstitution. The key difference between what I am proposing and what \nthe Supreme Court struck down is the legal effect of the President's \nactions. The Line Item Veto Act allowed the President to cancel \nprovisions in their entirety, but the Supreme Court rejected this \narrangement. My legislation will empower the President to suspend \nprovisions until the Congress decides to approve or disapprove the \nsuspension of that provision with an up or down vote. The provisions \nare not cancelled out of the legislation. I believe this change \naddresses the Supreme Court's concerns. My legislation also does not \ninclude a mechanism which allows a provision to be suspended for a \nlengthy time period.\n  Under the Veto Wasteful Spending and Protect Taxpayers Act of 2010, \nthe President has 10 calendar days to submit to Congress a special \nmessage. The President may transmit two messages per bill, but a \nprovision may only be proposed for suspension or cancellation one time. \nThe House and Senate would consider the special message under a special \nprocess which does not allow for amendments or motions to strike.\n  I believe that the line-item veto is a valuable tool that should be \nmade available to any President regardless of political party. For this \nreason, the Veto Wasteful Spending and Protect Taxpayers Act of 2010 is \npermanent, rather than sunsetting after a few years.\n  It is time to reinstate the line-item veto. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to return to the \nPresident the authority to rein in wasteful spending.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 3424.

A motion to reconsider the \n     vote by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in \n     order.\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\n       (B) Consideration.--The 2007 spending bill shall be \n     considered as read. The previous question shall be considered \n     as ordered on the 2007 spending bill to its passage without \n     intervening motion except 50 hours of debate, equally divided \n     and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. A motion to \n     limit debate shall be in order during such debate. A motion \n     to reconsider the vote on passage of the 2007 spending bill \n     shall not be in order.\n       (C) Appeals.--Appeals from decisions of the chair relating \n     to the application of the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives to the procedure relating to the 2007 \n     spending bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (D) Application of house rules.--Except to the extent \n     specifically provided in this paragraph, consideration of an \n     2007 spending bill shall be governed by the Rules of the \n     House of Representatives. It shall not be in order in the \n     House of Representatives to consider any 2007 spending bill \n     introduced pursuant to the provisions of this subsection \n     under a suspension of the rules pursuant to clause 1 of House \n     Rule XV, or under a special rule reported by the House \n     Committee on Rules.\n       (E) Amendments.--It shall be in order to offer amendments \n     to the 2007 spending bill, provided that any such amendment \n     is relevant and would not result in an overall outlay level \n     exceeding the level included in the 2007 spending bill.\n       (F) Vote on passage.--Immediately following the conclusion \n     of consideration of the 2007 spending bill, the vote on \n     passage of the 2007 spending bill shall occur without any \n     intervening action or motion and shall require an affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. \n     If the 2007 spending bill is passed, the Clerk of the House \n     of Representatives shall cause the bill to be transmitted to \n     the Senate before the close of the next day of session of the \n     House.\n       (4) Fast track consideration in senate.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding rule XXII of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than 7 days of \n     session after the date on which an 2007 spending bill is \n     reported or discharged from all committees to which it was \n     referred, for the majority leader of the Senate or the \n     majority leader's designee to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the 2007 spending bill. It shall also be in \n     order for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the 2007 spending bill at any time after the \n     conclusion of such 7-day period. A motion to proceed is in \n     order even though a previous motion to the same effect has \n     been disagreed to. All points of order against the motion to \n     proceed to the 2007 spending bill are waived. The motion to \n     proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to a \n     motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by which \n     the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in \n     order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the \n     2007 spending bill is agreed to, the 2007 spending bill shall \n     remain the unfinished business until disposed of.\n       (B) Debate.--Consideration of an 2007 spending bill and of \n     all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith \n     shall not exceed a total of 50 hours. Debate shall be divided \n     equally between the majority and minority leaders or their \n     designees. A motion further to limit debate on the 2007 \n     spending bill is in order. Any debatable motion or appeal is \n     debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be divided equally \n     between those favoring and those opposing the motion or \n     appeal. All time used for consideration of the 2007 spending \n     bill, including time used for quorum calls and voting, shall \n     be counted against the total 50 hours of consideration.\n       (C) Amendments.--It shall be in order to offer amendments \n     to the 2007 spending bill, provided that any such amendment \n     is relevant and would not result in an overall outlay level \n     exceeding the level included in the 2007 spending bill.\n       (D) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall occur \n     immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the \n     2007 spending bill and a single quorum call at the conclusion \n     of the debate if requested. Passage shall require an \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen \n     and sworn.\n       (E) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate to the procedure relating to a 2007 \n     spending bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (5) Rules to coordinate action with other house.--\n       (A) Referral.--If, before the passage by 1 House of an 2007 \n     spending bill of that House, that House receives from the \n     other House an 2007 spending bill, then such proposal from \n     the other House shall not be referred to a committee and \n     shall immediately be placed on the calendar.\n       (B) Treatment of 2007 spending bill of other house.--If 1 \n     House fails to introduce or consider a 2007 spending bill \n     under this section, the 2007 spending bill of the other House \n     shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under this \n     section.\n       (C) Procedure.--\n       (i) 2007 spending bill in the senate.--If prior to passage \n     of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate, the Senate receives \n     an 2007 spending bill from the House, the procedure in the \n     Senate shall be the same as if no 2007 spending bill had been \n     received from the House except that--\n\n       (I) the vote on final passage shall be on the 2007 spending \n     bill of the House if it is identical to the 2007 spending \n     bill then pending for passage in the Senate; or\n       (II) if the 2007 spending bill from the House is not \n     identical to the 2007 spending bill then pending for passage \n     in the Senate and the Senate then passes the Senate 2007 \n     spending bill, the Senate shall be considered to have passed \n     the House 2007 spending bill as amended by the text of the \n     Senate 2007 spending bill.\n\n       (ii) Disposition of the 2007 spending bill.--Upon \n     disposition of the 2007 spending bill received from the \n     House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the 2007 \n     spending bill originated in the Senate.\n       (D) Treatment of companion measures in the senate.--If \n     following passage of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate, \n     the Senate then receives an 2007 spending bill from the House \n     of Representatives that is the same as the 2007 spending bill \n     passed by the House, the House-passed 2007 spending bill \n     shall not be debatable. If the House-passed 2007 spending \n     bill is identical to the Senate-passed 2007 spending bill, \n     the vote on passage of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate \n     shall be considered to be the vote on passage of the 2007 \n     spending bill received from the House of Representatives. If \n     it is not identical to the House-passed 2007 spending bill, \n     then the Senate shall be considered to have passed the 2007 \n     spending bill of the House as amended by the text of the \n     Senate 2007 spending bill.\n       (E) Consideration in conference.--Upon passage of the 2007 \n     spending bill, the Senate shall be deemed to have insisted on \n     its amendment and requested a conference with the House of \n     Representatives on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \n     and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part \n     of the Senate, without any intervening action.\n       (F) Action on conference reports in senate.--\n       (i) Motion to proceed.--A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the conference report on the 2007 spending \n     bill may be made even though a previous motion to the same \n     effect has been disagreed to.\n       (ii) Consideration.--During the consideration in the Senate \n     of the conference report (or a message between Houses) on the \n     2007 spending bill, and all amendments in disagreement, and \n     all amendments thereto, and debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, debate (or consideration) shall be \n     limited to 30 hours, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the majority leader and minority leader or \n     their designees.

Debate on any amendment to any such \n     instructions shall be limited to 20 minutes, to be equally \n     divided between and controlled by the mover and the manager \n     of the conference report. In all cases when the manager of \n     the conference report is in favor of any motion, appeal, or \n     amendment, the time in opposition shall be under the control \n     of the minority leader or his designee.\n       (iv) Amendments in disagreement.--If there are amendments \n     in disagreement to a conference report on the 2007 spending \n     bill, time on each amendment shall be limited to 30 minutes, \n     to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the manager \n     of the conference report and the minority leader or his \n     designee. No amendment that is not germane to the provisions \n     of such amendments shall be received.\n       (G) Vote on conference report in each house.--Passage of \n     the conference in each House shall be by an affirmative vote \n     of three-fifths of the Members of that House, duly chosen and \n     sworn.\n       (H) Veto.--If the President vetoes the bill debate on a \n     veto message in the Senate under this subsection shall be 1 \n     hour equally divided between the majority and minority \n     leaders or their designees.\n       (6) Rules of the senate and house of representatives.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed \n     to be part of the rules of each House, respectively but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of bill under this section, and it \n     supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is \n     inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n\n     SEC. 2.

and\n       (ii) not be required to post any bond in order to pursue \n     such remedies.\n       (C) No attachment or execution.--No attachment or execution \n     may be issued by any court upon assets in the possession of \n     the Corporation as receiver for a covered financial company.\n       (D) Limitation on judicial review.--Except as otherwise \n     provided in this title, no court shall have jurisdiction \n     over--\n       (i) any claim or action for payment from, or any action \n     seeking a determination of rights with respect to, the assets \n     of any covered financial company for which the Corporation \n     has been appointed receiver, including any assets which the \n     Corporation may acquire from itself as such receiver; or\n       (ii) any claim relating to any act or omission of such \n     covered financial company or the Corporation as receiver.\n       (E) Disposition of assets.--In exercising any right, power, \n     privilege, or authority as receiver in connection with any \n     covered financial company for which the Corporation is acting \n     as receiver under this section, the Corporation shall, to the \n     greatest extent practicable, conduct its operations in a \n     manner that--\n       (i) maximizes the net present value return from the sale or \n     disposition of such assets;\n       (ii) minimizes the amount of any loss realized in the \n     resolution of cases;\n       (iii) mitigates the potential for serious adverse effects \n     to the financial system;\n       (iv) ensures timely and adequate competition and fair and \n     consistent treatment of offerors;

or\n       (II) the period applicable under State law; and\n\n       (ii) in the case of any tort claim, the longer of--\n\n       (I) the 3-year period beginning on the date on which the \n     claim accrues; or\n       (II) the period applicable under State law.\n\n       (B) Date on which a claim accrues.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (A), the date on which the statute of \n     limitations begins to run on any claim described in \n     subparagraph (A) shall be the later of--\n       (i) the date of the appointment of the Corporation as \n     receiver under this title; or\n       (ii) the date on which the cause of action accrues.\n       (C) Revival of expired state causes of action.--\n       (i) In general.--In the case of any tort claim described in \n     clause (ii) for which the applicable statute of limitations \n     under State law has expired not more than 5 years before the \n     date of appointment of the Corporation as receiver for a \n     covered financial company, the Corporation may bring an \n     action as receiver on such claim without regard to the \n     expiration of the statute of limitations.\n       (ii) Claims described.--A tort claim referred to in clause \n     (i) is a claim arising from fraud, intentional misconduct \n     resulting in unjust enrichment, or intentional misconduct \n     resulting in substantial loss to the covered financial \n     company.\n       (11) Avoidable transfers.--\n       (A) Fraudulent transfers.--The Corporation, as receiver for \n     any covered financial company, may avoid a transfer of any \n     interest of the covered financial company in property, or any \n     obligation incurred by the covered financial company, that \n     was made or incurred at or within 2 years before the time of \n     commencement, if--\n       (i) the covered financial company voluntarily or \n     involuntarily--\n\n       (I) made such transfer or incurred such obligation with \n     actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to \n     which the covered financial company was or became, on or \n     after the date on which such transfer was made or such \n     obligation was incurred, indebted; or\n       (II) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in \n     exchange for such transferor obligation; and\n\n       (ii) the covered financial company voluntarily or \n     involuntarily--\n\n       (I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made \n     or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a \n     result of such transfer or obligation;\n       (II) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about \n     to engage in business or a transaction, for which any \n     property remaining with the covered financial company was an \n     unreasonably small capital;\n       (III) intended to incur, or believed that the covered \n     financial company would incur, debts that would be beyond the \n     ability of the covered financial company to pay as such debts \n     matured; or\n       (IV) made such transfer to or for the benefit of an \n     insider, or incurred such obligation to or for the benefit of \n     an insider, under an employment contract and not in the \n     ordinary course of business.\n\n       (B) Preferential transfers.--The Corporation as receiver \n     for any covered financial company may avoid a transfer of an \n     interest of the covered financial company in property--\n       (i) to or for the benefit of a creditor;\n       (ii) for or on account of an antecedent debt that was owed \n     by the covered financial company before the transfer was \n     made;\n       (iii) that was made while the covered financial company was \n     insolvent;\n       (iv) that was made--\n\n       (I) 90 days or less before the date on which the \n     Corporation was appointed receiver; or\n       (II) more than 90 days, but less than 1 year before the \n     date on which the Corporation was appointed receiver, if such \n     creditor at the time of the transfer was an insider; and\n\n       (v) that enables the creditor to receive more than the \n     creditor would receive if--\n\n       (I) the covered financial company had been liquidated under \n     chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code;\n       (II) the transfer had not been made; and\n       (III) the creditor received payment of such debt to the \n     extent provided by the provisions of chapter 7 of the \n     Bankruptcy Code.\n\n       (C) Post-receivership transactions.--The Corporation as \n     receiver for any covered financial company may avoid a \n     transfer of property of the receivership that occurred after \n     the Corporation was appointed receiver that was not \n     authorized under this title by the Corporation as receiver.\n       (D) Right of recovery.--To the extent that a transfer is \n     avoided under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), the Corporation \n     may recover, for the benefit of the covered financial \n     company, the property transferred or, if a court so orders, \n     the value of such property (at the time of such transfer) \n     from--\n       (i) the initial transferee of such transfer or the person \n     for whose benefit such transfer was made; or\n       (ii) any immediate or mediate transferee of any such \n     initial transferee.\n       (E) Rights of transferee or obligee.--The Corporation may \n     not recover under subparagraph (D)(ii) from--\n       (i) any transferee that takes for value, including in \n     satisfaction of or to secure a present or antecedent debt, in \n     good faith, and without knowledge of the voidability of the \n     transfer avoided; or\n       (ii) any immediate or mediate good faith transferee of such \n     transferee.\n       (F) Defenses.--Subject to the other provisions of this \n     title--\n       (i) a transferee or obligee from which the Corporation \n     seeks to recover a transfer or to avoid an obligation under \n     subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) shall have the same \n     defenses available to a transferee or obligee from which a \n     trustee seeks to recover a transfer or avoid an obligation \n     under; and\n       (ii) the authority of the Corporation to recover a transfer \n     or avoid an obligation shall be subject to subsections (b) \n     and (c) of section 546, section 547(c), and section 548(c) of \n     the Bankruptcy Code.\n       (G) Rights under this section.--The rights of the \n     Corporation as receiver under this section shall be superior \n     to any rights of a trustee or any other party (other than a \n     Federal agency) under the Bankruptcy Code.\n       (H) Rules of construction; definitions.--For purposes of--\n       (i) subparagraphs (A) and (B)--\n\n       (I) the term ``insider'' has the same meaning as in section \n     101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code;\n       (II) a transfer is made when such transfer is so perfected \n     that a bona fide purchaser from the covered financial company \n     against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be \n     perfected cannot acquire an interest in the property \n     transferred that is superior to the interest in such property \n     of the transferee, but if such transfer is not so perfected \n     before the date on which the Corporation is appointed as \n     receiver for the covered financial company, such transfer is \n     made immediately before the date of such appointment; and\n       (III) the term ``value'' means property, or satisfaction or \n     securing of a present or antecedent\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\n     debt of the covered financial company, but does not include \n     an unperformed promise to furnish support to the covered \n     financial company; and\n\n       (ii) subparagraph (B)--\n\n       (I) the covered financial company is presumed to have been \n     insolvent on and during the 90-day period immediately \n     preceding the date of appointment of the Corporation as \n     receiver; and\n       (II) the term ``insolvent'' has the same meaning as in \n     section 101(32) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n       (12) Setoff.--\n       (A) Generally.--Except as otherwise provided in this title, \n     any right of a creditor to offset a mutual debt owed by the \n     creditor to any covered financial company that arose before \n     the Corporation was appointed as receiver for the covered \n     financial company against a claim of such creditor may be \n     asserted if enforceable under applicable noninsolvency law, \n     except to the extent that--\n       (i) the claim of the creditor against the covered financial \n     company is disallowed;\n       (ii) the claim was transferred, by an entity other than the \n     covered financial company, to the creditor--\n\n       (I) after the Corporation was appointed as receiver of the \n     covered financial company; or\n       (II)(aa) after the 90-day period preceding the date on \n     which the Corporation was appointed as receiver for the \n     covered financial company; and\n       (bb) while the covered financial company was insolvent \n     (except for a setoff in connection with a qualified financial \n     contract); or\n\n       (iii) the debt owed to the covered financial company was \n     incurred by the covered financial company--\n\n       (I) after the 90-day period preceding the date on which the \n     Corporation was appointed as receiver for the covered \n     financial company;\n       (II) while the covered financial company was insolvent; and\n       (III) for the purpose of obtaining a right of setoff \n     against the covered financial company (except for a setoff in \n     connection with a qualified financial contract).\n\n       (B) Insufficiency.--\n       (i) In general.--Except with respect to a setoff in \n     connection with a qualified financial contract, if a creditor \n     offsets a mutual debt owed to the covered financial company \n     against a claim of the covered financial company on or within \n     the 90-day period preceding the date on which the Corporation \n     is appointed as receiver for the covered financial company, \n     the Corporation may recover from the creditor the amount so \n     offset, to the extent that any insufficiency on the date of \n     such setoff is less than the insufficiency on the later of--\n\n       (I) the date that is 90 days before the date on which the \n     Corporation is appointed as receiver for the covered \n     financial company; or\n       (II) the first day on which there is an insufficiency \n     during the 90-day period preceding the date on which the \n     Corporation is appointed as receiver for the covered \n     financial company.\n\n       (ii) Definition of insufficiency.--In this subparagraph, \n     the term ``insufficiency'' means the amount, if any, by which \n     a claim against the covered financial company exceeds a \n     mutual debt owed to the covered financial company by the \n     holder of such claim.\n       (C) Insolvency.--The term ``insolvent'' has the same \n     meaning as in section 101(32) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n       (D) Presumption of insolvency.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the covered financial company is presumed to have \n     been insolvent on and during the 90-day period preceding the \n     date of appointment of the Corporation as receiver.\n       (E) Limitation.--Nothing in this paragraph (12) shall be \n     the basis for any right of setoff where no such right exists \n     under applicable noninsolvency law.\n       (F) Priority claim.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     title, the Corporation as receiver for the covered financial \n     company may sell or transfer any assets free and clear of the \n     setoff rights of any party, except that such party shall be \n     entitled to a claim, subordinate to the claims payable under \n     subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of subsection (b)(1), \n     but senior to all other unsecured liabilities defined in \n     subsection (b)(1)(E), in an amount equal to the value of such \n     setoff rights.\n       (13) Attachment of assets and other injunctive relief.--\n     Subject to paragraph (14), any court of competent \n     jurisdiction may, at the request of the Corporation as \n     receiver for a covered financial company, issue an order in \n     accordance with Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure, including an order placing the assets of any \n     person designated by the Corporation under the control of the \n     court and appointing a trustee to hold such assets.\n       (14) Standards.--\n       (A) Showing.--Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure shall apply with respect to any proceeding under \n     paragraph (13), without regard to the requirement that the \n     applicant show that the injury, loss, or damage is \n     irreparable and immediate.\n       (B) State proceeding.--If, in the case of any proceeding in \n     a State court, the court determines that rules of civil \n     procedure available under the laws of the State provide \n     substantially similar protections of the right of the parties \n     to due process as provided under Rule 65 (as modified with \n     respect to such proceeding by subparagraph (A)), the relief \n     sought by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph (14) may be \n     requested under the laws of such State.\n       (15) Treatment of claims arising from breach of contracts \n     executed by the corporation as receiver.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this title, any final and non-appealable \n     judgment for monetary damages entered against the Corporation \n     as receiver for a covered financial company for the breach of \n     an agreement executed or approved by the Corporation after \n     the date of its appointment shall be paid as an \n     administrative expense of the receiver. Nothing in this \n     paragraph shall be construed to limit the power of a receiver \n     to exercise any rights under contract or law, including to \n     terminate, breach, cancel, or otherwise discontinue such \n     agreement.\n       (16) Accounting and recordkeeping requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--The Corporation as receiver for a covered \n     financial company shall, consistent with the accounting and \n     reporting practices and procedures established by the \n     Corporation, maintain a full accounting of each receivership \n     or other disposition of any covered financial company.\n       (B) Annual accounting or report.--With respect to each \n     receivership to which the Corporation is appointed, the \n     Corporation shall make an annual accounting or report, as \n     appropriate, available to the Secretary and the Comptroller \n     General of the United States.\n       (C) Availability of reports.--Any report prepared pursuant \n     to subparagraph (B) and section 203(c)(3) shall be made \n     available to the public by the Corporation.\n       (D) Recordkeeping requirement.--\n       (i) In general.--The Corporation shall prescribe such \n     regulations and establish such retention schedules as are \n     necessary to maintain the documents and records of the \n     Corporation generated in exercising the authorities of this \n     title and the records of a covered financial company for \n     which the Corporation is appointed receiver, with due regard \n     for--\n\n       (I) the avoidance of duplicative record retention; and\n       (II) the expected evidentiary needs of the Corporation as \n     receiver for a covered financial company and the public \n     regarding the records of covered financial companies.\n\n       (ii) Retention of records.--Unless otherwise required by \n     applicable Federal law or court order, the Corporation may \n     not, at any time, destroy any records that are subject to \n     clause (i).\n       (iii) Records defined.--As used in this subparagraph, the \n     terms ``records'' and ``records of a covered financial \n     company'' mean any document, book, paper, map, photograph, \n     microfiche, microfilm, computer or electronically-created \n     record generated or maintained by the covered financial \n     company in the course of and necessary to its transaction of \n     business.\n       (b) Priority of Expenses and Unsecured Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--Unsecured claims against a covered \n     financial company, or the Corporation as receiver for such \n     covered financial company under this section, that are proven \n     to the satisfaction of the receiver shall have priority in \n     the following order:\n       (A) Administrative expenses of the receiver.\n       (B) Any amounts owed to the United States, unless the \n     United States agrees or consents otherwise.\n       (C) Wages, salaries, or commissions, including vacation, \n     severance, and sick leave pay earned by an individual (other \n     than an individual described in subparagraph (G)), but only \n     to the extent of $11,725 for each individual (as indexed for \n     inflation, by regulation of the Corporation) earned not later \n     than 180 days before the date of appointment of the \n     Corporation as receiver.\n       (D) Contributions owed to employee benefit plans arising \n     from services rendered not later than 180 days before the \n     date of appointment of the Corporation as receiver, to the \n     extent of the number of employees covered by each such plan, \n     multiplied by $11,725 (as indexed for inflation, by \n     regulation of the Corporation), less the aggregate amount \n     paid to such employees under subparagraph (C), plus the \n     aggregate amount paid by the receivership on behalf of such \n     employees to any other employee benefit plan.\n       (E) Any other general or senior liability of the covered \n     financial company (which is not a liability described under \n     subparagraph (F), (G), or (H)).\n       (F) Any obligation subordinated to general creditors (which \n     is not an obligation described under subparagraph (G) or \n     (H)).\n       (G) Any wages, salaries, or commissions including vacation, \n     severance, and sick leave pay earned, owed to senior \n     executives and directors of the covered financial company.\n       (H) Any obligation to shareholders, members, general \n     partners, limited partners, or other persons, with interests \n     in the equity of the covered financial company arising as a \n     result of their status as shareholders, members, general \n     partners, limited partners, or other persons with interests \n     in the equity of the covered financial company.\n       (2) Post-receivership financing priority.--In the event \n     that the Corporation, as receiver for a covered financial \n     company, is unable to obtain unsecured credit for the covered \n     financial company from commercial sources, the Corporation as \n     receiver may obtain credit or incur debt on the part of the \n     covered financial company, which shall have priority over any \n     or all administrative expenses of the receiver under \n     paragraph (1)(A).\n       (3) Claims of the united states.--Unsecured claims of the \n     United States shall, at a minimum, have a higher priority \n     than liabilities of the covered financial company that count \n     as regulatory capital.\n       (4) Creditors similarly situated.--All claimants of a \n     covered financial company that are similarly situated under \n     paragraph (1) shall be treated in a similar manner, except \n     that the Corporation as receiver may take any action \n     (including making payments, subject to subsection \n     (o)(1)(E)(ii)) that does not comply with this subsection, \n     if--\n       (A) the Corporation determines that such action is \n     necessary--\n       (i) to maximize the value of the assets of the covered \n     financial company;\n       (ii) to initiate and continue operations essential to \n     implementation of the receivership or any bridge financial \n     company;\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\n       (iii) to maximize the present value return from the sale or \n     other disposition of the assets of the covered financial \n     company; or\n       (iv) to minimize the amount of any loss realized upon the \n     sale or other disposition of the assets of the covered \n     financial company; and\n       (B) all claimants that are similarly situated under \n     paragraph (1) receive not less than the amount provided in \n     paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (d).\n       (5) Secured claims unaffected.--This section shall not \n     affect secured claims or security entitlements in respect of \n     assets or property held by the covered financial company, \n     except to the extent that the security is insufficient to \n     satisfy the claim, and then only with regard to the \n     difference between the claim and the amount realized from the \n     security.\n       (6) Priority of expenses and unsecured claims in the \n     orderly liquidation of sipc member.--Where the Corporation is \n     appointed as receiver for a covered broker or dealer, \n     unsecured claims against such covered broker or dealer, or \n     the Corporation as receiver for such covered broker or dealer \n     under this section, that are proven to the satisfaction of \n     the receiver under section 205(e), shall have the priority \n     prescribed in paragraph (1), except that--\n       (A) SIPC shall be entitled to recover

to any such master \n     agreement, without regard to whether the master agreement \n     contains an agreement or transaction that is not a swap \n     agreement under this clause, except that the

or other official \n     decision by any court of competent jurisdiction, or other \n     public authority pursuant to which the Corporation has been \n     appointed receiver; and\n       (II) the term ``in danger of default'' means a covered \n     financial company with respect to which the Corporation or \n     appropriate State authority has determined that--\n\n       (aa) in the opinion

reasonable prospect that the covered \n     financial company will be able to pay such obligations \n     without Federal assistance; or\n       (bb) in the opinion of the Corporation or such authority--\n       (AA) the covered financial company has incurred or is \n     likely to incur losses that will deplete all or substantially \n     all of its capital; and\n       (BB) there is no

agreement, shall be treated as a \n     single agreement and a single qualified financial contact. If \n     a master agreement contains provisions relating to agreements \n     or transactions that are not themselves qualified financial \n     contracts, the master agreement shall be deemed to be a \n     qualified financial contract only with respect to those \n     transactions that are themselves qualified financial \n     contracts.\n       (ix) Transfer.--The term ``transfer'' means every mode, \n     direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or \n     involuntary, of disposing of or parting with property or with \n     an interest in property, including retention of title as a \n     security interest and foreclosure of the equity of redemption \n     of the covered financial company.\n       (x) Person.--The term ``person'' includes any governmental \n     entity in addition to any entity included in the definition \n     of such term in section 1, title 1, United States Code.\n       (E) Clarification.--No provision of law shall be construed \n     as limiting the right or power of the Corporation, or \n     authorizing any court or agency to limit or delay, in any \n     manner, the right or power of the Corporation to transfer any \n     qualified financial contract in accordance with paragraphs \n     (9) and (10) of this subsection or to disaffirm or repudiate \n     any such contract in accordance with subsection (c)(1).\n       (F) Walkaway clauses not effective.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding the provisions of \n     subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and sections 403 and 404 \n     of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act \n     of 1991, no walkaway clause shall be enforceable in a \n     qualified financial contract of a covered financial company \n     in default.\n       (ii) Limited suspension of certain obligations.--In the \n     case of a qualified financial contract referred to in clause \n     (i), any payment or delivery obligations otherwise due from a \n     party pursuant to the qualified financial contract shall be \n     suspended from the time at which the Corporation is appointed \n     as receiver until the earlier of--\n\n       (I) the time at which such party receives notice that such \n     contract has been transferred pursuant to paragraph (10)(A); \n     or\n       (II) 5:00 p.m. (eastern time) on the 3rd business day \n     following the date of the appointment of the Corporation as \n     receiver.\n\n       (iii) Walkaway clause defined.--For purposes of this \n     subparagraph, the term ``walkaway clause'' means any \n     provision in a qualified financial contract that suspends, \n     conditions, or extinguishes a payment obligation of a party, \n     in whole or in part, or does not create a payment obligation \n     of a party that would otherwise exist, solely because of the \n     status of such party as a nondefaulting party in connection \n     with the insolvency of a covered financial company that is a \n     party to the contract or the appointment of or the exercise \n     of rights or powers by the Corporation as receiver for such \n     covered financial company, and not as a result of the \n     exercise by a party of any right to offset, setoff, or net \n     obligations that exist under the contract, any other contract \n     between those parties, or applicable law.\n       (iv) Certain obligations to clearing organizations.--In the \n     event that the Corporation has been appointed as receiver for \n     a covered financial company which is a party to any qualified \n     financial contract cleared by or subject to the rules of a \n     clearing organization (as defined in subsection (c)(9)(D)), \n     the receiver shall use its best efforts to meet all margin, \n     collateral, and settlement obligations of the covered \n     financial company that arise under qualified financial \n     contracts (other than any margin, collateral, or settlement \n     obligation that is not enforceable against the receiver under \n     paragraph (8)(F)(i) or paragraph (10)(B)), as required by the \n     rules of the clearing organization when due, and such \n     obligations shall not be suspended pursuant to paragraph \n     (8)(F)(ii). Notwithstanding paragraph (8)(F)(ii) or (10)(B), \n     if the receiver fails to satisfy any such margin, collateral, \n     or settlement obligations under the rules of the clearing \n     organization, the clearing organization shall have the \n     immediate right to exercise, and shall not be stayed from \n     exercising, all of its rights and remedies under its rules \n     and applicable law with respect to any qualified financial \n     contract of the covered financial company, including, without \n     limitation, the right to liquidate all positions and \n     collateral of such covered financial company under the \n     company's qualified financial contracts, and suspend or cease \n     to act for such covered financial company, all in accordance \n     with the rules of the clearing organization.\n       (G) Recordkeeping.--\n       (i) Joint rulemaking.--The Federal primary financial \n     regulatory agencies shall jointly prescribe regulations \n     requiring that financial companies maintain such records with \n     respect to qualified financial contracts (including market \n     valuations) that the Federal primary financial regulatory \n     agencies determine to be necessary or appropriate in order to \n     assist the Corporation as receiver for a covered financial \n     company in being able to exercise its rights and fulfill its \n     obligations under this paragraph or paragraph (9) or (10).\n       (ii) Timeframe.--The Federal primary financial regulatory \n     agencies shall prescribe joint final or interim final \n     regulations not later than 24 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (iii) Back-up rulemaking authority.--If the Federal primary \n     financial regulatory agencies do not prescribe joint final or \n     interim final regulations within the time frame in clause \n     (ii), the Chairperson of the Council shall prescribe, in \n     consultation with the Corporation, the regulations required \n     by clause (i).\n       (iv) Categorization and tiering.--The joint regulations \n     prescribed under clause (i) shall, as\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\n     appropriate, differentiate among financial companies by \n     taking into consideration their size, risk, complexity, \n     leverage, frequency and dollar amount of qualified financial \n     contracts, interconnectedness to the financial system, and \n     any other factors deemed appropriate.\n       (9) Transfer of qualified financial contracts.--\n       (A) In general.--In making any transfer of assets or \n     liabilities of a covered financial company in default, which \n     includes any qualified financial contract, the Corporation as \n     receiver for such covered financial company shall either--\n       (i) transfer to one financial institution, other than a \n     financial institution for which a conservator, receiver, \n     trustee in bankruptcy, or other legal custodian has been \n     appointed or which is otherwise the subject of a bankruptcy \n     or insolvency proceeding--\n\n       (I) all qualified financial contracts between any person or \n     any affiliate of such person and the covered financial \n     company in default;\n       (II) all claims of such person or any affiliate of such \n     person against such covered financial company under any such \n     contract (other than any claim which, under the terms of any \n     such contract, is subordinated to the claims of general \n     unsecured creditors of such company);\n       (III) all claims of such covered financial company against \n     such person or any affiliate of such person under any such \n     contract;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Because of the systemic importance of credit ratings \n     and the reliance placed on credit ratings by individual and \n     institutional investors and financial regulators, the \n     activities and performances of credit rating agencies, \n     including nationally recognized statistical rating \n     organizations, are matters of national public interest, as \n     credit rating agencies are central to capital formation, \n     investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the \n     United States economy.\n       (2) Credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized \n     statistical rating organizations, play a critical \n     ``gatekeeper'' role in the debt market that is functionally \n     similar to that of securities analysts, who evaluate the \n     quality of securities in the equity market, and auditors, who \n     review the financial statements of firms. Such role justifies \n     a similar level of public oversight and accountability.\n       (3) Because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and \n     analytical services on behalf of clients, much as other \n     financial ``gatekeepers'' do, the activities of credit rating \n     agencies are fundamentally commercial in character and should \n     be subject to the same standards of liability and oversight \n     as apply to auditors, securities analysts, and investment \n     bankers.\n       (4) In certain activities, particularly in advising \n     arrangers of structured financial products on potential \n     ratings of such products, credit rating agencies face \n     conflicts of interest that need to be carefully monitored and \n     that therefore should be addressed explicitly in legislation \n     in order to give clearer authority to the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission.\n       (5) In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on \n     structured financial products have proven to be inaccurate. \n     This inaccuracy contributed significantly to the \n     mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and \n     investors, which in turn adversely impacted the health of the \n     economy in the United States and around the world. Such \n     inaccuracy necessitates increased accountability on the part \n     of credit rating agencies.\n\n     SEC. 932.

Such order may, by \n     provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the \n     covered person or service provider to cease and desist from \n     the subject activity, and to take affirmative action to \n     correct the conditions resulting from any such violation.\n       (2) Effectiveness of order.--A cease-and-desist order shall \n     become effective at the expiration of 30 days after the date \n     of service of an order under paragraph (1) upon the covered \n     person or service provider concerned (except in the case of a \n     cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall \n     become effective at the time specified therein), and shall \n     remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except \n     to such extent as the order is stayed, modified, terminated, \n     or set aside by action of the Bureau or a reviewing court.\n       (3) Decision and appeal.--Any hearing provided for in this \n     subsection shall be held in the Federal judicial district or \n     in the territory in which the residence or principal office \n     or place of business of the person is located unless the \n     person consents to another place, and shall be conducted in \n     accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5 of the \n     United States Code. After such hearing, and within 90 days \n     after the Bureau has notified the parties that the case has \n     been submitted to the Bureau for final decision, the Bureau \n     shall render its decision (which shall include findings of \n     fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue \n     and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or \n     orders consistent with the provisions of this section. \n     Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as \n     provided in this subsection.

Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have \n     jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall \n     except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (3) be \n     exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in \n     whole or in part, the order of the Bureau. Review of such \n     proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5 \n     of the United States Code.

Such order may \n     include any requirement authorized under this subtitle. Such \n     order shall become effective upon service upon the person \n     and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in \n     proceedings authorized by paragraph (2), shall remain \n     effective and enforceable pending the completion of the \n     administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until \n     such time as the Bureau shall dismiss the charges specified \n     in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued \n     against the person, until the effective date of such order.\n       (2) Appeal.--Not later than 10 days after the covered \n     person or service provider concerned has been served with a \n     temporary cease-and-desist order, the person may apply to the \n     United States district court for the judicial district in \n     which the residence or principal office or place of business \n     of the person is located, or the United States District Court \n     for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting \n     aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or \n     effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the \n     administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges \n     served upon the person under subsection (b), and such court \n     shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.\n       (3) Incomplete or inaccurate records.--\n       (A) Temporary order.--If a notice of charges served under \n     subsection (b) specifies, on the basis of particular facts \n     and circumstances, that the books and records of a covered \n     person or service provider are so incomplete or inaccurate \n     that the Bureau is unable to determine the financial \n     condition of that person or the details or purpose of any \n     transaction or transactions that may have a material effect \n     on the financial condition of that person, the Bureau may \n     issue a temporary order requiring--\n       (i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave \n     rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or \n     inaccurate state of the books or records; or\n       (ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to \n     a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the \n     proceedings under subsection (b)(1).\n       (B) Effective period.--Any temporary order issued under \n     subparagraph (A)--\n       (i) shall become effective upon service; and\n       (ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in \n     proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and \n     enforceable until the earlier of--\n\n       (I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under \n     subsection (b) in connection with the notice of charges; or\n       (II) the date the Bureau determines, by examination or \n     otherwise, that the books and records of the covered person \n     or service provider are accurate and reflect the financial \n     condition thereof.\n\n       (d) Special Rules for Enforcement of Orders.--\n       (1) In general.--The Bureau may in its discretion apply to \n     the United States district court within the jurisdiction of \n     which the principal office or place of business of the person \n     is located, for the enforcement of any effective and \n     outstanding notice or order issued under this section, and \n     such court shall have jurisdiction and power to order and \n     require compliance herewith.\n       (2) Exception.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by \n     injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any \n     notice or order or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or \n     set aside any such notice or order.\n       (e) Rules.--The Bureau shall prescribe rules establishing \n     such procedures as may be necessary to carry out this \n     section.\n\n     SEC. 1054.

Relief may not be ordered under \n     subparagraph (A) if the employer demonstrates by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the \n     same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that \n     behavior.\n       (4) Issuance of final orders; review procedures.--\n       (A) Timing.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     conclusion of any hearing under paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     of Labor shall issue a final order providing the relief \n     prescribed by this paragraph or denying the complaint. At any \n     time before issuance of a final order, a proceeding under \n     this subsection may be terminated on the basis of a \n     settlement agreement entered into by the Secretary of Labor, \n     the complainant, and the person alleged to have committed the \n     violation.\n       (B) Penalties.--\n       (i) Order of secretary of labor.--If, in response to a \n     complaint filed under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Labor \n     determines that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, \n     the Secretary of Labor shall order the person who committed \n     such violation--\n\n       (I) to take affirmative action to abate the violation;\n       (II) to reinstate the complainant to his or her former \n     position, together with compensation (including back pay) and \n     restore the terms, conditions, and privileges associated with \n     his or her employment; and\n       (III) to provide compensatory damages to the complainant.\n\n       (ii) Penalty.--If an order is issued under clause (i), the \n     Secretary of Labor, at the request of the complainant, shall \n     assess against the person against whom the order is issued, a \n     sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses \n     (including attorney fees and expert witness fees) reasonably \n     incurred, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, by the \n     complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing of the \n     complaint upon which the order was issued.\n       (C) Penalty for frivolous claims.--If the Secretary of \n     Labor finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) is frivolous \n     or has been brought in bad faith, the Secretary of Labor may \n     award to the prevailing employer a reasonable attorney fee, \n     not exceeding $1,000, to be paid by the complainant.\n       (D) De novo review.--\n       (i) Failure of the secretary to act.--If the Secretary of \n     Labor has not issued a final order within 210 days after the \n     date of filing of a complaint under this subsection, or \n     within 90 days after the date of receipt of a written \n     determination, the complainant may bring an action at law or \n     equity for de novo review in the appropriate district court \n     of the United States having jurisdiction, which shall have \n     jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount \n     in controversy, and which action shall, at the request of \n     either party to such action, be tried by the court with a \n     jury.\n       (ii) Procedures.--A proceeding under clause (i) shall be \n     governed by the same legal burdens of proof specified in \n     paragraph (3). The court shall have jurisdiction to grant all \n     relief necessary to make the employee whole, including \n     injunctive relief and compensatory damages, including--\n\n       (I) reinstatement with the same seniority status that the \n     employee would have had, but for the discharge or \n     discrimination;\n       (II) the amount of back pay, with interest; and\n       (III) compensation for any special damages sustained as a \n     result of the discharge or discrimination, including \n     litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable \n     attorney fees.\n\n       (E) Other appeals.--Unless the complainant brings an action \n     under subparagraph (D), any person adversely affected or \n     aggrieved by a final order issued under subparagraph (A) may \n     file a petition for review of the order in the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation with \n     respect to which the order\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\n     was issued, allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the \n     complainant resided on the date of such violation, not later \n     than 60 days after the date of the issuance of the final \n     order of the Secretary of Labor under subparagraph (A). \n     Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States \n     Code. The commencement of proceedings under this subparagraph \n     shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of \n     the order. An order of the Secretary of Labor with respect to \n     which review could have been obtained under this subparagraph \n     shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or \n     other civil proceeding.\n       (5) Failure to comply with order.--\n       (A) Actions by the secretary.--If any person has failed to \n     comply with a final order issued under paragraph (4), the \n     Secretary of Labor may file a civil action in the United \n     States district court for the district in which the violation \n     was found to have occurred, or in the United States district \n     court for the District of Columbia, to enforce such order. In \n     actions brought under this paragraph, the district courts \n     shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief \n     including injunctive relief and compensatory damages.\n       (B) Civil actions to compel compliance.--A person on whose \n     behalf an order was issued under paragraph (4) may commence a \n     civil action against the person to whom such order was issued \n     to require compliance with such order. The appropriate United \n     States district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard \n     to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the \n     parties, to enforce such order.\n       (C) Award of costs authorized.--The court, in issuing any \n     final order under this paragraph, may award costs of \n     litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness \n     fees) to any party, whenever the court determines such award \n     is appropriate.\n       (D) Mandamus proceedings.--Any nondiscretionary duty \n     imposed by this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus \n     proceeding brought under section 1361 of title 28, United \n     States Code.\n       (d) Unenforceability of Certain Agreements.--\n       (1) No waiver of rights and remedies.--Except as provided \n     under paragraph (3), and notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, the rights and remedies provided for in this section \n     may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or \n     condition of employment, including by any predispute \n     arbitration agreement.\n       (2) No predispute arbitration agreements.--Except as \n     provided under paragraph (3), and notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, no predispute arbitration agreement shall \n     be valid or enforceable to the extent that it requires \n     arbitration of a dispute arising under this section.\n       (3) Exception.--Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), an \n     arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement \n     shall be enforceable as to disputes arising under subsection \n     (a)(4), unless the Bureau determines, by rule, that such \n     provision is inconsistent with the purposes of this title.\n\n     SEC. 1058.
