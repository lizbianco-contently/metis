Mr. President, this has been a historic storm. I was in \nNevada. I left Friday morning, early, and had a beautiful weekend \nthere--highs in the low 60s. But getting back here was another story. \nIt was very, very difficult, and though I am here, a lot of Senators \nsimply have not been able to get here.\n  Staff is also under great duress to get here. The subway--the Metro, \nas we call it--which is so important to people who live and work here, \nis basically only an underground transit vehicle now. Anything above \nthe ground is not working. So if you live right in DC, you might be all \nright, but if you are either in Maryland or Virginia, you can't get \nhere if you have to depend on the subway.\n  As a result of that, we have had to change things. Even those who get \nhere have extreme difficulty in driving. The police and authorities are \nstill recommending that people not go on the roads. They are dangerous \nand difficult, and some, especially if you get off the main drag, are \nimpassable. As a result of that, Mr. President, we are going to have to \nchange things around here. And as you know, all the reports are that \nthere is a 90 percent chance we are going to have another big storm \ntomorrow.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the orders with respect to Calendar Nos. 468 and \n688 be modified to provide that the orders be delayed to occur at 2 \np.m., Tuesday, February 9, under the same conditions and limitations as \nprovided under the original order of February 4, 2010.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/08/senate-section/article/S507-9", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S507-S508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n               enrolled bill and joint resolution signed\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill and joint resolution, which had previously been \nsigned by the Speaker of the House:\n\n       H.R. 730.
