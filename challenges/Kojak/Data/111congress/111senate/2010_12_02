Madam President, I believe a number of colleagues are \nlined up to speak. They are not here, so I will take a moment and take \nit off the Democratic side and just speak for a very few minutes.\n  I know a number of my colleagues are wanting to talk a little bit \nabout the START treaty. I look forward to their doing so. I did want to \nbring colleagues up to speed on sort of where we are and hopefully give \nan accurate, up-to-the-moment assessment of sort of what the progress \nis.\n  I wish to express my gratitude to a group of Senators on the other \nside of the aisle--Senator Kyl, Senator McCain, Senator Lindsey Graham, \nSenator Isakson, and Senator Corker, particularly--all of whom have \nbeen working in good faith and consistently.\n  Senator Kyl and I are talking almost every single day. It has been a \nconstructive process. Obviously, there are points of disagreement here \nand there on substance. We are trying to work through those. I wish to \nsay that Senator Kyl has worked with us calmly and quietly and in good \nfaith in an effort to try to resolve some legitimate questions from \nMembers on his side of the aisle. He has been consistent and persistent \nin hammering home those differences and the needs that must be met as \nwe go through the process. Vice President Biden has been particularly \nengaged and particularly helpful in helping us to move the process \nforward, so the administration has a voice that\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\nis directly engaged in these discussions and is working very hard to \nmeet the concerns raised by Senator Kyl and others.\n  I am encouraged by the process in which we are engaged. Senators need \nto know it has not been a process of sidestepping a best effort to try \nto get to a place where we can take up the START treaty in the next \ndays. We still have some issues to try to complete.\n  Some Senators have expressed the desire to hear from the \nadministration with respect to the Lisbon conference and what modality \nwas arrived at there with respect to deployment. We will make that \nhappen. In addition, the President was sent an additional set of \nquestions just the other day. Those answers are being worked on, and \nthey will be forthcoming.\n  As long as everybody keeps working in this kind of positive and \nconstructive way, I am hopeful we can live up to our responsibility.\n  I call the attention of Senators to the Washington Post today, an \neditorial op-ed written by former Republican Secretaries of State Henry \nKissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, and Colin \nPowell. They clearly say: We urge the Senate to ratify the New START \ntreaty signed by President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. \nThey express their reasons why they believe it is important for us to \ndo so.\n  It is my hope that the conversations we are having and the process \nthat is in place is going to produce a positive outcome.

Madam President, in October a dear friend of mine--and \nof the Commonwealth of Kentucky--passed away peacefully. And today I \nwish to pay tribute to Mayor Bill Gorman, of Hazard, KY, for his warm \nand generous spirit and, above all, for his faithfulness to the mission \nof promoting, defending, and serving the people of Hazard.\n  Mayor Gorman was born about a decade after the railroad came, when \nHazard was first opening up to the world. He saw the floods and the \ncleanup, the coal carnivals, and the stores on Main Street come and go. \nHe saw Senators and Congressmen, and Presidential candidates. He saw it \nall. And he could have followed it all too, right out of Hazard. But he \ndidn't. Because Hazard was the only place he ever wanted to be.\n  The story goes that Bill was vacationing down in Florida in 1977, \nwhen somebody threw his name in the race for mayor. From that point on, \nbeing mayor was all Bill ever wanted. He never drew a paycheck. And he \nwas never off the clock--as anyone who used to get his late-night phone \ncalls can attest. He was always thinking of how to move Hazard forward, \nhow to make life better for the people of Hazard and the surrounding \nregion. Whether it was extending the water lines or building a pool \nwhere the kids in town could learn to swim, or expanding the hospital, \nor improving and expanding educational opportunities, he always had a \nvision and a plan to make it happen. And he usually did.\n  He attended every ribbon cutting, no matter how small. And he took \neverybody's calls--even at home--and there were a lot of them--because \nhis number was always listed in the phone book. He treated everyone \nwith dignity and respect, and he wanted to talk to everybody, whether \nyou were the President of the United States--and Bill knew a lot of \nthem or somebody down on their luck.\n  One of Bill's lunch buddies remembers being with him once when he got \na phone call from an elderly widow who lived in one of the public \nhousing units in town. Her health was deteriorating, she said, and she \nwondered if he could help her move from the fourth floor to the first \nfloor. Mayor Gorman got the building manager on the phone immediately \nand asked if anything was opening up on the first floor. There was. And \nthat woman got her wish. Moving floors was important to that lady, so \nit was important to Mayor Gorman.\n  Another time a group of city workmen dropped into a local restaurant \nfor a bite to eat after working around the clock after a snow storm. \nWhen the bill came, they were told it had already been paid. It was \nMayor Gorman, but they didn't know it. He made sure of it. He did that \nkind of thing all the time, never flaunting it, just lifting folks up--\nfrom high school kids going off to college to an elderly woman who \nneeded a hand--he was there.\n  For Mayor Gorman, no problem was too little or too big. He was as \nconcerned about the little things as he was determined to accomplish \nthe big things, and he was a master at both. He never boasted. He just \ndid good. It is a rare breed these days. But Bill Gorman was a rare \nman, a gentle soul who devoted himself to his mission in life and who \nenjoyed every minute of it. Not that he wasn't feisty. If you ever \nwanted to pick a fight with Mayor Gorman, say something about the \npeople of eastern Kentucky; he would take you on. And the people of \nPerry Country loved him for it.\n  He was proud of his people and his heritage. And he was proud of the \ncoal industry that built this region. As it happens, I got to know Bill \nbefore he was a mountain legend. Long before either of us had set out \non our political careers, and I was working as the youth chairman for \nMarlow Cook, who was running for the Senate that year. When they sent \nme out on the road, they told me to look up a guy named Bill Gorman \nwhen I got to Hazard. He was the guy, they said. And they were right. \nAnd when the two of us got together for the last time at his home this \npast August, 42 years later, he was still the guy.\n  Washington may not be a very popular place these days, but Hazard is \na pretty popular place in Washington. Walk into any office--whether it \nis a staffer or a U.S. President--and you are liable to see a Duke or \nDuchess of Hazard citation on the wall. I am told that even Pope John \nPaul II was named a Duke of Hazard, which is appropriate, since Bill \nused to say he was born a Baptist, was adopted by the Catholics, and \nwould die a Presbyterian. Like a lot of politicians, he was covering \nall his bases.\n  Mayor Gorman once said that government is only as good as the people \nwho run it. If that is true, it is likely Hazard will never be as good \nas it was when Mayor Gorman was with us. But I think we owe it to him \nto make it so--to live our lives with the same dedication and spirit of \nservice he did. I am blessed to have known him. He is dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8358-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8358-S8359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MISPLACED PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday we watched a number of \nDemocratic Senators come to the Senate floor and express their \nexasperation at not being able to do what they want to do around here. \nIt is quite astonishing.\n  Let's face it, most Americans are not particularly interested in the \nthings Democratic leaders have put at the top of their to-do list. They \nthought they put a restraining order on Democratic partisan priorities \nearly last month. It is time Democrats put the priorities of the voters \nfirst.\n  In a couple of weeks the lights go out around here unless we do \nsomething to stop it. At the end of the month every taxpayer suffers a \npay cut unless we stop it. But Democrats would rather spend the \nSenate's limited time on don't ask, don't tell and immigration. They \nwould rather come down to the floor to talk about filibuster rules.\n  So they still do not get it, and that is why Republicans are \ninsisting we put these things aside and finish the most important and \nurgent legislation before time runs out.\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\n  Fifteen million Americans are out of work. More than 3 million of \nthose jobs have been lost since the stimulus was passed. So with all \ndue respect for the Democrats' economic theories, the $1 trillion \nstimulus, endless government spending, and bailouts do not appear to \nhave worked.\n  We have tried their way. Now it is time to try what businesses and \nfamilies are asking us to do. Ask any business owner in America what we \ncould do to help them start hiring again, and they will tell you the \nbest thing we can do is give them certainty about their taxes.\n  The DREAM Act does not create jobs. Filibuster rules do not create \njobs. Wasting time on votes to raise taxes will not create jobs.\n  Right now, House Democrats are getting ready to send us a bill on \ntaxes they know will not pass in the Senate. This is a purely political \nexercise. Just consider what a number of Senate Democrats have said \nabout this issue. Here is what one of their newest Members said just a \nfew weeks ago:\n\n       I would extend them--\n\n  Referring to tax cuts--\n\n       for everyone.\n\n  Here is another one from September:\n\n       I don't think it makes sense to raise any federal taxes \n     during the uncertain economy we are struggling through.\n\n  The first comment was from Senator Coons. The second comment was from \nSenator Lieberman.\n  Another said:\n\n       I support extending all of the expiring tax cuts until . . \n     . the nation's economy is in better shape, and perhaps \n     longer, because raising taxes in a weak economy could impair \n     recovery. Continuing all of the tax cuts could provide \n     certainty for families and businesses. . . .\n\n  That was Senator Ben Nelson.\n\n       I don't think they ought to be drawing a distinction at \n     $250,000.\n\n  That was Senator Jim Webb.\n\n       The economy is very weak right now. Raising taxes will \n     lower consumer demand at a time when we want people putting \n     more money into the economy.\n\n  That was Senator Evan Bayh.\n  Raising taxes during an economic downturn, one said, ``would be \ncounterproductive.'' That was Senator Kent Conrad.\n  So what is the problem? It seems to me we have solid bipartisan \nagreement on the right thing to do for the economy and for job \ncreation. Who is holding it up, and what do they have against helping \nbusinesses and creating jobs?\n  It is time to focus. We have tried the tax-and-spend route. It has \nnot worked. Why don't we listen to the voters? Let's fund the \ngovernment while reducing spending and prevent a massive tax hike on \nevery American taxpayer.\n  Look, we have bipartisan support for this in the Senate and \nbipartisan opposition to raising taxes on anyone. As the President said \nearlier this week, after our meeting at the White House:\n\n       I think everybody understands that the American people want \n     us to focus on their jobs, not ours. They want us to come \n     together around strategies to accelerate the recovery and get \n     Americans back to work.\n\n  I agree with the President. Why don't we get this done?\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, a number of my colleagues and I are \ncoming to the floor today to discuss a critical national security issue \nthat Senator Kerry has already referenced in his remarks on the Senate \nfloor. It is an issue that requires strong bipartisan action by the \nSenate; that is, the ratification of the New START treaty.\n  As we enter into the last weeks of the 111th Congress, there is no \ndoubt we have some significant work remaining on a number of important \npriorities. But we have come to the Senate floor today to say that \nnational security and the threat posed by nuclear weapons also requires \nour urgent consideration this year.\n  After more than 20 Senate hearings, more than 31 witnesses, 900 \nquestions and answers, and nearly 8 months of thorough consideration--\nincluding additional time during the August recess for the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee to consider the treaty--it is now time to \nvote on New START.\n  The treaty is squarely in the national security interests of the \nUnited States. It reduces the number of nuclear weapons aimed at \nAmerican cities and allows for the return of critical onsite \ninspections lost when the previous START treaty expired. Ratifying the \ntreaty would reestablish American leadership on nuclear security and \ngive the United States increased leverage to curb nuclear proliferation \naround the globe.\n  This treaty in no way interferes with our ability to have a safe, \nsecure, and reliable nuclear arsenal. In fact, in response to Senate \nconcerns, the Obama administration has committed unprecedented amounts \nof money to ensure this modernization piece. Just yesterday, the three \ndirectors of America's nuclear labs wrote in a letter that they were \n``very pleased'' with the administration's commitment and believe this \ncommitment provides ``adequate support to sustain the safety, security, \nreliability and effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrent.''\n  Another concern that has been raised is the effect the New START \ntreaty may have on some of our closest NATO allies. As chair of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe, I am intensely focused \non meeting our NATO security commitments and defending and protecting \nour allies in NATO and beyond. I agree we need to remain vigilant in \nsupport of our allies, especially those in Central and Eastern Europe \nthat border Russia and have strong, legitimate security concerns. But a \nfailure to ratify this treaty could result in deteriorating U.S.-\nRussian bilateral relations and adversely affect the security of our \npartners in Europe.\n  I was pleased to see, just last week, at the NATO summit in Lisbon \nthat all 28 NATO allies expressed their unanimous support for Senate \nratification of the New START treaty. New START is in America's \ninterests, and as our allies in Europe have stated clearly, New START \nis also in their interests.\n  Finally, a failure to ratify this treaty could have serious negative \neffects on our ability to meet the nuclear challenge posed by Iran. The \nfailure to ratify the START treaty would undercut America's ability to \nmarshal international support and exert increasing pressure on Iran. As \nwe heard Senator Kerry reference earlier this morning, just today in \nthe Washington Post five former Secretaries of State of the past five \nRepublican administrations made a compelling case linking this treaty \nand the threats posed by Iran and North Korea.\n  The consensus is clear. New START is in our national security \ninterests, and we should not wait any longer to ratify this treaty. Our \nmilitary and our intelligence communities do not want us to wait. Our \nallies abroad and countless foreign policy experts, Republican and \nDemocrat, across the political spectrum do not want the Senate to wait. \nThe American people do not want us to wait.\n  We should follow in the footsteps of the Senate's strong bipartisan \narms control history and ratify the New START treaty this year.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Casey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I commend my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Shaheen.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues this morning in support of the New \nSTART accord. Next Sunday will mark 1 year since American inspectors \nwere on the ground in Russia. We need to vote on the resolution of \nratification for this important treaty because it will indeed make \nAmerica safer. Without ratification of this treaty, we are less safe \nand less secure. We have to maintain what we have always maintained in \nthis country as it relates to our arsenal: a safe, secure, and \neffective nuclear arsenal. This treaty is consistent with that goal.\n  The agreement provides for predictability, transparency, and \nstability in the U.S.-Russian nuclear relationship.\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\nFormer National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Linton \nBrooks put it best when he said:\n\n       Transparency leads to predictability; predictability leads \n     to stability.\n\n  It is that stability that we seek. The opportunity to examine Russian \nnuclear forces helps to limit the surprises, mistrust, or \nmiscalculation that could result from a lack of information. By \nbuilding trust with regard to our respective nuclear arsenals, progress \non other important issues such as the war in Afghanistan and our policy \nas it relates to Iran becomes more likely.\n  Some have asked whether we have lost any valuable elements of the \noriginal START treaty's inspection regime. In June of this year, I \nchaired a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee that addressed \nthis very issue. We examined the implementation of the treaty with \nrespect to both inspection and verification and how the treaty would be \nexecuted in Russia and the United States.\n  Critics point out that under the original START treaty, the United \nStates was permitted 25 data update, reentry vehicles, and facility \ninspections a year, while under New START the United States can inspect \n18 facilities annually not 25. However, in a previous hearing on the \nNew START treaty, Admiral Mullen noted that when START entered into \nforce there were 55 Russian facilities subject to inspection, but now \nthere are only 35 Russian facilities subject to inspection.\n  I would also assert that the inspection regime has also changed to \nreflect the current security environment, an enhanced relationship with \nthe Russian Federation, and more than a decade of experience in \nconducting START inspections. The inspection regime is simpler and \ncheaper than what was conducted under the first START treaty. We \nconduct fewer inspections under this treaty because there are fewer \nsites to inspect. Yet, proportionally, the number of inspections \nconcluded under this treaty has increased not decreased. During that \nsame hearing, Dr. James Miller, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of \nDefense for Policy said:\n\n       Inspections will help the United States verify that Russia \n     is reporting the status of its strategic forces accurately \n     and complying with the provisions of the New START Treaty. \n     Inspections will not be shots in the dark. Using information \n     provided by requiring data exchanges, notifications, past \n     inspections, and national technical means, we can choose to \n     inspect those facilities of greatest interest to us. Then, \n     through short-notice on-site inspections, our inspectors can \n     verify that what the Russians are reporting accurately \n     reflects reality.\n\n  So said the Under Secretary of Defense, Mr. Miller.\n  After more than 20 hearings by the Senate Committees on Foreign \nRelations, Armed Services, and Intelligence, and comprehensive \ndeliberation, it is time to vote on New START. We have examined all \nsides of the issue. We heard from Republican experts and Democratic \nexperts alike. We have heard from former Secretaries of State and \nexperts in international relations. The U.S. military leadership \nuniformly supports this treaty. More than 900 questions were submitted \nfrom the Senate to the administration on New START, and the \nadministration answered every single question.\n\n  I wish to close on a historical note. On October 1, 1992, the first \nSTART treaty was ratified by the Senate by a vote of 93 to 6. As the \ndebate on the treaty wrapped in this room, the Senate majority leader \nat the time, George Mitchell, commended President Bush for his role in \nnegotiating the agreement. He read a letter from Acting Secretary of \nState Lawrence Eagleburger which encouraged ratification.\n  This expression of bipartisanship at that time was made remarkable by \nthe fact that the Senators assembled would soon return home to campaign \nin the 1992 election. That election was 1 month away and Democrats and \nRepublicans came together and supported ratification.\n  We all remember the contentious nature of that election, similar to \nthe period we are living through now. Yet even within that environment, \nboth parties came together to do the right thing for national security. \nWe have to do this again. It is critically important that this treaty \nbe ratified.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, it is my privilege to rise to join with \nmy colleagues from New Hampshire and Pennsylvania and Colorado in \nsupport of the New START treaty, the New Strategic Arms Reduction \nTreaty.\n  I bring a bit of a personal perspective, a bit of affection for this \nissue, for this reason: When I was in graduate school, I was studying \nto take on issues of world economic development, issues of \ninternational poverty. I had worked in Latin America. I had worked in \nIndia. I traveled through Central America. I spent some time in west \nAfrica. I thought global poverty was a very important issue that could \nbe worth investing my career in.\n  But as I came out of graduate school, I had an opportunity to switch \ntracks and work on nuclear issues as a Presidential fellow for Caspar \nWeinberger in the Reagan administration. This was a complete change of \ndirection and one I didn't anticipate. But I went through that door and \nworked on strategic issues because the greatest threat to our planet \nwas the successful management of nuclear weapons, strategic nuclear \nweapons, an enormous threat that needed to be smartly managed. I felt \nthat engaging in that discussion, being part of that effort, was a very \nvaluable matter in which to put my energy.\n  So I spent 2 years at the Pentagon working on strategic nuclear \nissues and then worked for Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, \nas a strategic nuclear policy analyst during the 1980s. It gave me a \nbit of a closeup view and a view particularly of the Reagan \nadministration, working with Mikhail Gorbachev--Reagan and Gorbachev--\nworking on these issues. One related issue--though not a strategic \nissue, it certainly had strategic implications--was the theater nuclear \narms negotiations that resulted in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear \nForces Treaty. Back then it was called the zero option. It created \nintrusive inspection regimes to ensure that both nations were complying \nwith the treaty. That, of course, was the hallmark of Reagan's \nphilosophy that we ``trust but verify.''\n  More than the specifics of that treaty, I wish to note that it passed \n93 to 5. That treaty, similar to most strategic arms treaties, passed \nwith wide bipartisan support. When it comes to the safety of our \nNation, when it comes to minimizing the threat of nuclear devastation, \nwe have set aside red and blue, we have set aside Republican and \nDemocrat, and we have done what is right for our Nation.\n  Certainly, the threat involving nuclear weapons is as serious today \nas it was in 1987 when President Reagan signed the INF treaty or when \nit was ratified in 1998.\n  Now the Senate must decide whether to ratify the New START treaty. \nNew START limits both the United States and Russia to 1,550 deployed \nstrategic warheads, a significant reduction from the 2002 Moscow \nTreaty. It limits both parties to 700 deployed strategic delivery \nvehicles. These reductions continue to reduce both nations' oversized \nnuclear arsenals, a dangerous legacy of the Cold War, while allowing \nthe U.S. military to preserve a flexible strategic deterrent.\n  The new treaty improves our strategic relationship with Russia. The \nnew treaty reinforces the U.S. global leadership in nonproliferation.\n  Verification is a key element in New START, consistent with President \nReagan's philosophy of ``trust but verify.'' With the expiration of \nSTART a year ago, U.S. officials have been without their ability to \nconduct onsite inspections in Russia for the first time in a decade and \na half, and that increases the nuclear threat.\n  The new treaty allows both parties to verify compliance through data \nexchanges, through onsite inspections, and through reconnaissance \nsatellites. Both countries must maintain a database listing the types \nof locations of all accountable warheads and delivery vehicles. Each \ndelivery vehicle is assigned a unique identifier, which is used to \ntrack it from the moment of production through its various deployments \nand to its dismantlement. U.S. inspectors can verify using short \nnotice, onsite inspections.\n  This treaty is critical in safeguarding nuclear material and \npreventing proliferation of weapons and it is critical for our \nrelationship with Russia and our authority on nuclear issues.\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\n  Let me quote one expert:\n\n       The principal result of nonratification would be to throw \n     the whole nuclear negotiating situation into a state of \n     chaos.\n\n  That quote comes from GEN Brent Scowcroft, who was the first \nPresident Bush's National Security Adviser, or let's listen to this \nexpert:\n\n       A rejection of [this treaty] would indicate that a new \n     period of American policy had started that might rely largely \n     on the unilateral reliance of its nuclear weapons, and would \n     therefore create an element of uncertainty in the \n     calculations of adversaries and allies. And therefore, I \n     think it would have an unsettling impact on the international \n     environment.\n\n  That is Dr. Henry Kissinger.\n  Today there is an article in the Washington Post: ``Why New START \nDeserves GOP Support.'' This is written by Dr. Kissinger, George \nShultz, James Baker, III, Lawrence Eagleburger, and Colin Powell. These \nare Secretaries of State for the last five Republican Presidents \njoining together in a detailed analysis of the New START and why the \nSenate should ratify this treaty.\n  There are some who may say it is not an issue of the substance but, \nrather, we just need more time to consider the provisions. Consider \nthis: The treaty was signed on April 8 of this year. The treaty went \nthrough extensive and thorough hearings and briefings on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The committee favorably reported it out with \nbipartisan support on September 16. In the 34 weeks since the treaty \nwas signed and the 10 weeks since it was reported from the Committee on \nForeign Relations, every Member of our body has had an opportunity to \nread the testimony, to explore the content, to consult with the \nexperts, to consult with the administration, and to reach a conclusion. \nIn fact, we have had more opportunity to review this treaty than the \n100th Congress did for the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty \nunder Ronald Reagan.\n  Finally, I think it is useful to hear President Reagan's thoughts on \nnuclear weapons. In 1985, he said this:\n\n       There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the \n     cost of national security, and that is to reduce the need for \n     it. And this we are trying to do in negotiations with the \n     Soviet Union. We are not just discussing limits on a further \n     increase of nuclear weapons. We seek, instead, to reduce \n     their number. We seek total elimination one day of nuclear \n     weapons from the face of the Earth.\n\n  Well, this treaty does not eliminate nuclear weapons, but it does \nreduce them and it does, in the eyes of expert after expert after \nexpert--Democratic experts and Republican experts--make our Nation more \nsecure. So there can be no better reason to ratify it as soon as \npossible.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I rise to support timely ratification of \nthe new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, often called New START. New \nSTART accomplishes critical goals for our national security. It reduces \nRussia's deployed nuclear warhead stockpile by 30 percent. It reduces \nthe number of deployed and nondeployed launchers to 800. It limits the \nnumber of deployed missiles and bombers to 700--fewer than half the \nnumber of the original START treaty.\n  It also establishes a stronger system of onsite inspections, allowing \nus to physically count individual warheads. This is the safest way to \nensure that we have an accurate understanding of Russia's nuclear \nweapons force. Nevertheless, the Senate has failed to take action on \nwhat should be noncontroversial--a treaty with bipartisan support that \nwill make our country safer. Today, I wish to talk about the \nconsequences if we fail to ratify New START.\n  Right now, with no treaty in place, our country has virtually no \nability to monitor Russia's nuclear weapons. The previous START treaty \nexpired on December 5, 2009, almost a year ago today. Since that time, \nour inspectors have been shut out of Russia's facilities. We have been \nmaking national security decisions in the dark.\n  By contrast, the comprehensive verification system proposed under New \nSTART allows our military to make better, safer decisions about our \nnational security. Without these verification measures in place, we \nwill lose track of Russia's nuclear arsenal. We will spend more money \nto obtain less reliable information. Delaying ratification makes no \nsense for our national security or for this Nation's wallet. Failure to \nratify New START does not just undermined our short-term national \nsecurity interests, it weakens our long-term relationship with Russia \nand countries all around the world. In a post-9/11 world, strong \nrelationships and shared intelligence have never been more critical as \nwe defend against emerging threats.\n  We rely on Russia's support to help us contain one of the biggest \nthreats to our national security and to the world's security: Iran's \nprogress toward a nuclear weapon. In fact, earlier this year, the \nUnited States brokered an agreement with Russia and China that imposes \nnew U.N. sanctions against Iran to limit its weapons production. Our \nfailure to move forward on New START would make these efforts more \ndifficult.\n  The goal of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons requires a \nsolid United States-Russia relationship, and that relationship begins \nwith New START.\n  We have had ample time to study the treaty: 20 formal hearings, \ncountless briefings, 900 questions submitted for the record. All \nSenators have had time to express opinions and register concerns. The \nexperts, both Republicans and Democrats, tell us it is time to ratify \nthe treaty. In fact, LTG Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser for \nPresidents Ford and George H. W. Bush, has said:\n\n       The principal result of nonratification would be to throw \n     the whole nuclear negotiating situation into a state of \n     chaos.\n\n  He is not alone in this considered view.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to extend our \ntime until 10:20 and to then allow for 5 minutes for the Republicans at \nthe other side of their time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I will wrap up in the next couple of \nminutes.\n  He is not alone in this considered view. Listen to the bipartisan \nwisdom calling on the Senate to ratify this treaty: former Secretaries \nof State George Shultz, James Baker, Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell, \nMadeleine Albright, and Warren Christopher; former Defense Secretaries \nJames Schlesinger, William Cohen, William Perry, Frank Carlucci, and \nHarold Brown; former National Security Advisers Brent Scowcroft, \nStephen Hadley, and Sandy Berger. Patriots all, committed public \nservants who take it as an article of faith that partisanship ends at \nour water's edge, as do most Coloradans and most Americans. When it \ncomes to New START, I believe the Senate will as well.\n  President Reagan began negotiating the first START treaty with the \nSoviet Union in 1982--right in the middle of the Cold War. Even today, \nall these years later, we remember Reagan's brilliant phrase ``trust \nbut verify.'' Many believed the Cold War would never end. So much has \nchanged since the fall of the Soviet Union: the rise of global \nterrorism, the growing threat of Iran, the integration of our global \neconomy, and the realization that when one economy falls, all are in \ndanger.\n  As you know, I have just finished a long and tough campaign, and I \ncan tell you that Coloradans are patriots before they are partisans. \nThey are parents before they are Republicans and Democrats. And they \nare neighbors before they are foes. We need to respond, and the Senate \nshould ratify New START now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I join my colleagues who have taken the \nfloor this morning to urge a timely ratification of the START treaty. \nWe have now been 1 year without a comprehensive verification regime to \nunderstand Russia's strategic nuclear forces. Since the end of the Cold \nWar, we have had a verification system in place because we need to know \nwhat Russia is doing. We are at risk by not\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\nhaving a comprehensive verification regime in place. The ratification \nof New START will allow us to have that verification system in place, \nand it is in our national security interest.\n  We have had plenty of opportunity to understand exactly what is \ninvolved in the New START Treaty. For 7 months, the Senate has been \nconsidering the ratification. We have had over 20 hearings. I am \nhonored to serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We have had \nnumerous hearings and opportunities, both in closed sessions and open \nsessions, to understand exactly why this ratification is in the \nsecurity interest of the United States.\n  I point out that this is New START. We already had a Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty with Russia that expired at the end of last year. That \ntreaty was ratified by a prior vote of 93 to 6. So we have great \ninterest. We know what is involved, and we have had strong, bipartisan \nsupport for the ratification of START. The United States needs \ntransparency to know what Russia is doing and to provide confidence and \nstability. We need that confidence and stability to contribute to a \nsafer world.\n  The ratification of New START allows the United States to continue to \nbe in the leadership internationally, not only to deal with arms \nreduction but also with nonproliferation issues. That is particularly \nimportant today as we get international support to prevent Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear weapon state. Russia has helped us in that regard. \nThe ratification of this treaty is a continued movement toward \nisolating Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n  As other colleagues have pointed out, military leadership and \nbipartisan political leadership has supported this ratification.\n  I urge my colleagues to ratify New START. It is in our national \nsecurity interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8362-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8362-S8363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I was truly disappointed to learn that \nSenator Reid intends to bring up a new version of the sweeping amnesty \nproposal, known as the DREAM Act. Disguised as an educational \ninitiative, the DREAM Act will provide a powerful incentive for more \nillegal immigration by granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.\n  The bill, which is unaffordable for taxpayers in many different ways, \nis a bad idea and comes at the worst possible time. As of recently, \nthere are now plenty different versions of the DREAM Act on the \nlegislative calendar, with different moving parts and revisions, but at \nthe end of the day, it doesn't matter which one you focus on; they all \nhave the same core, which is amnesty for a significant number of \nillegal aliens.\n  Also with that amnesty would come very significant taxpayer-funded \nbenefits for these folks, including instate college tuition. In these \ndifficult economic times, it is an insult to legal, tax-paying citizens \nthat President Obama and his allies in the Senate want to use their \nhard-earned money to pay for educational benefits for illegal aliens.\n  The struggling economy has increased the demand for enrollment in \npublic universities, as a growing number of families are unable to \nafford other education. At a time when many Americans cannot afford to \nsend their own children to college, this bill would clearly allow the \ngovernment to provide Federal student loans to illegal aliens who will \ndisplace legal residents competing for taxpayer subsidies. I am opposed \nto this proposal because it would unfairly place American citizens in \ndirect competition with illegal aliens for scarce slots in classes at \nState colleges. The number of those coveted seats is absolutely fixed. \nSo every illegal alien who would be admitted as a result of the DREAM \nAct would take the place of an American citizen or someone who is \nlegally in our country. It makes no sense to authorize Federal and \nState subsidies for the education of illegal aliens when our State \nschools are suffering, as higher education budgets are being slashed, \nadmissions curtailed, tuitions increased.\n  Enactment of the DREAM Act would be bad policy under any \ncircumstances, but in the current economic climate, it would be a \ncatastrophe for States facing already strained budgets. The DREAM Act \nwill continue amnesty to millions of illegal aliens who entered the \nUnited States as minors and meet loosely defined ``educational \nrequirements.'' Specifically, the bill grants immediate legal status to \nillegal aliens who have merely enrolled in institutions of higher \neducation or received a high school degree or diploma.\n  The sponsors say several things to try to mitigate this basic fact, \nbut it doesn't.\n  First of all, they have described the beneficiaries in this \nlegislation as kids, boys and girls. In reality, the DREAM Act allows \nillegal aliens up to the age of 30 to be eligible to receive amnesty \nand qualify for Federal student loans.\n  Second, Harry Reid and the bill's proponents argue that this new \nversion of the DREAM Act has been narrowly tailored. I don't believe \nthe American public would be convinced that dropping the age of \neligibility from 35 to 30 transforms the core of this legislation or \nchanges anything at its core.\n  Third, the new and improved DREAM Act also requires that illegal \naliens seeking relief undergo a background check and submit biometric \nand biographic data. Again, that doesn't change the core of the bill, \nwhich is about amnesty for millions of illegal aliens, thereby putting \nthem in a position to compete for important taxpayer-funded benefits \nwith U.S. citizens.\n  Furthermore, the new version of the DREAM Act expands the waiver \nauthority of the Secretary of Homeland Security, thereby negating any \nadditional requirements for eligibility. The bar for eligibility is \nalready extremely low, but even what little is required can be waived \nwhenever that Secretary decides to do so.\n  The American people have made it very clear--crystal clear--that they \nwant to see the government fulfill its responsibility to enforce the \nlaws and to take steps to control illegal immigration, not to reward \nbad behavior with amnesty and taxpayer-funded benefits.\n  Amnesty and economic incentives only encourage more illegal \nimmigration. This is certainly not the answer to our current, ongoing \nimmigration crisis. It will only worsen our economic crisis. I am \nreally outraged that any elected lawmaker would consider this proposal, \nparticularly now, particularly when our States and fellow citizens are \nstruggling to deal with economic hardship and budget cuts.\n  The DREAM Act also includes no cap on the number of those who will be \neligible to receive this amnesty. The economic ramifications would be \nprofound and are simply unacceptable.\n  Finally, there is absolutely no pay-for in this legislation, while it \nis beyond argument that the act will increase costs on the Federal \ntaxpayer.\n  So, bottom line, this bill is absolutely increasing the Federal \ndeficit and the Federal debt--we don't know by exactly how much. To \nhelp answer that question, I am writing the Congressional Budget Office \ntoday and asking for an immediate score of the newest version of the \nDREAM Act. Whatever the number is--and it is important that we get that \nnumber--let me underscore that it is beyond debate that there is \nsignificant cost to this bill, without any pay-fors. That means the \nDREAM Act will also increase the Federal deficit and the Federal debt.\n  As chairman of the Border Security Caucus, I will be fighting this \nmeasure every step of the way, doing everything I can to stop what is \nclearly, at its core, an amnesty proposal. I invite all Members of the \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats, to listen to the American people who \nhave been speaking about this loud and clear and to heed their call and \nsay no to amnesty and turn to what should be our clear priority, which \nis enforcing the laws on the books, enforcing the clear laws against \nillegal immigration.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

I thank the Chair.\n  At the end of my remarks, I will propound a unanimous consent request \nthat the minority party is aware is coming.\n  I travel around my State pretty often, and when I do, I hear a lot in \nRhode Island about the sacrifices people have had to make during what \nare, for our State, still very difficult economic times. We are still \nover 11 percent unemployment. Many of my constituents have adjusted to \nthis difficult economic climate by cutting back on extras and finding \nsavings in their personal lives wherever they can. But for our \nseniors--Rhode Island has a very large population of seniors--who live \non a limited budget, simply cutting back is a very harsh option for \nthem.\n  In 2008, Rhode Island seniors on Social Security received an average \nmonthly payment of about $1,130. Madam Present, $1,130 a month is not a \nlot to live on, particularly in the Northeast. I have heard from \nseniors who worry about keeping the heat on in their homes because oil \nprices are so high. I have heard from seniors who have to split pills \nor skip doses because their prescription costs are so high. And I am \nhearing this from people who have worked hard all their lives, who paid \ninto the system throughout their careers and who believed they would be \nable to grow old comfortably. Instead, many of them are really just \nscraping by on their Social Security benefits, and the benefits often \nno longer cover their daily living expenses. So for people in this \nsituation, every penny counts.\n  This past year, for the first time since 1975, Social Security \nrecipients in Rhode Island, in New York, and elsewhere did not receive \na cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, and it appears they will not \nreceive a cost-of-living adjustment in 2011 either. These yearly \nadjustments are dictated by a specific formula that is tied to \ninflation. I know that because of the slow economy, inflation has been \nstagnant over the past 2 years. So the rigid mathematical formula that \ndrives the cost-of-living adjustment does not presently provide for the \ncost-of-living adjustment seniors need.\n  This is a misfire in the cost-of-living calculation because it is \nbased on a market basket that includes things seniors don't buy a lot \nof and it doesn't put adequate weight on heat and oil and energy, \nprescriptions and medical devices, and things on which seniors do spend \na lot of money. It also overlooks people such as Chuck, who is a 67-\nyear-old retiree from North Providence, RI, who wrote to me recently to \nexpress his concern that his monthly Social Security income will be \nfrozen at its current level for yet another year. He wrote that \nregardless of what the COLA formula concludes, his cost of living \ncontinues to rise. Chuck says:\n\n       Prices have risen at the supermarkets. Medications have \n     also increased in copayments. Today, I am paying more and \n     getting less for the dollar.\n\n  I believe Chuck speaks for many American seniors when he expresses \nconcern about the lack of an increase in Social Security payments. So \ntoday I rise in support of the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, \nintroduced by my colleague, Senator Sanders of Vermont. This bill would \nhelp ease the strain on the budgets of our seniors by providing a \nspecial one-time payment in 2011 of $250 to all Social Security \nrecipients. In effect, it would be a COLA replacement. Although a $250 \nCOLA replacement may not sound like much money, for those on a limited \nbudget, the extra financial assistance provides a little extra peace of \nmind amid skyrocketing health care and prescription drug costs. And for \nseniors in New England, the payment could help keep the heat on through \nthe approaching winter.\n  This assistance would not be unprecedented. While this was the first \nyear in decades that seniors did not receive a COLA, we have taken \nsteps in recent years to provide special help to seniors and to \ndisabled Americans struggling through this recession. In 2008, I worked \nvery hard with my colleagues to secure a $300 rebate for seniors and \nSSDI recipients in that year's economic stimulus act. In 2009, we again \nworked to make sure the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included \na one-time $250 payment to seniors and SSDI recipients. We now have a \nchance to once again lend that helping hand to our seniors.\n  Passing this bill would be the right thing to do for seniors, \nobviously, but it is also a good thing to do for our struggling \neconomy. In Rhode Island, for example, the payments would inject more \nthan $51 million into our economy--money that would quickly be spent on \nessential items such as food and medicine.\n  As I said at the beginning, Rhode Island is hurting. Unemployment \nstands at 11.4 percent, gas is now more than $3 per gallon, and our \nseniors face yet another year of frozen Social Security payments. By \npassing this Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, we can show our \nseniors that they are not forgotten and in turn provide a valuable \nboost to the local grocery stores, pharmacies, and shopping centers \nthat remain such an integral part of our local economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing by our Nation's seniors \nand to support the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be \ndischarged of S. 3976, which is the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief \nAct of 2010 that I have been discussing; that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; that there be 4 hours of debate with respect \nto the bill divided and controlled by Senator Sanders and the \nRepublican leader or his designee, and that no amendments or motions be \nin order during the pendency of this agreement; that upon use or \nyielding back of time the bill be read a third time, and the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, would \nthe Senator agree to include an amendment that would offset the cost of \nthe bill with unspent Federal funds, the text of which I have at the \ndesk?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am happy to discuss with colleagues on the other \nside how this can be paid for, but I cannot help but note that \ncolleagues on the other side do not share their concern for the payment \nand pay-go side of the equation when it comes to the tax cuts for \npeople making many millions of dollars a year whom we are trying to get \nexempted as we try to get tax relief for the middle class.\n  It would be hard for me to hold seniors getting a $250 one-time \nbenefit in a year in which the COLA formula has misfired and they are \ngetting no COLA benefit despite their other costs going up, and at the \nsame time be asked to agree to hundreds of thousands of dollars per \nmillionaire, in some cases, in tax relief that is not paid for. I \nthink, if anything, the seniors should be held to a lower standard than \nmultimillionaires for whom the tax benefit would amount to potentially \nhundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  I appreciate my colleague's very legitimate concern about the cost \nthis would incur. I submit we are still, at least in my State, in a \nstage in the recovery where we continue to need to revive the economy. \nThis will be very beneficial to the country in terms of its economic \nrecovery, and it would be unfair to hold seniors to a different \nstandard for this $250 COLA, a harsher standard than we would hold our \nmillionaires to, for hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax relief. So \nI stand by the request as propounded in the unanimous consent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I note \non the front page of USA Today ``Jobless Data could Break '80s \nRecord.''\n\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\n\n       Not since the early 1980s has the nation's unemployment \n     rate been so grim for so long, a government report due Friday \n     is likely to show.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The chronic level of high unemployment shows that many \n     Americans are still suffering, even though [the government], \n     the National Bureau of Economic Research, has said the \n     recession officially ended in June 2009.\n\n  The people in this country know what is happening in their own \ncommunities and their own States and do not need to be told different \nthings by the government when they know the reality in which they are \nliving.\n  I heard from my distinguished colleague some concerns we all share \nabout the economy and what best way to stimulate economic growth. I \nbelieve, with Members on my side of the aisle, that one of the things \nyou do is you don't raise taxes on anyone in this country during these \neconomic times. We are unanimous on this side of the aisle in that \nposition.\n  But listening to my colleague, there are now actually a growing \nchorus of Members from his side of the aisle who are agreeing with me, \nincluding the two newest Members of the Senate from the other side of \nthe aisle who have come here, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia and the one from Delaware. The one from West Virginia, while \nrunning for the Senate, said, ``I wouldn't raise any taxes,'' referring \nto the tax cuts that are scheduled to expire come the end of this year. \nThe Senator-elect and newly sworn in Senator from Delaware, in terms of \ntax cuts, said, ``I would extend them for everyone.''\n  So there is a growing chorus on the ways to give this economy and the \njob-creating segment of this economy some certainty so they can then \nmake the investments, make the decisions, hire the people to try to do \nthat.\n  We are unanimous in our support for not raising taxes on anyone \nduring economic times like this and, with that growing chorus, then, as \na result, I object.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I appreciate the objections of the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would respond by saying that even if we assume that \nthe right answer at this point is to continue a massive tax cut for \npeople who make--I think it was most recently reported that the 400 \nbiggest income earners in the country earned an average, each, of $344 \nmillion, a third of $1 billion each. So the tax cuts for people like \nthat create a very significant cost to the country.\n  I understand it is the theory of the Senator that this is to our \neconomic benefit. But, clearly, there is a very high cost in our \ndeficit to going down that path.\n  My motivation in offering this unanimous consent is that our seniors, \nwho will spend the $250 one-time payment virtually immediately--which \nevery economist I have ever seen who discusses the economic stimulus \neffect of these different types of expenditure agrees would be far more \nbeneficial if it were the $250 payment on behalf of seniors than it \nwould be when these highest end people get these massive tax refunds \nand benefits--that it would be fair to treat seniors the same way.\n  I regret that we face this objection. I think the objection is \ninconsistent in the sense that the Senator is holding, with this \nobjection, seniors to a higher standard, a harsher standard, than he is \nholding millionaires and billionaires to. Everybody knows about the \nmarginal utility of money. For a senior on a fixed income, $250 extra \nat the end of the year, Christmas time, whether it means keeping the \nhouse warm, affording their prescription drug payments, being able to \nset a little money aside for presents for their grandchildren--that is \nvery important funding, and not just from a humanitarian point of view. \nFrom an economic point of view it means it gets plowed right back into \nthe local economy--the local toy store, the local grocery store, the \nlocal pharmacy. It gets put right back to work. I don't know what \nhappens when somebody making $334 million a year gets a $1 million tax \nbreak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed his time.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In that case, I yield the floor and thank the \nPresiding Officer for her courtesy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, in response to my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, despite over a $13 trillion existing debt that we cannot pay \nback, the Democrats are back with another proposal to add another $13 \nbillion to the deficit, add it to the growing deficit. This one is not \neven a new proposal, it is a proposal that was already rejected by 50 \nSenators, including 11 Members from across the aisle a number of months \nago.\n  If we are going to attempt to help those seniors, as has been \nmentioned by my colleague, we need to do it in a fiscally responsible \nway.\n  I absolutely support helping the seniors who are having a hard time. \nI just propose we pay for it. That is why I offered the amendment to \nthe proposal from the Senator from Rhode Island that would, in fact, \njust pay for it. It is as simple as that. I propose that instead of \npiling money, debt on top of our massive debt, what I have offered is \nan amendment that would authorize the Office of Management and Budget \nto cut an appropriate amount from other programs to help them find \nmoney to pay for this one.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes, Madam President.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. A question, through the Chair: Would the Senator \nexplain why it is that when it comes to the deficit it is more \nimportant to protect our national debt than it is to help our seniors, \nbut it is less important to help our deficit and our debt than it is to \ngive tax breaks to multi-multimillionaires?\n  As I said, the 400 highest income earners the IRS has reported \nearning more than a third of $1 billion each on average, it would \nstrike me that the deficit and the debt is a matter of national concern \nthat should apply equally to millionaires--I mean multi-super-ultra-\nhyper-millionaires--than it is to seniors struggling to get by on \nSocial Security. I don't understand why the deficit matters so much \nwhen it comes to depriving our seniors of a COLA adjustment, but it \ndoesn't appear to matter at all when it comes to providing the very \nwealthiest Americans--people who have their own jets, have their own \nyachts, people who have, you know, seven homes--additional tax relief \nthat most billionaires who have come forward in this matter say they \ndon't want or need; that it is unpatriotic, frankly, from their \nperspective not to be asked to contribute more.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, the way that I propose to pay for this \nto help those seniors, to help those who have those needs, is a \nproposal that is very familiar to this body. It is because 21 of my \nDemocratic colleagues voted in favor of this way to pay for something \nearlier this week when the same pay-for was attached to an amendment \nfrom my colleague, Senator Johanns from Nebraska, that would have \nrepealed an unfortunate paperwork mandate in the health care law.\n  I would be happy to list all of the Senators who voted for this. I am \nsorry my friend across the aisle is not joining me in supporting this \nfiscally responsible support for our seniors. But, as I say, on the \nissue of stimulating the economy and giving some certainty in this \nNation to those job creators, the Republicans are united: 42 of us say \nyou should not raise taxes on anyone during economic times like these, \nand the chorus of Democrats who support that continues to grow. It grew \nthis past week from five members of the Democratic conference to seven \nwith the swearing in of Senator Coons of Delaware and Senator Manchin \nof West Virginia.\n  Senator Kent Conrad from North Dakota has said:\n\n       The general rule of thumb is that you do not raise taxes or \n     cut spending during an economic downturn. That would be \n     counterproductive.\n\n  So he says do not raise taxes during an economic downturn.\n  Senator Evan Bayh said:\n\n       The economy is very weak right now. Raising taxes will \n     lower consumer demand at a time when we want people putting \n     more money into the economy.\n\n  Senator Jim Webb, Democrat from Virginia, said: ``I don't think they \nought to be drawing a distinction . . . '' at a certain dollar number.\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\n  Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska said:\n\n       I support extending all of the expiring tax cuts until \n     Nebraska's and the nation's economy is in better shape, and \n     perhaps longer, because raising taxes in a weak economy could \n     impair recovery.\n\n  Senator Joe Lieberman, Connecticut, said:\n\n       I don't think it makes sense to raise any Federal taxes \n     during the uncertain economy we are struggling through.\n\n  Then, of course, Senator Coons: ``I would extend them to tax cuts for \neveryone.''\n  And Senator Manchin, then-Governor of West Virginia, said, ``I \nwouldn't raise any taxes.''\n  At a time with 9.6 percent unemployment, at a time when our Nation \ncontinues to struggle economically, at a time people are looking for \nwork, wanting to work, looking for jobs, the job-creating sector of \nthis country needs some certainty. With the mandates of the health care \nlaw, which are expensive, environmental mandates coming from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency with their rules and regulations \nimpacting on the cost of energy, and then the uncertainty, the \nsignificant uncertainty that exists in this country as to what tax \nrates will be and how that is going to impact all taxpayers with their \ntake-home pay come January 1, it is no surprise that people are \nconcerned and reluctant to make long-term commitments and investments \nin businesses and in the future.\n  That is why I stand here to object to my colleague from Rhode Island \nwhen he makes a proposal, which there is support for, but it is unpaid \nfor. We need to pay for it. I bring to the Senate floor a responsible \nway in which to pay for it, and which he has rejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, are we in a period of morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are still in morning business. \nHowever, the time remaining, 10 minutes remaining, is controlled by the \nminority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In that case I would yield to the minority to use the 10 \nminutes, and I will be seeking recognition following them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8365-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8365-S8366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ETHANOL TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it seems as though every few weeks or \nso there are a lot of misleading and misinformed accusations launched \nat our Nation's renewable fuel producers. It is impossible to come to \nthe Senate floor to respond to all of them. But sometimes the claims \nare so outrageous that they require an informed response. So I am here \nto give that response with emphasis on the word ``informed.''\n  Earlier this week, a number of my colleagues in the Senate, including \na few of my fellow Republicans, sent a letter to the majority and \nminority leaders expressing their opposition to extending the tax \nincentives for homegrown ethanol. Homegrown means we are less dependent \nupon people such as Dictator Chavez and our oil sheiks.\n  My colleagues argued that the tax incentive for the production of \nclean, homegrown ethanol is fiscally irresponsible. They expressed \ntheir support for allowing the 45-cent-per-gallon credit for ethanol \nuse to expire. It is important to remember that the incentive exists to \nhelp the producers of ethanol compete with the big oil industry. \nRemember, the big oil industry has been well supported by the Federal \nTreasury for more than a whole century.\n  Many of the Republican Senators who signed onto that letter have also \nbeen leading the effort to ensure that no American sees their taxes go \nup on January 1, 2011, which will happen automatically if we do not do \nsomething this very month.\n  The largest tax increase in the history of the country can happen \nwithout even a vote of Congress because of the sunsetting law. Of \ncourse, in that regard, I support the position of my Republican \ncolleagues. But a repeal of the ethanol tax incentive is a tax increase \nthat will surely be passed on to the American consumer.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues of a debate that we had earlier \nthis year on an amendment offered by Senator Sanders. The amendment he \noffered would have, among other things, repealed the $35 billion in tax \nsubsidies enjoyed by oil and gas. Opponents of the Sanders amendment \nargued that repealing the oil and gas subsidies would reduce domestic \nenergy production and drive up our dependance on foreign oil.\n  Opponents of the Sanders amendment argued that it would cost U.S. \njobs and increase prices at the pump for consumers. I agreed with the \narguments of the opponents. All of my Republican colleagues and more \nthan one-third of the Democrats did as well. Thus, the Sanders \namendment was defeated. That majority against the Sanders amendment \nknew that if we tax something we get less of it. Repealing incentives \non ethanol would have the very same result.\n  Well, guess what. I know removing incentives for oil and gas will \nhave the same impact as removing incentives for ethanol. We will get \nless domestically produced ethanol and be more dependent upon those oil \nsheiks. But it will also cost U.S. jobs. It will increase our \ndependence on foreign oil. It will increase prices at the pump for \nAmerican consumers. So whether it is jobs or increased dependence or \nincreasing the price of gas, no American would like that to be the \nresult. We are already dependent on foreign sources for more than 60 \npercent of our oil needs. We spend $730 million a day on imported oil.\n  That money is leaving America to the Middle East or nutty dictators \nlike Chavez. Why do my colleagues want to increase our foreign energy \ndependence when we can produce that energy right here at home?\n  So I would like to ask my colleagues who voted against repealing the \noil and gas subsidies but are supporting repealing incentives for \nrenewable fuels, how do you reconcile such inconsistencies? The fact \nis, it is intellectually inconsistent to say increasing taxes on \nethanol is justified, but it is irresponsible to do so on oil and gas \nproduction.\n  If tax incentives lead to more domestic energy production and result \nin good-paying jobs, why are only incentives for oil and gas important \nbut not for domestically produced renewable fuels? It is even more \nridiculous to claim that the 30-year-old ethanol industry is mature and \nthus no longer needs the support they get, while the century-old big \noil industry still receives $35 billion in taxpayer support.\n  Regardless, I do not believe we should be raising taxes on any type \nof energy production or on any individual, particularly during a \nrecession. Allowing the ethanol tax incentive to expire will raise \ntaxes on producers, blenders, and ultimately consumers of renewable \nfuel. A lapse in the ethanol tax incentive is a gas tax increase of \nover 5 cents a gallon at the pump. I do not see the logic in arguing \nfor a gas tax increase when we have so many Americans unemployed or \nunderemployed and struggling just to get by.\n  On Tuesday of this week all of my Republican colleagues and I signed \na letter to Majority Leader Reid stating that preventing a tax \nincrease, meaning mostly income-tax increases, and providing economic \ncertainty should be our top priority in the remaining days of this \nCongress. I know we all agree we cannot and should not allow job-\nkilling tax hikes during a recession.\n  Unfortunately, those Members who have called for ending the ethanol \nincentive have directly contradicted this pledge because a lapse in the \ncredit will raise taxes costing over 100,000 U.S. jobs at a time of \nnear 10 percent unemployment. The taxpayer watchdog group, Americans \nfor Tax Reform, considers the lapse of an existing tax credit for \nethanol to be a tax hike.\n  Now is not the time to impose a gas tax hike on the American people. \nNow is not the time to send pink slips to more than 100,000 ethanol-\nrelated jobs. A year ago at this time I came to the Senate floor to \nimplore the Democratic leadership to take action on extending expiring \ntax incentives for the biodiesel industry. They failed in their \nresponsibility to extend that incentive and provide support for an \nimportant renewable industry.\n  So while 23,000 American jobs were supported on December 31 last \nyear, nearly all of those jobs have disappeared. An industry with a \ncapacity to produce more than 2 billion gallons of renewable fuel a \nyear is on track to produce less than 20 percent of that capacity this \nyear.\n  Ethanol currently accounts for 10 percent of our transportation fuel. \nA\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\nstudy concluded that the ethanol industry contributed $8.4 billion to \nthe Federal Treasury in 2009, $3.4 billion more than the ethanol \nincentive. Today, the industry supports 400,000 U.S. jobs. That is why \nI support a homegrown, renewable fuels industry, as I know the Obama \nadministration does as well.\n  I would encourage anyone who is unclear on the administration's \nposition to contact Agriculture Secretary Vilsack.\n  I would like to conclude by asking my colleagues, if we allow the tax \nincentive to lapse, from where should we import an additional 10 \npercent of our oil? Should we rely on Middle East oil sheiks or Hugo \nChavez? I would prefer we support our renewable fuel producers based \nright here at home rather than send them a pink slip. I would prefer to \ndecrease our dependence on Hugo Chavez not increase it.\n  I certainly do not support raising the tax on gasoline during a \nrecession. I would respectfully ask my colleagues to reconsider their \nsupport for this job-killing gas tax increase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I support the comments from my colleague \nfrom Iowa on the importance of ethanol and the tax incentives and the \nability to try to make us less dependent on foreign oil and produce \nmore renewable energy in our country. So I appreciate the statement he \nhas just made.\n  I want to talk about the START treaty and the importance of it. But I \ncannot help but respond, at least a bit, to some of the discussion that \noccurred as I walked on the Senate floor about the so-called tax cuts \nor the extension of the tax cuts.\n  You know, what is going to confound a lot of people who look back on \nhistory, perhaps historians who, in a rearview mirror, look back 100 or \n50 years--what is going to confound them about this time, this place, \nand these people, all of us, is what we did that seemed so irrational \nbecause, particularly economic models, if you are talking about \neconomic historians, economic models are based on rational \nexpectations. Then they create a model based on what would you do \nrationally.\n  Now here is what they are going to see at this moment. They will see \na country that is at war halfway around the world. They will see a \ncountry with a $13 trillion national debt and a $1.3 trillion annual \ndeficit. And what is the debate? Tax cuts that existed in 2001, through \nlegislation I voted against, tax cuts that were extended and were set \nto expire this year would cost $4 trillion in the coming 10 years to \nextend.\n  With a $13 trillion debt, we have people coming to the floor of the \nSenate and saying they want to deal with this debt. Then, on the other \nside of the ledger, they say: And we want to extend all of the tax \ncuts.\n  That is another way of saying they want to take the $13 trillion \nFederal debt to a $17 trillion Federal debt. And, you know, historians \nare going to say: I thought there was some notion of rational \nexpectations. What is rational about a country up to its neck in debt \ndeciding: We are going to extend tax cuts even to the wealthiest \nAmericans; those who make $1 million a year shall be given a $104,000-\na-year tax cut?\n  Why? Because the minority is insisting upon it. Even though, just \nthat piece of it, above $250,000 a year in income, even though just \nthat one piece will add $1 trillion, that is the cost plus the interest \nto the Federal debt.\n  It is unbelievable. And the so-called little guy, the people out \nthere who are working for a living and struggling--some of them lost \ntheir jobs, some lost their homes, some have lost hope--they are \nasking: Well, what about me? Why is it there is such energy to stand up \nfor those who are making millions of dollars?\n  A guy named Barney Smith from Marion, Indiana stood up at the \nDemocratic National Convention in Denver in 2008 and he asked this \nquestion. Barney Smith had lost his job, a job, that he said, is now \nbeing performed by someone overseas. Barney Smith said: When are you \nall going to treat Barney Smith like you treat Smith Barney? That is a \npretty decent question. Who is on the floor standing for the interests \nof the Barney Smiths? I hope, perhaps in the coming days, there will be \nsome rational expectations coming from this deliberative body, and that \nrational expectation should not include cutting taxes for the \nwealthiest Americans at a time when America is at war.\n\n  This morning, perhaps at 6 a.m., our soldiers were called out of bed \nhalfway around the world, strapped on their ceramic body armor, took up \ntheir weapons, and went out on patrol. They will be shot at today \nhalfway around the world. We are told our responsibility is to provide \ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\n  I wish to read a comment from Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I don't see \na notion in this country about self-sacrifice in order to meet common \ngoals and reach the common purpose of our destiny.\n  Here is what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when we were at war then:\n\n       ``Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our \n     enemies in distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have \n     the privilege of working in a munitions factory or a ship \n     yard, or on the farms or in the oil fields or mines, \n     producing the weapons or raw materials that are needed by our \n     armed forces. But there is one front and one battle where \n     everyone in the United States--every man, woman and child--is \n     in action. . . . That front is right here at home, in our \n     daily lives, and in our daily tasks. Here at home everyone \n     will have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is \n     necessary, not only to supply our fighting men, but to keep \n     the economic structure of our country fortified and secure. . \n     . .''\n\n  That isn't only for soldiers who sacrifice for country. It is for all \nof us. It is distressing to me to see that the serious is treated so \nlightly and the light is treated too seriously in this Chamber. We know \nbetter. This country is loaded with debt. It is at war. We owe it to \nthe American people and to the future to do better and try to steer \nthis country toward better times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8366-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8366-S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              START TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the START treaty. \nThis issue, while on the front pages in the last few days, is not \nfront-page news generally, but it is so unbelievably important.\n  First, I compliment Senator Kerry, chairman of the committee. I \ncompliment Senator Lugar and others who have worked on this. I was part \nof the national security working group. We had many briefings during \nthe negotiations with the Russians. I chair the appropriations \nsubcommittee that funds our nuclear weapons, and I have stood next to \nnuclear weapons, know a lot about them, know about the horror of these \nweapons, as do almost all Americans. Let me describe how many nuclear \nwarheads we have in the world.\n  This data is the Union of Concerned Scientists' that made an estimate \nin 2010. They said Russia has about 15,000 nuclear weapons; the United \nStates about 9,400; China, 240; France, 300; Britain, 200. We can see \nIsrael at 80. These are the expected number of nuclear weapons on the \nplanet. That is somewhere around 25 to 28,000 nuclear weapons on this \nplanet, the loss of one of which or the explosion of one of which in a \nmajor city by a terrorist group will change life on this planet \nforever.\n  The question is, What are we doing now to stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons, prevent terrorists and rogue nations from acquiring nuclear \nweapons, and then reducing the number of nuclear weapons? What are we \ndoing?\n  I have told the story of the CIA agent called Dragonfire who, 1 month \nto the day, October 11, 2001, reported to his superiors there was \nevidence that a Russian 10 kiloton nuclear weapon had been stolen and \nsmuggled into New York City by a terrorist group. That was exactly 1 \nmonth after 9/11 when Dragonfire provided that piece of information to \nthe intelligence community. For a month or 2 months, there was an \napoplectic seizure in the intelligence community, with the \nadministration trying to figure out how to deal with this. No one from \nNew York was informed, not even the mayor. It was later discovered this \nwas not a credible piece of intelligence, and everyone breathed easier. \nBut as they did the postmortem, they understood, it would have been \npossible, perhaps, to have believed a terrorist group could have stolen \na low-yield Russian nuclear weapon. It would have been possible for \nthem to have stolen it and to have smuggled it into a major city, New \nYork or Washington, and it would have\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\nbeen possible for a terrorist group to have detonated it. That is one \nnuclear weapon. There are 25,000 on this planet.\n  This morning on the way to work I heard a description on the radio of \nthe nuclear weapons possessed by Pakistan. The question by some people \nwho know a lot about this is whether there is an impossibility of \nsomeone from al-Qaida or the Taliban infiltrating the structure by \nwhich there is security for the nuclear weapons in Pakistan. That is an \nopen question.\n  Earlier this year I was in Moscow, about an hour and a half outside \nMoscow, at a training facility we have helped fund in Russia to train \nfor the security of Russian nuclear weapons. It is in all our \ninterests--it is in the interest of the future of mankind--to \nunderstand the urgency to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to \nstop rogue nations and terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons and, \nfinally, at least to begin substantially reducing the number of nuclear \nweapons. That is what brings us to the issue of the START treaty.\n  I don't denigrate anyone or suggest that anyone who raises questions \nabout this is uninformed. That is not the case. All of us want what is \nbest for this country and for the world. We want to have arms reduction \ntreaties and weapons reductions in a way that is verifiable and will \nstrengthen the world's security. There have been a lot of questions \nasked. A lot of them have been answered. It is my hope that all of us \nwho have been interested in this--and that is both Republicans and \nDemocrats--will find ways to come together and pass this START treaty.\n  If I might, I will describe the unbelievable success we know occurs \nfrom this kind of activity. We don't have to test this. We know it \nworks. Through the Nunn-Lugar program, which has been around for some \nwhile, we actually fund the activities to destroy weapons that \npreviously were aimed at the United States. Albania is now chemical \nweapons free; the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus have no nuclear \nweapons any longer; 7,500 warheads have been deactivated; 32 ballistic \nmissile submarines; 1,400 long-range nuclear missiles; 155 bombers.\n  I know it is repetitive, but I wish to again say that I have in my \ndesk a piece of wing from a Soviet Backfire bomber. We didn't shoot \nthis down. I ask unanimous consent to show it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As a result of Nunn-Lugar, we sawed the wings off. How is \nit that I stand on the floor with a piece of a wing from a bomber that \nused to carry nuclear weapons threatening to destroy this country? I do \nthat because we know these work.\n  Ukraine is now nuclear free. This is a hinge from a silo that \ncontained a nuclear-tipped missile aimed at the United States. This \npiece, from a silo containing an intercontinental ballistic missile \naimed at America, is from a missile that no longer exists. The nuclear \nweapon is gone; the missile is gone. There are now sunflower seeds \nplanted where there was previously a missile. I tell that to say: We \nunderstand what works. Arms negotiations, arms treaties with which we \nhave tried to reduce delivery vehicles and nuclear weapons work.\n  I have just described the Nunn-Lugar program. Let me show a couple \nphotographs of it. This is a Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine \nthat carried nuclear weapons. I have the copper wiring from this \nsubmarine in my desk, reminding all of us, again, that this works. We \ndidn't have to destroy this submarine with a weapon under the sea in \nhostile action. We negotiated a treaty. It was taken apart.\n  This shows an SS-18 missile silo in Ukraine. We can see they planted \ndynamite and blew up the silo. Because we agreed with the Russians that \nwe were going to reduce nuclear weapons, reduce delivery vehicles, that \nsilo is now gone and sunflower seeds are planted where a missile \npreviously had been.\n  Here is a photograph of a Blackjack bomber that the old Soviet Union \nand Russia had. We destroyed it, sawed off the wings. We know these \nkinds of treaties work.\n  The treaty negotiated is supported by so many people. ADM Mike \nMullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says:\n\n       I, the Vice Chairman and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our \n     combatant commanders, stand solidly behind this new treaty. \n     This treaty represents our country's best interests, in my \n     judgment.\n\n  There are many things to say in support of concluding an arms control \nagreement with the Russians. There are many questions that have been \nraised about the treaty and have been answered. When I described \nearlier the large number of people who say it is in this country's \ninterest to support this treaty, I did not put up several of these, but \nlet me say, Dr. Kissinger, said:\n\n       I recommend ratification of the treaty. It should be noted \n     I come from the hawkish side of this debate so I'm not \n     advocating these measures in the abstract. I try to build \n     them into my perception of the national interest.\n\n  This morning George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Colin \nPowell, and Dr. Kissinger wrote an op-ed piece in the Post making the \ncase.\n  Those who have raised questions about this are as concerned about our \nnational security as anybody else. They believe, as I do, in the same \ngoals. Let's keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorist \norganizations and rogue nations. Let's stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons and, ultimately, let's try to reduce the number of weapons on \nthis planet. I think everybody here who is involved are people of good \nwill. My fervent hope is that in the coming couple weeks, as we \nconclude this session of the Congress, we will find a way to have on \nthe floor this treaty which is so widely supported and be able to say, \nall of us of every persuasion, we did something that will have a \nlasting impact on the future of this country, the security of this \ncountry, and the security of the world. We did something that reduces \nnuclear weapons, the number of nuclear weapons among the two nations \nthat have, by far, the most nuclear weapons. We did something that \nsubstantially reduces the number of delivery vehicles for nuclear \nweapons. This will provide for a much greater measure of security for \nus and the rest of the world.\n  Those who have spoken on this issue, giving different views, offering \ndifferent views, I have great respect for them. Many of them and I were \npart of the national security working group. Along the line when the \ntreaty was being negotiated, we had meetings in an area that is for \ntop-secret presentations. All along the way we understood what was \nhappening and how it was happening. I think this is a treaty that is \nmutually beneficial and represents not only the best interests of both \ncountries that are parties to the treaty but especially the best \ninterests of the world.\n  I started by saying the loss of one nuclear weapon exploded in one \ncity on the planet would change everything about our lives. We have \nabout 25,000 nuclear weapons on the planet. The security of those \nweapons, the ability to keep them out of the wrong hands, the ability \nto keep others from acquiring weapons, the ability to reduce weapons, \nall of that urgent and important. It doesn't always rise to the top in \nthe debate in the Senate, but now we have that discussion around this \ntreaty which is only a first step. I hope, by the end of this month, \nperhaps all of us could celebrate having a significant achievement for \nthe security of the country and for the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as America's energy needs continue to \ngrow, so does our need for commonsense approaches to meeting these \nneeds. Unfortunately, the Obama administration's announcement yesterday \ndealt a death blow to one of our most important ways to expand our \ndomestic energy supplies. My message to the Obama administration is \nthat we need to drill it, not kill it. Yesterday, the administration \nannounced the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast to be off-\nlimits to any new offshore drilling for the next 5 years. In\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\nother words, the Obama administration decided to deny Americans new \ndomestic energy supplies, deny Americans new jobs, and make America's \nenergy prices rise.\n\n  In the wake of the BP oilspill, there is no question we are reminded \nof the need to preserve our environment as we seek to expand our energy \ngrowth by drilling for more oil. As we continue opening up new sources \nof traditional energy in an environmentally friendly manner, preventing \nspills must be a top priority. However, arbitrarily--arbitrarily--\nclosing off our own domestic supplies is not the answer.\n  First, this deathblow to offshore drilling will only make us more \ndependent on OPEC and Middle Eastern countries and hostile regimes that \nmean us harm. Also, this moratorium will cost us jobs at a time when \nAmerica needs job creation more than ever.\n  The American Petroleum Institute estimates that we will not get \n75,000 jobs as a result of the Obama administration's offshore drilling \nmoratorium. Domestic production of energy will be integral for our \neconomic growth. Production of domestic energy sources not only helps \nus meet growing demand and keeps us secure, but if the Obama \nadministration removes their moratorium it will create jobs, and we \nneed jobs.\n  Strict and arbitrary environmental regulations in place on coal \nmining, hydraulic fracturing of natural gas, and of offshore oil \ndrilling just create a de facto moratorium on more production and on \nmore jobs. Limiting production will make the sources we have available \nonly more expensive. It is simply a matter of supply and demand.\n  As I have already mentioned, since energy demand will go up in the \nnear future, these regulations--by hampering production--will serve as \nan indirect energy tax on consumers. Guess what. Remember, the $4-a-\ngallon gasoline we had a couple years ago? Well, we may see that, and \neven more, as a result of shutting off our domestic supply.\n  We should not be jumping to constrain domestic energy production \nwithout first giving any new regulations a very strict look to make \nsure we do not punish consumers just trying to power their households, \nfuel their vehicles, get jobs, and live their lives. We all know we \nneed a new energy policy, one that enables us to find, create, and use \ndomestically produced clean energy.\n  This is not the first time we have sought to do this, but the \ndifference now is that we have a recession to contend with at the same \ntime. People are struggling with high unemployment. In the Midwest, our \nmanufacturing sector has lost thousands of jobs. In an economy with a \nstubborn, nearly 10-percent unemployment rate, the million-dollar \nquestion--or bigger than that--we all have these days is, How can we \ncreate jobs?\n  So as we approach changing our energy policy, while we all want to \nprotect the environment--and we must--we have to ensure that the \npolicies we choose will not have adverse consequences to economic \ngrowth. Unfortunately, too many of my colleagues, and some in the \nadministration, are focusing on jamming through Energy bills that would \nimpose job-killing tax increases on farmers, small businesses, and \nfamilies. Their ideas have ranged from a cap-and-trade tax bill to \nothers that pick winners by awarding massive taxpayer-funded incentives \nto some and, in the process, harming others.\n  I think there is a better way to move our Nation to energy \nindependence. The commonsense approach we have to take would make use \nof the clean, reliable sources we have here without picking sources and \ntechnology winners. We need to develop affordable, homegrown, and clean \nenergy solutions to help push our Nation toward an independent and more \nenvironmentally friendly future.\n  I am by no means an expert on this subject, but I have been around \nthe block a time or two, so I support many strategies to reduce our \ndependence on fossil fuels and cut pollution. I have to stress that, in \nfact, we will continue to rely on fossil fuels to meet a large portion \nof our energy demand. Coal accounts, for example, for 50 percent of our \nNation's electricity generation and over 80 percent of Missouri's \nelectricity. So we have to harness our abundant supply of coal in a \nclean way by helping to advance carbon capture and sequestration, or \nCCS.\n  City Utilities of Springfield, MO, and others are conducting a \nproject to assess the feasibility of carbon sequestration in smaller, \nshallower saline aquifers and individual powerplants. Much of the CCS \nresearch to date has focused on deep saline aquifers in large \ngeological basins often far removed from most powerplant sites.\n  When complete, however, this pilot demonstration being conducted in \nSpringfield may yield new lessons about CCS technologies that can be \napplied to powerplant sites in specific locations across the Nation.\n  Nuclear power, such as coal, is also an important source of base-load \npower, and it must also play a role in our energy future. Nuclear \nenergy generates more than seven times as much zero-carbon electricity \nas all renewable sources combined.\n  In 2007, for example, nuclear energy prevented the emission of 693 \nmillion metric tons of carbon dioxide--roughly the equivalent of taking \nall U.S. passenger cars off the road. Of course, generating nuclear \npower results in waste that must be stored or otherwise dealt with, and \nwe have spent billions of dollars on an improved site to store that \nwaste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Unfortunately, political opposition \nhas stalled, perhaps permanently, the operation of that site.\n  A real solution can be found in nuclear reprocessing, which reuses \nspent nuclear fuel and can produce the same amount of energy and leaves \nonly 5 percent of the waste. France does it. Why should not we?\n  We must have policies in place that spur the development of more \nzero-emission nuclear power so we can harness all of its promise. And \nwe must eliminate the layers and layers of bureaucracy and regulations \nwhich do not add to the safety of that power produced.\n  I agree we need to develop other zero-carbon sources, such as \nrenewable energy sources. Missouri power providers are currently \nexpanding their wind generation, and we have a number of wind turbines. \nAlso, a few families and businesses receive a portion of their power \nfrom wind farms in Kansas.\n  Every day we are making advances in solar power, but this and wind \npower currently require huge taxpayer subsidies just to set up the \noperations, and it is followed by a $20-per-megawatt taxpayer subsidy \nwhen and if they produce power.\n  Our State of Missouri, however, is blessed with hydropower sources \nwhich could be expanded by installing hydropower generation on existing \nMississippi River locks and dams. But it is unlikely these renewable \nsources can provide more than a fraction of the energy we use, even in \nMissouri.\n  So we must avoid national renewable energy standards that arbitrarily \nset requirements without ensuring that families and workers continue to \nreceive the affordable power they need. Intermittent wind and sunlight \nmean we must always ensure that a reliable base source of power remains \nin place to back them up.\n  Another way to make these sources more viable is through new battery \ntechnology that will help stabilize these sources' power flow. As a \nlongtime leader in the battery industry, Missouri is also leading the \nway in advanced lithium-ion batter development and energy storage.\n  For example, Dow-Kokam in Kansas City is using lithium-polymer \ntechnology to make batteries lighter, longer lasting, smaller, and \nquicker to charge. Not only would batteries make renewable sources more \nviable, they would help with peak shaving by storing large amounts of \nenergy produced at offpeak times.\n  When talking about batteries, of course, we cannot help but think \nabout the promise that electric cars have to transform our \ntransportation system and get us off our dependence of foreign oil.\n  I am a strong supporter of the increased use of hybrid and electric \nvehicle technology. Smith Electric Vehicles in Kansas City is building \ndelivery trucks, which are the world's largest electric vehicles with a \ntop speed of 50 miles an hour and a range in excess of 100 miles on a \nsingle overnight charge of the truck's battery at a time when there is \navailable electricity on the grid between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. not \notherwise being used.\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\n  But even with the promise of electric vehicles, American families, \ndrivers, and workers still will need a plentiful supply of \ntransportation fuels to power their cars. I do agree we eventually need \nto lessen our dependence on fossil fuels, and that is why I have been a \nlongtime supporter of using renewable biomass for fuel and for energy.\n  The biofuels industry has created good, often high-paying jobs which \nare critical to the Midwest where we have lost so many manufacturing \njobs to the recession. I have been a longtime supporter of keeping tax \nincentives in place for the ethanol and biodiesel industry. These tax \nincentives, plus increased support for infrastructure to deliver these \nfuels, will be imperative as the industry becomes more competitive with \ntraditional fuels. We must extend the volumetric excise tax credit, \nwhich we promised in the Congress to the farmers who set up the \ncooperatives to develop ethanol and biodiesel sources. In my opinion, \none of the most exciting things about this industry is that it drives \nthe development of low-carbon feedstocks.\n  So I will close by talking about the potential that my home State of \nMissouri has to be a leader in a large part of our clean energy future \nby providing some of this homegrown energy, or biomass.\n  We have made great progress in Missouri in the use of algae and \ncarbon dioxide from fuel. Missouri also has abundant farmlands and \nforests that can provide diverse biomass feedstocks to generate \nelectricity or produce renewable fuels. For example, a University of \nMissouri study found that Missouri's 2.5 million acres of corn and 5 \nmillion acres of soybeans produce a combined 13 million tons of dry \ncrop residue each year which can be converted into electric energy or, \nthrough cellulosic operation, into fuels.\n  Now, our forests alone can potentially provide 150 million tons of \nwood residues from scrub timber annually on a renewable basis. \nTogether, that is a lot of biomass feedstock that is homegrown and that \nis carbon neutral because it takes in energy as it grows, releases that \nenergy when it is burned, and takes it in again as replacements are \ngrown. If we do not harness it, that energy is released when the wood \nor the biomass degrades.\n  Missouri entrepreneurs are developing new technology to convert \nmunicipal solid waste into clean burning biochar, which can supplement \nour biomass producers. In addition, Missouri is home to some of the \nforemost researchers in clean-burning biomass at the University of \nMissouri-Columbia.\n  Last but not least, the State of Missouri Department of Agriculture \nis on the cutting edge in supporting burgeoning biomass technology.\n  By creating a thriving biomass industry, we would not only help \ncreate our clean energy future, we would also create much needed new \njobs in Missouri and Midwestern States by providing income to \nstruggling farmers and agroforesters.\n  We must promote these clean energy strategies in a market-friendly \nway, and taxing our suffering families' and workers' use of energy is \nnot the way. Produce more, do not tax more. Taxing it does not increase \nthe production of it. Promoting these clean energy strategies is a \nbipartisan win-win-win, and I hope all of my colleagues will join me in \nhelping this become a reality.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we had a hearing in the \nCommerce Committee yesterday about the future of NASA. We had the \nPresident's science officer, the head of the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy, Dr. Holdren; and the Chief Financial Officer of \nNASA, Dr. Robinson. We pointblank asked both of them if they intended \nto follow the new law, the NASA authorization bill, that sets out a \nvisionary course for the future of our manned and unmanned space \nprogram. They both indicated they would absolutely follow the direction \nof policy within the administration; they would follow the law.\n  Clearly, this has the President's stamp of approval. For once, we \npassed the bill unanimously in the Senate and by a three-quarters vote \nin the House of Representatives. The President then signed the bill \ninto law. It is the President's policy. It is a policy that balances a \nnumber of things.\n  We continue the International Space Station at least until the year \n2020, a space station, by the way, that is just now being completed \nafter over a decade of construction. It is designated as a national \nlaboratory, but a host of nations are all participants in the \nInternational Space Station, and cutting-edge research will be done \nutilizing the unique property of zero gravity of orbit as the space \nstation orbits the Earth at 17,500 miles an hour.\n  We will start to develop new rockets that, as we speak, are being \ndeveloped to carry cargo to and from the International Space Station. \nThose rockets will be in a competition between commercial companies, a \ncompetition conducted by NASA for making those rockets safe enough in \norder to take crew to and from the International Space Station and, at \nthe same time, realizing that NASA's real vision is to go out and \nexplore the heavens.\n  The NASA authorization bill starts the development of a heavy-lift \nrocket that will be able to take components up into low Earth orbit, \nwhere they can be assembled, and then ultimately to fulfill the \nPresident's goal he has set, which is to go to Mars.\n  The path by which we go to Mars is yet to be determined. A lot of \nthat will depend upon the development of technology. There is within \nthis NASA bill a robust technology development program for such \nmissions as going to Mars or to an asteroid or whether we go back to \nthe Moon. We were on the Moon 40 years ago. Now it is time to venture \non out into the cosmos.\n  Under conventional technology, it would take 10 months for us to get \nto Mars, and by the time you got there, the realignments of the planets \nas they orbit the Sun would cause us to have to stay on the surface of \nMars for a year until the planets were realigned where Earth was going \nto be close enough to Mars for the 10-month return journey. So, \nnaturally, there is development going on by a number of entities, but \none in particular headed by the astronaut who has flown more than any \nother astronaut--seven times--Dr. Franklin Chang-Diaz. He has been \ndeveloping over the years, even from the time he got his Ph.D. at MIT, \na plasma rocket, and that rocket is being now sufficiently developed \nthat they are ready to do the testing stage and carry a small version \nof the rocket to the International Space Station, where it would be \nattached. A plasma rocket gives a constant stream of plasma energy that \nwould keep the space station boosted to its height instead of \nconstantly having to boost it every year or so because the orbit \ndegrades. That plasma rocket would take us to Mars, if perfected, in 2 \nmonths instead of 10 months. If you go to Mars that fast--and by the \nway, that is going at 400,000 miles per hour--if you go that fast, then \nyou don't have to stay on the surface of Mars for a year because you \ncan stay there for a first trip for a few days, and the planets are \nstill aligned so they are close enough so that in a 2-month period, you \nwould be able to get back.\n  These are exciting things for the future of both the human space \nprogram and the nonhuman space program. The development of technologies \nin Earth science, the unmanned portion--we have a fairly significant \nincrease in the NASA budget with regard to the science portion.\n  There is a huge increase in the budget of NASA for aeronautics. \nRemember, the first ``A'' in NASA--it is the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration. The first ``A'' is aeronautics. There is a huge \nincrease in the research and development for aeronautics. A lot of the \nairplanes we take for granted today or the cutting-edge advances in our \nmilitary aircraft, where do we think that originally came in? It came \nfrom the research and development through NASA.\n\n[[Page S8370]]\n\n  So, naturally, the Commerce Committee wanted to make sure the \nadministration, given some of the uncertainties of the actual funding \nlevels, is on point to follow the NASA authorization law. We received \nthose assurances yesterday.\n  It is our hope that as we now come to decide how we are going to fund \nthe rest of the government for the rest of the fiscal year--we are \nalready into the fiscal year, October and November and going into the \nthird month of the fiscal year; a fiscal year that started October 1--\nwe are hoping that, at the very least, we can take the existing \nappropriations from last year, the fiscal year 2010, and carry that \nforward, at the very least, for NASA. What that would mean is instead \nof having funding at $19 billion for 2011, the funding would be at last \nyear's level of $18.724 billion. That would be $276 million less than \nthe authorized level. NASA can live with that. The exceptional goals \nthat are set in this NASA bill can be achieved with that cut, which is \nless than 1.6 percent of the total NASA authorized level--clearly, it \ncan be done under these very austere times.\n  So I am hopeful, on the basis of what we saw yesterday and heard in \nthe Commerce Committee, we will be able to go forth. A third shuttle \nflight will be added that will fly next summer. As we transition into \nthe new commercial rockets, as we transition into the development of \nthe new heavy-lift rocket, along with its spacecraft known as a \ncapsule, as we transition into the extension of the International Space \nStation, the modernization of our space facilities, particularly at the \nKennedy Space Center--as we transition into all that, we will have less \nof a disruption of the employment in the space community than otherwise \nwould have been the case with employment dropping precipitously off a \ncliff because of the shutdown of the space shuttle program.\n\n  I am encouraged, I am optimistic, I am grateful, and I was happy to \nhear the unequivocal statements by the administration yesterday in \nsupport of the NASA bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Madam President, in a letter sent yesterday to Senate \nleaders, former Deputy Attorneys General of the United States who \nserved in both Republican and Democratic administrations urged the \nSenate to consider the nomination of James Cole to be the Deputy \nAttorney General without further delay.\n  The Deputy Attorney General is the No. 2 position at the Department \nof Justice. It is a critical national security and Federal law \nenforcement position. These former officials who served with \ndistinction in that post write that the deputy is ``the chief operating \nofficer of the Department of Justice, supervising its day-to-day \noperations'' and that ``the deputy is also a key member of the \nPresident's national security team, a function that has grown in \nimportance and complexity in the years since the terror attacks of \nSeptember 11.'' These former Deputy Attorneys General are right. I \nthank them for speaking out to urge the Senate to complete \nconsideration of this important nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Incidentally, the Deputy Attorneys General who served in \nboth Republican and Democratic administrations who signed this letter \nwere Donald Ayer, Carol Dinkins, Mark Filip, Jamie Gorelick, Philip \nHeymann, Paul McNulty, David Ogden, and Larry Thompson.\n  Mr. Cole's nomination has been pending on the Executive Calendar for \n4\\1/2\\ months, since it was reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee in July. I have a hard time remembering any time, in either a \nDemocratic or Republican administration, that the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral has been held up like this.\n  Those Republican Senators who continue to block us from considering \nthis well-qualified nominee should come forward and explain why they \nfeel it is justified to continue to leave America without a crucial \nresource we need to combat terrorism and to keep the country safe. \nInstead of doing this anonymously, the Senators ought to step forward \nand say why we cannot confirm this Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 \nlaw enforcement position for the whole United States of America.\n  Today, I will seek unanimous consent for a time agreement to debate \nthis nomination and finally have a vote in the full Senate. I have \nalerted the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of \nthis request. Those who oppose the nomination are free to say why and \nthey can vote no, but let's end the stalling.\n  You have Senators say that they don't want to vote yes and that they \ndon't want to vote no, but that they want to vote maybe. This is what \nis happening now with the nomination for the No. 2 law enforcement \nofficial of the country.\n  Madam President, we were all elected for 6-year terms, with the \nresponsibility to vote yes or no in the best interests of the United \nStates. Voting maybe does not serve those interests.\n  President Obama nominated Jim Cole to be Deputy Attorney General on \nMay 24. That was 6\\1/2\\ months ago. I thank the Judiciary Committee \nranking member, Senator Sessions, for working with me to schedule a \nhearing on the Cole nomination while the committee was preparing for \nJustice Kagan's confirmation hearing.\n  The problem was not with the Senator from Alabama. He helped me move \nforward with that hearing in the committee, and I wish we could have \nproceeded in the same spirit in the Senate. As the former Deputy \nAttorneys General wrote, ``Because of the responsibilities of the \nposition of Deputy Attorney General, votes on nominations to fill this \nposition usually proceed quickly.'' They also note that of the 11 \nnominations to fill this position over the last 20 years, from both \nDemocratic and Republican Presidents, ``none remained pending for \nlonger than 32 days.'' Indeed, all four of the Deputy Attorneys General \nwho served under President Bush, three of whom signed the letter we \nreceived yesterday, were confirmed by the Senate by voice vote an \naverage of 21 days after they were reported by the Judiciary Committee. \nIn fact, we confirmed President Bush's first nominee to be Deputy \nAttorney General the very same day it was reported by the committee.\n  We should treat the nomination of Jim Cole with the same urgency and \nseriousness with which we treated President Bush's nominations of Larry \nThompson, James Comey, Paul McNulty, and Mark Filip. We should reject \nthe strategy of some Senate Republicans of elevating their partisan \ngoal to weaken the Obama administration over taking actions to keep us \nsafe.\n  In November, over 4 months after Mr. Cole responded to written \nquestions following his confirmation hearing, only two Senators sent \nhim additional followup questions on a topic covered extensively during \nthe earlier questioning. Two weeks ago, Mr. Cole promptly answered even \nthese additional questions. There is no reason for Republicans to \ncontinue blocking the Senate's consideration of this nomination.\n  Jim Cole served as a career prosecutor at the Justice Department for \na dozen years and has a well-deserved reputation for fairness, \nintegrity, and toughness. He served under both Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents. He clearly demonstrated during his confirmation \nhearing months ago that he understands the issues of crime and national \nsecurity that are at the center of the Deputy Attorney General's job.\n  The nomination received strong endorsement from Republican and \nDemocratic public officials, and from high-ranking veterans of the \nJustice Department, including the letter to the Senate leaders \nyesterday from eight former Deputy Attorneys General who served in the \nadministrations of President Reagan, President George H.W.\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\nBush, President Clinton, President George W. Bush, as well as the \ncurrent administration. Former Republican Senator Jack Danforth, who \nworked with Jim Cole for more than 15 years, described Mr. Cole to the \ncommittee as someone without an ideological or political agenda.\n  The months of delay of this nomination have been unnecessary, \ndebilitating and wrong.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 December 1, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Addison Mitchell McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: We are a bipartisan group \n     of former Deputy Attorneys General of the United States. We \n     write to urge the expeditious consideration by the Senate of \n     the nomination of James Cole to be Deputy Attorney General.\n       The Cole nomination was received by the Senate on May 24, \n     2010, and reported favorably from the Judiciary Committee on \n     July 20, 2010, so the nomination has been pending before the \n     Senate for more than one hundred and twenty days. Because of \n     the responsibilities of the position of Deputy Attorney \n     General, votes on nominations for this position usually \n     proceed quickly. Over the past twenty years, presidents of \n     both parties nominated eleven individuals to serve as Deputy \n     Attorney General. Their nominations were pending on the \n     Senate calendar for an average of twelve days, and none \n     remained pending for longer than thirty-two days. Nine of the \n     eleven nominees were confirmed by voice vote or unanimous \n     consent.\n       The position of Deputy Attorney General is an important \n     position in the federal government. The Deputy Attorney \n     General functions as the chief operating officer of the \n     Department of Justice, supervising its day-to-day operations. \n     As such, the Deputy plays a central role in ensuring \n     effective enforcement of federal laws, including laws against \n     mortgage fraud, health care fraud, organized crime and child \n     exploitation. The Deputy is also a key member of the \n     president's national security team, a function that has grown \n     in importance and complexity in the years since the terror \n     attacks of September 11. He or she supervises the work of the \n     Department's National Security Division, and is called upon \n     to make crucial, time sensitive decisions to protect the \n     American people.\n       There is a capable individual currently serving as Acting \n     Deputy Attorney General, but it is important to the proper \n     functioning of the Department that there be a confirmed \n     official in this position. Only a Deputy appointed by the \n     President may formally and automatically assume all of the \n     duties of the Attorney General when that Cabinet official is \n     unavailable for one reason or another. And there is at least \n     one critical statutory responsibility that an Acting Deputy \n     cannot perform--signing applications to the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n       We strongly urge that the Senate vote on the nomination of \n     James Cole as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald B. Ayer,\n     Carol E. Dinkins,\n     Mark R. Filip,\n     Jamie S. Gorelick,\n     Philip B. Heymann,\n     Paul J. McNulty,\n     David W. Ogden,\n     Larry D. Thompson.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. At this time--and I note that my colleague from Alabama is \nin the Chamber--I propound the following unanimous-consent request:\n  I ask unanimous consent, as if in executive session, that at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader, following consultation with \nthe Republican leader, that the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider Calendar No. 1002, the nomination of James Michael Cole to be \nDeputy Attorney General; that there be 2 hours of debate with respect \nto the nomination, with the time equally divided and controlled between \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of such time, the Senate proceed to vote on \nconfirmation of the nomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill object--I would first thank my colleague, Senator Leahy, for the \ncourtesy as he has moved forward with this. He is a relentless chairman \npushing for these nominees. I respect his responsibility and his belief \nthat this nominee needs to move forward, and, frankly, it is about \ntime--we need to fish or cut bait on it. I do not think an indefinite \ndelay is good for the country.\n  This nomination does have controversy. Most of the nominations the \nPresident has submitted did clear unanimously in our committee, but \nthis nomination resulted in all the Republicans on the committee voting \nagainst it. But I now understand that our two leaders, Senators Reid \nand McConnell, are working at this moment to try to figure which \nnominees should move before we recess--and hopefully before too many \ndays--and perhaps this nominee will be in that group. But until those \ntalks are complete, I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am disappointed. The Republicans are \nsaying there is a double standard. All of the Deputy Attorneys General \nnominated by Republican presidents have been confirmed, most by voice \nvote, within a month. This one has waited on the floor for over 4 \nmonths and we still cannot even get a vote. As Senators, we should all \nat least have the courage to vote yes or to vote no. Eventually, we \nhave to stop voting maybe. It allows everybody to go home and say: I \nmay be here on an issue or I may be there. We are Senators and we must \nhave the courage to vote yes or to vote no. We cannot continue to vote \nmaybe, especially on the No. 2 law enforcement officer of the United \nStates. President Bush's first deputy, was confirmed within 24 hours of \nbeing reported from Committee, while James Cole has waited 6 months for \na vote. Voting maybe is not a profile in courage in the Senate.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the recess \nstart 2 minutes from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Did you say recess in 2 minutes?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I would be glad to make that longer. We have an order, as \nI understand it, to recess at 12:34. I wanted to make a brief comment. \nIf the Senator would like some time, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask that the unanimous-consent request allow me \nto have 5 minutes when the Senator finishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I certainly have no objection. That is a fair request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wanted to follow up for a moment \nbecause we are talking about the No. 2 person in the Department of \nJustice, and one of our responsibilities is to make sure executive \nagencies perform their function. The Judiciary Committee has the \nresponsibility to make sure the Department of Justice is doing its \nwork. But we, the Judiciary Committee, recommended the confirmation of \nthe Deputy Attorney General 6 months ago. How can we expect the \nAttorney General to get the work done if we do not give him the help in \nthe confirmation process?\n  I agree completely with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--we \nshould have the courage to vote up or down a Deputy Attorney General--\nbut I really took this time because I find it amazing that Jim Cole has \nnot been confirmed. See, I happen to know Jim Cole. I have had \nexperiences of working with Jim Cole in my official capacity as a \nMember of Congress. He was selected to be our Special Counsel in an \nextremely complicated and difficult matter in the Ethics Committee in \nthe House of Representatives. He wasn't selected by me. At the time, \nPorter Goss, a Republican from Florida, was the chairman of our \ncommittee, and he worked with six of us in a very difficult \ninvestigation, and he brought the six of us together because of the \nprofessional manner in which Jim Cole attacks any of the problems with \nwhich he is confronted. He is not a partisan; he is a professional. He \nis a professional who\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\nunderstands what it is in the Department of Justice and public service. \nHe has worked for both Democratic and Republican administrations. He \nhas been recommended by both Democrats and Republicans. He is not at \nall a partisan. He is the person whom you would want to have in the \nDepartment of Justice. And that is why Porter Goss said he found Jim \nCole to be ``a brilliant prosecutor and extraordinarily talented''--\nquoting from the Republican from Florida, who, along with the \nDemocrats, was very proud of the professional work Jim Cole brought to \na very partisan battle in the House of Representatives.\n  We should confirm this nominee. We should at least vote on this \nnominee. But to use this somewhat backward approach to deny a vote on \nthe No. 2 person in the Department of Justice is just wrong.\n  I understand Senator Sessions is saying there will hopefully be an \nagreement before the end of this Congress. But, quite frankly, this \nnominee came out in July. It is not as if he came out of the committee \nlast week. He came out in July. This is an important position, and I \nthink we have a responsibility to vote up or down this important part \nof the ability of the Department of Justice to carry out its important \nmission. So I am disappointed that we had an objection heard on this \nnominee. I would urge everyone to make sure this nominee is voted on \nprior to when we leave for this holiday recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the President and the Attorney General \nneed a Deputy Attorney General who can function, who has the confidence \nof the Congress and the American people and will do an excellent, \nfirst-rate job.\n  There are questions about this nominee. Every nominee who has been \nnominated for the Deputy Attorney General or other positions in the \nDepartment of Justice by President Bush was not rubber stamped within a \nday or two. Tim Flanigan, a highly competent nominee, was opposed by \nDemocratic lawmakers aggressively after 9/11. The President withdrew \nhim from consideration and then nominated someone who was promptly \nconfirmed. He did not try to ram it down our throats.\n  Frankly, we have a problem of confidence in the Department of \nJustice. The Attorney General himself, perhaps following the lead of \nthe President, has indicated on a number of different occasions a lack \nof commitment to vigorous action to prosecute terrorists who have \nattacked the country, and he has taken other steps.\n  I would have liked to have seen a Deputy Attorney General nominee who \nwas not in that mold but who was more of a career prosecutor who would \nhave helped bring some balance and input from a more traditional view \nof the role of the Attorney General as someone who prosecutes \ncriminals, protects the United States, defends law-abiding Americans \nfrom terrorists and criminals who attack them. That was the approach I \ntook when I was attorney general. I hired people who were proven \nprosecutors. But Mr. Cole, for example, right after 9/11, indicated his \nbelief that these attacks were not acts of war but instead were \ncriminal acts; he wrote this in an article:\n\n       For all of the rhetoric about war, the September 11th \n     attacks were criminal acts of terrorism against the civilian \n     population.\n\n  I do not agree with that. The American people do not agree with that. \nWhy does the President want to appoint somebody who thinks 9/11 was a \ncriminal act and not an act of war? I think it is a big deal, so that \nis one of the reasons we have raised it. Is he going to bring some \nbalance to Attorney General Holder or are they going to move even \nfurther left in their approach to these issues?\n  I would also note he was given a highly paid position as an \nindependent monitor of AIG. This is the big insurance company whose \ncredit default swaps and insurance dealings really triggered this \nentire collapse of the economic system. He was in the company at the \ntime as a government monitor, and he did not blow the whistle on what \nwas going on throughout this period of time.\n  It is argued that he wasn't precisely there to monitor. Sue Reisinger \nof Corporate Counsel wrote this about his handling of that matter:\n\n       It is as though Cole were spackling cracks in the \n     compliance walls and never noticed that AIG's financial \n     foundation was crumbling beneath his feet.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One more point.\n  Beatrice Edwards of the Government Accountability Project criticized \nCole for failing to ``detect an atmosphere of . . . laissez-faire \ncompliance of the company.'' So he has been criticized for a big, \nimportant role he had.\n  Those were just some of the concerns held in committee. And I wish \nthe President had nominated somebody like Larry Thompson, who was \nDepartment Attorney General under President Bush, and whom everybody \nrespected and would have been confirmed like a knife through hot \nbutter.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in a way, the Senator is making my point. \nIf he has questions about Mr. Cole, let him argue them, debate them, \nset a time, and then vote yes or vote no. Particular issues come up in \nthe Senate, such as nominees, and Republicans hold them up so they \nnever come to a vote. Then the Senators can take any position they want \nto back home.\n  All I am saying is that we must vote yes or no and not maybe. We have \ntoo many issues in the Senate, whether it is tax matters, don't ask, \ndon't tell, or nomination, where we continue to delay a vote.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Alabama has never hesitated to \nvote yes or no in committee, and I commend him on that. Many times we \nagree, and a number of times we disagree, but he states his position as \na yes or no. He and I have voted on this issue in committee and stated \na position. I just hope everybody else can as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the chairman of our committee. \nHe is doing what I would do if I were in his place, in saying: Let's \ngive this nominee an up-or-down vote and let's have a debate on it. Our \nleaders are working on that, and perhaps that can be accomplished. But \nit must be noted that this is a nominee who has some controversy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8372-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the 111th Congress is drawing to a close \nand families across the Nation are preparing for the holiday season. In \nthe Senate, we still have many items on our agenda, bills we need to \ncomplete before we adjourn. Many of these bills represent the \npriorities of various Senators addressing issues that some have worked \non for this entire Congress, some for several Congresses. Other bills \nare necessary to prevent certain longstanding policies from expiring, \nsuch as tax relief for working families, and still others are needed to \navert cuts in key programs such as Medicare payments to doctors and \nprotecting rehabilitative services for seniors.\n  In addition to marking the start of the holiday season, this week \nalso brings a devastating reminder of the economic disaster facing many \nfamilies. On Monday, action to extend unemployment benefits to millions \nof people was blocked in the Senate by Republicans. Yesterday, those \nbenefits expired. The Republicans are telling us we cannot consider any \nlegislation until we take up tax breaks for millionaires. On December \n1, more than 800,000 Americans were left without benefits and up to 2 \nmillion more will soon follow by the end of the year, including 48,000 \nMarylanders. There are some in this body who may not recognize the \nperil facing families whose benefits are being cut off. Every day I \nhear from Marylanders who are asking\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\nCongress for help. They want to work but can't find employment. Many \nhave been looking for a long time, over a year, sending hundreds of \nresumes, pounding the pavements, attending job fairs and numerous \ninterviews, all to no avail. They want us to take the steps necessary \nto help the economy create jobs, and they need some assistance in the \nmeantime to help them stay afloat.\n  Maryland's unemployment rate stands at 7.4 percent statewide. \nAlthough that is lower than the national average, in some counties the \nsituation is more dire. In Baltimore City, the rate is 11 percent. In \nDorchester County, it stands at 9.8 percent. In Somerset County, it is \n9.9 percent, and in Washington County, it is almost 10 percent. Earlier \nthis week several building trade workers visited my office. For them \nthis is not a recovery, this is not a recession, this is a depression. \nThat is because in the construction industry, unemployment rates range \nfrom 30 to 50 percent, depending on location. Among one local union in \nBaltimore the unemployment rate is 27 percent; more than one out of \nevery four members has no job.\n  In fact, Labor Department statistics tell us that for every job \nopening there are five individuals actively seeking employment. The \nodds are not very good for someone trying to find employment today. \nThat is why we have had long-term unemployment and why we need to \nextend benefits to those who are in need today. Nearly 15 million of my \nfellow Americans cannot find work. Of that total, the number of long-\nterm unemployed, defined as those who have been jobless for 27 weeks or \nmore, is about 6.2 million. As of last month, two-fifths of unemployed \npersons have been out of work for at least 27 weeks. Behind the \naggregate numbers, there is a deeper sense of despair in many \ncommunities. Teenage unemployment is over 27 percent, Black \nunemployment is over 15 percent, and Latino unemployment is over 12 \npercent.\n  In addition to the number of people out of work and seeking work, the \nDepartment of Labor also calculates data that includes people who want \nto work but are discouraged from looking and people who are working \npart-time because they can't find full-time employment. In October \n2010, the rate stood at 17 percent in that category.\n  During the course of this national debate over unemployment \ncompensation, a number of issues are in contention: those who say the \njobs are there and people should continue looking; whether this should \nbe paid for or considered emergency spending; whether we should focus \non growing the economy rather than on benefits; whether it is time to \nend benefits because the economy is recovering; that the unemployed do \nnot deserve extended benefits and more.\n  Let me address some of these issues. For those who say the jobs are \nthere but people just aren't looking, in September 2010, almost 15 \nmillion workers were unemployed, but there were only 3 million job \nopenings or five unemployed workers for every available job. In other \nwords, if every available job were filled by unemployed individuals, \nfour out of the five unemployed workers would still be looking for \nwork. Last night we heard in this Chamber that the objection to \nextending unemployment benefits is because it is not paid for. It is \nright to extend tax breaks for millionaires and not pay for it because \nthat somehow is an emergency situation, but extending unemployment \nbenefits to those who are in dire need doesn't qualify as emergency \nspending. Historically, unemployment compensation extensions have been \ntreated as emergency spending by Congresses and administrations going \nback to the Reagan administration. Families across Maryland and the \nNation will tell us that when you have a mortgage that is due, when \nyour heat is about to be cut off, when you cannot buy groceries for the \nfamily, that is an emergency situation. Their situations constitute \nemergencies, and we should treat them as such.\n  For those of my colleagues insisting extending benefits is not as \nimportant as getting the economy back on solid footing, I point out \nthat numerous economists have pointed out the value of unemployment \ninsurance benefits. These are dollars going back into the market, \nraising consumption, and creating jobs.\n  Let me compare it to what my Republican colleagues are saying about \ntax breaks for millionaires. Where is that going to benefit the \neconomy? That money isn't going to go right back. We know unemployment \nbenefits do go right back into the economy. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that for every $1 we spend in \nunemployment compensation, we generate more than $1.90 back into the \neconomy. In other words, it is a stimulus. The nonpartisan CBO has \nanalyzed 11 different measures for their effectiveness in growing the \neconomy, and it rates extending unemployment benefits as the single \nmost effective tool. This helps job growth. When people receive \nunemployment benefits, they spend it immediately. That helps retail \nestablishments, grocery stores, including many small businesses, and \nthe overall economy. It is the definition of stimulus spending, and it \nis immediate.\n  With no extension, unemployed workers and their families will have \nless money to spend and will cut back on their purchase of goods and \nservices, resulting in weaker sales, hurting businesses, and costing \njobs.\n  Another sentiment I have heard expressed is, we are giving a handout \nto unemployed Americans. Unemployment insurance is not a handout. It is \nnot government largesse. Unemployment insurance is just that. It is an \ninsurance program. It is an insurance program employees and employers \ncontribute to so during difficult times, there is money available when \na person loses their job. People receiving benefits had jobs, and the \ntime they worked is reflected in the weeks of benefits they receive. \nThis is an insurance program. It is countercyclical. It is supposed to \nbe available during tough economic times. That is why unemployment \ninsurance is paid. These funds should now be available to help people \nwho need them.\n  Finally, I wish to address a misconception about the amount of \nunemployment benefits. These are not extravagant payments. The average \nbenefit amounts to $302 per week.\n  The reason we are told we can't bring this up is because we have to \nbring up the tax bill first. We can't get the tax bill up because \nRepublicans are insisting we have to deal with the millionaires. The \ntax breaks for the millionaires are far more money than the $302 per \nweek for someone who is on unemployment compensation. What these \nfamilies receive is not a lot of money, but it is a lifeline. It keeps \nfood on the table, heat through the winter months, and gas in the car \nwhile they are continuing to look for jobs. The extension only gives \nthose who are eligible for unemployment benefits the same number of \nmaximum weeks we provide others during these economic times. It does \nnot lengthen the total number of eligible weeks of benefits.\n  The highest unemployment rate at which any previous Federal emergency \nunemployment program ended was 7.2 percent in March of 1985, during the \nsecond Reagan administration, much lower than where we are today. So \nwhere do we stand? We have passed several short-term extensions, and we \nneed to act again. Here we are today, as 800,000 Americans across the \nNation have no benefits whatsoever. Yet our Republican colleagues \nobject. They object to a short-term extension. They object to any \nextension. They say: First, let's bring up the tax bill that provides \nbreaks for millionaires, and we can't bring up the middle-income tax \nrelief until we take care of the millionaires.\n  Nearly every Member of the Senate has risen to talk about the need \nfor job creation. I believe all of us are sincere. Each of us is \ncommitted to acting on legislation that will create more job \nopportunities for Americans. We have passed the Recovery Act and a \nSmall Business Jobs Act and will soon consider tax extenders that will \nfurther help businesses invest more in jobs. Rather than abruptly \ncutting off those still in difficult times because of the economy, we \nshould pass at least a 1-year extension of unemployment compensation \nbenefits. On behalf of the millions of American families who will be \naffected by what we do or fail to do this week, I call upon my \ncolleagues, at the start of the holiday season, to recognize the needs \nof families struggling to make ends meet and agree to an extension of \nthis essential program.\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the American people deserve to know why we \nare not legislating. We are all here, and we are not passing any bills, \nbills that are important to the American people; for example, a bill to \nkeep the government operating. We are getting to the point where we are \nrunning out of time. We are not doing that today. A bill to authorize \nthe Defense Department, here we are in the middle of two wars, we are \nnot doing that bill. A bill to help victims of 9/11, the brave first \nresponders who are suffering because they worked, some of them almost \n24/7, in the debris that was so toxic to them, and I remember then EPA \nAdministrator Whitman saying it was all fine, it was all safe, the air \nwas OK. We need to help them. We are not doing that. A bill to help our \nfirefighters, a bill to help firefighters have the dignity to be able \nto negotiate for their wages, a bill called the DREAM Act to help many \nproductive young people join the military and go to college and help \nour country, we are not doing those either. We are doing nothing. We \nare not doing a bill to promote manufacturing that was offered by one \nof my colleagues. We are not doing a bill to give tax breaks to \ncompanies that hire unemployed workers. We are not doing a bill to end \ntax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. We are not doing the \nSTART treaty, a treaty that is endorsed by international experts from \nAmerica on both sides of the aisle, including George Shultz, and people \nwho worked for Ronald Reagan and George Bush. We are not doing that.\n  All these bills, including the unemployment insurance extension, \nwhich is so critical, all that is being held hostage by my Republican \nfriends who all wrote a letter and put their names on it. I am not \nmaking this up. It is in writing. They said they would do nothing until \nthey won tax break bonuses for those who earn over $1 million, the \nmillionaires and the billionaires. They are holding up all this \nimportant work. To me, it is shocking. I have heard of having an \nobjection to a bill and having a strong moral objection to a bill and \nholding things up. They are holding up every single thing, as my \nfriend, Senator Stabenow, has talked about for days now.\n  Here is the point: Democrats have agreed to give every working \nAmerican a tax break on their first $250,000 of income, every working \nAmerican, up to the sky, a tax break on the first $250,000 of income. \nWe even offered to go up to the first $1 million because some of our \nfriends said: Oh, 250 isn't high enough. There are some small \nbusinesses in there. We investigated that, and 97 percent of small \nbusinesses would be protected with the $250,000 level. But if we go up \nto 1 million, all the small businesses are taken care of. We have \nexpressed interest in going up to $1 million. Guess what. This is not \nenough for the Republicans in the Senate. They are fighting for those \nearning over $1 million, over $1 billion. It doesn't matter. They are \nholding everything hostage.\n\n  Let's be clear. They are fighting, they are united, they are strong, \nthey are adamant on behalf of the billionaires of this country, by the \nway, many of whom said: Please, we don't need any more tax breaks. We \nare doing great.\n  So if ever people wanted to know which party fights for whom, this is \nit, folks. This is the clearest example I have ever seen in my life.\n  Do you know that under the Republican plan a family earning $10 \nmillion a year--listen, $10 million a year--will get back, under their \nplan, $460,000 every single year? They are fighting for that.\n  They say they care about the deficit. I do not see that because their \nposition on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires will add \nhundreds of billions of dollars to our deficit. But when you ask them \nwhether they would be willing to help us to extend unemployment \nbenefits to the workers who are caught in this deep, dark recession, \nthey say: Oh, we can't afford it.\n  So listen, they will not pay for the tax cuts to their millionaire, \nbillionaire friends, but they insist on cutting the Federal budget to \npay for extending unemployment insurance, which, as far as I know, has \nnever been done before. It is an emergency funding, and it is, by the \nway, $50 billion compared to $400 billion.\n  So I hope the American people--I know they have a lot of things to \ndo, getting ready for the holidays and caring about families; \nunfortunately, many of them are worried this holiday; more than 400,000 \nworkers in California will lose their unemployment benefits by the end \nof December--I hope they see who is fighting for them versus who is \nfighting for the millionaires and the billionaires. It is right out \nthere.\n  I could not believe that one of my colleagues from the other side of \nthe aisle, from Massachusetts, was outraged that we tried to extend \nunemployment benefits. Why is he outraged? He should be outraged that \nmore than 2 million workers nationwide will lose their benefits by the \nend of December. We just got a report that 7 million unemployed workers \ncould be denied access to benefits by the end of next year, while my \nRepublican friends are fighting to get $460,000 a year for someone who \nearns $10 million. They would allow 7 million unemployed workers in our \ncountry to go without benefits.\n  Their proposal is: Well, let's cut a program. Well, ask any economist \nabout that. That is harmful to an economic recovery. We know that for \nevery $1 of unemployment insurance that gets spent, it has an impact of \n$1.61 to the economy because folks on unemployment are not like the $10 \nmillion-a-year family that is going to stick it in their trust fund; \nthey are going to spend it in the corner grocery store, and that has a \nripple effect throughout the economy.\n  I wish to read to you a statement by Laura from Long Beach, one of my \nconstituents.\n\n       Today my parents' unemployment benefits expired. Today, I \n     don't know how they're going to make it. I don't know what \n     I'm going to do.\n       This morning I woke up to hear that the Republicans in the \n     Senate have signed a letter pledging not to allow anything to \n     pass until Bush tax cuts are reinstated. These are the same \n     tax cuts that only help people who are employed, excessively \n     wealthy, and people who will never hire my dad, who is a hard \n     worker--but nearing 60.\n       He experienced losing his job when a lot of Americans did. \n     Since then, he's been working low paying jobs at local \n     businesses--businesses that little by little have had to cut \n     back. Unfortunately, this usually means that they fire their \n     newer employees--employees like my dad.\n       Since losing his job, his 10 year old car has quit working, \n     leaving him bereft of transportation and making it even more \n     difficult to find a job. My mom isn't as healthy as she used \n     to be and can't work because she needs to provide childcare \n     for my sister, who works hectic hours in the healthcare \n     industry.\n       I'm currently in graduate school--the first of my family to \n     graduate from college. My husband and I are debating whether \n     or not I need to drop out so that I can help provide for my \n     parents, who currently live out of state.\n       Suffice it to say, when I read the news this morning, I \n     broke down in tears.\n\n  Let me divert. She heard about the letter from the Republicans saying \nthey would do nothing until these tax cuts went in, and she broke down \nin tears. She said:\n\n       My family has lived a hard life, and this just made it \n     harder. But really, I'm crying because I can't believe that \n     this is what my country has come to--or more importantly, \n     this is what my father's country has come to.\n       . . . . He was raised believing that this country was the \n     best country in the world--that it would always look out for \n     the best interest of its people. He served in the military, \n     bought American cars, and worked at the same job for over 20 \n     years. So as much as I am writing this letter because I'm \n     upset about my own familial circumstances, I'm equally \n     interested in writing you to remind you of the middle class--\n     and those of us who are slipping out of it.\n\n  I have a number of other letters, but I know other colleagues are \nhere. But no one could be more eloquent than Laura and I want to thank \nher and everybody else who wrote to me and I\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\nwill come back again during the time we are in session to put these \nletters in the Record.\n  But in summing up, it is very clear where we are. My Republican \nfriends, to a person, have all signed on to a strategy, and that \nstrategy is to keep us from passing very important legislation, \nincluding an unemployment insurance extension, including the Defense \nbill, including the START treaty--everything I put in the Record--until \nthey get their tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. That, to me, \nis a shame. They have a right to do it. I support their right to do it. \nBut I also think the American people ought to know what is going on.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3981, a bill \nto provide for a temporary extension of unemployment insurance \nprovisions; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, the \nbill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there are \na couple ways we can help people who are currently looking for work. \nOne is by extending unemployment benefits for those who have been out \nof work now 99 weeks. This is what the extension is about: for those \nwho have already----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I have \njust heard from my colleague, would the Senator agree to include an \namendment that has been proposed by Senator Brown that would offset the \ncost of the bill with unspent Federal funds, the text of which is at \nthe desk? Would the Senator include that amendment that has been \nproposed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely, I would not agree to that modification. It \ngoes to the very point I was making. They want to give tax breaks to \nmillionaires and not pay for it, but they are forcing cuts in other \njobs programs here. It would only make a worse recession and I object \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President. So I do object to the motion \nby the distinguished Senator from California.\n\n  As I was saying, there are two ways to help those who are looking for \nwork and one of which is to improve the economy. We can do that by \ngiving some certainty--certainty--to people who provide jobs, who build \nbusinesses, who create opportunities, the job-creating sector of this \ncountry. We can do that by giving them certainty regarding what their \ntax rates will be come January 1. Right now there is an incredible \namount of uncertainty.\n  The second way is to deal with the unemployment benefits for those \nwho have been out of work now 99 weeks because that is what this is \nabout. These are people who have been collecting unemployment benefits \nfor 99 weeks. I will tell you, there are people across the Nation \nhaving a tough time due to this poor economy. I wish to see the economy \nimprove.\n  The national unemployment rate in October was 9.6 percent. Today's \nfront page of USA Today says: ``Jobless data could break '80s \nrecord''--a record from the 1980s. ``November was likely 19th month \nabove 9 percent.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question--please, a very \nquick one?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator so much, and he is my friend.\n  I just want the Senator to understand this extension is not for \nanything beyond 99 weeks. Believe me. It is up to 99 weeks. We do not \nhave any extension beyond 99 weeks. I just wanted my friend to know \nthat.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the comments of \nthe Senator from California. Senator Brown, who occupies the desk next \nto mine, was on the floor talking about this just 2 nights ago and does \nwant to work to extend unemployment benefits and to do it in a way that \nis paid for. That is why I came to offer the amendment to the Senator \nfrom California to say: Well, let's do it but do it by paying for it \nusing unspent Federal funds, the text of which is at the desk.\n  We need to pay to extend this. But what we need to do is stimulate \nthe economy because of what we see on the front page of USA Today about \n``Jobless data could break '80s record'' and ``November was likely 19th \nmonth above 9 percent.'' We need to give certainty to business.\n  My colleague from California made comments about a letter signed by \n42 Republican Senators. In fact, I did sign that. All the Republican \nMembers of the Senate signed it. In the first paragraph it says:\n\n       President Obama in his first speech after the November \n     election said ``we owe'' it to the American people to ``focus \n     on those issues that affect their jobs.'' He went on to say \n     that Americans ``want jobs to come back faster.''\n\n  That is why 42 of us signed the letter. Let's focus on that. Let us \nget that done. Let us provide that certainty. If after that is done the \nmajority party wants to go and address the issues of don't ask, don't \ntell, wants to talk about the DREAM Act, talking about incentives for \nillegal immigrants with college education, if they want to talk about \nissues of firefighters joining unions, fine. But let's get to the \nfundamentals of what the American people want to have dealt with. That \nis why I was happy to offer an amendment to my colleague from \nCalifornia to say pay for it, and then we can move on. Because \nbusinesses need that sort of certainty.\n  I heard her many comments about taxes, and I believe you should not \nraise taxes on anyone in the middle of economic times such as these. My \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle all agree and there is actually \nbipartisan agreement that you should not raise taxes on anyone in the \nmiddle of economic times such as these.\n  The newest Members of the Senate--and since the election there are \nnow three new Members who have been sworn in; two on that side of the \naisle, one on my side of the aisle--are unanimous in saying one should \nnot raise taxes on anyone during these economic times.\n  Senator Manchin from West Virginia said: ``I wouldn't raise any \ntaxes.''\n  Senator Coons from Delaware said: ``I would extend them [the tax \ncuts] for everyone.''\n  So when I look at this and also see statements by Joe Lieberman from \nConnecticut, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, Senator Jim Webb from \nVirginia, Senator Evan Bayh from Indiana, Senator Conrad from North \nDakota, it is a growing chorus of Democrats saying: One should not \nraise taxes on anyone during these economic times.\n  We need to give certainty to the job-creating segment of this Nation. \nWe need to do it in a timely manner. With it only being 4 weeks until \nthe end of the year and people wanting to know what is going to happen \nwith their taxes, I think the best thing this body could do is to \nprovide that certainty.\n  So with that, I notice a number of colleagues who are waiting to \nspeak and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I agree with my friend from Wyoming. \nWe need certainty in the marketplace, and we are happy to do that. We \nare happy to create certainty right now that middle-class taxpayers and \nsmall businesses will be able to receive tax cuts permanently into the \nfuture, that we will be able to extend those tax cuts.\n  We also believe it is important to give certainty to people who are \nout of work through no fault of their own, who yesterday began to lose \nunemployment benefits. Now, I personally believe, as long as the \neconomy is as sluggish, as slow, as challenged as it is, we ought to \nextend benefits beyond 99 weeks. But the bill in front of us is not \nthat. It is the bill Senator Boxer talked about, which is just the \nbasic program. The program basically says, if you lose your job today \nyou have the same opportunity to receive some temporary help as the \nperson who lost their job on Monday or Tuesday because, right now, the \nRepublicans have been blocking us from even extending the basic program \nfor anyone who is newly unemployed, newly out of work.\n\n  So I think people who are out of work at this holiday season would \nlike some certainty.\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\n  I was interested in a story in the paper today--I believe it was \ntoday--quoting the Michigan Retailers Association concerned about \nChristmas and the inability to have unemployment benefits extended \nwould directly relate to the ability of families to have any kind of \nopportunity to have Christmas, and it would affect retailers and small \nbusinesses. They would like to see some certainty. I would also like to \nsee a more robust effort and certainty as it relates to jobs.\n  When we look at the way to stimulate the economy, the way to create \njobs, the budget folks tell us the No. 1 way right now to keep the \neconomy going is to help those who have no choice but to spend the \ndollars in their pockets. That is somebody who is out of work. That is \nthe No. 1 way to stimulate the economy, to try to keep things moving, \nand certainly we have heard that from our retailers. On a long list, \nthe least effective was to give another bonus tax cut to millionaires \nand billionaires. That was the least effective.\n  So I agree we want economic certainty. What I would love to see is to \ntake those dollars that have been ineffective for 10 years--and we know \nthat simply because it hasn't created jobs. I have lost over 800,000 \njobs in Michigan, 10 years of tax cuts for millionaires and \nbillionaires. I have one question: Where are the jobs? If my colleagues \ncan answer that, I am happy to support that policy.\n  What I would suggest as an alternative is that now, just a little \nunder 2 years ago, we invested in the recovery to, for the first time \nin many, many, many years, invest in American manufacturing: battery \nmanufacturing, new clean energy manufacturing, making things in \nAmerica, making things at home. And we are beginning to see every month \nnow manufacturing slowly coming up. The investment in the American \nautomobile industry has paid off for us in turning things around, in \nkeeping manufacturing jobs here. We are moving from 2 percent of the \nmanufacturing of advanced battery technologies in America to 40 percent \nof the world's manufacturing in 5 years because of a strategic \ninvestment.\n  I am happy to talk about those kinds of investments, but what we have \nheard from Republican colleagues is that they are willing to risk \neverything. They will risk everything to get another tax cut, a bonus \ntax cut on top of the one everybody is going to get if we extend tax \ncuts for the first $250,000 in income per couple. They want a bonus tax \ncut, and they are willing to risk everything and stop everything if \nthey can't get it. So it is very clear what their priorities are.\n  I can speak from Michigan that these are not our priorities. When I \nlook at our manufacturers, our suppliers; when I look at small \nbusinesses; when I look at families who are struggling to keep their \nhomes to stay in the middle class--maybe trying to get into the middle \nclass--working families, their priority is not to give somebody making \n$1 million a year another $100,000 bonus on top of the regular tax cut.\n  So what are we talking about? We are talking about everything being \nrisked for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. What are some of \nthe things we are risking? Another $700 billion on the national debt. \nIf we want to deal with the debt--and I don't know about my colleagues, \nbut I heard an awful lot about the debt, concern about the deficit in \nthis last election and through this last year. There were concerns when \nwe were investing in manufacturing, investing in other things to create \njobs, helping small businesses; the tax cuts for small businesses, \nlending for small businesses. We heard an awful lot from the other side \nof the aisle about the fact that we shouldn't be doing these things \nbecause of the deficit. The most important thing was the deficit.\n  I am not willing to be lectured about the deficit. I voted to balance \nthe budget when I was in the House under President Clinton. We handed \nPresident Bush a balanced budget, the largest surplus in the history of \nthe country. So I am not willing to accept that. I have great concern \nabout the deficit, but that concern means I don't want to see $700 \nbillion put on the national debt for a bonus tax cut for millionaires \nand billionaires.\n  So they are willing to risk the national deficit. They are willing to \nrisk jobs. Again, the least stimulative way to create jobs is to put \nanother bonus round of tax cuts in the hands of millionaires and \nbillionaires who, if they invest it--we don't know whether it will be \noverseas, taking jobs overseas or where it will be--but we know it \nhasn't trickled down to the people I represent, certainly, in Michigan.\n  The sense I get from the other side of the aisle is that they think \nwe just haven't waited long enough; we haven't waited long enough for \nit to trickle down. Well, we are tired of waiting. We are tired of \nwaiting, and we are tired of an economic policy of tax cuts geared to \nthose up here when it doesn't work and we are losing jobs. Under that \npolicy of trickle-down economics, Michigan lost over 800,000 jobs in \nthe last 10 years. I am tired of that. I want to see a policy that is \ngoing to work. That one hasn't worked. I don't see why in the world we \nare willing to extend it.\n  They are willing to hold up the tax cuts for middle-class families \nand small businesses. Again, I am not willing to be lectured about \nsmall business when we have seen 16 different small business tax cuts \nfilibustered in the last 2 years on the other side of the aisle; eight \ntax cuts in the small business jobs bill that only two colleagues from \nthe other side of the aisle courageously stepped over to support. So we \nunderstand the importance of small business.\n  Social Security and Medicare: We have a debt commission that has a \nnumber of proposals that are very difficult on Social Security and \nMedicare, and that is based on the deficit we have now not another $700 \nbillion. I wonder if my colleagues are willing to support cuts in \nSocial Security and Medicare, additional cuts to pay for their tax cuts \nfor millionaires and billionaires. I don't know. Is that what they are \nsuggesting? It certainly is something that could happen if we add \nanother $700 billion.\n  Then there is the one we have been talking about that is not an \neconomic issue but a moral issue for us as a country: Are we going to \nhelp folks who have gotten caught up in this country and who find \nthemselves in a situation that is unprecedented through no fault of \ntheir own? They didn't cause the recklessness on Wall Street. They were \nnot the ones who made the decision not to enforce trade laws in a fair \nway or tax policy that allows jobs to go overseas.\n  The people in my State were not the ones who made any of the \ndecisions that caused the situation they are in. Yet Wall Street did \npretty well. A lot of folks did pretty well. A lot of folks now are \nback doing very well.\n  The folks left holding the bag are working families, folks who have \nbeen in the middle class and are now mortified because they have to go \nask for help at a food bank for the first time in their lives. That is \nnot an unusual situation in my State; people who have always worked, \nwho want to work but find themselves in a situation, because of the \neconomy, they did not create; where they now have to ask that our \ncountry be willing to support them at this time for their families \nuntil we can turn this economy around. Who are we if we are not willing \nto do that as a country?\n  Frankly, I am embarrassed we are having a debate on the floor of the \nSenate about whether to extend help for somebody who has lost their \njob, the bread winner who no longer can bring home the bread versus a \n$100,000 bonus tax cut for a millionaire next year, and whatever it is \nfor billionaires. I find that embarrassing, and I find it more than \nthat, actually. If ever we are going to talk about our values and \npriorities and get them right in terms of what affects the majority of \nAmericans, it ought to be when we are looking at these choices.\n  People in my State want to work. They want us to focus on jobs. They \nwant us to partner with business. They want us to do those things; when \nit is necessary, stand back, get out of the way; stand up and partner, \ndo all of the things that will allow us in a global economy to compete, \nto be able to make things in America and, of course, I prefer they be \nmade in Michigan. But they want jobs. They want the economy to turn \naround.\n  Nobody is out there asking for a handout. They do want us to \nunderstand what they are going through and to be willing to have the \nsame sense of\n\n[[Page S8377]]\n\nurgency about the average family in this country as we did for the Wall \nStreet banks. That is ultimately what we are talking about on this \nfloor, is what the priorities are going to be.\n  Our colleagues have sent a letter, with everybody signing it, saying \nthey are not willing to do anything else. They are not willing to \nextend unemployment benefits. Two million people started losing their \nbenefits yesterday--temporary help, by the way--$250 to $300 a week, \nwhich just barely kind of maybe keeps the heat on, because it is \ngetting cold in Michigan, and a roof over their heads while they are \ndesperately sending resumes out all over the country.\n  I get on planes now with people who are flying all over the country \nbecause they want to work. They are flying all over the place and \ncoming home on the weekends, trying to find work. Our colleagues say: \nWell, you know what. Forget them. They need to wait because the most \nimportant thing is extending the tax cuts for the wealthiest people in \nour country.\n  I happen to--as we all do--know a lot of people in that category who \nsay to me: I am willing to do my share. I am not asking you for this. I \nam willing to do my share. I have done well. I understand we have a \nnational deficit. I understand we have a country that has a lot of \nchallenges right now, and I am willing to step up and do my part. So \nthis is not trying to beat up on people or demagogue against people who \nhave worked hard, in many cases, and done well for themselves. But it \nis about having a set of priorities about what is important. In the few \ndays we have left between now and the end of the year, what is the most \nimportant thing we could be doing?\n  I know other colleagues wish to speak. Let me just say, in my \njudgment, we can create certainty. It certainly doesn't have to be \nextending tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. It certainly can \nbe extending tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses, \ncreating certainty with the R tax credit for those who want to \ninnovate and invest. There are other kinds of certainty we can create \nfor businesses in our Tax Code. We need to do that before the end of \nthe year.\n  We need to remember that there are a whole lot of families right now \nwho are trying to create some certainty in their lives about whether \nthey can put up a Christmas tree because they are still going to have \ntheir house. That is not rhetoric; that is happening to people. We as \nDemocrats are not willing to risk all this. The Republicans may be \nwilling to risk everything to give a bonus tax cut to millionaires and \nbillionaires, but we are fighting for everybody else.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wanted to take some time today to talk \nabout some issues that have been around for a number of years and \nremain unresolved in a way that I believe is very detrimental to our \ncountry and our citizens.\n  There is a lot of discussion these days about deficits and debt at \nthe Federal level. We have a $13 trillion Federal debt and a $1.3 \ntrillion deficit this year. We have a fiscal policy that is in great \ndifficulty. The discussion these days is about extending tax cuts--by \nthe way, none of which is anticipated in the budget numbers that are \nalready unsustainable, showing large debts for the long term. Extending \nall of the tax cuts that were scheduled to expire this year will add $4 \ntrillion to the $13 trillion debt that already exists. The reason I \nmention the fiscal policy issue is, when we talk about debt and \ndeficits, most people talk about the need to cut spending. We also need \nsome additional revenue from those who are not paying their share. But \nwe do need to cut spending.\n  I believe I have held 21 hearings as chairman of the Democratic \nPolicy Committee over recent years--21 separate hearings on the subject \nof waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting in the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Much of it still goes on in terms of the work with the \nPentagon on this contracting issue.\n  I have just received a letter from the inspector general at the \nPentagon, who is looking into one of the issues of the last hearings--\nthe issue of soldiers and contractors who were exposed to sodium \ndichromate, a chemical that was the subject of the movie ``Erin \nBrockovich,'' soldiers who were exposed and not told they were exposed \nto that deadly carcinogen and some of whom have already died. They were \nboth National Guard and Regular Army soldiers.\n  In the context of doing a lot of these hearings, I have discovered \nand I believe that throughout the last decade, we have seen the \ngreatest waste and fraud and abuse in the history of this country. It \nhas contributed immeasurably to this overspending and deficits and \ndebt. I wanted to talk about that work we did, myself and my \ncolleagues, over 21 separate hearings.\n  At one of the hearings we held, we had testimony from a man who, in \nIraq, was responsible for rooting out corruption in the Iraqi \nGovernment. His name was Judge al-Radhi. I have a photograph of Judge \nal-Radhi. He testified in this country. He testified that in his work \nas head of the anticorruption unit in Iraq, he found that $18 billion \nwas missing, most of it American money, most of it coming from the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Just missing. Now, why was he here in the country testifying at a \nhearing I held? Because he got booted out of Iraq, and he got no \nsupport from the U.S. Government as he was booted out of Iraq, and he \nended up in this country. But he is the person who was supposed to be \nrooting out and investigating and prosecuting waste and fraud and \nabuse.\n  His investigations and the investigations of his staff--some of whom \nwere assassinated, some of whose families were killed--show there was \n$18 billion--$18 billion--missing, and most of it was American money. \nWell, that is the story about Judge al-Radhi.\n  We had a hearing early on in this process and talked about the issue \nof contractors and contracting. As you know, in the early part of the \nwar in Iraq and in Afghanistan, money was just shoved out the back door \nof the Pentagon, hiring contractors, very large contracts, in most \ncases no-bid, sole-source contracts.\n  A very courageous woman came to testify before our committee. Her \nname was Bunnatine Greenhouse. She was the highest civilian official at \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, the highest civilian official in the \nPentagon in charge of contracting. Here is what she said. She objected \nto the way the Pentagon was doing these contracts, massive contracts, \nsole-source, a massive amount of money, and she watched as the normal \nprocesses were avoided and ignored. She testified in public:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown & Root represents the \n     most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed \n     during the course of my professional career.\n\n  This is an extraordinary woman, the highest civilian person in the \nArmy Corps of Engineers. She was in charge of contracting. Two master's \ndegrees, came from a family in Louisiana. All three kids have advanced \ndegrees. Her brother, by the way, was one of the 50 top professional \nbasketball players in the last century, Elvin Hayes. Bunnatine \nGreenhouse. Remember that name. A very courageous woman, she saw \nabuses, spoke about it publicly, and for that she lost her career. She \ngave up her career. She was told: Resign or be fired.\n  Let me talk about what she meant when she said the most unbelievable \nabuses she had seen in contracting. I want to do it starting small \nbecause then I am going to talk about billions of dollars.\n  But at one of our hearings, we had a man who kind of looked like a \nbookkeeper at a John Deere dealership in a\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\nsmall town. He was kind of a good old guy with glasses, and he had been \nin charge of purchasing for Kellogg, Brown & Root or Halliburton over \nin Kuwait, purchasing the things our troops needed in Iraq. He came and \ntestified, and he said: You know, as I was purchasing things, I was \ntold by my employer, Halliburton: Don't worry what the cost is, the \ntaxpayer pays for this. This is cost-plus.\n  So he told us a number of examples, big examples, but he brought a \nsmall one that I thought reflected the entire attitude.\n  This is a towel. I ask unanimous consent to show the towel on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a towel. Halliburton was to purchase towels for \nthe troops, hand towels. You know, they were purchasing hand towels to \nbe awarded to the troops. So he ordered some white hand towels for the \ntroops, and his boss said: Well, you can't order those white hand \ntowels. You have to order the hand towels that have the logo of our \ncompany, ``Kellogg, Brown & Root,'' on the hand towel.\n  Mr. Bunting said: Yes, but that would quadruple the cost.\n  His boss said: That doesn't matter. This is a cost-plus contract. \nOrder the towels. Put our company name on them.\n  I mean, this is such a small but important symbol of the behavior \nthat went on for most of the decade that fleeced the American \ntaxpayers.\n  We had a hearing in which we were told by a food service supervisor \nof Kellogg, Brown & Root that Kellogg, Brown & Root charged the Federal \nGovernment for serving 42,000 meals a day to American soldiers but they \nwere only serving 14,000 meals. They were charging the taxpayer for \n42,000 meals--according to this supervisor who was on the ground and \nthen left the company in disgust--they were charging the taxpayers, the \nAmerican Government, for 42,000 meals a day for soldiers and serving \nonly 14,000 meals a day.\n  We had testimony about brand new $85,000 trucks being left on the \nside of the road to be torched because they had a flat tire or a \nplugged fuel pump. Why? Cost-plus. A new truck. Taxpayers will buy \nanother one.\n  There was a company called Custer Battles to which the previous \nadministration and the Pentagon awarded over $100 million in security \ncontracts. We had a man named Frank Willis who came to testify at a \nhearing I held. Frank Willis was a classic example of a guy who went to \nIraq to see if he could do some good and wanted to be helpful to our \ngovernment's effort in Iraq. He showed us a photograph, which I thought \nI had--I think we probably do not--a photograph of $2 million which was \nin the basement of the building in which he worked. They had cash, only \ncash, and their message to contractors in Iraq was, you bring a bag, we \npay cash. And he showed me a photograph of $2 million, hundred-dollar \nbills wrapped in Saran Wrap that he said they occasionally threw around \nthe office as a football--$2 million sitting on the table, American \ntaxpayers' money. By the way, much of that was loaded on pallets and \nflown over to Iraq in C-130s. There were even stories about people \ndispensing hundred-dollar bills out of the back of pickup trucks. So it \nwas.\n  Custer Battles went on to be charged with defrauding the Pentagon, of \nmassive over billing. We had a witness named Robert Isakson who said \nthat Custer Battles had handed in $10 million in fake invoices for \nabout $3 million of work. In one example, the company was charged with \ntaking forklifts that they found--they were to provide security for the \nBaghdad Airport. They took forklifts they found in a building at the \nBaghdad Airport--they received the forklifts for free because they took \nover the security. They got the forklifts, took them someplace, painted \nthem blue, and then sold them back to the U.S. Government.\n  The case against Custer Battles was thrown out of court on procedural \ngrounds, and a new case is now pending, as I understand it, before the \nFourth Circuit.\n  We had testimony before this committee about something called The \nWhale. It is a prison in Khan Bani Saad. I want to show what we have in \nIraq. Our country--that is, the coalition provisional government, which \nwas us; we set it up in Iraq and we ran it--said: We are going to build \na prison in Iraq, Kahn Bani Saad prison.\n  The Iraqis said: We don't want a prison there.\n  We said: We are going to build a prison anyway.\n  So we spent $40 million of American money on this. Two contractors \nended up getting $50 million total, and here is what it looks like \nright now in Iraq. It has never been used, never will be used. The \nIraqis didn't want it. But our country dumped nearly $50 million into \nthis project.\n  You know, the question is, Who is accountable for that? Who is going \nto answer to it? And I have watched now, holding 21 hearings over a \ndecade and finding that very few are held accountable for this kind of \nthing. This prison was built of a scale to house 3,600 inmates. It will \nnever be finished. As you see, you have just a shell of some cinder \nblocks, and the American taxpayers are out about $50 million.\n  We heard from witnesses about the Parsons Corporation, which got a \n$243 million contract to build or repair 150 health clinics in Iraq. \nTwo years later, the money was all gone, and there weren't 150 health \nclinics, there were 20.\n  I had a doctor, a very brave, courageous physician, come to this \ncountry to testify to what he saw of the ones that were completed. \nUnbelievable. So what happened to the money? The American taxpayers \nlost the money. Did this improve the health of the Iraqis?\n  The physician who came to testify said he went to the Minister of \nHealth in Iraq and said to the Minister of Health: Where are those \nclinics, because I am told the Americans have spent $243 million to \nbuild health clinics. Where are the clinics?\n\n  The Iraqi Health Minister said: Well, most of them are imaginary \nclinics.\n  Yes, but the money was not imaginary. The American taxpayers' money \nis gone.\n  We had several hearings on the issue of Kellogg, Brown & Root. And I \nmention them because they got the biggest contract, sole-source \ncontract. That is why they are the ones that are mentioned the most. \nThey were providing water treatment to the military facilities in Iraq. \nSo our solders are in military camps in Iraq, and KBR gets the water \ntreatment contract. It turns out that the nonpotable water they were \nproviding to soldiers in the camps that we had a hearing on was more \ncontaminated than raw water from the Euphrates River.\n  We actually had, from a whistleblower, the internal memorandum from \nKellogg, Brown & Root, by the guy who was in charge of the water \ncontract in Iraq, and in his memorandum, he said this was a near miss. \nIt could have caused mass sickness or death. But publicly, they said it \ndidn't happen. The Defense Department said it did not happen. But it \ndid happen, and I asked the inspector general to investigate it. He \ndid. He did a report and said that both the Defense Department and \nKellogg, Brown & Root were wrong. It did happen, in fact. That kind of \ncontaminated water was being served to the troops because the contract \nwas a contract that was not provided for appropriately by the company. \nThe company was taking the money and not doing what it was supposed to \ndo with the water.\n  By the way, in the middle of these hearings, while the Department of \nDefense, Department of the Army, as well as Kellogg, Brown & Root were \ndenying it all, I got an e-mail here in the Senate from an Army doctor, \na captain, and she wrote to me and said: I am a physician in the camp. \nI had my lieutenant follow the water line to find out what was \nhappening because I had patients here who showed that they were \nsuffering diseases and suffering problems as a result of contaminated \nwater.\n  So that came from the physician who was in Iraq on the ground.\n  So despite all of the denials, the inspector general finally issued a \nreport saying: No, no, the Defense Department was wrong, as was \nKellogg, Brown & Root. A contract to provide water to these soldiers \nacross Iraq at the Army camps was not being appropriately handled, and \nvery contaminated water was going to those camps.\n  The list is almost endless. I know there is a photograph I have shown \non\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\nthe floor previously because it is another contract to provide \nelectrical capabilities to the Army camps. When you put up an Army \ncamp, you have the need to provide electricity. And I held two hearings \non this subject.\n  This is a photograph of SGT Ryan Maseth--quite a remarkable young \nman, a Green Beret from Pennsylvania. He is shown there with his \nmother, who is a very courageous woman as well. He was killed in Iraq, \nbut Sergeant Maseth wasn't killed by a bullet from an enemy gun; \nSergeant Maseth was killed taking a shower. He was electrocuted in a \nshower. And it wasn't just Sergeant Maseth; others lost their lives as \nwell--electrocuted in a shower, power-washing a Jeep.\n  The fact is, what we discovered when we held the hearings was that \nthe work that was done to provide electricity and to wire these camps \nwas done in some cases by people who didn't have the foggiest idea what \nthey were doing. Third-country nationals who couldn't speak English and \ndidn't know the first thing about electricity were working on these \nissues.\n  The Army originally told Mrs. Maseth that her son died, they thought, \nbecause he took an electrical appliance into the shower. No, he didn't. \nHe was killed because shoddy electrical work was done that ended up \nkilling this soldier.\n  Now, Kellogg, Brown & Root denied that, as did the Defense \nDepartment. The inspector general did the report and said: Oh, yeah. \nYeah, that sure did happen.\n  In fact, let me show you what the inspector general has said.\n  This is from Jim Childs, master electrician hired by the Army Corps \nof Engineers, to inspect this electrical work for which the American \ntaxpayer paid a bundle. Jim Childs, master electrician, went in after I \nheld the hearings. He said:\n\n       [T]he electrical work performed by KBR in Iraq was some of \n     the most hazardous, worst quality work I have ever inspected.\n\n  Let me show what Kellogg, Brown & Root said:\n\n       The assertion that KBR has a track record of shoddy \n     electrical work is simply unfounded.\n\n  The inspector general did the inspection. We had to redo much of the \nwork in Iraq and Afghanistan, inspect it all and redo much of it. In \nthe meantime, people died. We have demonstrated that there is evidence \nof shoddy work in a range of areas. Yet the contractors continue to be \ngiven additional contracts. For the shoddy electrical work for which \nsome soldiers gave their lives, this contractor was not only given the \nmoney from the contract but bonus awards for excellent work. I have \ntried very hard to get the Pentagon to take back those bonuses, \nunsuccessfully. But the reason I am going through this is to point out \nthat we have for a decade now been shoveling money out the door at a \ntime when we are deep in debt, spending a great deal of money on the \ndefense of this country, on the Defense Department, on the war effort, \nand so on. A substantial portion of that which goes out the back of the \nPentagon in the form of contracts has represented the most egregious \nwaste in the history of the country.\n  One of my great regrets is that we did not--and we should have; I \ntried very hard--ever get constituted a Truman-type committee which \nexisted in the 1940s to investigate this sort of spending and to try to \nshut down spending that is not only injuring our troops and disserving \nthem but injuring taxpayers.\n  I started by talking about the issue of sodium dichromate. We think \nabout 1,000 soldiers were at risk at a place in Iraq that is called \nQarmat Ali. Some have died. Those soldiers who were at Qarmat Ali told \nof seeing something like sand blowing all over the place. It was red, \nhowever. That was the sodium diechromate, a deadly carcinogen. It is \nthe subject over which a movie was made called ``Erin Brockovich.''\n  We have tried for a long time to get the Pentagon to be as active and \ninvolved as they should be with respect to the health and safety of \nthose 1,000 soldiers who were potentially exposed. Like most of these \nissues, they have been very slow to respond.\n  My point is twofold. One is about supporting America's fighting men \nand women, doing what is right for them. There have been a number of \npeople in the Pentagon--one of whom testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee in the Senate and who I strongly believe knew he was not \ntelling the truth. He was a general, as a matter of fact. There have \nbeen a number who have denied virtually all of these circumstances. Yet \ninspectors general have investigated and said they are wrong.\n  Obviously, the contractor denies these things. The contractors have \ngotten wealthy doing this. We have had whistleblowers come in. A woman \ncame in and told us she was working at a recreational facility in the \nwar theater, and that is at the base. There is a facility where you can \nplay pool and ping-pong and do various things. It was a facility with \nmany different rooms. She worked for Kellogg, Brown & Root and she was \nto keep track of how many people came in because they got paid based on \nhow many people came in.\n  She said: What they told me to do was to keep track of how many \npeople came in to each room, and that is what we billed the government \nfor. If somebody came in and went through three rooms, the government \nwas billed for three visits. I went to the people in charge and said: \nThis is fraud. We can't do this. We are defrauding the government. They \nimmediately put me in detention in a room under guard and sent me out \nof the country the next day.\n  It is the story of virtually all the hearings we have held.\n  The point is twofold. One is to protect America's soldiers and do \nright by the men and women who have gone to war because this country \nasked them to. Secondly, on behalf of the American taxpayer, to decide \nif we are choking on debt and deficit, to continue doing what we know \nis wrong, shoveling these contracts out the door without adequate \naccountability is something we have to pay attention to.\n  Secretary Gates has tried more than others. When I began these \nhearings, which stretched into 21 hearings, the then-Secretary of \nDefense had virtually no time for these issues. I have had an \nopportunity to talk to Secretary Gates. I know he has tried very hard \nto make changes. Moving the Pentagon on these issues is very difficult. \nThere is a relationship always between the Pentagon and the largest \nsuppliers and largest companies and contractors with whom they do \nbusiness. My experience has been we can have the goods and have them \nred-handed. We can have internal memorandum from the company itself \nthat says they screwed up, could have caused mass sickness and death, \nbut publicly they will say none of this happened. It is about \ndeception, about lying, about cheating taxpayers, and about not \nstanding up the way we should stand up for America's fighting men and \nwomen. This Congress needs to do much more. Congress needs much \nstronger oversight, much more attentive oversight on this kind of \nspending.\n  I went back and read the Truman committee work. Harry Truman was a \nSenator. At a time when a President of his own party was in the White \nHouse, he insisted that they establish the Truman Commission, of which \nhe became chairman. He insisted on getting a committee to investigate \nwaste in the Pentagon. They eventually created the committee, and they \nmade him chairman. They held 60 hearings a year for 7 years. The \ncommittee was started with $16,000. In today's dollars, it saved $16 \nbillion. Think of that. There is way too little oversight going on on \nthese issues. I have just scratched the surface in the 21 hearings I \nchaired. Many of my colleagues were in those hearings. This country \ndeserves better.\n  One of the significant responsibilities of Congress is not just to \nappropriate money and evaluate what money needs to be appropriated for \nbut to do oversight. When we send money out the door, this Congress \nneeds to do better oversight. What I have discovered and decided is \nthat oversight is sadly lacking at the Pentagon. There are too many men \nand women, including Bunnatine Greenhouse, who gave up their careers \nand lost their jobs because they had the courage to speak out and say: \nThis is wrong, this is fraud, this is cheating, this undermines our \nsoldiers. There are too many men and women who gave up their careers \nbecause they had the courage to do that. We have whistleblower \nprotections, but in many cases it doesn't work the way it should. There \nis much for us to do.\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\n  I will not be chairing additional hearings because my 30 years in the \nCongress will be done at the end of this month. It has been a great \nprivilege to be here. But as one can tell, I believe passionately in \nthis issue, about our Federal deficits, about spending, about \naccountability, but most especially about doing things that support the \nsoldiers we ask to go to war.\n  This has been an abysmal record. In this decade, the amount of money \nspent on contractors--in many cases with no-bid, sole-source contracts \nthat were negotiated under the most abusive conditions and in \nviolation, in many cases, of rules, according to the highest civilian \nofficial in charge of contracting--has been a disgrace. This country \nneeds to do much better.\n  The work I and a number of my colleagues did holding these hearings \nhas in many ways held up a spotlight and tried to shine it on the same \nspot. We have cajoled, embarrassed, and pushed, and I think we have \nmade some progress. But so much more needs to be done and can be done. \nMy hope is this work will continue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8380-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8380-S8381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXTENDING TAX CUTS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, unless Congress acts, this new year \nwill begin with the imposition of an onerous new tax burden for \nAmerican families. They will face an automatic tax increase of nearly \n$2.7 trillion--one of the largest tax increases in history--when the \n2001 and 2003 tax laws expire.\n  This tax increase will hit all American earners regardless of their \nincome level and regardless of whether they are married or single, \nretired or working or salaried or hourly employees.\n  It is my judgment that the 2001 and 2003 tax relief laws should be \nextended for all Americans. With the economy still weak, and with \nunemployment persisting at nearly 10 percent, now is not the time to be \nraising taxes on anyone.\n  Some argue that Americans in the higher tax brackets should not be \nprotected from this tax increase. But that argument for higher taxes \ncome January 1 ignores the fact that a tax increase on top earners is a \ntax increase on small businesses and, thus, a tax on jobs at a time \nwhen we should be doing everything possible to stimulate the creation \nof more jobs.\n  As you are aware, most small businesses are passthrough entities. \nThey are sole proprietorships, partnerships or S corporations that must \nreport their earnings on their owners' individual tax returns. \nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, there are some 750,000 \npassthrough small businesses in the top two tax brackets. Higher taxes \nhurt these small companies by taking away capital they need to grow and \nto add jobs.\n  In Maine, there are numerous small businesses that would be hurt by \nthis tax increase. One is D Machine Products, a precision design \nmachining and fabrication operation located in Westbrook, ME. Founded \nin 1967, this company now has more than 130 highly skilled and \ndedicated employees. When I visited this company in August, the owner, \nDuane Gushee, expressed to me his concerns about the impact higher \ntaxes would have on his growing business. He explained that D \ncompetes with companies all over the world for markets and customers. \nWithout constant innovation and investment in cutting-edge technology, \nD would lose its customers and the jobs of its employees would be in \njeopardy. The tax increase that would go into effect unless we act \nwould hit D on January 1 and would take money out of its bottom \nline--money that is needed to upgrade its equipment and stay ahead of \nforeign competition.\n  Another business that would be hit hard is Pottle's Transportation, a \ntrucking company headquartered in Hermon, ME. This company was founded \nin 1972 and now has more than 200 employees with 150 trucks.\n  Barry Pottle, who runs this business, tells me that Pottle's needs to \npurchase 25 to 30 trucks every year just to maintain its fleet. New \ntrucks used to cost the company about $100,000. But in the past few \nyears, the cost has escalated by another $25,000. The tax increase \nscheduled for January 1 would make it difficult, if not impossible, for \nBarry to make these investments.\n  Other Maine businesses have come forward to highlight the impact a \ntax increase would have on their ability to grow their businesses and \nto add much needed jobs.\n  One of these is Allagash Brewing Company, a craft brewery located in \nPortland, ME. Founded in 1994, Allagash has grown to 28 employees and \nhas established a reputation for uncompromising quality as one of the \nfinest producers of Belgian-style beers in North America.\n  Similar to most small businesses, Allagash relies on its retained \nearnings to finance investment and growth. As Rob Tod, the co-owner of \nAllagash puts it:\n\n       There's plenty of demand for our product, but we can't fill \n     demand without equipment, and we can't buy equipment without \n     money.\n\n  When small businesses cannot invest and grow, they cannot add jobs, \nand that is what our focus needs to be on: the creation of policies \nthat will help the private sector to create jobs.\n  Rob estimates that every 1 percent increase in Allagash's tax rate \nmeans one fewer worker for 5 full years. Stated another way, the tax \nincrease slated to occur on January 1 would wipe out jobs for five \nworkers for 5 years just at this one brewery. If that is the impact at \none small business in Portland, ME, imagine what the impact would be on \njobs lost nationwide.\n  Other small businesses in my home State have expressed their \nfrustration at the uncertainty Washington is creating by leaving these \ntax hikes hanging over their heads. As one small business starkly put \nit to me:\n\n       The increases in personal taxes reduce the amount of money \n     I have available for investments of all kinds. I am not \n     investing in my business. I am not hiring workers. I am not \n     considering starting anything new. I am waiting. There is no \n     way to know what Washington is about to do to me, but I \n     expect it will be nasty and brutally unfair. In response, I \n     am holding my ground and preparing for the worst.\n\n  That is an exact quote from an entrepreneur in my State. As if the \ntestimony of these small businesses were not enough, there is a second \nreason to support extending the 2001 and 2003 tax relief for all \nAmericans: A tax increase at this time on top earners would reduce \nconsumer spending dramatically, cutting demand, and costing jobs at a \ntime when our fragile economy can least afford it.\n  We have only to look at Peter Orszag's column in the New York Times--\nhe was President Obama's former Budget Director--to underscore this \npoint. He wrote that failing to extend the existing tax relief would \n``make an already stagnating job market worse.'' He then went on to \nsay:\n\n       Higher taxes now would crimp consumer spending, further \n     depressing the already inadequate demand for what firms are \n     capable of producing at full tilt.\n\n  Mr. Orszag is not alone in this view. Economist Mark Zandi has \nestimated that raising taxes on top earners would cost us 770,000 jobs \nand four-tenths of 1 percent of our GDP over the next 2 years. He \ncautions that earners in the top brackets are responsible for ``one \nfourth of all [U.S.] Personal outlays,'' and that a pullback in \nspending by these taxpayers could ``derail the recovery.''\n  In light of this risk, Mr. Zandi has called the President's plan to \nraise taxes an ``unnecessary gamble.'' Mr. Zandi suggests that a middle \nground where no one's taxes are increased until the recovery is firmly \nin place is where we should go.\n  That is essentially what I recommended to this body in September. I \nurged the Senate to take up legislation to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief for 2 more years. That is a middle ground. Surely, we ought to \nbe able to come together and embrace that compromise. That will get us \nthrough the recession. It will send a strong signal to the business \ncommunity to invest and create jobs. It would remove the uncertainty.\n  Here is my suggestion for what we should do during that 2-year \nperiod, since I see my colleague, Senator Wyden, on the floor. During \nthat time we could undertake comprehensive tax\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\nreform to make our system fairer, simpler, and more progrowth. I know \nthat has been a passion of Senator Wyden's for some time. That is what \nwe could use those 2 years to work on.\n  So I am once again going to ask my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle--there are some on this side who want to make all the relief from \nthe 2001, 2003 laws permanent; there are some on the other side of the \naisle who want to increase taxes for the top two rates and just extend \nthe tax relief for those making up to $250,000--let's instead extend \nthe tax relief for everyone right now for 2 more years, remove the \nuncertainty, encourage businesses to create new jobs, stop penalizing \nsmall businesses, do not put a damper on consumer spending at the worst \npossible time, and then let's use those 2 years productively to rewrite \nthe Tax Code, to make it simpler, fairer, and more progrowth.\n  I think that is a reasonable plan. Let's abandon any approach of \nraising taxes at this critical time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8381-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8381-S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX REFORM\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before she leaves the floor, let me say \nto the Senator from Maine that I very much appreciate her thoughtful \nviews. She continually talks about the desire to get folks to come \ntogether. I think there are a variety of ways to do it. That is \nessentially what I was going to outline this afternoon. I just want to \nassure my good friend from Maine that I am very much looking forward to \nworking with her on this issue and thank her again for her kind \nremarks.\n  Madam President and colleagues, I think we have a choice.\n  We can continue to have this debate at the margins about how to \nextend a thoroughly discredited, insanely complicated, job-killing \nsystem that we have today or we can find a way, as Democrats and \nPresident Reagan did back in the 1980s, to come together and put in \nplace a reform system that will create, in my view, millions of good-\npaying, new jobs, the way Democrats and Republicans in the 1980s came \ntogether and created more than 16 million new jobs.\n  To pick up on this discussion, I think there is a message for \nDemocrats and Republicans together on this issue.\n  This question of extending the 2001 and 2003 tax legislation has \nalmost become a tax version of ``The Emperor Has No Clothes.'' We all \nknow this story and have read it to our kids. It's about two swindlers \nspinning a tall tail about magical, invisible cloth. The emperor and \nhis ministers and all of his subjects get so caught up in the story of \nthe magical and invisible cloth that it takes a child to point out what \neverybody should have seen was obvious: The emperor has no clothes.\n  The fact is, when we look at extending the 2001-2003 tax laws, what \nwe will see at the end of the day is from the standpoint of creating \ngood-paying jobs and the opportunity to grow the economy, the emperor \nreally doesn't have any clothes. The numbers don't add up.\n  When tax policy was partisan between 2001 and 2008, there was only \n2.3 percent payroll expansion, 3 million new jobs, and real median \nincome fell by 5 percent. Yet that is what we are hearing on the floor \nof the Senate ought to be extended.\n  I say to my good friend from Pennsylvania, his State, as has mine, \nhas been pounded by this economy. How can we explain to our \nconstituents that we are extending a policy that based on the facts, \nnot on political rhetoric, produced such anemic payroll expansion, such \na modest number of new jobs, and a loss of real median income. I don't \nthink we can explain it to folks in Pennsylvania and Oregon.\n  What I do think we can explain that gets us away from this ``Emperor \nHas No Clothes'' situation is what happened in the 1980s when a big \ngroup of Democrats and Republicans came together and changed the \ndiscussion about taxes. Instead of Democrats and Republicans beating up \non each other, it became the people against the special interests and, \nin effect, leading Democrats such as Dick Gephardt and Dan Rostenkowski \nand others joined with the President to point out the inequities. And \nwe had Democrats then talking about the desire to make sure companies--\ncompanies that hire people at good wages--would be in a position to \nbenefit because they would be paying rates that would be competitive in \ntough global markets.\n  There are opportunities--because I have been talking to folks in \nlabor and folks in business--to do this. Why don't we take away the tax \nbreaks for shipping jobs overseas and use that money to lower rates for \nfolks who manufacture in the United States, who create good-paying jobs \nin hard-hit parts of Pennsylvania and Oregon. I would like to see our \ncompanies have a new incentive for green manufacturing which many of \nthe companies in Oregon want to do. To do it, why not take away some of \nthose tax breaks you get from what is called tax deferral and foreign \ntax credits and use that money to create more employment at home? We \nare not going to be able to do that if we just reup for this \ndiscredited, broken, insanely complicated tax system.\n  Now, I have said to colleagues--and Senator Casey and a number of us \nhave talked about it--that if it takes some very short-term extension \nof current law in order to make sure we don't hurt middle-class people \nand we don't hamper economic growth, I would be willing to look at it. \nI would be willing to look at that if we use the opportunity to then \naggressively pursue bipartisan tax reform; tax reform, for example, \nthat would do something about a Tax Code that nobody likes.\n  This isn't like the health care issue. I think the Presiding Officer \nand my friend from Pennsylvania understand that part of what happened \nin the health care issue is a lot of folks said: I want to fix health \ncare, I want to contain costs, but I sort of like the health care I \nhave. There isn't anybody on the planet I can find who makes an \nargument that they like the current Tax Code.\n  We spend 7.6 billion hours a year to comply with tax law. It costs us \nalmost $200 billion to comply with our tax laws annually. That is the \nequivalent of 3.8 million people working full-time just to comply with \nthe Tax Code. At one point in the tax reform discussions, after I got \non the Finance Committee, I brought just a portion of the books that \ncontain the provisions of the Tax Code. And there are thousands of \npages. In fact, we add thousands of pages every few years. I am 6 feet \n4 inches and just a portion of the books are taller than me. The \ncomplexity of the code increases exponentially, as Nina Olson, who is \nthe Taxpayer Advocate at the Internal Revenue Service, has pointed out.\n  So I offer this up--and I know my colleague is waiting to speak--only \nto say if we are asking the country to choose--and that is why I use \nthis ``Emperor Has No Clothes'' analogy--between something we know \nhasn't worked--I would note, for example, that the Wall Street Journal, \nnot exactly hostile to conservatives, pointed out that George W. Bush \nhad ``the worst track record on record for job creation.''\n  How do you make the case to the American people, whether you are in \nPennsylvania or Oregon or anywhere else, that you want to anchor them \nto the same discredited tax system that has failed to create jobs for \nthe entire period in which it was in effect?\n  So I hope as we get into this debate we look at the fact that perhaps \nwe are having the wrong conversation. Perhaps we are having the wrong \nconversation in just debating extending the 2001-2003 tax provisions--\nmaybe we will extend them for some people and we will not extend them \nfor other people. What we ought to be saying is, look at history. Look \nat what happened in the 1980s when Democrats and Republicans came \ntogether. In fact, back then there was almost a mirror image of what we \nhave now.\n  Back in the 1980s we had a Republican President and a Republican \nSenate, and Democrats in the House. So we have today almost a mirror \nimage of that, and we know when they got together in the 1980s that it \ncreated millions of new jobs, millions of good-paying jobs. I think we \ncan do that again.\n  I want to spend 2011 working with my colleagues--the Senator from \nPennsylvania, the Senator from New Hampshire, and Senator Collins, who \ngave a very eloquent statement on the advantages of real tax reform--I \nwant to spend the next year working with colleagues on something that \nshows vastly more promise for creating more\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\ngood-paying jobs and economic opportunity than these choices we are \ntalking about on the floor of the Senate that, in my view, literally \nyoke us to a system that we know is not going to produce jobs.\n  It would be one thing if the debate was in question; that maybe the \nnumbers from the 1980s were a little ambiguous, and when tax policy was \npartisan between 2001 and 2008 the numbers were more encouraging. That \nis not the picture. The picture is crystal clear. When we went at tax \nreform in a bipartisan way in the 1980s with a Democratic effort in the \nCongress and a Republican President, big win: 16 million new jobs. When \nwe got partisan with taxes in 2001 and 2008, we just went downhill to \ntruly anemic economic growth. The country deserves better.\n  I would finally say I think this is exactly the kind of bipartisan \nwork that the country was calling for at this last election. Why not \ngive it to them rather than serve up yet more that is seen as \npolarizing and divisive when our country is undergoing such economic \nanguish.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, thank you very much. First of all, I wish \nto commend the remarks our colleague from Oregon made. He has great \ninsight into our Tax Code. I think he has reminded us yet again we have \na lot of work to do, and we are grateful for his comments today and his \ncharge to us--that we have a good deal of work in 2011 and even as we \nwrap up 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8382-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8382-S8383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about unemployment \ninsurance, and I will be brief. At the end of my remarks I will be \noffering a unanimous consent request.\n  First of all, I wish to cite a study just released today by the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers.\n  I commend to my colleagues this report entitled ``The Economic Impact \nof Recent Temporary Unemployment Insurance Extensions'' dated December \n2, a report by the Executive Office of the President and the Council of \nEconomic Advisers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Executive Summary of the report be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CASEY. This report released today had a number of findings: First \nof all, that the emergency expansion of unemployment insurance programs \nin 2007 has benefited 40 million people in the United States of America \nwho have either received or lived with a recipient of these programs. \nThis figure includes 10.5 million children.\n  In line with other studies that have been released, this report by \nthe Council of Economic Advisers states that there are 800,000 more \njobs and GDP is 0.8 percent higher because of the expansion of \nunemployment insurance programs. Without reauthorization through 2011, \nthe one we are debating today in the Senate, at this time next year, in \nDecember of 2011, there will be 600,000 less jobs and GDP will be 0.6 \npercent lower. So there are real consequences to the denial of this \nreauthorization going forward.\n  To give my colleagues a sense of what that means in a State such as \nPennsylvania, without reauthorization of these programs, 353,989 people \nwill lose unemployment insurance coverage by November of 2011. The \nPennsylvania economy will be severely impacted without reauthorization. \nAccording to the Council of Economic Advisers, there will be 31,228 \nless jobs in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania if we do not reauthorize \nunemployment insurance.\n  Just to put that in perspective, in the first three quarters of this \nyear, in the midst of a recovery--slow recovery but a recovery \nnonetheless--our State has gone from losing jobs in 2009 to gaining \njobs. In the first three quarters of the year, we have gained roughly \n48,000 jobs. Without unemployment insurance, we stand to lose, as I \nsaid, more than 31,000 of those jobs.\n  We know the unemployment rate of 9.6 percent nationally means nearly \n15 million people are out of work. If you are opposed to this \nreauthorization, you have to come up with another answer. You can't \njust say to 15 million people: Well, we couldn't get it done, or things \ninterfered in Washington.\n  In our State, fortunately, we are lower than 9.6. We are 8.8, \npercent. But 8.8 percent in Pennsylvania means that 560,000 people are \nout of work. It ballooned up to over 590,000 this summer, but \nfortunately that has been coming down over the last couple of months \nand, of course, we want to keep it moving in that direction.\n  Let me just conclude with this thought: For the past six decades, \nCongress has provided federally funded unemployment insurance benefits. \nDuring every recession, the Congress has done that, and thank goodness \nthey did. Finally, without this reauthorization in our State of \nPennsylvania, 83,000 Pennsylvanians will exhaust their benefits this \nmonth. Of course, across the country, it is some 2 million.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    The Economic Impact of Recent Temporary Unemployment Insurance \n                               Extensions\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       Unemployment insurance (UI) provides a safety net for \n     workers who have lost a job through no fault of their own, as \n     long as they continue to search for new employment. During \n     normal economic conditions, firms pay into state insurance \n     systems that replace roughly half of the average individual's \n     lost earnings, up to 26 weeks. However, the federal \n     government historically funds additional weeks of benefits in \n     response to an economic downturn. The benefits allow \n     recipients to continue to support their families while \n     searching for their next job.\n       In response to the recession that began in December 2007, \n     Congress expanded UI benefits by creating Emergency \n     Unemployment Compensation (EUC) and 100 percent federal \n     funding of Extended Benefits (EB). These programs provide UI \n     benefits after a worker exhausts state benefits, helping when \n     it takes longer to find a job, such as in this severe \n     downturn. These extensions began to expire on November 30, \n     2010. In this report, the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) \n     examines the effects of the extensions thus far and the \n     potential impact on the economy if Congress fails to act soon \n     to continue these emergency measures.\n       As a result of these emergency expansions to UI:\n       EUC and EB have helped 14 million unemployed workers as of \n     October 2010. As of that date, there were almost 5 million \n     unemployed workers benefiting from these programs each week.\n       In total, these programs have benefited about 40 million \n     people who have received, or lived with a recipient of, EUC \n     or EB. This total includes 10.5 million children.\n       If these measures are not extended, the maximum eligibility \n     for benefits in most states will revert to the pre-\n     recessionary level of 26 weeks. The Department of Labor \n     estimates that, relative to a month-long extension, 2 million \n     unemployed workers will lose coverage in December 2010. And, \n     relative to a year-long extension, nearly 7 million \n     unemployed workers in total will lose coverage by November \n     2011.\n       Further, EUC and EB make up a substantial portion of \n     household income. Without EUC and EB, the typical household \n     receiving these benefits will see their income fall by a \n     third. In the 42 percent of households where the EUC or EB \n     recipient is the sole wage-earner, 90 percent of income will \n     be lost.\n       This important income replacement allows individuals that \n     have suffered from job loss to avoid a dramatic drop in their \n     spending levels. Research studies have documented that UI is \n     an extremely effective form of support for the economy \n     relative to other government programs, both in terms of bang-\n     for-the-buck and timeliness. EUC and EB recipients spend \n     their benefit checks, rather than saving them, and a drop in \n     this income will translate into a sizeable drop in aggregate \n     spending.\n       Specifically, CEA estimates that:\n       Employment was about 800,000 higher, and the level of GDP \n     0.8 percent higher, in September 2010 than would have been \n     the case without EUC and EB.\n       Without an extension, employment would be about 600,000 \n     lower, and GDP 0.6 percent lower, in December 2011 than if a \n     year-long extension were passed.\n       Previously, Congress continued federal expansions of UI \n     until the economy was much further along the road to \n     recovery. With 10 consecutive months of private sector job \n     growth and half a percentage point drop in the unemployment \n     rate since its peak, the economy is beginning to recover. \n     However, the unemployment rate remains at 9.6 percent and \n     there are still 5 job seekers for every job opening. For the \n     last half-century, Congress has consistently extended UI \n     benefits when economic circumstances substantially increased \n     the difficulty of finding a job. Given the current labor \n     market conditions, failing to continue UI extensions now \n     would be unprecedented.\n\n\n                            I. INTRODUCTION\n\n       As a form of insurance against job loss, employers pay \n     taxes into state government unemployment systems at rates \n     based, in part, on past usage of the system. State \n     governments then provide weekly payments of $300, on average, \n     to workers who have lost a\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\n     job through no fault of their own, replacing roughly half of \n     an individual's lost earnings. Typically, unemployed workers \n     can receive up to 26 weeks of benefits, as long as they \n     continue to search for work. In an economy with normal labor \n     demand, one would expect most unemployed workers to find a \n     job within this time frame. However, in December 2007 the \n     United States began to slide into a deep recession. By \n     October 2009, the unemployment rate was 10.1 percent, and \n     there were more than 6 jobs seekers for every job opening, \n     compared to just 1.5 prior to the recession.\n       Recognizing that unemployed workers would have a \n     significantly harder time finding jobs, Congress created \n     Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008 (EUC) in June of \n     that year. This swift action put unemployment benefits in \n     place much earlier than has been done in previous \n     recessions--almost one year before GDP stopped declining. \n     These early efforts by Congress resulted in UI playing a \n     greater role in stabilizing the economy, as suggested in a \n     recent Department of Labor report.\n       As the labor market worsened, Congress further extended and \n     expanded the program, particularly for unemployed workers in \n     the hardest-hit states. As part of the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act, Congress provided for 100 percent federal \n     funding of Extended Benefits (EB), a program usually funded \n     jointly by the state and federal governments. Individuals are \n     eligible for EB once they exhaust their EUC benefits if their \n     state meets certain unemployment-based triggers. All told, an \n     unemployed worker could receive up to 99 weeks of coverage in \n     those states with the highest rates of unemployment. (See the \n     Appendix for more detail on these programs.)\n       Importantly, the current tiered structure of EUC and EB \n     allows for a natural phasing down of coverage as economic \n     conditions improve. Many of the eligible weeks of benefits \n     are determined at the state level by thresholds based on \n     states' unemployment rates; the maximum length of coverage \n     provided by these federal programs is shorter in states with \n     better economies. Beyond this natural phase down, however, \n     the legislation authorizing these programs began to expire on \n     November 30, 2010 and the millions of Americans receiving \n     coverage through these programs have already begun losing \n     benefits.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3981\n\n  Mr. CASEY. So with that, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3981, a bill \nto provide for a temporary extension of unemployment insurance \nprovisions; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; and any statements related to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, because \nthe Republicans want to extend unemployment benefits without increasing \nthe deficits, would the Senator agree to include an amendment proposed \nby Senator Brown that would offset the cost of the bill with unspent \nFederal funds, the text of which is at the desk?\n  Mr. CASEY. I would not. I object to that for the simple reason that \nthe construction of that amendment involves dollars already allocated \nto Federal programs across the board. Although the money has not been \nspent yet, it has been allocated. If there is a concern, as there seems \nto be--and I would categorize it as an alleged concern--about the \ndeficit, there doesn't seem to be the same concern about running up the \ndeficit not by billions but by hundreds of billions to extend tax cuts \nto Americans above the $250,000 income tax bracket. So if there is that \nconcern about the deficits, I wish that logic and concern was applied \nto the tax cut debate.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Further reserving the right to object, first of all, I \nwould love to offset the tax cuts with spending reductions in areas \nacross the board because I think the deficit is a problem. Because the \nSenator from Pennsylvania just wants to increase the deficit with \nunemployment benefits, without offsetting it, without spending cuts, I \nam forced to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, since yesterday, we have witnessed in \nthis Chamber the resumption of a set of tired and worn out taking \npoints that the Democratic side drags out whenever they are forced to \nfinally get around to discussing tax policy.\n  Well, once again beating the same dead horse, the other side has \nattempted to go back in time again and talk about fiscal history. \nEarlier this week, there has been a lot of revision or perhaps editing \nof recent budget history. I expect more of it in the future days.\n  The revisionist history basically boils down to two conclusions. \nFirst, that all of the ``good'' fiscal history of the 1990s was derived \nfrom a partisan tax increase bill in 1993, and, two, that all the bad \nfiscal history of this decade to date is attributable to bipartisan tax \nrelief plans.\n  Not surprisingly, nearly all of the revisionists who spoke generally \noppose tax relief and support spending increases. The same crew \ngenerally supports spending increases and opposes spending cuts.\n  For this debate, it is important to be aware of some key facts. The \nstimulus bill passed by the Senate, with interest included, increased \nthe deficit by over $1 trillion. The stimulus bill was a heavy stew of \nspending increases and refundable tax credits seasoned with small \npieces of tax relief.\n  The bill passed by the Senate had new temporary spending that, if \nmade permanent, will burden future budget deficits by over $2.5 \ntrillion. Now, that is not this Senate Republican speaking; it is the \nofficial congressional scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office. In \nfact, the deficit effects of the stimulus bill passed within a short \ntime after the Democrats assumed full control of the Federal Government \nroughly exceeded the deficit impact of 8 years of bipartisan tax \nrelief. You can see that very clearly right here.\n  The tax relief over here, and the stimulus bill here--all of this \noccurred in an environment where the automatic economic stabilizers, \nthankfully, kicked in to help the most unfortunate in America with \nunemployment insurance, increased amounts of food stamps, and other \nbenefits.\n  That antirecessionary spending, together with lower tax receipts and \nthe bailout activities, set a fiscal table of a deficit of $1.4 \ntrillion. That was the highest deficit as a percentage of the economy \nin post-World War II history. You can see that right here.\n  From the perspective of those on the Republican side, this debate \nseems to be a strategy to divert, through a twisted blame game, from \nthe facts before us. How is the history a history of revision? I would \nlike to take each conclusion one by one.\n  The first conclusion is that all of the good fiscal history was \nderived from the 1993 tax increases. To test that assertion, all you \nhave to do is take a look at data from the Clinton administration. The \nmuch ballyhooed 1993 partisan tax increase accounts for 13 percent of \nthe deficit reduction in the 1990s, 13 percent. That 13-percent figure \nwas calculated by the Clinton administration Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  The biggest source of deficit reduction, 35 percent, came from a \nreduction in defense spending. Of course, that fiscal benefit \noriginated from President Reagan's stare-down of the Communist regime \nin Russia. The same folks on that side who opposed President Reagan's \ndefense build-up somehow seem to take credit for the fiscal benefit of \nthe peace dividend.\n  The next biggest source of the deficit reduction, 32 percent, came \nfrom other revenue. Basically this was the fiscal benefit from the pro-\ngrowth policies such as the bipartisan capital gains tax cuts of 1997 \nand the free trade agreements that President Clinton, with Republican \nvotes, got passed.\n  The savings from the policies I pointed out translated to interest \nsavings. Interest savings account for 15 percent of the deficit \nreduction. Now, for all of the chest thumping about the 1990s, the \nchest thumpers who pushed for big social spending, did not bring much \nto the deficit reduction tables in the 1990s. Their contribution was \nthis, 5 percent.\n  What is more, the fiscal revision historians in this body tend to \nforget who the players were. They are correct that there was a \nDemocratic President in\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\nthe White House, but they conveniently forget that Republicans \ncontrolled the Congress for the period where the deficit came down and \neventually turned into a surplus.\n  They tend to forget they fought the principle of a balanced budget \nthat was the centerpiece of Republican fiscal policy.\n  Remember, the government shutdowns of late 1995? Remember what that \nwas all about? It was about a plan to balance the budget.\n  We are consistently reminded of the political price paid by the other \nside for the record tax increases they put into law in 1993. \nRepublicans played a political price for forcing the balanced budget \nissue in 1996. But as we found out in 1997, President Clinton agreed. \nRecall as well all through the 1990s what the year-end battles were \nabout.\n  On one side, congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration \npushed for more spending. On the other side, congressional Republicans \nwere pushing for tax relief. In the end, both sides compromised. That \nis the real fiscal history of the 1990s.\n  Now, let's turn to the other conclusion of the revision by fiscal \nhistorians. That conclusion is that in this decade all fiscal problems \nare attributable to the widespread tax relief enacted in the years \n2001, 2003, 2004, and 2006.\n  In 2001, President Bush came into office. He inherited an economy \nthat was careening downhill. Investments started to go flat in 2000. \nThe tech-fueled stock market bubble was bursting. After that came the \neconomic shocks of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Add in the corporate \nscandals to that economic environment, and it is true that in the \nfiscal year 2001, as it came to a close, the projected surpluses turned \nto a deficit.\n  But it is wrong to attribute the entire deficit occurring during this \nperiod to the bipartisan tax relief. Because, according to the CBO, the \nbipartisan tax relief is responsible for only 25 percent of the deficit \nchange, while 44 percent is attributable to higher spending and 31 \npercent to economic and technical changes.\n  In just the right time, the 2001 tax relief plan kicked in. As the \ntax relief hits its full force in 2003, the deficits grew smaller. This \npattern continued for 4 more years through 2007. If my comments were \nmeant to be partisan shots, I could say this favorable fiscal path from \n2003 to 2007 was the only period, aside from 6 months in 2001, where \nRepublicans controlled the White House and the Congress.\n  But unlike the fiscal history revisionists, I am not trying to make a \npartisan point; I am just trying to point out a few fiscal facts. There \nis also data that compares the tax receipts for 4 years after the much \nballyhooed 1993 tax increase and the 4-year period after the 2003 tax \ncuts.\n  I have a chart here that will track those trends. In 1993, the \nClinton tax increases, the blue line, brought in more revenue as \ncompared to the 2003 tax cuts. That trend reversed as both policies \nmoved along in years. Over the first few years, the extra revenue went \nup over time relative to the flat line of the 1993 tax increases.\n  So let's get the fiscal history right. The pro-growth tax and trade \npolicies of the 1990s, along with the peace dividend, had a lot more to \ndo with the deficit reduction in the 1990s than the 1993 tax increases.\n  In this decade, deficits went down after the tax relief plans were \nput in full effect. No economist I am aware of would link the technical \nbursting of the housing bubble with the bipartisan tax relief plans of \n2001 and 2003. Likewise, I know of no economic research that concludes \nthat the bipartisan tax relief of 2001 and 2003 caused the financial \nmeltdown of September and October 2008.\n  I have another chart that shows what the President inherited from the \nDemocratic Congress and a Republican President. As I said, from the \nperiod 2003 through 2007, after the bipartisan tax relief program was \nin full effect, the general pattern was this: revenues went up, \ndeficits went down.\n  One major point that needs to be said right here is to state where \nthe government gets the money it spends. Basically I am asking, from \nwhere do taxes come? I would have thought this would have been \nperfectly obvious to most people, but I may have been wrong. Taxes come \nfrom taxpayers. I say this because we have heard tax relief for certain \nindividuals referred to as the word ``bonus.'' A search of the \nCongressional Record for the Senate on December 1, 2010, shows that the \nword ``bonus'' was said nearly 50 times, the implication being that by \nextending tax relief for all Americans we are giving some people a \nbonus that other people are paying for.\n  Let me try to simplify this for my colleagues who are having trouble \nunderstanding. There is no proposal to cut taxes for anyone before this \nbody. The question is, Instead, are we going to allow taxes to go up or \nare we going to prevent a tax increase? If we prevent taxes for \neveryone from going up, we are letting taxpayers keep more of their own \nmoney that they have earned and worked hard for. No one is proposing a \nbonus or a gift to anyone. The question is, Do we want taxpayers to \nhave more or less of their own money?\n  My colleagues on the other side have been especially incensed by what \nthey consistently refer to as ``tax cuts for the rich'' and seem to \nbelieve tax relief for everyone is responsible for our disastrous \nbudget situation. However, I think nearly everyone serving in the \nChamber and certainly the President and House and Senate leadership \nsupport extending around 80 percent of that tax relief. If those on the \nother side are serious in their pleas that taxes must be increased in \nthe name of fiscal responsibility, how can they claim 80 percent of the \ntax relief is absolutely necessary and that 20 percent of the tax \nrelief is absolutely wrong? This chart, drawn up from Congressional \nBudget Office data, should give more insight into the two groups the \nother side is talking about. The orange line measures the effective tax \nrate paid by the top 5 percent of taxpayers. By the way, this is where \nthe small business owners' tax hit occurs. This group represents those \ntax-paying families with incomes over $250,000. Under the Democratic \nleadership's preferred tax policy, this line will go back up to where \nit was in the year 2000. Republicans would prefer to prevent this tax \nincrease, and we have shown it falls primarily on the backs of small \nbusiness.\n  The main point this chart shows, though, is that tax relief \nundertaken during the last administration benefited all taxpayers, and \ncharacterizing it as tax cuts for the rich is simply not accurate. Of \ncourse, I wish to put our country on a path to fiscal responsibility, \nbut I do not believe higher taxes will lead us to that path. Rather, we \nneed to carefully examine how we spend the money we already collect.\n  This debate is about one fundamental question. Who does the money \nyou, the taxpayer, have worked hard to get belong to? Does it belong to \nthe citizens who earn it or does it belong to the government? Is \nwhatever the taxpayer is left with an allowance, with the balance to be \nspent by a government that knows best? I think most people would answer \nmy last two questions with a strong resounding no. As we continue to \ndiscuss pressing tax matters in Congress, we need to keep these \nfundamental and simple truths in mind. We need to stop taxes from \nincreasing for all Americans. It is fundamental, after all the years I \nhave served in the Senate, that increasing taxes $1 does not go to the \nbottom line and bring the deficit down.\n  Through three or four different occasions during the years I have \nserved in the Senate, we have had propositions, some of them even \nbipartisan, that we increase taxes by $1 and somehow we will decrease \nexpenditures by $3 and, in the process, we are all going to win and the \ndeficit is going to go down. But what we forget is how the mechanics of \nlegislative bodies work. You increase taxes for a long period of time, \nbut each year expenditures are reviewed, and somehow that 3-for-1 rule \ndoes not seem to hold on the expenditure side. They don't go down. They \ncreep up, creep up, and creep up. So in the final analysis, it is kind \nof averaged out that for every $1 we bring in in increased taxes, it is \na license to spend $1.15.\n  Some studies would say it is even much higher than that and not just \none proposition like that but several propositions like that. That is \nhow it has ended up. I don't like to increase taxes, but if there was \never a time I could increase taxes and knew that went to the bottom \nline and brought the deficit down $1, it might be a proposition I\n\n[[Page S8385]]\n\ncould buy into. But the practice of legislative bodies, particularly \nthe Congress of the United States, increasing taxes $1 is a license to \nspend more. It is a ratchet effect. I am very suspicious of those \npropositions. I think my colleagues see that raising taxes has not done \nanything to bring the budget deficit down.\n  I ask our colleagues, in these last few weeks of this Congress, to \nkeep those historical facts in mind so we don't get hoodwinked into \ndoing things that don't end up reducing the deficit. Even at a time \nwhen it sounds like it will reduce the deficit and makes sense, the \ncommon sense we ought to remind each other of is it doesn't work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the upcoming \namendments and debate we will have on the tax issue. Let me say a few \nthings. First, we are in a very tough economic situation. We have a \nlarge number of unemployed people, and even people who have been \nemployed over the last decade, for the middle class, their incomes have \nnot gone up. Their buying power has not gone up. This is the first \ndecade that middle-class incomes have not increased.\n  Second, the economy, if we look at statistics from 2000 to 2010, even \nwith the recession, has done pretty well. But almost all the income and \nall the wealth has agglomerated to the top 1 percent and top 10 \npercent. That means the people at the highest end did very well, while \neverybody else did not. I have nothing against them. In fact, I think \nthey are great. They are part of the American dream. To say they have \ngotten most of the wealth, some of my colleagues bring up the false \nissue of class warfare. It is not class warfare. It is a fact we have \nto deal with, just like saying middle-class incomes have not gone up \nenough. That is not class warfare either. Those are just facts.\n  Then there is the third issue; that when we began the decade in 2001 \nthere was a surplus of $300 billion left by Bill Clinton. Now, of \ncourse, we have a huge deficit. We did when Barack Obama took office, \nand because of the stimulus it is greater. But the No. 1 reason was the \ntax cuts, mainly agglomerated to the wealthy, passed by President \nGeorge Bush and a Senate and House led by Republicans.\n  Issue 4, when the tax rates were higher--Bill Clinton had raised \nthem--we all know job growth in the 1990s far exceeded job growth in \nthis decade.\n  So put all that together, and it makes a pretty strong point that the \nmiddle class needs relief, No. 1; that the country must overcome the \ndeficit problems we face, No. 2; and No. 3, that the highest income \npeople are doing great.\n  So what would be the proper solution to that when we have a tax bill \ncoming before us? It is pretty logical. It is pretty obvious. We should \nactually make sure the middle class keeps their taxes low. They are the \nones whose incomes have suffered. They are the ones who spend it when \nthey get a check because they don't have much money. They are the ones \nwho need the relief both for themselves and in their personal and \nfamily situations and for the economy. But to give huge amounts of tax \nbreaks to the very wealthy doesn't make any sense. Why? Because, first, \nthey are doing great. God bless them; second, because they don't spend \nit. They are not going to go out to the supermarket or the department \nstore Christmas shopping because they know they are getting a little \nbit of a tax break; they have plenty of money. And third, because even \nmost of them would probably admit they did fine when the rate was a \nlittle higher on them. It is not going to affect their business and \nspending decisions very much, if at all.\n  The logical solution is to give the middle class the tax break and \nsay to the upper income: Your money should go to deficit reduction. \nThat is what we will vote on in the next few days on the floor. Some \nwould prefer that the level be 250, that the tax cuts should go to all \nthose below 250. I know my colleague from Iowa feels that way. He will \nspeak after me. I have been willing to have the rates go up to 1 \nmillion. I think having a rate for the very highest income people, \nwhich we always used to have, restoring that makes a great deal of \nsense because that is where the wealth is agglomerating. It is no \nlonger people in the top 10 percent who do the best. It is people in \nthe top 1 percent who do the best, far and away. On that vote, we will \nsee where people stand.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to make it seem as \nif a tax cut for someone making $50,000 is the same as a tax cut for \nsomeone making $5 million. They say: Tax cuts for everybody. Don't \nraise taxes on anybody. But it is not the truth. What we are here to do \nis actually pull away the veil. It seems the No. 1 motivation of too \nmany of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is to give a tax \nbreak to the wealthiest among us, which may make political sense. I \ndon't know. It may for them. It sure doesn't make economic sense. It \ndoesn't make fairness sense. It doesn't make sense from the point of \nview of getting the economy going.\n  I want the American public, over the next few days, as we debate \ntaxes, to listen. Ask yourself: Do you think someone making $10 million \nshould get a huge tax break? Do you think Warren Buffett or Bill Gates \nshould get a tax break that is more than the income of thousands and \nthousands and thousands of middle-class people? If you believe no, tell \nyour Senator.\n  Do you believe the deficit is a serious problem and giving $300 \nbillion to $400 billion to people who make over $1 million instead of \nputting that money into the deficit makes sense? If you do not, call \nyour Senator and tell him no. Do you think it is at all fair to say \nthat to extend unemployment benefits for hard-working people who are \nlooking every day for jobs, that that has to be paid for but tax breaks \nto the wealthiest among us do not have to be? If you think that does \nnot make any sense, tell your Senator, tell him or her no.\n  I know we have a very powerful media group on the hard right, and \nthey are going to try to get on the radio and get on the television and \nconvince the average middle-class person that Democrats want to take \naway their tax cut and Republicans want to give it to them. But nothing \ncould be further from the truth. We have been the ones focused on the \nmiddle class, and they have been the ones focused on the wealthy.\n  We are not willing to hold middle-class tax cuts hostage until there \nis a tax cut for the wealthiest among us. It is time for some clarity. \nIf all my colleagues on the other side of the aisle vote for a tax \nbreak for those whose annual income is above $1 million, unpaid for, I \ndo not want to hear about deficit reduction when it comes to programs \nfor transportation or education or health or the military from them \never again.\n  They may believe lowering taxes on everybody is a good thing. That is \nan ideology I do not agree with at this point in time. But they cannot \nclaim deficit reduction is a goal when they will increase the deficit \nby hundreds of billions of dollars without it being paid for to give \ntax breaks to the very few wealthy families here in America.\n  As for the argument that those tax breaks are important to create \njobs, no economist believes that. We are talking about the personal \nincome tax rate, not the corporate rate. We are talking about people \nwho, when they had a higher rate, did very well. We are talking about \njob growth in the last decade among the slowest we have had in a very \nlong time under those low tax rates, whether they were times of \neconomic growth or economic decline. There is virtually no good \nargument to give huge tax breaks to the very wealthy at a time when our \ndeficit is as large as it is. There is a very good argument to give \nthose same tax breaks, on a percentage basis, of course, to the middle \nclass.\n  So to the American people, please watch the floor tonight, tomorrow, \nover the next several days. Figure out who is on your side. Figure out \nwho is being fiscally responsible. Figure out who wants to help the \naverage middle-class person and at the same time get a hold on our \ndeficit.\n  Again, I repeat, I respect and salute those who have made a lot of \nmoney on their own and are very wealthy. God bless them. They are part \nof the American dream. But the American dream does not say that at a \ntime of need, at a time when deficits are severe, that because you have \nmade all that money you should get a more huge tax break than everybody \nelse.\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\n  So this debate is going to be an interesting one. I think it is going \nto set the tone for what we do over the next 2 years. Believe me, we \nwill be talking about the millionaires' tax break--who voted for it and \nwho voted against it--not just today and not just tomorrow but over the \nnext 2 years. It is a very important issue and one we cannot let rest \nfor the good of the middle class, for the good of deficit reduction, \nfor the good of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened with great attention to the \nspeech just given by my friend from New York. Senator Schumer is right \non target when he is talking about: Whom are we fighting for? What are \nwe in the Senate for? What are we here to do? Whom are we fighting for?\n  I have often said the one thing about the very wealthy in our \ncountry, they are pretty good at taking care of themselves. Obviously, \nthey would not be rich if they were not. But what about the people who \ndo not have much? Who is fighting for them? This is what I wish to \nspend some time talking about; that is, the unemployed in this country.\n  Last week we went home for Thanksgiving. I hope everyone had a good \ntime with their families. Now we are looking at the upcoming holidays \nwith anticipation, as we do every year, to be with our families, go out \nand buy some presents and exchange presents--kids, grandkids, a festive \ntime.\n  But what about all those people who are out of work and have no \nmoney, who right now are being cut off from the only lifeline they \nhave, unemployment insurance benefits--losing them day after day \nbecause they ended 2 days ago. By the time Christmas rolls around, \nsomewhere close to 2 million Americans not only will be out of a job \nbut will have no source of income whatsoever, facing another winter \nseason celebrating the holidays with nothing.\n  I had a newspaper headline I showed the other day that said: ``Luxury \nspending is back in fashion''--about how much money was being spent on \njewels and fancy wristwatches and high-end types of things. Then, right \nunder, in small print, it said: However, for millions of Americans they \nare not shopping anywhere because they are out of work.\n  The two faces of America--is that what we want this country to be, a \nfew who can spend on lavish, jewel-encrusted watches, buying $2,500 \ncashmere scarves, as I just read about the other day, and everybody \nelse sort of getting in the soup line? We are a better country than \nthat.\n  That is what I wanted to talk about: reauthorizing the emergency \nunemployment insurance program. But I, first of all, listened to my \nfriend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, talk about taxes. I \ndid not hear the whole speech, but I heard him say raising taxes never \nreduces the deficit or reduces the debt. I do not know which he said--\neither the debt or the deficit.\n  Well, I hate to disagree with my friend, but in 1993, when we enacted \nthe Clinton economic proposal, it included increasing taxes in 1993. \nOh, I remember the Senator from Texas, Mr. Phil Gramm, an economist, \ngot up and said: Oh, this is going to cause a depression. This will be \nthe worst thing that ever happened to this country. We are going to rue \nthe day we ever did this. Well, we passed it. Of course, it did not get \none Republican vote, and we did raise some taxes in 1993.\n  What happened, then, for the next 7, 8 years? We had unprecedented \ngrowth in this country. Quite frankly, we did balance the budget by \n2000. Not only did we balance it, we had a surplus, and we had a \nsurplus going into 2001. That is when George Bush came to the \nPresidency and said: Oh, we have this big surplus. Alan Greenspan was \nwarning us we had too much of a surplus and it might not be wise to pay \ndown the debt. We were on course to pay down the national debt. Then \nthe Bush administration pushed through some tax cuts, for which they \nsaid: Oh, we are just going to do it temporarily, you see, just until \n2010. We will keep them until 2010, and then we will have to revisit it \nor we will go back to what we had before in 2001.\n  They made that deal. I did not vote for it. I did not think we should \ncut taxes that time. I thought we should pay off the national debt. \nThat would have strengthened our economy more than anything. But, no, \nthe Bush administration, the Republicans who controlled the House and \nthe Senate, said they wanted to cut the taxes. Most of the taxes that \nwere cut, as my friend from New York said, were for the very wealthy.\n  What happened? Did we have a lot of job growth? Not a bit. Not a bit. \nNot only did we not get job growth, the deficit skyrocketed. So I do \nnot want to hear any exhortations from that side of the aisle about how \nraising taxes has never reduced the deficit or the debt. We did under \nBill Clinton. The proof is there. We had a surplus. But they wanted the \ntax breaks to give to the wealthy.\n  Lastly, my friend from New York talked about being held hostage. \nThere has been a lot of talk about middle-income Americans getting a \ntax break. But I ask--and I keep asking--who are middle-income \nAmericans? Who are they? Well, I keep hearing it is those earning \n$250,000 a year or below. Mr. President, $250,000 a year? My friends, \nif you are making $250,000 a year, you are in the top 5 percent of the \nincome earners in America. That is right. If you make $250,000 a year, \n95 percent of the American people make less than you do. So is that \nmiddle class? I do not think so.\n  To me, in the middle class are people who are making $30,000, \n$40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 a year. That is \nthe broad middle class of America. A lot of people in America are \nliving on $40,000 a year. It might be hard for some people to think \nabout that, but that is true. They do not take fancy trips. They do not \nhave fancy cars. They do not go to fancy restaurants. They do not wear \nsuits and ties every day. But they are working, and a lot of them are \nworking at jobs that are important to our society.\n  They may be nurses aides. They may be taking care of our elderly in a \nnursing home or in assisted living. They may be our childcare workers \ntaking care of our children. They could be working in fast food places. \nThey are making $35,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year, and that is it. That \nis the middle class of America. What are we doing for them? What are we \ndoing for that middle class?\n  So every time I hear about that $250,000 is the middle class, I am \nthinking: Wait a second. You are talking about the top 5 percent in \nAmerica. If you want to talk about the broad middle class, you have to \nstart talking about people making less than $100,000 a year. What are \nwe doing for them?\n  Well, it seems to me, if we are going to have some tax breaks and \nstuff, we have to think about this group. In that group--in that \ngroup--of the broad middle class is the army of the unemployed. That is \nwhere the unemployed are. The unemployed are not on Wall Street. They \ngot their bailouts. They are getting million-dollar bonuses this year, \nand my friends on the Republican side want to extend the tax breaks so \nnot only do they get their million-dollar bonuses, they will not have \nto pay their fair share of taxes on them either, not to mention, for \nsome of them, the way they are getting their money, they are being \ncharged at the least possible tax rate--not as regular income but as \ncapital gains. But I am not going to get into that right now.\n  So what are the Republicans doing? They are saying we cannot extend \nthe unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans who are \nunemployed until and unless we have tax breaks for the wealthiest \nAmericans. For those making over $250,000, $500,000, over $1 million--\nthey do not care; no matter what, no matter who you are, how much money \nyou make--we have to give them tax breaks or we cannot extend \nunemployment benefits to the unemployed. You want to talk about \nhostages? The Republicans in this Congress are holding hostage the \nunemployed workers in America because they want to get the tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest. That is what is happening here. I don't know that \nmany of the American people know about that. Oh, they see us debate \nthis stuff and back and forth about who is going to get these tax \nbreaks, but right now unemployment benefits have run out. We have asked \nI think three or four times, if I am not mistaken, on the Senate floor \nfor unanimous consent to extend\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\nthe unemployment benefits, and the Republicans have objected every \nsingle time. Why?\n\n  They wrote a letter. Yesterday, the Republican leader had a letter \nsigned by every single Republican in the Senate that said they will not \nallow any bill to pass the Senate unless and until we pass a bill \ngiving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. It almost begs \ncredulity. You wonder, is this real? Do they really mean that? Well, \nthey signed their names to it. That means we can't extend unemployment \nbenefits until we give in, until we give in to the Republicans and give \ntax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. What a deal. What a deal--\nholding people who are at the end of their ropes--the most vulnerable \nin our society--holding them hostage for their Wall Street friends.\n  I have heard this said by some on the other side: Well, unemployment \nbenefits make people lazy. If you give them unemployment benefits, they \nwon't look for work.\n  Well, let me talk for a minute about what the labor market looks like \nright now, and we will see if these people are really lazy. Right now, \nthere are 15 million people who want a job and can't find one but 9 \nmillion people forced to work part time because they can't get a full-\ntime job. There are a number of other people who have looked for a job, \nand they have given up. They have been out of work for 2 years. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, after 99 weeks, you don't get any unemployment \nbenefits whatsoever, and a lot of people have been out of work for over \n99 weeks. They have nothing. That means our unemployment rate is not \naround 9 percent; it is actually about 17 to 18 percent. And these \nunemployed workers are looking for work.\n  What people have to understand is that before you can get \nunemployment benefits, you have to be actively looking for work. It is \na requirement in order to get it. But what is happening out there? \nWorkers can't find jobs because there aren't any. There is one job for \nevery five workers. Well, it says here: 14.8 million workers \nunemployed. That is not really true. It is actually about 26 million. \nThat is 14.8 million unemployed, but when you include those who have \ngiven up because they have gone beyond 99 weeks, when you take into \naccount those who work part time because they were working full time \nbut now they can only get a part-time job, it adds up to almost 26 \nmillion.\n  Let's just take the Bureau of Labor Statistics as they are: 14.8 \nmillion workers, 2.9 million jobs, 1 for about every 5. Actually, it is \nfewer than that. If you really look at the overall picture, it is \nreally more like 1 in 8 to 1 in 10. So, in other words, for about every \n8 to 10 workers, there is 1 job out there someplace. So most workers \nwill lose on this kind of game of musical chairs. When you run around \nand the music stops, one person gets a job and six or seven people \ndon't have one. So I challenge my Republican friends: How can six or \nseven or eight people find a job when there is only one available? That \nis why we have so many people facing long-term unemployment.\n  Over 6 million people have been out of work for more than half a \nyear. I saw a lot of them who were here in Washington yesterday. Four \nin 10 workers, what we call the long-term unemployed, have been \nunemployed and looking for a job for at least 6 months. This is higher \nthan during any previous recession.\n  There are extensions going back to 1950. In terms of the share of the \ntotal unemployed--you can see the graph here--in terms of who has been \nunemployed for more than 6 months--and as we can see, as we go from the \n1950s to here, look at where this line now goes in 2010: more than we \nhave ever had going clear back to the 1950s. Long-term unemployed, \nhigher than any previous recession. It is the highest in 60 years. They \nare being held hostage by the Republicans.\n  Long-term unemployment is especially common among older workers over \naged 50. These are people who have worked all their lives, they have \nsaved for retirement, they have lost their jobs, and they are having a \nvery difficult time finding new work. A year, year and a half, 2 \nyears--I have met people out of work for well over 2 years. Again, they \ncan't find work because it is not there, through no fault of their own.\n  So, as I said, our economy needs at least 11 million jobs--at least. \nTo say that people who are unemployed are lazy and shouldn't get \nbenefits--if you say that, you are obviously out of touch. You are out \nof touch with the real world and what is happening out there and the \ndifficult circumstances that face our hard-working American families.\n  I get a lot of letters--and I am sure the occupant of the chair does \ntoo from his home State--from people who are just at their wit's end, \nand they just tear your heart out.\n  A 50-year-old woman from Altoona has been unemployed since November \n2009, a year and a month. She wrote me: ``I can't even get a job at \nMcDonald's right now, and believe me, I have tried everywhere.'' \nUnemployment insurance is helping her get by, but she is worried about \nrunning out of benefits, which just happened 2 days ago. I got this \nletter before 2 days ago. Her unemployment benefits are out.\n  An unemployed schoolteacher from Estherville wrote me. She said:\n\n       I have not felt so humiliated in 20 years. I have been a \n     productive and hard-working woman since I was 13, but now I \n     feel insignificant.\n\n  She wrote me that this summer. This month, she wrote me again. She \nsaid:\n\n       I have tried to find employment in other States, all over \n     Iowa, in every form of employment you can imagine: \n     convenience stores, fast food, factories. I am a high school \n     math teacher with three college degrees and I can't find a \n     job. If it weren't for unemployment, I would be on food \n     stamps.\n\n  But without unemployment insurance, she doesn't know what she is \ngoing to do. She just lost hers a couple of days ago too.\n  These are just two examples, but there are millions. In this holiday \nseason, from now until the new year, 2 million people will be cut off \nif we don't continue these programs. In Iowa, my home State, more than \n10,000 people will be cut off from their benefits during this holiday \nseason. And if we don't do anything, we will face 6 million by April \nleft without any source of income, hanging by a thread. Their savings \nare exhausted. Their unemployment benefits are the thin lifeline \nkeeping them afloat.\n  Congress has never cut back emergency unemployment benefits when the \nunemployment rate was as high as it is now, and this is no time to \nstart. Here it is again. Going back to 1959, when we had high rates of \nunemployment, every single time, Congress passed emergency funding to \nkeep unemployment benefits going--that is, until now.\n  Republicans have said, oh, they will extend it, but they want to pay \nfor it. It is about $56 billion to extend it for 1 year. They have to \npay for it, and how they want to pay for it is to take money out of the \nRecovery Act. There is still some unexpended money there that is going \nout for things such as roads and bridges and infrastructure projects \nthat put people to work. So they want to take money from that, which is \ngiving people some jobs and helping build our infrastructure, to put \ninto unemployment benefits, when, going back to 1959, through \nRepublican and Democratic administrations, we have always said this is \nan emergency, and that is the way we fund it.\n  Well, the Republicans say, we have a huge deficit. We can't do that \nanymore. Then why are they so intent on passing a tax cut bill, \nextending a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans and they don't pay for \nit? They put it on the deficit--not for $56 billion but for $700 \nbillion. Oh, they are willing to do that. They are willing to do that \nfor the wealthiest but not for people at the end of their rope, the \nunemployed.\n  So I guess we have entered a new era in this country. We don't help \nthe unemployed: we just help the wealthy. That is all we do. That is \nwhy we are here, I guess. Look at that. We ought to be ashamed of \nourselves. I ask, have my Republican friends lost all sense of \nfairness? Have my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle \nlost all sense of justice? Have they lost all sense of what is right \nand what is wrong? Where is the moral outrage? Where is the moral \noutrage that we are going to let people stand in the soup lines for \nChristmas but we are going to give tax breaks to the wealthiest? We are \ngoing to give million-dollar bonuses to the people on Wall Street who, \nby the way, caused a lot of these problems, and we won't even make them\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\npay their fair share of taxes. Where is the outrage? Well, I will tell \nyou. It is out there. The American people are seeing this. They are \nsaying: Wait a minute, Congress wants to pass this big tax break and \nthey won't help the unemployed? They get it. They get it.\n  I can't believe Congress is doing this. I can't believe my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle are so hard-hearted that they would hold \nhostage--that they would not let us move a bill to extend the \nunemployment benefits until we pass their bill to extend the tax breaks \nto the wealthiest Americans. Where is our sense of moral outrage at \nthis?\n  Just one other thing. Unemployment benefits that we give out to \npeople is not money that is thrown down a rathole. Quite frankly, one \nof the best economic stimuli we have is unemployment benefits, believe \nit or not. Why is that? Well, because people who get unemployment \nbenefits--and right now, in my State it averages about $300 a week. \nThat is about a national average. It is right about there. It is about \n$300 a week. That is about $15,000 a year. That is lower than the \npoverty wage, by the way. If you think unemployment benefits are some \nbig deal, it is lower than the poverty wage. So when they get that \nmoney, what do they do? They go out and they buy groceries. They buy \nsome clothes for the kids. They buy the necessities of life. And that \nmoney acts as a multiplier to our economy.\n  This is Mark Zandi, Moody's economy.com, about how the GDP increase \nis generated by $1 of stimulus going to these various things. Food \nstamps is the best. For every dollar we put into food stamps, we get an \nincrease in GDP of $1.74, again because people spend that money to buy \nfood, most of which is grown, produced, processed, packaged, shipped, \nand bought in America. Unemployment benefits are right next to food \nstamps--$1.61 increase in GDP for every dollar we put out, again for \nthe same reason. People using unemployment benefits are not using them \nto buy a Mercedes. They are not using the benefits to buy a new, high-\ndefinition, 3D flat screen TV made in Japan. They are not using the \nbenefits to buy a gold-encrusted, diamond-studded Rolex watch made in \nSwitzerland. They are using these benefits to buy the necessities of \nlife, most of which are made here in America. Extending the Bush tax \ncuts--for every dollar we put in, we get back 32 cents in GDP growth.\n  That is what the Republicans want. Why, when trying to stimulate the \neconomy, would we put $1 into something that returns us only 32 cents, \nwhen we can put $1 in and get back $1.61? How about infrastructure \ninvestments. We get back $1.57 for every $1. It is very close to \nunemployment benefits. Yet Republicans want to take money out of this \nand put it here. Why don't we take money out of here--the tax cuts--and \nput it here? That is a better deal for our economy. It creates jobs, \nand we get an increase in economic activity in our country.\n  As I said earlier, here it is. The average UI benefit is about \n$15,600 and the poverty level is $21,756 for a family of four. It is a \npowerful benefit that provides food, clothes, housing, utilities--all \nof the things needed just to keep life going. That is what these \nunemployment benefits are spent on.\n  With the holidays coming, our economy needs the money and people need \nthe benefits. Cutting off that revenue would be counterproductive for \njobs. It is counterproductive for the people who need these benefits. \nIt makes no sense economically to cut off unemployment benefits. But \nmore importantly, it makes no sense morally. There is such a thing as \nright and wrong. There is such a thing as fair and unfair and just and \nunjust. It is not just, it is not fair, and it is not right that, \nthrough no fault of their own, we are saying to these people, the \nunemployed in America, the millions--whether it is 14.9 million or \ncloser to 26 million or anywhere in between--it is just not right to \nsay: Well, maybe we will extend your unemployment benefits after we \nextend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest in our society. That is \ntotally irresponsible. But that is where we find ourselves.\n  I say to the President of the United States: Mr. President, you made \na lot of promises when you were campaigning in my State of Iowa, and \none of the most important you made was that you were going to hold the \nline--and you said this time and time again--at $250,000. You would \nextend the tax breaks to middle-income people below $250,000. You ought \nto hold to that, Mr. President. You ought to hold to that.\n  We will see if the Republicans want to shut down the government. Do \nthey want to shut the government down? That is what they are saying. We \nare going to have to have a resolution on the Senate floor--because it \nwill run out--to keep the government going. They are saying they will \nnot pass that unless and until we extend the Bush tax cuts for the \nwealthy.\n  I dare the Republicans to shut the government down just because they \nwant to give tax breaks to the wealthy. I say if that is what they want \nto do, let the American people see the extent to which the Republicans \nwill go in order to help their wealthy friends.\n  Mr. President, hold to your guns, hold to your guns on $250,000 and \nbelow. Don't give in. Don't give up. The American people are behind you \non this one, Mr. President. Tell them you want unemployment benefits \nextended, you want middle-class tax breaks extended, and we want to \nfund the government. We don't want to go into default. We want that \nfirst. Don't give up, Mr. President. The American people will be behind \nyou, and this Congress will be behind you too.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today the House passed legislation \nthat would extend the tax cuts for those middle-class taxpayers who \nmake under $200,000 a year. That is a good thing, and I support that. \nBut why on Earth would we extend the tax cuts for a certain segment of \nthe population and not extend the tax cuts for everyone? Why would we \ndo that? Who are the job creators in our country? What is the problem \nour country has right now? It is jobs. We have an unemployment rate \nthat is hovering around 10 percent. So what should we be doing in \nCongress to try to alleviate that situation? We should be doing \neverything in our power to create jobs in the private sector. The \nprivate sector is where jobs will be a created, where it will be \nsomething that will support a family.\n  Of course, we are going to support tax cuts for everyone in this \ncountry because we are in an economic recession. The idea of increasing \ntaxes on the people who would create jobs is something that could only \ncome out of Washington. All of us have been home for the last few \nweeks. Last week was Thanksgiving, and we were in grocery stores \ntalking to our constituents. Time and time again I heard people in the \nreal world, people who are creating jobs, saying: Why don't you all \naddress the issues of this country? Don't you know what is happening?\n  Well, do you know something? They have a point. They have a point \nbecause, of course, many of us have been saying this for a long time. \nBut here we are in December, the last month of the year. The IRS can't \neven print the tax forms because they don't know what the tax rates are \ngoing to be because Congress left in September and didn't finish its \njob. Now here we are in December and we are going to have a train \nwreck.\n  That is why those on our side signed a letter saying that we are not \ngoing to address any issue until we settle the tax issue and the issue \nof funding government. After that, there are many things that could be \non the agenda. But those are two things that are essential. So knowing \nthe way things work around here, and knowing that we could end up \ntalking for 2 more weeks before we do anything, we are going to set the \npriority to say that it is tax cuts and it is funding the government, \nand if we can do other things, fine, but if we can't, then we go home.\n  I think the START Treaty is very important, and we are all looking at \nthat. But we have to make sure the small businesspeople of our country \nknow what to expect. And if they can hire people on even in this \nholiday season, it will make a difference.\n  President Reagan and President Kennedy and President Bush 43 all did \nsomething that had the same effect on our revenue in this country; they \ncut taxes and revenue increased. Cutting taxes is what increases and \nspurs the\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\neconomy, and it works every time. So now we are talking about deciding \nwho is going to get their tax cuts and who isn't.\n  We should be saying clearly and simply to the American people--and \nespecially the small businesspeople who are waiting to see what their \nbudgets are going to be next year--we are not going to raise taxes on \nanybody because we want you to hire; we want you to give jobs to the \npeople of this country. If we can extend unemployment for those who \nhave been out of work and can't find something, and they are really \ntrying, and we can do it in a responsible way and pay for it, \nhopefully--I believe if we cut taxes, that will spur the economy and \npay for it.\n  Tomorrow, apparently, in the Senate we are going to get the House \nbill that passed today that cuts taxes for some but not all. So what \nwill happen if we do what the House has suggested? Households will \nlose, on average, $20,000 in total disposable personal income between \n2011 and 2020. Total individual income taxes will increase by $37 \nmillion between 2011 and 2020. Jobs will be lost and small businesses \nare not going to hire. I can tell you that anecdotally because I have \nbeen talking to the small business owners in my State. I was a small \nbusiness owner, and I know what it takes to increase employment.\n  Without action by us, the death tax will return with a vengeance. A \nlot of people think: Oh, a death tax, that is just going to affect the \nheirs of rich people. I think we have to remember that estates over $1 \nmillion will be taxed at the 55-percent rate. So many small businesses \nin this country are either farms or ranches, where the valuation at \ndeath on the property is going to be so much higher than the \nproductivity on that land, and the heirs are going to be faced with \nselling the property to pay the taxes, which means it will no longer \nhave any capacity for hiring people or productivity.\n  The same is true for small manufacturing companies. I was a small \nmanufacturer. I can tell you my equipment was worth a whole lot more \nthan the productivity of that equipment. You can pay for it over time, \nso you own the equipment. But then if you die and your heirs have to \npay a huge estate tax on the value of equipment, then they are going to \nhave to sell the equipment and, therefore, you have lost the business.\n  The statistics in this country of family businesses that are passed \nto the second generation and the third generation are abysmal. It is \nabout 50 percent that goes to the second generation. To the third \ngeneration, it is 20 to 30 percent. Who does that hurt? Of course, it \nhurts the families. It also hurts the employees of those family-owned \nbusinesses. They are the ones who will be put out of work. So the \nestate tax going to 55 percent over $1 million is not good public \npolicy. It would be outrageous for us to leave this year and go into \nthat kind of estate tax, which is confiscatory.\n  I have to tell you, I think it walks away from the American dream. \nThe American dream is that you can start from nothing in this country \nand you can build something and you can give the fruits of your labor \nto your children. That is the American dream. That is what people come \nhere and work for 7 days a week in restaurants, to try to build \nsomething to give to their children. Who are we to take that away? That \nis the American dream. But it will be gone at the end of this year if \nwe don't address that issue in Congress.\n  Capital gains and dividends: How many of our seniors are living on \ncapital gains and dividends? I guarantee you, anybody who has a bank \naccount knows you are not earning anything from that. You are not \nearning from cash because the interest rates are so low that many of \nour seniors are struggling. If they have a nest egg of stocks that is \npaying some dividends, then that is what many of them are living on. So \nwe are going to raise the tax on dividends from 15 percent to 20 \npercent at a time when so many seniors are struggling. That is what is \ngoing to happen if we don't address the tax cuts by the end of this \nyear.\n  The marriage penalty: That is my bill. I introduced relief from the \nmarriage penalty. Why should two people working get married and go into \na higher tax bracket in this country? We addressed that issue. For most \npeople, we have eliminated the marriage penalty, but not at the end of \nthis year, if we don't act, the marriage penalty comes back. So a \npoliceman and a schoolteacher who marry are going to have to pay about \n$1,400 more in taxes just because they want to get married--a \nschoolteacher and a policeman. It is an absolute fact. Is that what we \nwant in this country?\n\n  Small business owners pay at the individual rates--a subchapter S \nsmall business. Many small businesses are created to be able to pay at \nthe individual tax rate. Over 50 percent of the small businesses in our \ncountry pay at the individual tax rate. So now we are going to say \nindividuals' tax rates are going to go up if they make over $250,000, \nwhich is many of the small businesses in our country, so they are going \nto be paying at the higher rate. These are the things that are going to \nhappen if we don't act.\n  The House passed legislation that is going to be devastating for the \npeople who are unemployed in this country. How could we even think of \ndoing something so drastic? I hope tomorrow when the Senate takes up \nthe House bill that we send it back to the House and say: This is not \ngoing to go.\n  I will say to the President of the United States: I thought, Mr. \nPresident, that you said you were open to working on extending the \ntaxes for everyone, and yet here we are, with the leadership of the \nHouse who just talked to the President this week, and we have the same \nthing they have been talking about for all these months--no give, \nnothing has changed.\n  So here we are, it is December, and the people of America expect the \nleaders of Congress to address the issues that are on people's minds. \nWe are 3 weeks from Christmas, we are 4 weeks from the end of the year. \nHow could we leave without taking responsible action to let everyone in \nthis country who is paying taxes know how to plan for--I would hope for \n2 or 3 or 4 or 5 years?\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I want to say the one thing that seems to be \nmissing in the Halls of Congress is the importance--to a family, but \nalso to a small business especially that is thinking of expanding and \nhiring people--of stability and predictability. You can't say we are \ngoing to extend the tax cuts for 1 year or 2 years and do the right \nthing for the economy of our country. We ought to do it permanently, to \nbe honest. But if you are not going to do it permanently, at least do \nit for 5 years, or, at a minimum, 2 or 3 years.\n  It is not going to cost the government to give these tax cuts. We are \nkeeping it the way it is now. We are trying to spur jobs being created \nin our country. So when people talk about this is going to cost the \ngovernment X billion dollars to let people keep the money they have \nearned, they are going right over the heads of the American people.\n  So predictability is the most important thing we can do for small \nbusinesses so they can plan, so they can say we are going to expand our \nproduct line, we are going to expand our service area. These are the \nthings they can do if they know what their tax commitments are going to \nbe, and if they know what their health care costs are going to be. That \nis what is freezing the economy right now because people don't know \nwhat to expect.\n  So I hope the President is listening. I hope the leadership of the \nSenate is listening. Most certainly, I hope the House of \nRepresentatives will come to the table and see we can do better than \nthis, and we ought to do it before we leave this week or next week so \npeople know what to expect; so small businesses can sit down at the end \nof the year and plan their businesses and create jobs in this country. \nThat is the Christmas present people would like. They want jobs. They \nwant to work to support their families. They do not want to live on \nunemployment. They do not want to live on food stamps. That is not a \nlife. It is not a future. It is not hope. That is what they want--a \nfuture and hope for their families.\n  So I hope, myself, that we, the leaders of America, will give the \nAmerican people what they deserve and what clearly is in the long-term \nbest interests of their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8390]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX.

Mr. President, I come to the floor, as many of us have \ndone in recent weeks, to pay tribute to a Member of Congress who is \nretiring--to a great Floridian and a great American, a man I am proud \nto call a colleague and a friend, Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart. \nCongressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart is retiring after 18 years of service \nin the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Born in Havana, Cuba, Lincoln came to the United States in 1959, at \nthe age of 4 years old. His father, Rafael Lincoln Diaz-Balart, had \njust been elected a senator in Cuba, but he could not take office or \nremain in Cuba because of the rise of the dictator Fidel Castro.\n  Lincoln Diaz-Balart rose in the House of Representatives to become a \nsenior member of the Rules Committee, the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process, and is now the \ncochairman of our congressional delegation. He is also the chairman of \nthe Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute.\n  Lincoln grew up in south Florida. He attended public schools there \nand high school, but he also attended school in Madrid, Spain. He \nreceived a degree in international relations from New College in \nSarasota and obtained a diploma in British politics in Cambridge, \nEngland. He received his law degree from Case Western Reserve \nUniversity in Cleveland.\n  Lincoln started the practice of law in Miami. He worked for Legal \nServices of Greater Miami, providing free legal services to the poor. \nHe was subsequently an assistant state's attorney, prosecuting those \nwho committed crimes, and a partner in the prestigious Fowler, White \nlaw firm.\n  Lincoln was first elected into politics in the Florida Legislature \nback in 1986, but quickly--just 3 years later--ran for the U.S. \nCongress. In 1992, he served his first term as a Representative of \nFlorida's 21st Congressional District and served as a member of the \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  In 1994, Lincoln became the first Hispanic in history to be named to \nthe powerful Rules Committee. In 1996, he drafted much of the \nlegislation that strengthened the embargo against Cuba and its \ndictatorship.\n  In 1997, he showed his penchant for helping those in need by \nsuccessfully carrying out efforts to restore the supplemental security \nincome and food assistance to legal immigrants who were denied aid by \nthe welfare reform law of the previous year.\n  As a member of the House Rules Committee, on September 14, 2001, \nCongressman Diaz-Balart took to the floor of the House the joint \nresolution authorizing the use of force in Afghanistan after the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  Congressman Diaz-Balart lives in Miami with his wife Cristina and \ntheir two sons Lincoln and Daniel. When he retires, Florida will lose \none of its strongest voices, as will this country and all those who \ncare about freedom around the world.\n  He has fought for Florida's families with integrity and \neffectiveness. From his time in the State senate to his service in \nCongress, he has served with passion, drive, and a steadfast \ndetermination to do what is right. Most of all, and what I appreciate \nhim most for, he has been a champion of freedom and democracy, not only \nin Cuba but throughout Latin America and the world.\n  No one in Congress is more passionate about ending the oppression \nthat Cubans suffer under the current regime. His efforts are known not \nonly here but throughout the world. He is a voice of change, and he is \na passionate believer in the rights of people everywhere to be free. He \nspeaks for political prisoners held in the regime's prisons, he speaks \nfor those who suffer beatings for speaking out against their captors, \nand he speaks for everyday Cubans who hunger for the freedom they have \nnever felt.\n  I have heard Lincoln speak many times about the plight of the Cuban \npeople. I have seen his desire to see the people of Cuba enjoy the \nprize of liberty that has been denied them for more than 50 years. When \nhe speaks about these issues, you feel his passion. His voice has been \na great voice for a life of liberty throughout Florida, this country, \nand the world.\n  To know Lincoln is to know one of his heroes--his father Rafael Diaz-\nBalart, a well-respected public servant. When he had to leave Cuba in \n1959, he arrived in the United States and established the White Rose, \nthe first anti-Castro civic organization. When Lincoln returns to \nFlorida, he will lead a nonprofit inspired by the White Rose. I know \nhis father is looking down from Heaven and will continue to be proud of \nhis son.\n  The House of Representatives will not be the same without his \ntalents, but Florida will continue to benefit by having him back at \nhome full time. As an article in his hometown paper--the Miami Herald--\nnoted, even though Lincoln has announced his retirement, the pulpit \nwill change but the passion will not. To me, Lincoln will always be a \nsteadfast ally in the cause for freedom 90 miles away from our shores \nin Florida. He knows that freedom is not negotiable, and its cause is \nthe most noble cause in the world. Our country and our world is better \noff because of my friend Lincoln Diaz-Balart.\n\n  I will always be grateful to him because when I came here to the \nSenate with him and his brother Mario Diaz-Balart, another great \nchampion for freedom, I was mentored in the issues that affect my State \nand so many of the people in my State who come from Cuba and other \ncountries in Latin America. Through their mentoring and through their \npassion and through the education they provided to me, I was better \nable to understand his plight, a plight that I don't think most of my \ncolleagues can know as well as we can in Florida--that just 90 miles \nfrom our shore is an evil dictator who oppresses his people.\n  When I am in Florida talking with folks, oftentimes I will make the \nremark, if I am, say, in Orlando, FL: Can they imagine that just 90 \nmiles away, say, in West Palm Beach, FL, that it would be illegal to \nspeak out against the government, illegal to practice your religion, \nillegal to gather together in association to express your political \nviews--all of the freedoms we sometimes take for granted? Just 90 miles \nfrom our shore, people are jailed, are killed for trying to exercise \nthose freedoms.\n  It was brought home to me most when I was visited recently by a man \nby the name of Ariel Sigler. Ariel was a political prisoner in Cuba for \n7 years. He has recently been released, and he was in Miami receiving \nmedical care. Ariel is a man who was a professional boxer, a large, \nstrapping man. But he didn't just fight with his hands; he also raised \nhis voice for freedom in his native Cuba. When he did so, he was thrown \nin jail, and now he is a man who is about 100 pounds less in weight, \nwhose once towering frame is relegated to a wheelchair because for 7 \nyears he was imprisoned just for wanting to criticize his government. \nHe was put in a small cell with several other prisoners. He was fed \nmaggot-infested food, and he had to wash in a pipe and drink from a \npipe sitting outside his cell, as did all the other prisoners. It made \nhim sick, desperately sick. This happens just 90 miles from the shore \nof this country. It is intolerable.\n  But I know of this, and my heart bleeds for the Cuban people because \nof the great work of Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart. So we will miss \nhim. His voice has fought for freedom in this body, in the U.S. \nCongress, for 18 years. But as the Miami Herald said: The pulpit will \nchange but the passion will not.\n  We know he will continue to hold that lamp of freedom and be an \nadvocate for free people and people who yearn to be free throughout the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8390-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8390-S8391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX.

Mr. President, we have worked hard today trying to be at a \npoint where we could be further down the road than we are. I know the \nRepublican leader has worked hard to try to get to a point where we \ncould have the four amendments that people are talking about all around \nthis city.\n  We were not able to do that because of at least one Republican who \nheld that up. Senator McConnell has given this a valiant try and I have \nbeen in the position he is in and I understand that. I certainly do not \ncriticize him.\n  I would hope everyone understands we are going to have to have some \nvotes Saturday. We are going to wind up having, right now, two cloture \nvotes. We may not have any more. We\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\nmay not be able to work out anything with the minority. But everyone \nshould be aware that could happen. We are satisfied, if the minority \ndoes not want those other two amendments, then we will just go ahead as \nwe are scheduled now under the rules of the Senate.\n  We are going to have to be here on Saturday. We have so many things \nto do, as everyone knows, and we have been trying to work through some \nof that this week and have not gotten through nearly as much as we \nwanted.\n  I am, however, disappointed we have not been able to do more. I \nreceived a letter from all the Republicans yesterday saying: We are not \ngoing to allow you to do anything legislative until we get the tax cuts \nresolved and funding the government.\n  Well, we are not only not getting legislative things done now, now \nthey are not letting us do the tax cuts and funding the government. So \nwe are going to try to work our way through this. We have a lot to do. \nWe have to work together, and I intend to be as cooperative as I can. \nMy caucus, even though we have very strong feelings, recognized we are \ntrying to do what is good for this country, but we cannot do them \nalone. I apologize for not having more definition early on, but we did \nthe best we could.\n  So tomorrow we are going to be in session and there will be time for \npeople to give some speeches and do the things they need to do. Be \nprepared for Saturday. As to what time Saturday, we do not know. Under \nthe rule, it is 1 hour after we come in. If we can work out something \ndifferent than that, we will do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8392-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I would like to briefly describe two pieces \nof legislation which were before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs, and recently secured full approval of the Senate.\n  The first piece of legislation is H.R. 6162, the Coin Modernization, \nOversight, and Continuity Act of 2010. This bill principally addresses \nthe issue of how to approach the costs of metals used to make our \nNation's circulating coinage. In recent years, market prices for \nvarious metals--including those used for our Nation's coinage, such as \nnickel, copper, and zinc--have risen to such a point that it costs the \nU.S. Mint more than a penny to make a penny, and more than a nickel to \nmake a nickel. By giving the Treasury Secretary the authority to \nconduct research and development on metallic materials for all \ncirculating coinage, as appropriate, and mandating a biennial report on \nthe status of current coin production costs and an analysis of \nalternative content, this legislation will equip the U.S. Mint with the \ntools necessary to present detailed legislative recommendations to \nCongress. Should the Congress decide to act on any such prospective \nrecommendations for lower cost metallic materials and combinations, \nthere could be considerable savings to the taxpayer over time. In \naddition, this bill gives the Secretary flexibility in determining the \nquality and quantity of gold and silver bullion coins produced. The \nMint has recently taken drastic but prudent measures to meet the \nextraordinary demand for silver and gold bullion coins and has \nsuspended production of its proof and uncirculated versions, which are \nof great intrinsic value to collectors and coin enthusiasts. Going \nforward, the Mint will be able to simultaneously offer these higher-\nquality versions directly to the public while continuing to satisfy \ndemand for bullion coins.\n  The second piece of legislation is H.R. 6166, the American Eagle \nPalladium Bullion Coin Act of 2010, which authorizes the Secretary to \nmint and issue a $25 palladium bullion coin, subject to the submission \nof a report to Congress demonstrating sufficient public demand for such \ncoins and no resultant net cost to taxpayers. Palladium is a sought-\nafter investment-grade precious metal whose market price is often \nreliably above silver and below that of gold and platinum. Other \ngovernments have issued palladium bullion coins before as investment \nvehicles and collector's items, and this bill lays the groundwork for \nthe U.S. Mint to carry out a unique palladium coin program that would \nbenefit investors and numismatists, and cost nothing to the taxpayer.\n  The Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act of 2010 and the \nAmerican Eagle Palladium Bullion Coin Act of 2010 have both passed the \nHouse, and will now await the signature of the President. I am pleased \nthat these two bills were approved by this body, as they reflect sound \nand measured policy towards improving the state of our Nation's \ncoinage, and thank my colleagues for their help in getting these \nmeasures adopted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8392-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEW START TREATY\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, I was proud to vote for the passage of the \nresolution of advice and consent to the New START Treaty between Russia \nand the United States in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last \nSeptember. It was the right thing to do for our national security.\n  The most dangerous threat to America and to the world is for a \nterrorist organization or network to obtain a nuclear weapon. Nuclear \ndisarmament is among the most critical steps we must take to keep our \nNation and future generations safe. Ratification of the New START \nTreaty would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the American and \nRussian arsenals, bolstering our national security by reducing the risk \nof loose nuclear weapons and materials falling into the hands of \nhostile nations or terrorist groups seeking to attack America or her \nallies.\n  Only recently, documents have revealed to the world the continuing \nsignificant risk that Pakistan's nuclear weapons could fall into the \nhands of terrorists. There are a number of ways for us to address and \nminimize this risk in Pakistan and other countries. An agreement \nbetween two nuclear leaders to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear \nweapons and to improve transparency and oversight is a critical factor \nto keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. By reducing \nthe numbers of unneeded nuclear weapons in Russia, improving \nverification of Russian nuclear reductions, controlling and securing \nRussian nuclear warheads, and eliminating retired Russian delivery \nsystems and vulnerable weapons-grade material new START would reduce \nthe possibility that a nuclear weapon could be launched due to a \nterrorist attack, a misunderstanding, or a miscalculation, killing \nhundreds of thousands of Americans.\n  This continuation of a landmark agreement between our nations would \nbe an important step in the President's efforts to convince other \ncountries to get rid of their nuclear weapons. Countries like Ukraine \nhave made this commitment in part due to the confidence that new START \nprovides.\n  The treaty signed by President Obama and President Medvedev is \nsensible and it is right for our Nation's security; this is evidenced \nby the endorsements of several former Secretaries of Defense and State \nfrom both sides of the political aisle. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to ratify this treaty, ensuring a safer world for our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8392-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8392-S8393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the spirit, \ndetermination, and life of Ivy Johnson. Ivy lost her long battle with \ncancer on Friday, November 19. Our thoughts and prayers remain with her \nparents, her brothers, and the rest of her family and friends.\n  While Ivy's many academic achievements and personal adventures will \nbe chronicled by others, I want to focus on the Ivy we knew--the public \nservant--and I offer these thoughts on her life and her service to the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  From the start, I appreciated and respected Ivy's strong work ethic, \nand my trust in her judgment grew each passing day.\n  Ivy had a wonderful capacity to combine her knowledge of the law and \nunderstanding of policy with the practical political realities that \nform the foundation of the legislative process. Ivy believed in the law \nand that it worked to advance notable and worthy goals.\n  She worked with Representative Issa's staff on the House Oversight \nand Government Reform Committee to identify financial support provided \nby the Federal Government to the Association of Community Organizations \nfor Reform Now, or ACORN, after allegations emerged of inappropriate \nactivity by that organization.\n  She provided insightful analysis on everything from judicial \nnominations to homegrown terrorism.\n  She played a critical role in the investigative work of my staff \nregarding the November 2009 terrorist attack at Fort Hood. She \nskillfully conducted investigative reviews of the government's policies \nrelating to the reading of Miranda rights to terrorists captured in the \nUnited States.\n  Ivy understood that the security of our Nation and the privacy and \ncivil liberties of Americans are not mutually exclusive. Her guidance \non law enforcement and intelligence tools and techniques reflected a \nmature appreciation of the Constitution and laws of the United States, \nan understanding of the threat terrorists pose to our Nation, and a \ndeep respect for the rights of Americans.\n  Her accomplishments were noteworthy in and of themselves, but they \nare remarkable considering the personal struggle that Ivy was waging \nthroughout her tenure on the committee.\n  Shortly before joining my staff, her doctors found a tumor in her \njaw. She endured multiple surgeries, numerous rounds of chemotherapy \nand radiation, and other difficult treatments that sapped her strength \nand energy.\n  But neither the cancer nor the treatments could destroy Ivy's \ndetermination or spirit. Ivy insisted on carrying a full workload. She \nwas always concerned that her treatments might place additional burdens \non her colleagues, and she never complained about the hand she had been \ndealt.\n  On more than one occasion, we tried to tell Ivy to stop e-mailing \nfrom her BlackBerry while she was waiting for treatments. When a \nparticularly grueling round of treatments or an extensive surgery was \non the horizon, and with everything she was undergoing at the time, Ivy \nthought of others and let us know she would be watching her BlackBerry \nif we needed her for anything.\n  And we often did. The trust Ivy had earned from me and my senior \nstaff was such that we regularly sought her guidance on matters across \nthe board. Ivy was ``a lawyer's lawyer''--even the most skilled lawyers \non my staff regularly sought her thoughts on issues because her \nknowledge of the law and her reasoned approach to problem solving was \nindispensable when complex problems required careful analysis.\n  In her professional life, and her pain, Ivy was intensely private. \nFew knew how ill Ivy actually was because while she suffered, her work \nnever did.\n  There are times in our lives, whether professional or personal, when \nwe know the right person has come into our lives, and that was the case \nfor us with Ivy. It brought a heartfelt smile to my face when Ivy's \nmother told me that Ivy had called her time with us her ``dream job.''\n  Ivy's courage and determination will continue to serve as an \ninspiration for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8393-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO AGNES WELCH\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I pay special tribute to \nAgnes Welch, a member of the Baltimore City Council and a dedicated \npublic servant. Councilwoman Welch, who was first elected to the \nBaltimore City Council in 1983, is retiring after serving her community \nand her city in the council for almost three decades.\n  Councilwoman Welch has always been attuned to the needs of her west \nBaltimore community and loyal to her faith. She has been a trailblazer \nfor women, African Americans, and her constituents. Her committee work \nin the city council helped shape the renaissance of Baltimore's \ndowntown and the redevelopment of its neighborhoods. Her work with not-\nfor-profit organizations and city agencies has created new \nopportunities for child care, family health care, better schools, and \nsenior housing. Councilwoman Welch's work with the Catholic Archdiocese \nhas improved the Church's outreach to and accommodation for people of \ncolor and it has improved services for the neighborhoods and \ncommunities surrounding the churches. As a result of her outstanding \nservice and dedication to the church, she received the Papal Medal \n``pro ecclesia et pontifice'' from Pope John Paul II.\n  Legislatively, Councilwoman Welch has demonstrated her concern for \nthe welfare of her constituents, particularly those people living in \npoverty. She sponsored legislation which created the framework for \naddressing homelessness. Another legislative proposal funded a study \ninto the increase in teenage homicides. Most recently, she introduced \nlegislation to establish a Task Force on Childhood Obesity.\n  Councilwoman Agnes Welch has been an outstanding public servant, \nworking selflessly, tirelessly, and effectively on behalf of others. I \nask my colleagues to join me today in thanking Councilwoman Welch for \nher dedication to her community and constituents, and in wishing her \nwell in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8393-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8393-S8394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TOM MONAHAN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, I would like to celebrate \nthe extraordinary career of newsman Tom Monahan, who, after 40 years of \npolitical reporting for NBC Connecticut, is semi-retiring. I first came \nto know Tom in the early seventies when he covered me in the \nConnecticut General Assembly, and I have greatly admired his work and \npersonality ever since.\n  Tom is a native of Bristol, CT, who began his career in broadcast \nradio. He started reporting sports when he first joined NBC CT, and \nthen graduated through the ranks to eventually become the station's \nchief political reporter and one of Connecticut's very finest.\n  Much can be said about Tom's skill as a journalist, but his integrity \nimmediately comes to mind. Edward R. Murrow, the great television \nbroadcaster, once said ``we cannot make good news out of bad \npractice,'' and Tom's career surely embodied that principle. At a time \nwhen journalism is increasingly defined by attacks and negativity, Tom \nrepresents something of the ``old guard'' fact-driven reporting meant \nto inform and educate. He was always interested in getting the story \nout, but not interested in ``getting'' the public official who was part \nof the story. For so many years, the people of Connecticut who watched \nhim came to rely on him for his truthfulness, and in the end many of us \nwho were privileged to be in public life during his career wanted to \nhelp him get the story because we had such respect for and confidence \nin him.\n  I have so many memories from over the years with Tom, but one stands \nout above the others. I remember the morning in August 2000 when Vice \nPresident Gore announced that he had selected me to be his Vice \nPresidential running mate. I was in my house in New Haven, CT, and the \nnumber of satellite and TV trucks outside began to grow, in effect \nbarricading me in. The Gore campaign team flew in from Nashville and my \nnew press secretary said to me in my kitchen, ``Sir, the initial \nreaction to Vice President Gore's selecting you as his running mate has \nbeen tremendous and, if you speak to the press outside, you can only \ndetract\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\nfrom the positive coverage we're getting.'' As we walk out the side \ndoor to head to the airport, who, of course, was standing right there \nbut Tom Monahan. Needless to say, I went over and spoke to Tom--how was \nI not to?\n  As I reflect on Tom's career, I cannot help but think how much he \nwill be missed, and how grateful Connecticut should be for the \ninvaluable service he provided us. We are undoubtedly better off for \nhaving had Tom Monahan as a reporter. I wish him and his wonderful \nfamily my very best as he moves on to an exciting new chapter in his \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8394-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING ROBBINS BARSTOW\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life and \nwork of Robbins Barstow of Hartford, CT, a great filmmaker, \nconservationist, and dedicated member of the community.\n  Robbins Barstow has come to hold a special place in the hearts and \nminds of thousands of families across the country through the tender \nand illuminating documentary films he produced over the years. Mr. \nBarstow captured the lives and aspirations of ordinary people in mid-\ncentury America, most famously in his film ``Disneyland Dream'' which \nthe Library of Congress included in its National Film Registry for its \ncultural and artistic significance, calling it a ``priceless and \nauthentic record of time and place.''\n  Mr. Barstow brought a similar sensitivity and talent to his \nprofessional work with the Connecticut Education Association, where he \nworked tirelessly on behalf of teachers and public schools across our \nstate. Mr. Barstow believed deeply in the power of education to \ntransform our country and the world, and he dedicated so much of his \nlife to ensuring that our teachers got the respect and acknowledgement \nthat they so greatly deserve.\n  I also admired Mr. Barstow deeply for his extraordinary efforts as a \nconservationist. He held a special interest in whales and brought his \ninterest and passion for the environment and natural world to founding \nCetacean Society International, a conservation, education, and research \norganization with ties to over 25 nations. Mr. Barstow made a number of \nfilms about endangered species that will continue to inform us of the \nimportance of conservation and inspire future conservationists for \nyears to come.\n  The State of Connecticut and our Nation more broadly are blessed to \nhave leaders like Robbins Barstow in our communities. He will be deeply \nmissed and his important contributions and unforgettable spirit will \nnever fade from our memory. My thoughts and prayers are with the entire \nBarstow family: his wife Margaret, his children David, Dan, and Cedar, \nhis grandchildren, and great-grandchild.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8394-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. MILO SHULT\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I honor an Arkansan for his \ncontribution to Arkansas and our Nation. Dr. Milo Shult served as vice \npresident of the University of Arkansas's Division of Agriculture for \nthe past 18 years, improving living conditions for many Arkansans and \nAmericans. After so many years of service, he has decided to step down \nfrom his position and move to the next chapter of his life. He leaves \nbehind a positive, lasting legacy. While he is stepping down from his \ncurrent position with the university, he will undoubtedly continue to \nplay an active role in promoting agriculture and enhancing the lives of \nAmericans.\n  The Division of Agriculture at the University of Arkansas, which was \nheaded by Dr. Shult, plays an integral role in improving the lives of \nindividuals all over the State and Nation through its work on campus \nand in the field. The mission of the division is to enrich the lives of \nneighbors by drawing on what is learned from research and using \noutreach skills. They meet this mission by maintaining a strong \npresence throughout Arkansas, which is critical given the importance of \nagriculture to our economy and way of life. Agriculture contributes 12 \npercent of Arkansas's gross State product and is responsible for more \nthan one in every six jobs in the State. We are proud to be ranked in \nthe top 25 among States in the production of 24 agricultural \ncommodities, and we rank in the top 5 for rice, broilers, upland \ncotton, cottonseed, catfish, turkeys, and sweet potatoes.\n  Becoming such a successful and diverse agriculture State requires an \nactive research and extension service that is innovative and \nresourceful. Dr. Shult developed a solid division system that currently \nemploys cooperative extension faculty in all 75 counties; agricultural \nexperiment station scientists and extension specialists on 5 university \ncampuses and at 5 research and extension centers; and support personnel \nat 8 research stations. These employees provide Arkansans with \ninformational resources related to agriculture production and \nprocessing; environment, energy and climate; family and youth programs; \naccess to safe and nutritious foods; and community development. These \nresources serve as tools to positively impact lives and communities in \nArkansas and make our Nation and world better.\n  While vice president of the Division of Agriculture, Dr. Shult \nexhibited excellent leadership ability moving the division forward. Dr. \nShult possessed exemplary skill in working with stakeholders and \nbuilding relationships while executing the division's programs \nconsistent with its mission. The division grew and prospered under his \nleadership, and it stands poised to meet the many challenges and needs \nof the 21st century. During his tenure, Dr. Shult oversaw the \ndevelopment of over $72 million in new construction and facility \nupgrades, including new construction or improvements to every Research \nStation and Research and Extension Center across the State. Today these \nfacilities are state of the art and the envy of other States and \nnations. With Dr. Shult at the helm, the division kept with the times \nand always planned for the future by turning challenges into \nopportunity. He leaves behind an improved division and an improved \nState with a vision of where it needs to go to meet future challenges.\n  While I and others will certainly miss Dr. Shult's work at the \ndivision, I am excited to know he will remain active in agriculture \nresearch, extension and education. Dr. Shult was recently appointed to \nthe National Agricultural Research, Extension, Education and Economics \nAdvisory Board. In this position, Dr. Shult will advise the Secretary \nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture and land-grant colleges and \nuniversities on top national priorities and policies for food and \nagricultural research, education, extension, and economics. This is a \nhuge compliment to Dr. Shult and is a result of his efforts at the \nUniversity of Arkansas. He will provide outstanding leadership on the \nboard, and I am sure he will bring a unique perspective that is needed \nand desired.\n  Dr. Milo Shult is an inspiration and a proven leader of people and \norganizations. He is a family man with many friends and associates. I \nhave enjoyed working with him in my capacity as U.S. Senator, and I \nknow the entire Arkansas congressional delegation is appreciative of \nhis kindness and genuine efforts. His passion, leadership, and \ninfluence greatly increased the readiness and effectiveness of the \nUniversity of Arkansas's Division of Agriculture. I appreciate his \nservice to the people of Arkansas, and I wish him well in his continued \nservice to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8394-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8394-S8395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING STERLING ROPE COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, American manufacturers have faced a \nvariety of persistent challenges over the past several decades, \nincluding competition from foreign markets and rising structural costs. \nNonetheless, the manufacturing industry remains resilient in the United \nStates. The sector still supports roughly 18.6 million jobs in the \nUnited States, or approximately one-sixth of all private sector jobs, \nand American manufacturing produces $1.6 trillion of value every year \nequaling 11 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. And just yesterday, \nwe got word from the Institute for Supply Management, or ISM, that \nNovember marked the 16th straight month of positive growth for American \nmanufacturing. And so, today I recognize one of Maine's remarkable \nsmall manufacturing companies, Sterling Rope Company, which has been \nproducing high quality rope for more than a decade and a half.\n  Sterling Rope got its beginnings in 1993, when president and founder \nCarolyn Brodsky opened her business in Massachusetts. By 1997, Ms. \nBrodsky\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\ndecided to relocate her firm to Maine for a number of reasons, \nincluding our State's high-skilled workforce and quality of life. Over \nthe past 13 years, Sterling Rope has grown in size, moving from its \noriginal Maine location in Scarborough to a larger facility in Saco, \nbefore settling at its present location in the Biddeford Industrial \nPark.\n  The company manufactures rope for a plethora of activities an uses, \nincluding climbing, rope rescue, and industrial safety. In particular, \nSterling Rope prides itself as a leader in the advancement and \nproduction of life safety rope and cord. One of the company's products, \nthe FireTech 32, is the direct result of its partnership with New York \nCity's Fire Department, which provided Sterling with feedback on how to \nbest construct the rope. The FireTech 32 is now FDNY's official escape \nrope. Indeed, the firm is noted for its exceptionally creative and \ncollaborative product development. The company has created a Sterling \nAthletes Team, which is a collection of expert climbers from around the \nworld that test Sterling's products and provided critical feedback for \nthe company.\n  Additionally, Sterling helps promote and support a variety of \nclimbing events and philanthropic efforts on its multifaceted Web site. \nOne inspiring event that Sterling has publicized is the Climb for \nCancer Cure, a mountain-climbing fundraiser held each summer since 2006 \nto raise both funds and awareness for people suffering because of \ncancer. All of the money raised from the climbs goes to help comfort \ncancer patients at the Marshall L. and Susan Gibson Pavilion at Maine \nMedical Center in Portland, by donating amenities like CD and DVD \nplayers. Climb for Cancer Cure also provides family members with \nbaskets containing gift cards to help them defray the costs associated \nwith visiting their loved ones, such as for lodging and gas. I thank \nSterling Rope for recognizing this tremendous initiative.\n  Sterling Rope is a prime example of a leading manufacturing company \nin my home State that is dedicated to making quality products and \nproviding responsiveness to its customers. I am proud that Carolyn \nBrodsky moved her company to Maine nearly a decade and a half ago, and \nI hope she continues to expand her extraordinary operations. I thank \nher and everyone at Sterling Rope Company for their hard work, and wish \nthem continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8395-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Inouye) reported that he had signed \nthe following enrolled bills, which were previously signed by the \nSpeaker of the House:\n\n       H.R. 6162.

A bill to provide for improvements to the United States \nPostal Service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The U.S. Postal \nService Improvements Act of 2010. This bill would help the U.S. Postal \nService regain its financial footing as it adapts to the era of \nincreasingly digital communications.\n  The storied history of the Postal Service predates our Constitution. \nIn 1775, the Second Continental Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin as \nthe first Postmaster General and directed the creation of a line of \npostsfrom Falmouth in New England to Savannah in Georgia. The \nConstitution also gives Congress the power to establish post offices \nand post roads.\n  Today, the Postal Service is the linchpin of a $1 trillion mailing \nindustry that employs approximately 7.5 million Americans in fields as \ndiverse as direct mail, printing, catalog companies, paper \nmanufacturing, and financial services.\n  Postal Service employees deliver mail 6 days a week to hundreds of \nmillions of households and businesses. From our largest cities to our \nsmallest towns, from the Hawaiian Islands to Alaskan reservations, the \nPostal Service is a vital part of our national communications network \nand an icon of American culture.\n  But the financial state of the Postal Service is abysmal. The numbers \nare grim: the Postal Service recently announced that it lost $8.5 \nbillion in fiscal year 2010. The Great Recession, high operating costs, \nand the continuing diversion of mail to electronic alternatives have \nchallenged the Postal Services ability to remain financially viable.\n  Faced with this much red ink, the Postal Service must reinvent \nitself. It must increase revenues by increasing its value to its \ncustomers and by becoming more cost effective.\n  Unfortunately, many of the solutions the Postal Service has proposed \nwould only aggravate its problems. Filing for enormous rate increases, \npursuing significant service reductions including elimination of \nSaturday mail delivery and seeking relief from funding its liabilities \nare not viable long-term solutions to the challenges confronting the \nPostal Service. These changes will drive more customers to less \nexpensive, digital alternatives. That downturn in customers will \nfurther erode mail volume and accelerate a death spiral for the Postal \nService.\n  The Postal Service must chart a new course in this digital age. It \nmust adopt a customer-focused culture. It must see the changing \ncommunications landscape as an opportunity.\n  The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, which I \nauthored, provides the foundation for these long-term changes, but the \nPostal Service has been slow to take advantage of some of the \nflexibilities afforded by that law. And, to be fair, the Postal Service \nhas encountered problems not of its making, such as a severe recession.\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\n  The legislation that I introduce today would help the Postal Service \nachieve financial stability and light the way to future cost savings \nwithout undermining customer service.\n  One area the legislation would help address is the more than $50 \nbillion that the Postal Regulatory Commission estimates the Postal \nService has overpaid into the Civil Service Retirement System, CSRS, \nand the nearly $3 billion it has overpaid into the Federal Employees \nRetirement System pension fund. It is simply unfair both to the Postal \nService and its customers not to refund these overpayments.\n  To address these inequities, the bill would allow the Postal Service \nto access amounts that it has overpaid into these pension funds. The \nPostal Service must be permitted to use these funds to address other \nfinancial obligations, like its payments for future retiree health \nbenefits and unfunded workers compensation liabilities and for repaying \nits existing debt.\n  I have pressed the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, to change its \ncalculation method for Postal Service payments into the CSRS fund \nconsistent with the 2006 Postal Reform law. OPM officials, however, \nstubbornly refuse to change this methodology or even to admit that the \n2006 postal law permits them to do so. This has created a bureaucratic \nstandoff that is unfair to the Postal Service. The OPM holds the life \npreserver it could help rescue the Postal Service, but it simply \nrefuses to throw it.\n  This legislation would direct the OPM to exercise its existing \nauthority under the 2006 postal reform law and to revise its \nmethodology for calculating the Postal Services obligations to the CSRS \npension fund. Once OPM exercises this authority, my legislation would \nallow the Postal Service to use any resulting overpayments to cover its \nannual payments into the Retiree Health Benefits Fund, rather than \nhaving to wait until after September 30, 2015, to access the CSRS \noverpayment.\n  Additionally, the legislation would allow the Postal Service to \naccess the nearly $3 billion it has overpaid into the Federal Employees \nRetirement System, FERS, pension fund. The legislation would grant OPM \nthis authority by adopting language, similar to section 802(c) of the \n2006 postal reform law, that allows OPM to recalculate the methodology \ngoverning Postal Service payments into the FERS pension fund.\n  As with the CSRS overpayment, the Postal Service would be permitted \nto use the FERS overpayment to meet its statutory obligations to the \nRetiree Health Benefits Fund. These fund transfers would greatly \nimprove the Postal Services financial condition.\n  If the CSRS and FERS overpayment amounts are sufficient to fully fund \nthe Postal Services obligations to the Retiree Health Benefits Fund, \nthis legislation would allow the Postal Service to pay its workers \ncompensation liabilities, which top $1 billion annually. The Postal \nService may also choose to use these funds to pay down its existing \ndebt, which currently is $12 billion.\n  Second, the legislation would improve the Postal Services contracting \npractices and help prevent the kind of ethical violations recently \nuncovered by the Postal Service inspector general.\n  Several months ago, I asked the Postal Service inspector general to \nreview the Postal Services contracting policies. The findings of these \ninspector general audits were shocking. The IG found stunning evidence \nof costly contract mismanagement, ethical lapses, and financial waste.\n  In its review of the Postal Services contracting policies, the IG \ndiscovered no-bid contracts and examples of apparent cronyism. The \nPostal Services contract management did not protect it from waste, \nfraud, and abuse. Indeed, it left the door wide open.\n  As a result, the Postal Service could not even identify how many \ncontracts were awarded without competition. Of the no-bid contracts the \nIG reviewed, 35 percent lacked justification.\n  In one of the more egregious examples of waste and abuse, the IG \ndiscovered that more than 2,700 contracts had been awarded to former \nemployees since 1991. Looking at the past 3 years, the IG found that \n359 were awarded as no-bid contracts. And 17 of those noncompetitive \ncontracts went to career executives within 1 year of their separation \nfrom the Postal Service.\n  Additionally, some former executives were brought back at nearly \ntwice their former pay to advise newly hired executives--an outrageous \npractice that the IG said raised serious ethical questions, hurt \nemployee morale, and tarnished the Postal Services public image. In one \nexample, an executive received a $260,000 no-bid contract in July 2009, \njust 2 months after retiring. The purpose: to train his successor.\n  My legislation would help remedy many of the contracting issues the \nIG identified. Specifically, the bill would direct the Postmaster \nGeneral to establish a competition advocate, responsible for reviewing \nand approving justifications for noncompetitive purchases and for \ntracking the level of agency competition. The competition advocate also \nwould be required to submit an annual report on Postal Service \nprocurement to the Postmaster General, the Board of Governors, the \nPostal Regulatory Commission, and the Congress.\n  To improve transparency and accountability, the bill also would \nrequire the Postal Service to publish justifications of noncompetitive \ncontracts greater than $150,000 on its Web Site. This transparency \nwould improve the Postal Services contracting practices and promote \ncompetition.\n  To resolve the ethical issues documented by the IG, the bill would \nlimit procurement officials from contracting with closely associated \nentities. It also would require the Postal Services ethics official to \nreview any ethics concerns that the contracting office identifies prior \nto awarding a contract.\n  Third, the legislation includes several provisions that would enhance \nefficiency and reduce costs. The Postal Service has made efforts to \nreduce costs over the past several years. But more must be done.\n  One area where improvements can be made is in the consolidation of \narea and district offices. The IG found that the Postal Services \nregional structure--eight area offices and 74 district offices costing \napproximately $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2009--has significant room \nfor consolidation. My bill would require the Postal Service to create a \ncomprehensive strategic plan to guide consolidation efforts--a road map \nfor future savings.\n  The bill would also require the Postal Service to develop a plan to \nincrease its presence in retail facilities, or co-locate, to better \nserve customers. Before co-location decisions could be made, however, \nthe bill would direct the Postal Service to weigh the impact of any \ndecision on small communities and rural areas. Moreover, the Postal \nService would be required to solicit community input before making \ndecisions about co-location and to ensure that co-location does not \ndiminish the quality of service.\n  Fourth, the bill includes a provision that would require the \narbitrator to consider the Postal Services financial condition when \nrendering decisions about collective bargaining agreements. This \nlogical provision would allow critical financial information to be \nweighed as a factor in contract negotiations.\n  Finally, the bill would reduce workforce-related costs government-\nwide by converting retirement eligible postal and federal employees on \nworkers compensation to retirement when they reach retirement age. This \nis a commonsense change that would significantly reduce expenses that \nboth the Postal Service and the Federal Government cannot afford to \nsustain.\n  In fiscal year 2010, the Department of Labor paid approximately $2.7 \nbillion to employees on workers compensation. This includes \napproximately $1 billion in workers compensation benefits to postal \nemployees. More than 8,600 of postal employees covered by workers \ncompensation are over the age of 55. The Department of Labor indicates \nthat Federal employees across the government are receiving workers \ncompensation benefits into their 80s, 90s, and even 100s. At the Postal \nService alone, more than 1,000 employees currently receiving workers \ncompensation benefits are 80 years or older. Incredibly, 132 of these \nindividuals are 90 years of age and older and there are three who are \n98.\n  The Postal Service is at a crossroads; it must choose the correct \npath. It must take steps toward a bright future.\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\nIt must reject the path of severe service reductions and huge rate \nhikes, which will only alienate customers.\n  The Postal Service must reinvent itself. It must embrace changes to \nrevitalize its business model, enabling it to attract and keep \ncustomers. The U.S. Postal Service Improvements Act of 2010 will help \nspark new life into this institution, helping it evolve and maintain \nits vital role in American society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Brown of \n        Massachusetts):\n  S. 4004. A bill to amend section 798 of title 18, United States Code, \nto provide penalties for disclosure of classified information related \nto certain intelligence activities and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to address a new and very \nserious threat to our national security.\n  In July of this year, the organization known as WikiLeaks, led by an \nAustralian citizen named Julian Assange, published 90,000 classified \nintelligence documents related to our efforts in the ongoing war \nagainst the Taliban insurgents and al-Qaida in Afghanistan.\n  In October, WikiLeaks dumped 400,000 classified documents that \nrevolved around the efforts of our Nation and our coalition partners to \nbring democracy, peace, and stability to the people of Iraq.\n  Now, just a few days ago, WikiLeaks has dumped another 250,000 \ndocuments that reveal private, often personal, communications between \ndiplomats and heads of state--communication that is necessary for the \ncritical discourse that occurs between governments on the many relevant \nand challenging international issues of our day.\n  In light of the damage that has already been done and the continuing \nthreat posed by WikiLeaks, I am here to introduce a bill that will help \ndefend our national interests, protect our troops, and provide \nassurance to our friends and allies that what they say to us in private \nwill stay with us, and that there will be consequences for the reckless \nactions taken by WikiLeaks, or others, who may attempt to do what they \nhave done--consequences that are consistent with our values and with \nour first amendment.\n  Let me spend a few moments examining the nature of this threat and \nsome of the serious implications.\n  After WikiLeaks dumped 400,000 classified documents concerning our \nefforts to promote democracy in Iraq, Pentagon spokesman Geoffrey \nMorrell stated the Department of Defense had to scramble to notify 300 \nIraqis because we were immediately concerned about their safety. He \nwent on to say that as many as 60,000 Iraqis could possibly be \nidentified in these leaked documents.\n  Let us consider the plight of those Iraqis just for a moment. These \nindividuals came forward to us with information that they felt would \nhelp their government deal with the insurgency and terrorist presence \nthat has been an impediment to peace and stability within their nation. \nYet this despicable character, Julian Assange, has rewarded their \nbravery by naming them to their enemies. This puts their very lives and \nthe lives of their families in jeopardy. This discourages other Iraqis \nfrom coming forward and standing up for freedom.\n  This, in turn, jeopardizes the lives of our American troops and harms \nour efforts to provide stability in Iraq to the point where we can \nwithdraw our troops.\n  Unfortunately, if Iraqis become afraid to speak out against the \nterrorists in their midst for fear of being named by Julian Assange, \nsucceeding becomes that much more difficult.\n  Let's turn to Afghanistan. Back in July, I read in the Times of \nLondon a very interesting assessment about the implication of Mr. \nAssange's actions. Let me quote:\n\n       Hundreds of Afghans' lives have been put at risk by the \n     leaking of 90,000 intelligence documents because the files \n     identify informants working with NATO forces.\n\n  Let me quote again from the Times:\n\n       In just two hours of searching the WikiLeaks archive, the \n     Times found the names of dozens of Afghans credited with \n     providing detailed intelligence to U.S. forces. Their \n     villages are given for identification and also, in many \n     cases, their fathers' names.\n\n  To the credit of the Times, they cited examples to back up their \nclaims. But as any responsible media organization should, they at \nleast, in their report, took the steps of hiding the names of the \nvillagers who came forward with information to assist their government \nand NATO.\n  Madam President, just as WikiLeaks recklessly dumped the leaked \nintelligence on Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesperson gave an interview \nin which he said:\n\n       We are studying the report. . . .We will investigate \n     through our own secret service whether the people mentioned \n     are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, \n     then we know how to punish them.\n\n  I don't think I need to elaborate on how the Taliban punishes their \nenemies.\n  Now we have this latest dump of classified State Department cables \nand information. I applaud our former colleague, Secretary Clinton, for \nthe excellent remarks she has made on this issue. She pointed out that \nthe leaks have put people's lives in danger, threatened our national \nsecurity, and undermined our efforts to work with other countries to \nsolve shared problems.\n  An essential dialog takes place between nations--a dialog that has \nexisted since nations first began. With that dialog, diplomats need to \nbe able to express their views candidly and, yes, privately. This is \nhow a lot of problems are solved.\n  Our Nation is working toward international solutions to some very \ncomplex problems. The Government of Yemen is fighting terrorists that \nreside within their own borders. The proliferation of nuclear weapons \ntechnology and the threat of long-range missiles in North Korea are \nproblems that require multilateral international engagement.\n  Secretary Clinton made another point I will focus on for a moment. \nAssange didn't just leak classified details about meetings between \ndiplomats. Our diplomats overseas meet with local human rights workers, \njournalists, religious leaders, and others--people with unique insight \ninto a wider range of issues.\n  Unfortunately, we live in a dangerous world where revealing the \nidentity of someone fighting for social issues, such as women's rights \nor children's rights or the identity of an advocate for religious \nfreedom could have serious repercussions that include imprisonment, \ntorture, or even death.\n  I wonder if WikiLeaks understands if Afghan villagers or activists \nfighting for human rights under oppressive regimes are killed as a \nresult of being named in these leaks, the blood of these good people is \non their hands.\n  Before I proceed with an examination of the bill that I have crafted \nto address this threat, let's be clear about some things. No one should \ndo Julian Assange any credit by referring to him as a journalist or as \npart of the news media. He is a computer hacker and an anarchist.\n  True to his hacker roots, he has devised a portal through which he \nhopes members of our government will anonymously and surreptitiously \nprovide him unfettered access to our closest secrets.\n  Make no mistake, these actions have harmed our friends and helped our \nenemies in a manner prejudicial to the safety and national interest of \nthe United States.\n  So with this threat in mind, a threat that the Founders could have \nnever seen coming, we have crafted a bill that amends the Espionage \nAct, specifically Title 18, Section 798.\n  Under current law, it is a criminal act for someone who knowingly and \nwillfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, publishes, or otherwise \nmakes available to any unauthorized person any classified information \nconcerning the communication intelligence activities of our United \nStates of America.\n  My bill, which we are introducing today, extends this protection \ncurrently afforded to the communications intelligence to human \nintelligence, known as HUMINT. This bill protects human intelligence \nsources and methods. I want to be very clear. It is my opinion that we \ncan go after Julian Assange under the current statute. But what our \nlegislation does is updates this decades-old statute to address this \nevolving threat prospectively.\n  I have no doubt that Assange is going to put out another document \ndump on\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\nhis Web site and another one after that. Once he does, this bill would \ngive the administration increased flexibility to deal with him and \npotentially other copycat organizations that aspire to his likeness.\n  There are a couple of concerns I want to address. First, one might \nwonder how this bill stands with our first amendment. While I hope we \ncan all agree that Julian Assange is no journalist, some might wonder \nif the amended law that would result from this bill could be applied to \nthe news media. It is pretty frustrating for the intelligence community \nwhen communications intelligence sources and methods are blown.\n  When this happens, sources of vital intelligence dry up or become \ninaccessible, and potentially millions of defense dollars go down the \ndrain. However, despite the serious consequences associated with losing \na communications intelligence source or method, and the damage that \ndoes to our national security, no Presidential administration has ever \nprosecuted a member of the news media under the existing statute, which \nhas been on the books since 1951.\n  Let's face it, leaks do happen. As Secretary Gates stated just a few \ndays ago, regrettably, our government leaks classified information like \na sieve. This bill does not stop anybody from publishing leaks, but it \ndoes provide legal incentive to Julian Assange to do what Amnesty \nInternational has repeatedly asked him to do: be more responsible about \nhow classified leaks are handled by not revealing the identity of these \nclassified human intelligence sources.\n  Let me be clear. This bill doesn't target journalists. Instead, it \nprovides flexibility for the Attorney General with a targeted solution \nand increased flexibility to deal with WikiLeaks.\n  Some might be wondering whether Julian Assange, who is a foreign \ncitizen, can be prosecuted under the Espionage Act. In fact, the courts \nlong ago established that he can be prosecuted under these statutes.\n  I am not a lawyer, but if you study the United States v. Zehe from \n1986, it becomes immediately clear that Assange can be prosecuted under \nthe Espionage Act.\n  That said, my concern is that our existing laws may have some \nloopholes through which he can escape. In fact, just a few days ago in \nthe Washington Post, I read where Attorney General Holder said:\n\n       To the extent that there are gaps in our laws . . . we will \n     move to close those gaps.\n\n  Well, I submit that the bill I am introducing today, with a couple of \nothers, will do just that. It closes a gap in our laws and it moves to \nprotect vital human intelligence sources and methods consistent with \nthe manner in which current law communications intelligence is already \nprotected.\n  I thank Senators Lieberman and Brown of Massachusetts for joining me \nin this important legislation and for the input Senators Lieberman and \nBrown of Massachusetts have given me on this important legislation.\n  I hope we can take up this bill, consider it, work with the \nadministration, work with the House, and pass this important \nlegislation so the next time, and we know there will be a next time, \nthat Julian Assange and his associates leak classified intelligence \nthat puts people's lives in danger, we can actually have another tool \nin the arsenal so our Department of Justice can go after these \ndespicable people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8400-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 692--CONGRATULATING THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS ON \n               WINNING THE 2010 WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 693, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 693) condemning the attack by the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the Republic of \n     Korea, and affirming support for the United States-Republic \n     of Korea Alliance.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to have my name added as a \ncosponsor of that measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 693) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 693\n\n       Whereas Yeonpyeong Island is located in the Yellow Sea \n     (West Sea) about 50 miles west of the city of Incheon and is \n     inhabited by more than 1,000 citizens and military personnel \n     from the Republic of Korea;\n       Whereas the United Nations Command established the Northern \n     Limit Line in 1953, marking the line of military control \n     between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the \n     Republic of Korea;\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2010, the Republic of Korea \n     military conducted military exercises in the Yellow Sea (West \n     Sea) on the southern side of the Northern Limit Line;\n       Whereas, on that day, North Korea military forces fired \n     approximately 170 artillery shells at Yeonpyeong Island, \n     resulting in military and civilian casualties, including the \n     death of 2 marines and 2 civilians from the Republic of \n     Korea;\n       Whereas North Korea's shelling caused widespread damage to \n     military installations and civilian property;\n       Whereas North Korea's attack against South Korea infringes \n     upon the commitments made in the Korean War Armistice \n     Agreement of 1953 that oblige military commanders to ``order \n     and enforce a complete cessation of all hostilities in Korea \n     by all armed forces under their control'';\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\n       Whereas this attack also violates United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1695 (2006), which emphasizes the need for \n     North Korea ``to show restraint and refrain from any action \n     that might aggravate tension, and to continue to work on the \n     resolution of non-proliferation concerns through political \n     and diplomatic efforts'';\n       Whereas this brazen attack is one in a series of actions by \n     the Government of North Korea that undermine regional peace \n     and security, especially on the Korean peninsula;\n       Whereas this attack follows the March 26, 2010, torpedo \n     attack by the Government of North Korea against the Republic \n     of Korea ship CHEONAN, which resulted in the death of 46 \n     sailors from the Republic of Korea Navy;\n       Whereas this attack also follows the revelation that the \n     Government of North Korea has constructed a uranium \n     enrichment facility at the Yongbyon nuclear site in clear \n     violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 \n     (2006) and 1874 (2009);\n       Whereas this attack and the trend of continued provocation \n     by the Government of North Korea reinforces the importance of \n     the alliance between the United States and the Republic of \n     Korea and the need for the United States to maintain a strong \n     military presence in East Asia; and\n       Whereas this attack also signifies the importance of \n     maintaining a strong bilateral economic, security, and \n     cultural relationship with the Republic of Korea: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the attack by the Government of North Korea \n     against the Republic of Korea in violation of the 1953 Korean \n     War Armistice Agreement;\n       (2) expresses its deep condolences to the government and \n     people of the Republic of Korea, especially the families on \n     Yeonpyeong Island who suffered from this attack and lost \n     their loved ones;\n       (3) recognizes that maintaining peace on the Korean \n     peninsula requires constant vigilance, and continues to stand \n     with the people and the Government of the Republic of Korea \n     in this time of crisis;\n       (4) calls on the international community, especially North \n     Korea's ally, China, to condemn this attack and enjoin the \n     Government of North Korea to halt all nuclear activities in \n     accord with United Nations Security Council resolutions 1718 \n     (2006) and 1874 (2009) and refrain from any further actions \n     that may destabilize the Korean Peninsula;\n       (5) calls on the President to work with the Government of \n     the Republic of Korea to take all necessary steps to deter \n     further aggression by the Government of North Korea, in \n     keeping with the security alliance between the United States \n     and the Republic of Korea;\n       (6) urges the Administration to continue a bilateral \n     economic relationship with the Republic of Korea; and\n       (7) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to its \n     alliance with the Republic of Korea for the preservation of \n     peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and throughout \n     the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/02/senate-section/article/S8444-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2010\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
