Madam President, today is the 40th anniversary of Earth \nDay. It is an annual reminder of what we have the power and \nresponsibility to do in our daily lives. It is a call to recommit \nourselves to finding the right balance that preserves our larger \nenvironment even as we live in it and use it. Earth Day is also an \nopportunity for us to appreciate the great outdoors, spaces that are \nnowhere more beautiful than in Nevada.\n  But today, of course, is not the only day to do this. That is why I \nam happy to have supported a number of environmental initiatives over \nthe past years to benefit my State and our country: protecting more \nthan 3 million acres of key wildlife habitat as wilderness in the State \nof Nevada; introducing legislation that created the Great Basin \nNational Park; providing more resources and better management for \npopular areas such as Red Rock Canyon and Black Rock Desert; enhancing \nthe Carson River corridor and improving management of the Sierra \nFoothills, and expanding open space opportunities for the people of \nCarson City.\n  Right now, I am working with the Nevada congressional delegation to \nprotect the Tahoe Basin from invasive species and devastating wildfires \nand to restore Lake Tahoe's water clarity and protect threatened \nspecies and wildlands. The act will also help protect the area's \neconomy and its 23,000 tourism-related jobs.\n  Every Nevadan and all Americans should be happy today and use it as a \nreminder to commit themselves to saving money and reducing pollution by \nusing energy more efficiently.\n  A Senator from Wisconsin named Gaylord Nelson created Earth Day 40 \nyears ago. He did it after having visited, in his official capacity, a \ndevastating oil spill off the coast of California near Santa Barbara. \nHe came back and said to his staff: We need to do more to protect the \nenvironment. Give me some ideas.\n  The idea started out originally to be a day where they would march, \nand someone came up with the idea, though, that rather than \n``birthday,'' ``Earth Day'' had a ring to it. That is how Earth Day was \nborn. It came at a time when we didn't have the Internet. It was done \nmostly by word of mouth.\n  Just before the first Earth Day, Gaylord Nelson came to the Senate \nfloor and warned:\n\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\n\n       America has bought environmental disaster on the \n     installment plan: Buy affluence now and let future \n     generations pay the price.\n\n  Four decades later, we must do more to get ourselves off that plan. \nWe must do more to cultivate a society where fulfilling our \nresponsibilities to nature becomes second nature.\n  I didn't know Gaylord Nelson, but I certainly feel I knew him because \nof the great work he has done. I have many of these Earth Days in \nNevada. It is really a day of celebration.\n  That is something we have to do. We have to do everything we can to \nprotect our environment.\n  Would the Chair announce morning business now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2536-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to talk a little bit about the \nWall Street reform bill that the Senate Banking Committee has been \nworking on for the last 6 months. It is my hope we can get this bill \nthrough this body and off the floor very soon.\n  In the past 48 hours, I have been very encouraged by what I have \nheard as far as the progress of negotiations between Chairman Dodd and \nSenator Shelby. I urge my colleagues to keep up the good work but \nremind them that actions speak louder than words and that now is the \ntime for action.\n  So my message is clear. Let's get this done. I hope we are now at a \npoint beyond creating rhetoric, where we can get down to resolving \noutstanding issues in a constructive way. We need to end the era of too \nbig to fail once and for all and end taxpayer-funded bailouts that came \nwith that too big to fail.\n  I voted against both bailouts of Wall Street and the U.S. auto \nindustry because I thought taxpayers were getting a raw deal. I do not \nbelieve in bailouts. But I do believe in making sure there are referees \non Wall Street to make sure the big banks and the investment firms play \nby the rules to make sure taxpayers and Main Street small businesses do \nnot pay the price of the sins of Wall Street.\n  The strong resolution authority and prefunding mechanism included in \nthis bill will strengthen taxpayer protections. Requiring big Wall \nStreet companies to pay into this fund and forcing failing firms into \nbankruptcy is not going to lead to more bailouts; it, in fact, will \nhave the opposite effect.\n  But if my Republican colleagues have other ideas about how to provide \nstrong resolution authority to protect taxpayers, I look forward to \nworking with them. So let's stop the rhetoric and get down to the \nbusiness our constituents sent us to do. We need to address the worst \nfinancial calamity since the Great Depression.\n  Let me also say how much I appreciate the work of my colleagues who \nhave been willing to talk in a thoughtful way about these issues. I \nwish to say thank you to Senator Corker for speaking the truth, for \nrightly noting that some of the concerns that have been raised in this \nbill could have been resolved in 5 minutes.\n  After listening to some of my colleagues on the floor yesterday, I \nthink our concerns may be more alike than unalike. I am hopeful we can \nwork together to address common concerns.\n  Everyone knows we have a pretty good bill. My good friend, Senator \nShelby, says he agrees with 80 to 90 percent of what is in this bill. I \nam heartened by the newspapers yesterday that we may be close to an \nagreement. I hope that means we now have the political will to address \nsubstantive concerns and move forward with this bill.\n  When I was elected to the Senate, I vowed to make Washington look a \nlittle bit more like Montana. I hope we can show the people of Montana \nwe have the can-do attitude they expect in addressing problems of this \nmagnitude and in moving America out of this financial crisis.\n  The American people are watching. Montanans are still steaming mad \nabout the $700 billion bailout. I, similar to them, have a hard time \nunderstanding why we have not set the rules yet, rules to prevent the \nrisky behavior that got us into this mess nearly 2 years ago.\n  Let me say to all my friends in this Chamber: We have waited long \nenough. We simply cannot afford to wait any longer to reform Wall \nStreet. Doing nothing is not an option. Passing a watered-down version \nof this bill is also not an option. To do either of those would leave \nus in a vulnerable position, vulnerable to another collapse.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this speech is not meant to target or \nmalign anyone. It is simply to talk about the responsibilities we have \nas Members of Congress to our constituents.\n  Our country has been rocked by a financial crisis of epic \nproportions, one that will have Americans paying for generations to \ncome. It has shaken the public's faith not only in Wall Street but in \nthis institution, the Congress.\n  Whether it is Enron or Amaranth or Bernie Madoff or the Wall Street \nbailout, the American people are asking themselves a fundamental \nquestion: Can I even trust those guys in Washington to look out for me \nwhen it comes to the special interests creating rules of the game that \ntilt the board in their favor?\n  Some people listening today may be smiling and thinking: Senator, \nthat is one of the oldest questions and most frequently asked in \nWashington, DC: Whose side are you on? But never has this question of \n``whose side are you on'' had such dramatic consequences for the \neconomic lives of millions of Americans. Over 2 million people have \nlost their homes, many going into bankruptcy, 7.3 million jobs have \nbeen lost, and our government has put something like $24 trillion on \nthe line to help Wall Street in this meltdown--something taxpayers will \nbe paying for decades, to say nothing of the kids who will not go to \ncollege because college tuition went up 32 percent or workers whose \n401s have been wiped out, making it almost impossible to retire.\n  The American people have been let down by those involved in \ngovernment oversight who have feigned: Oh, this stuff is too complex \nfor us to understand. We better listen to those outside interests. They \nunderstand this better than I do.\n  It takes a mighty man, who was in control of our financial markets \nfor nearly two decades, like Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to admit his \nphilosophy was wrong. But it took even more dogged oversight by the \nlikes of Henry Waxman to take a subject that some people think is too \ncomplex to understand and boil it down to a simple yes-or-no question.\n  Congressman Waxman to Mr. Greenspan:\n\n       Mr. Greenspan, the premise that you could trust markets to \n     regulate themselves, were you wrong?\n\n  Mr. Greenspan, in response:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  Mr. Waxman to Mr. Greenspan:\n\n       Mr. Greenspan, you found that your view . . . your ideology \n     was not right.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan, in response:\n\n       Precisely.\n\n  This debate we are about to have on financial reform, in my mind, is \nreally about the backbone of Congress. The central issue before us \ntoday is whether Congress is going to continue to trust Wall Street and \nthose who represent them because there is too much complexity for \nCongress to understand. Really? Is it any more complicated than \nnational security or the Medicare GPCI reimbursement formulas or our \nTax Code in general? Really? Is it too complicated?\n  P.J. O'Rourke, at a recent dinner honoring journalists, said:\n\n       It's a fundamental principle of the rule of law, a \n     fundamental principle of economics, and a fundamental \n     principle of politics. . . . that beyond a certain point, \n     complexity is fraud.\n\n  I agree with him. How is it that average Americans know that a back-\nalley craps game with fixed dice is a no-win situation, yet a dark \nmarket with fixed financial instruments is allowed to carry on for more \nthan a decade under the mischaracterized title of ``free market''?\n  The issue is, we were told over the last 10 years by the Bush \neconomic working group--and, for that matter, the Clinton economic \nworking group and now even some members of the Obama economic working \ngroup--that these issues are too complex to understand. Really? Is that \nwhat happened when Bernie Madoff literally made off with millions of \ninvestors' life savings in a Ponzi scheme? It was not complex. And \nregulators were either afraid, lazy, or paid off when they failed to \nask a simple question: Let me see your books. When we deregulated \nenergy markets and Enron had at least one manipulation scheme for every \nday of the week--Death Star, Get Shorty, Ricochet, Fat Boy, just to \nname a few--these issues were not complex; it was simply shorting \nsupply to drive up the price.\n  No, the issue is not complexity. It is about the central issue of \nmarkets. They have to have transparency and oversight to operate \neffectively. Never more have the American people been counting on their \nMembers of Congress to act like David against the big Goliath, Wall \nStreet interests.\n  We have been repeatedly warned about derivatives. The Long-Term \nCapital Management crisis almost took down the world economy in 1998 \nbecause it started using complex mathematical formulas to do \nderivatives.\n  Then-Chairman Brooksley Born of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission proposed regulating derivatives. That was her agency's \nprimary role. Not only was she told by the President's working group \nshe could not, they helped mastermind a strategy with Congress to stop \nher. So instead of regulating derivatives, Congress passed a law making \nsure the oversight agency could not regulate them. And just for extra \nmeasure, we also prohibited State attorneys general from regulating \nthem as well.\n  Well, why, if you were on Wall Street, would you ever worry about \nwhat exotic financial tools you were cooking up if you knew there was \nno oversight? Let me say that there are people on Wall Street who \noperate ethically, without fraud, without manipulation, and provide an \nessential tool to our economy and functioning markets. But when you \ntake away the accountability of Wall Street, something happens to the \naccounting on Wall Street.\n  We have had many votes here in the last 10 years to regulate and have \noversight of the derivatives market and bring them out of the dark, and \nthose efforts have primarily failed because the so-called smartest guys \nin the room stopped us. Did it really take another near 1933 Depression \nto remind us of our fundamental role? I ask my colleagues to check \ntheir previous votes on derivatives and tell me whether they still want \nto vote the same way.\n  My constituents have been so disgusted by our lack of holding Wall \nStreet accountable, they have said: If\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\nyou can't beat them, then at least break them up. So I will be offering \nan amendment to return us to Glass-Steagall, the law of the land \nprevious to 2000, to help protect consumers for decades. And I will be \noffering an amendment to strengthen our antimanipulation laws to make \nsure that if manipulation happens in the future, there will be a price \nto be paid.\n  I will also say that my constituents want us to get this right and \nget capital flowing to small business. While Treasury turned the keys \nover to Wall Street to bail them out, small business is still being \nstrangled by the lack of access to capital.\n  As one quote says:\n\n       This then is more than the tale of one company's fall from \n     grace. It is at its base the story of a wrenching period of \n     economic and political tumult as revealed through a single \n     corporate scandal. It is a portrait of America in upheaval at \n     the turn of the century, torn between the worship of fast \n     money and its zeal for truth, between greed and high \n     mindedness, between Wall Street and Main Street. Ultimately \n     it is a story of untold damage wreaked by a nation's folly--a \n     folly that in time we are all but certain to see again.\n\n  I wish that quote was about our current crisis that started in 2008, \nbut it is not. That quote is from a book called ``Conspiracy of Fools'' \nby Kurt Eichenwald that was written in 2005. He warned us that what was \nhappening was just a tremor leading up to a massive earthquake that was \nabout to happen. We did not listen. Are we listening now?\n  I am going to be working with my colleagues to offer several \namendments on the floor to strengthen this legislation, to make it the \nstrongest legislation possible, to be accountable to my constituents, \nand to make sure we are putting derivatives back into the clear light \nof day.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2538-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2538-S2539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IMPROPER PRACTICES ON WALL STREET\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Chair. I have sought \nrecognition to comment briefly on a hearing which will be held by the \nCriminal Law Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary on May 4 \nconcerning allegations of improper practices on Wall Street.\n  In light of the allegations of misconduct on Wall Street in recent \nyears and the consequential damages to the economy of the United States \nand worldwide, serious consideration should be given to whether civil \nliability and fines are sufficient or whether jail sentences are \nrequired to deal with such conduct and as a deterrence to others. With \ncivil liability or a fine, the companies or individuals calculate it as \npart of the cost of doing business, but a jail sentence is enormously \ndifferent.\n  The charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission \naccusing Goldman Sachs of securities fraud in a civil lawsuit has \nbrought intense public concern to conduct on Wall Street which has long \nbeen questioned. According to the SEC complaint, Goldman permitted a \nclient who was betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence \nwhich mortgage securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman then \nsold the investments to pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. \nThe client was betting the securities would decline in value based on \nhis knowledge of the underlying value. Similar practices have been \ndefended by investment bankers on the ground that the investors are \nsophisticated and have a duty to protect themselves without relying on \nthe investment counsel. There is a contention that the only issue is \nwhether the investments are suitable, with the denial that there is a \nfiduciary duty. That defense further contends that there is no conflict \nof interest.\n  Some of the issues to be considered at the hearing to be held by the \nCriminal Law Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee on May 4 are the \nfollowing:\n  First: Precisely what are the structures of the complex commercial \ntransactions involving securitizing mortgages, selling short hedge \nfunds, derivatives, et cetera?\n  Second: Under what circumstances, if any, do the investment bankers \nhave a fiduciary duty to the investors?\n  Third: Where, if at all, do conflicts of interest arise in such \ntransactions?\n  Fourth: Is there a legitimate distinction between the investment \ncouncil's duty to provide only a ``suitable'' investment without a \nfiduciary duty involved?\n  Fifth: When the investment banker recommends or offers an investment, \nis there an implicit representation that it is a good investment?\n  In my judgment, Congress should examine these complicated \ntransactions with a microscope and make a public policy determination \nas to whether such conduct crosses the criminal line. Congress should \ninvestigate and hold hearings to find the facts. Congress should then \ndefine what is a fiduciary relationship, what is a conflict of \ninterest, and what conduct is sufficiently antisocial to warrant \ncriminal liability and a jail sentence.\n  As a starting point, it should be emphasized that the SEC complaint \ncontains allegations which have yet to be proved. The numerous \nnewspaper stories and other media reports are hearsay, so the task \nremains to find the facts. These inquiries on Wall Street practices are \nbeing made in the context that they triggered or at least contributed \nto a global financial crisis.\n  Larry Summers, on March 13, 2009, said:\n\n       On a global basis, $50 trillion in global wealth has been \n     erased over the last 18 months. That includes $7 trillion in \n     the U.S. stock market wealth which has vanished, $6 trillion \n     in housing wealth which has been destroyed, 4.4 million jobs \n     which have already been lost, and the unemployment rate now \n     exceeds 8 percent.\n\n  In the intervening year, a total of 6.5 million jobs are now the \ntotal lost, and the unemployment rate stands at 9.7 percent.\n  I have long been concerned about the acceptance of fines instead of \njail sentences in egregious cases. There are many illustrative cases, \nbut three will suffice to make the point. In each of these cases, I \nregistered my complaint with the Department of Justice.\n  First: On September 2, 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion to \nresolve criminal and civil liability for committing health care fraud \nfor selling Bextra, for off-label uses the FDA declined to approve \nbecause they were unsafe. For a company with revenues in excess of $48 \nbillion and an income in excess of $8 billion in fiscal year 2008, it \nwas chalked off as the cost of doing business.\n  The second case: On December 15, 2008, Siemens AG entered guilty \npleas to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and agreed to \npay $1.6 billion in fines, penalties, and disgorgements with no jail \nsentences. Again, that amounts to a calculation as part of the cost of \ndoing business for a company which had revenues of $104 billion and a \nnet income of $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2008, after the penalty.\n  The third case, briefly: On May 8, 2007, Purdue Pharma agreed to pay \n$19.5 million to 26 States to settle complaints that Purdue encouraged \nphysicians which prescribed excessive doses of OxyContin in violation \nof an FDA ruling which resulted in numerous deaths. Company officials \npaid fines, nobody went to jail; again, part of the cost of doing \nbusiness.\n  From my days as district attorney of Philadelphia, where my office \nconvicted the chairman of the Housing Authority, the Stadium \nCoordinator, the deputy commissioner of Licenses and Inspections, and \nothers, my experience has convinced me that criminal prosecutions are \nan effective deterrent.\n  The deterrent effect of prison was succinctly stated by Mr. William \nMercer, chairman of the Sentencing Guideline Subcommittee of the \nAttorney General's Advisory Committee, on behalf of the Department of \nJustice, in a 2003 publication. He said:\n\n       [W]e believe that the certainty of real and significant \n     punishment best serves the purpose of deterring fraud \n     offenders and particularly white collar criminals. \n     [O]ffenders usually decide to commit fraud and other forms of \n     white collar crimes not with passion, but only after \n     evaluating the cost and benefits of their actions. If the \n     criminally inclined think the risk of prison is minimal, they \n     will view fines, probation, home arrest, and community \n     confinement merely as a cost of doing business. We aim to \n     remove the price tag from a prison term. We believe that if \n     it is unmistakable that the automatic consequence for one who \n     commits a fraud offense is prison, many will be deterred, and \n     at least those who do the crime will indeed do the time.\n\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\n\n  These are some of the considerations which will be taken up at the \nsubcommittee hearing.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2539-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Denny Chin, of New York, \nto be United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 60 minutes, equally divided, on this \nnomination.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, yesterday the Senate was forced to devote \nthe entire day to so-called ``debate'' on two nominations that \nRepublican objections had stalled for months. The good news is, the \nmajority leader's filing of cloture motions to end the filibusters on \nthese nominations succeeded. The votes took place. Each was confirmed \nwith more than 70 votes, a bipartisan majority of the Senate. The \ndebate amounted to statements by Senators in support of the \nnominations. Let me emphasize that. The only people who spoke, spoke in \nsupport of the nominations. During the entire day, not a single \nRepublican Senator came to the floor to oppose the nominations, nor did \na single Senator come to the floor to explain why there have been \nmonths of delay that left a key office of the Justice Department \nwithout a head for the last year. None came to explain why their \nobjections left a longstanding vacancy in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit.\n  Instead, there was silence. There is no explanation for what \ncontinues to be a practice by Senate Republicans of secret holds and a \nSenate Republican leadership strategy of delay and obstruction of \nPresident Obama's nominations. That is wrong.\n  Throughout the week, a number of Senators have come before the Senate \nto discuss this untenable situation. They have asked for consent to \nproceed to scores of nominations that are totally noncontroversial. Yet \nRepublicans objected because, after all, these nominees had committed \nthe horrible sin of being nominated by a Democratic President. It makes \nno sense. I am in my 36th year in the Senate. I have never seen anybody \ntreat any President, Republican or Democratic, in this way.\n  Pursuant to our Senate rules which were enacted after bipartisan \nefforts, those Republican Senators who are objecting have an obligation \nto come forward and justify those objections. I am going to be \ninterested to see which Senators are objecting to proceeding on 18 \njudicial nominees. Eighteen nominees who were reported unanimously--\nevery Democrat, every Republican in support of them from the Judiciary \nCommittee--and then they are held by these secret holds. I will be \ninterested in knowing what basis there is for not proceeding on those \n18 nominees. In fact, I would like to know why we can't proceed to the \n11 Justice Department nominees who were reported without objection--\nU.S. attorneys, U.S. marshals, and Directors of important institutes \nand bureaus within the Justice Department. Most of these people are \ninvolved with critical law enforcement matters. These stalled \nnominations extend back into last year, even though they had unanimous \nsupport from the committee, Republicans and Democrats alike. Even \nthough most of them are in key law enforcement positions, they have \nbeen stopped, they have been held up, they have been stalled. This is \nwrong, and it should end.\n  Today, the Senate has another opportunity to make progress by \ncompleting action on the long-stalled nomination of Judge Denny Chin of \nNew York to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which is \nthe circuit of the distinguished Presiding Officer and of this Senator. \nThe vacancy he has been nominated to fill, which has been delayed by \nsome anonymous Republican objection, has been classified as a judicial \nemergency by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. \nIt is not unusual. There are 40 other judicial emergency vacancies and \njudges being held up. It is one of the four current vacancies in the \nSecond Circuit's panel of 13 judges. All are judicial emergencies. \nAlmost one-quarter of the court is being held vacant. That is wrong.\n  It reminds me of the years during the Clinton administration when \nsimilar Republican practices led to Chief Judge Winter, himself a \nRepublican, having to declare the entire circuit an emergency in order \nto continue to operate with panels containing only a single Second \nCircuit judge. That is wrong. During that era, we had 61 pocket \nfilibusters of a Democratic President's judges. That is wrong.\n  Yesterday, Republicans insisted on 3 hours of ``debate'' before a \nvote on Judge Vanaskie and another 3 hours of ``debate'' for a vote on \nProfessor Schroeder, but none of them came down to debate. Then they \nwere both confirmed by overwhelming margins. We should be thankful that \ntoday they have insisted on only 1 hour before this long overdue vote. \nI will be interested to see whether a single Republican Senator comes \nto speak in opposition of Judge Chin's nomination or to explain why \nthey have delayed this vote for 19 weeks.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to report Judge Chin's \nnomination last December--all Republicans and all Democrats. None of \nthe Republican Senators serving on the committee opposed it--not \nSenators Sessions, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, Graham, Cornyn, or Senator \nCoburn. Not one. He is an outstanding district court judge. He has the \nstrong support of both of his State's Senators and a number of \nconservative leaders. Yet his nomination has been stuck on the calendar \nsince December. He has been waiting 133 days for the Senate to act. \nContrast this with the practice Democrats followed during the first 2 \nyears of the Bush administration when we proceeded to vote on his \ncircuit court nominations, on average, within 7 days of their being \nreported by the Judiciary Committee. Now we wait 133 days and more.\n  This dramatic departure from the Senate's traditional practice of \nprompt and routine consideration on noncontroversial nominations has \nled to a backlog of nominations and a historically low rate of judicial \nconfirmations, and it damages the integrity of our courts. Our Federal \nsystem of judges has been the envy of most other countries because we \nkeep them out of politics. Here we are sinking them into politics.\n  In fact, by this date in President Bush's Presidency, the Senate had \nconfirmed 45 Federal circuit and district court judges. As of today, \nonly 19 Federal circuit and district court confirmations have been \nallowed by the Republicans. This is despite the fact that President \nObama began sending judicial nominations to the Senate 2 months earlier \nthan President Bush did, so the Senate is way behind the pace we set \nduring the Bush administration.\n  In the second half of 2001 and through 2002 the Senate confirmed 100 \nof President Bush's judicial nominees. Given Republican delay and \nobstruction this Senate will not likely achieve half that. Last year \nthe Senate was allowed to confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court judges all year. That was the lowest total in more than \n50 years. Meanwhile, judicial vacancies have skyrocketed to more than \n100.\n  Judge Chin is a well-respected jurist who is widely celebrated for \none of his most newsworthy decisions in which he sentenced Ponzi scheme \noperator Bernard Madoff to 150 years in prison. He previously served \nfor 4 years as a Federal prosecutor, and he spent a decade as a lawyer \nin private practice. You would think they would be saying: Why don't we \nmove forward with the man who sentenced Bernie Madoff? It is almost as \nif we are punishing him for going after Bernie Madoff.\n  In fact, Judge Chin's impressive track record garnered the respect of \nformer judge and former Attorney General Michael Mukasey who wrote to \nthe\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\nJudiciary Committee: ``I believe him to be an intelligent and highly \nqualified nominee, who brings to the job not only experience but also \ndemonstrated good judgment and skill. He . . . [has] a temperament that \nhas shown him to be both firm and fair.''\n  James Comey, a former Deputy Attorney General and the former U.S. \nAttorney in the Southern District of New York, echoed this praise. ``In \na district with many fine trial judges, he was a star--smart, fair, \nhonest, careful, firm, apolitical, and a brilliant writer. . . . \n[W]hile always in control of the proceedings, he never lost the sense \nof humility that allowed him to listen to an argument with an ear \ntoward being convinced and to give all a fair hearing,'' wrote Mr. \nComey.\n  Judge John S. Martin, appointed by President George H.W. Bush, wrote \nto emphasize that Judge Chin ``is an exceptionally able lawyer'' and a \n``decent and thoughtful individual . . . who has earned the respect of \nthose who have appeared before him.''\n  When Judge Chin is confirmed today, he will become the only active \nAsian Pacific American judge to serve on a Federal appellate court. He \nwas also the first Asian Pacific American appointed as a U.S. district \ncourt judge outside the Ninth Circuit.\n  I cannot understand the stall of this nomination. It is time that we \nget to work. Let's move the people who should be moved forward. Let's \nget on with our job. After all, the American public pays us well to do \nthis job. They pay us to vote yes or no. They don't pay us to vote \nmaybe. With all of these stalls, we are saying we want to vote maybe. \nCome on, let's have the guts to vote yes or no.\n  Today I look forward to congratulating Judge Chin and his family on \nthis historic achievement. I commend both Senator Schumer and Senator \nGillibrand for their persistence in supporting this important \nnomination and bringing this matter to fruition. His confirmation is \nlong overdue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, in the fall of 2008, I reluctantly \nvoted for a bill that sent taxpayer money to Wall Street banks that \nshould have paid for their own mistakes. We were told it was needed in \norder to avert a global calamity. So I did it. Then I went back to my \nconstituents and vowed: Never again. Never again should taxpayers be on \nthe hook for recklessness on Wall Street, and no financial institution \nshould be considered too big to fail.\n  So when the financial regulatory bill the majority was about to bring \nto the floor last week still contained a number of loopholes allowing \nfuture bailouts, I raised the alarm. I wasn't about to take Democratic \nassurances that this bill protected taxpayers. I wanted them to prove \nit. That is what this debate is all about. It is about proving to my \nconstituents and to the rest of the country that we actually do what we \nsay we are going to do around here because if you haven't noticed, \nthere is a serious trust deficit out there. Public confidence in \ngovernment is at one of the lowest points in half a century. Nearly 8 \nin 10 Americans now say they do not trust the government and have \nlittle faith it can solve America's ills. And it is no wonder.\n  Over the past year, the American people have been told again and \nagain that government was doing one thing when it was doing another. \nJust think about some of the things Americans have been told.\n  As a Senator, the current President rallied against deficits and \ndebt. He said America has a debt problem and that it was a failure of \nleadership not to address it. Yet last year, his administration \nreleased a budget that doubles the debt in 5 years and triples it in \n10. The debt has increased over $2 trillion since he took office. In \nFebruary, the Federal Government ran the largest monthly deficit in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  How about the bailouts? The President said he didn't come into office \nso he could take over companies. But whether or not that is the case, \nAmericans can't help but notice that some people did better than \nothers. When it came to bailing out the car companies, the unions fared \na lot better than anyone else.\n  What about jobs? Last year, the White House rushed a stimulus bill \nthrough Congress because it said we needed to create jobs. They said we \nneeded to borrow the $1 trillion it cost the taxpayers to keep \nunemployment from rising above 8 percent. Well, more than a year later, \nunemployment is hovering around 10 percent. All told, we have lost \nnearly 4 million jobs since the President was sworn in.\n  Then there was health care. I will leave aside the substance for a \nmoment and just talk about the process. Americans were told the process \nwould be completely transparent, that all the negotiations would be \nbroadcast live on C-SPAN. Instead, they got a partisan back-room deal \nthat was rammed through Congress during a blizzard on Christmas Eve.\n  This is the context for the debate we are currently in. So it should \ncome as no surprise to anyone that when we are talking about a giant \nregulatory reform bill, the American people aren't all that inclined to \ntake our word for it when we say it doesn't allow for bailouts or that \nit will not kill jobs or that it won't enable the administration to \npick winners or losers. They have heard all that before, and they have \nbeen burned. This time, they want us to prove it.\n\n  The first thing they want us to prove is that this bill ends \nbailouts. That was the one thing this bill was supposed to do, and if \nthis bill didn't do anything else but that, a lot of people would be \nsatisfied. The administration has said it wants to end bailouts. I say \nto them: Prove it.\n  Some of us have pointed out concerns that this bill would give the \nadministration the authority to use taxpayer funds to support financial \ninstitutions at a time of crisis. Yes, the bill says taxpayers get the \nmoney back later, but that sounds awfully familiar. Isn't that exactly \nwhat we did with the first bailout fund--a bailout fund Americans were \npromised would be repaid but which Democrats are now trying to raid in \norder to pay for everything else under the Sun?\n  If a future administration thinks there is a crisis that requires \nusing taxpayer funds, then they should have to get permission from the \ntaxpayers first. It is not enough for someone in the administration to \nsay it is so; they need to come to Congress before they write the \ncheck. If this bill isn't like the first bailout, prove it.\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\n  As I said, we have seen in other bailouts that some are treated \nbetter than others. This bill appears to enable the same thing by \nallowing the FDIC to treat creditors with equal claims differently. If \nthe proponents of this bill think this bill does not allow the \nadministration to pick winners and losers, they need to prove it.\n  This bill also contains a number of provisions that threaten the \nability of small businesses to hire new workers. Other provisions would \nsend jobs overseas. And just this morning, the Wall Street Journal \npointed out a provision that would put new regulatory burdens on \nstartup businesses that would make it harder for them to get off the \nground. If this bill doesn't create new burdensome regulations that \nwill make it harder for Americans to dig themselves out of this \nrecession, then prove it. Prove it.\n  Every indication is that the chairman and the ranking member are \nmaking progress in their discussions and that this bill will have \nneeded improvements. That is good. Some of the concerns I have just \nraised are among the topics being discussed. But in the end, Americans \nare not rooting for some deal. They have asked us for clarity. They are \nasking us, not for verbal assurances but for concrete proof, because at \nthe end of the day I need to be able to look my constituents in the eye \nand prove to them that this bill does not allow for any bailouts. I \nneed to prove to them that this bill doesn't treat some favored groups \nbetter than others. I need to prove to them that this strengthens the \neconomy, that it doesn't make it worse.\n  People need to be convinced that we are doing what we are saying we \nare doing. This time they want proof and, frankly, I don't blame them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Stalled Nominations\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I know we have a vote scheduled at 12 \nnoon on a nomination. I know that is but 1 of 100 nominations that are \non the calendar awaiting action by the Senate. It is probably not very \nsurprising that people do not think much of this place when we cannot \nget nominations through, we cannot get business done. But people should \nunderstand the reason there are 100 nominations waiting on this \ncalendar is because the minority has decided to say no to everything, \njust to dig in their heels and decide they are not going to cooperate \non anything.\n  This afternoon I will again come to the floor and ask unanimous \nconsent on the nomination of GEN Michael Walsh. I just wanted Senator \nVitter from Louisiana to be aware that I intend to do that again.\n  Let me say I am going to be back this afternoon to talk about the \nSTART treaty and also to talk about financial reform and a couple of \nissues that are important to me, particularly the issue of too big to \nfail and the issue of, what I call just gambling on naked credit \ndefault swaps. I will talk about both of those this afternoon.\n  But when I come this afternoon, I am going to ask unanimous consent \non the nomination or the promotion of General Walsh. Let me again \ndescribe why this is important.\n  General Walsh is a decorated American soldier, served 30 years in the \nU.S. Army. He now commands a division of the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. He has served in wartime. He has served in Iraq. Six months \nago, on a bipartisan vote, unanimous vote, the Armed Services Committee \ndecided to promote this general to major general, give this one-star \ngeneral a second star. And 6 months later, this general has not been \npromoted. This person with a distinguished Army career has not received \nhis promotion. His promotion has been derailed by one Member of the \nSenate. That Member has the right to object, and so he has objected to \nthe promotion for this general.\n  My point has been that the objection to promoting a general with a \ndistinguished wartime record and a distinguished record for 30 years is \nan objection based on a demand from one Member of the Senate that the \nCorps of Engineers do something that the Corps of Engineers has already \ntold the Senator it does not have legal authority or legal ability to \ndo.\n  As I have indicated on two other occasions, I do not come to the \nfloor to criticise another Member by name. I have never done that \nbefore by name. But I did tell Senator Vitter from Louisiana that I \nintended to do that. As a matter of courtesy, I wanted him to know. I \nthink it is wrong. I think it is a horribly bad decision for him to \ndecide that he is going to hold up the promotion of a general who \nserved this country for 30 years because he is demanding certain things \nfor New Orleans and Louisiana the Corps of Engineers says it cannot do \nand does not have the legal authority to do.\n  Let me say as the chairman of the subcommittee that funds all of the \nwater issues, and there are plenty of water issues in Louisiana--I know \nbecause I have been involved in it--we have sent billions and billions \nand billions of dollars of the American taxpayers' money to New Orleans \nand Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I am pleased we \nhave done that because they were hit with an unprecedented natural \ndisaster called Hurricane Katrina.\n  So I was one of those who helped, who helped do some of the lifting \nto get the money to New Orleans and Louisiana. But our colleague \nindicated the other day that he is unhappy with the U.S. Government's \nresponse down in Louisiana.\n  Well, I would simply say to the folks in New Orleans and Louisiana: \nYou know what life would be like were this money and were the Corps not \ndown there with the billions of dollars that have now been spent. I \nthink it is important to understand the value of that cooperation and \nthe value of that partnership.\n  I understand there are some things about which people disagree. One \nof the issues raised by my colleague is an issue of the pumping \nstations down there. There is a disagreement about how they should \nproceed. He is demanding they proceed with a study in the manner that \nhe determines it should proceed. My point is, the Appropriations \nCommittee has already voted against that and said: We will not do it. \nNo. 1, it costs more; and, No. 2, it provides less flood protection. So \nwe are not going to do that.\n  To demand that be done, which the Corps does not have the authority \nto do at this point, and as leverage for that demand to hold up for 6 \nmonths the promotion of a distinguished soldier who has served in \nwartime, I think, is unbelievable.\n  So this afternoon I will come again and ask unanimous consent once \nagain that this soldier get the promotion that he is owed and deserves. \nSenator John McCain, Senator Carl Levin, the ranking member and the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, both support this promotion. \nThe entire Armed Services Committee voted for it unanimously, and yet 6 \nmonths later this soldier is not promoted.\n  I can understand people using a lot of leverage around here for \nvarious things. I have used some leverage myself on certain things. But \nI do not understand someone using the career of a soldier to make \ndemands that cannot possibly be met. If he continues to do that for 6 \nor 16 months, the situation will be the same as it is now because the \nCorps of Engineers cannot do what the Senator from Louisiana is \ndemanding they do.\n  It is simply, in my judgment, using this soldier's career as a pawn. \nThat is terribly unfair to any uniformed soldier who serves this \ncountry, especially a soldier who has gone to war for this country. So \nthis is fair notice that I will ask unanimous consent. I assume it will \nbe somewhere in the 4 or 5 o'clock range today. My expectation is that \nthe Senator from Louisiana will be on the Senate floor at that point. \nMy hope is he would not object.\n  Finally, at long last, my hope is that he will allow the Senate to do \nthe right thing and give this soldier's career and this soldier's \npromotion the due that it is owed by this Senate.\n  As I said, I am going to come back later today. I want to talk at \nsome length about the START treaty, which I think is very important. I \nwas in Moscow, Russia, within the last week and a half taking a look at \nglobal\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\nthreat reduction initiatives that we are working on with the Russians. \nIt is very important that this START treaty be ratified by the Senate. \nI note that there are some of my colleagues saying: The only way we \nwill ratify the START treaty, the only way we would support that and \nnot block that would be if we get dramatic new monies for new nuclear \nweapons or something of the sort.\n  So I am going to talk about that today. I also am going to talk about \nthe financial reform bill, which is now staring us in the face, and \nabout, as I mentioned, the issue of something that sounds like a \nforeign language, but it is not: naked credit default swaps. That is \nnot a foreign language; that is flatout gambling that has been done by \nthe largest financial firms in the country that steered America right \ninto the ditch. It is very important they be dealt with, and dealt with \nthe right way in financial reform.\n  Also, I am going to talk about the issue of too big to fail. In my \njudgment, if you are determined to be too big to fail, then, in my \njudgment, you are too big. I believe divestiture is an important part \nof the solution to that. I will talk about that more this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                               Earth Day\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to say to my friend, I thank him for bringing \nthe issue of the promotion of an Army Corps general to the floor today. \nI support his remarks. I support moving forward on that promotion.\n  Madam President, April 22 is Earth Day. It has been 40 years since \nthen-Senator Gaylord Nelson first advocated setting aside a national \nday to focus on our environment. We have learned a lot in those 40 \nyears. What we have learned is, it is very rewarding to protect and \ndefend our environment. What we have learned is, when we do that, and \nwe do it in the right way, we create millions of jobs and an economy \nthat is very prosperous.\n  One very clear example of that is, take my California coastline. It \nis an economic driver. It is beautiful. It is an economic driver \nbecause people want to see it in all of its beauty. They want to enjoy \nits beauty. They spend a lot of dollars on tourism to come and visit my \ncoast. They go to the restaurants. They go to the stores. That is why \nwe have always argued against our colleagues who want to go and \ndestroy--potentially destroy--that magnificent coastline, which is a \ngift from God, in my humble view.\n  It is interesting because the first Earth Day was inspired by a \nhorrible oilspill that hit Santa Barbara, and the whole country saw the \ndevastation, what happened to the wildlife, what happened to the ocean, \nwhat happened to the people there.\n  Ever since that time we have been taking a moment to take a deep \nbreath. By the way, breathing clean air is also an important part of \nEarth Day to actually appreciate this incredible gift that we have been \ngiven and to rededicate ourselves to the preservation of our \nenvironment.\n  In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire. Swaths of the Great \nLakes were lifeless dead zones. Air in our cities was very unhealthy. \nAll that happened in that year that then-Senator Gaylord Nelson decided \nto act on Earth Day.\n  When Senator Nelson took a trip, a plane trip, and looked down at the \ndevastation of the awful Santa Barbara spill, he realized we needed a \nday to celebrate the Earth and to dedicate ourselves to protecting \nthese gifts we have been given. Twenty million Americans rallied to \ncelebrate the first Earth Day the following year in April 1970.\n  I think it is important to note that protecting the environment has \nbeen a bipartisan thing here, at least up until recent times. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency opened its doors in November of 1970. \nIt was Richard Nixon who signed that law. The Clean Water Act became \nlaw in 1972, the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, the Toxic Controlled \nSubstances Act in 1976.\n  We have seen dramatic improvements in the air we breathe, the water \nwe drink, and, again, very good growth in our economy over this period. \nWe saw the gross domestic product rise from $4.26 trillion in 2005 \ndollars, in 1970, to $12.9 trillion. That is a threefold increase in \nthe GDP during the time we had these great environmental laws on the \nbooks.\n  So when the next politician stands up and says: You are going to \ndevastate the economy, let's show him or her that is not so. If we take \nthe lead--lead is a neurotoxin. When we keep it out of the area of our \nchildren, we know their IQs have gone up. It has been proven. We know \nwhat lies before us, clean energy. We know if we can get carbon \npollution out of the air, it is going to unleash twice as many dollars \nfrom the private sector into finding new technologies, clean energy \ntechnologies. It will get us off of that addiction to foreign oil, $1 \nbillion a day. We will make products in this country that the whole \nworld wants.\n  The world is going green. Why should we step back and allow China to \nmake all of the solar panels? Why should we step back and allow Germany \nto make all of the windmills? They have taken over the lead from the \nUnited States of America.\n  I want to see the words ``Made in America'' again. I want to see them \non products, clean energy technology products. I hope we will recommit \nourselves to protecting this environment.\n  Today, we have a tremendous opportunity before us in clean energy. \nWhen we move forward to address the challenge of climate change, we \nwill create millions of jobs and protect our children from dangerous \ncarbon pollution. Most importantly, clean energy will move us away from \nour dangerous dependence on foreign oil, which is costing us a billion \ndollars a day and making our country less secure.\n  America should be the leader in creating clean energy technologies \nthat are made in America and work for America.\n  It will mean manufacturing jobs for people who build solar panels and \nwind turbines; it will mean jobs for salespeople who will have a world-\nwide market for these American made exports.\n  It will mean jobs for engineers, office workers, construction \nworkers, and transportation workers too.\n  But today, other countries are moving quickly to take advantage of \nthe enormous opportunities to manufacture and sell the solar, wind, \ngeothermal and other clean energy technologies that will power the \nworld in the coming decades.\n  Venture capitalists tell us that when we pass clean energy and \nclimate legislation, it will unleash a wave of private investment that \nwill dwarf the capital that poured into high tech and biotech combined. \nThat means new businesses, new industries, and millions of new jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n  Colleagues on both sides of the aisle are working on legislation to \nstep up to the clean energy and climate challenge, building on the work \nwe have done in the Environment and Public Works Committee. I look \nforward to working with them as this process moves forward.\n  This Earth Day, we have an unprecedented opportunity to reinvigorate \nour economy, create jobs, and put America on a new course to recovery \nand prosperity. Let's remember the lessons of the past and seize this \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nnomination of Judge Denny Chin to the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit. Judge Chin is, first and foremost, a highly \nqualified and experienced nominee to one of the busiest courts in the \ncountry.\n  Judge Chin's life story speaks volumes about his own talent and \ndetermination, but also about the opportunities that this country \noffers--opportunities that made it possible for him to make the journey \nfrom Hong Kong, through Hell's Kitchen, to New York's best schools and \nnow to the Second Circuit.\n  No one could be more qualified. No one could have a more impeccable \nrecord on the district court. And, he has the bonus of providing needed \ndiversity to our appellate bench.\n  Nonethless, after passing him out of committee unanimously, my \nRepublican colleagues required the majority leader to file cloture on \nhis nomination. It took 4 months--4 months--to get an up or down vote \non him. It is good for the court system and the country that we are \nfinally doing it this morning.\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\n  He has been a sitting judge in the Southern District of New York for \n15 years, during which time he has presided with exceptional skill over \nsome of the most challenging and important cases in the country.\n  Judge Chin is a quintessential New Yorker: He graduated from our best \nschools--including Stuyvesant High School and Fordham University Law \nSchool--and practiced there his entire career. His family emigrated \nfrom Hong Kong to America when Judge Chin was just 2 years old. His \nfather worked as a cook and his mother worked as a garment factory \nseamstress in Chinatown. He grew up in a cramped tenement in Hell's \nKitchen with his four siblings. He later practiced in New York as both \na private lawyer and a Federal prosecutor.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have applied the following \ncriteria to each nominee for the federal bench: Is he excellent? Is he \nmoderate? And will he bring diversity to the bench?\n  On excellence: Besides his obvious academic and professional \ncredentials, Judge Chin has earned a unanimous well qualified rating \nexcellent by ABA.\n  But more important than this, in my book, are the views of his peers \nwho come in contact with him every day. Few judges have earned the \naccolades that litigants have given Judge Chin, whether they have \nexperienced his courtroom in victory or defeat.\n  For example, in the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary--which compiles \nevaluations of judges from practitioners--lawyers describe Judge Chin \nas ``a judge's judge,'' ``conscientious,'' ``extremely hard-working,'' \n``very bright,'' and ``an excellent judge.''\n  In short, no one--no one--questions Judge Chin's excellence, his \nintellect, or his temperament.\n  On moderation: There is more than one way to evaluate Judge Chin's \nmoderation.\n  First, he is a tough, but fair, sentencing judge. In an observation \nthat is emblematic of Judge Chin's moderation, one attorney has even \nsaid of Judge Chin: ``[h]e is a decent human being but he doesn't let \nthat influence his sentencing.''\n  Judge Chin is, in fact recently best known for sentencing Ponzi \nscheme operator Bernard Madoff. In a case that could have been a \ncomplete circus, that involved hundreds of victims who lost every penny \nthey had, Judge Chin ran the proceedings with dignity and efficiency \nand sentenced Madoff to the highest possible sentence.\n  Judge Chin said:\n\n       The message must be sent that Mr. Madoff's crimes were \n     extraordinarily evil and that this kind of irresponsible \n     manipulation of the system is not merely a bloodless \n     financial crime that takes place just on paper, but that it \n     is . . . one that takes a staggering human toll.\n\n  In addition, Judge Chin has said explicitly that he believes in a \nmodest, moderate role for judges. In his 1994 questionnaire that he \nsubmitted during his confirmation to be a district court judge, he \nwrote:\n\n       My view is that judges ought not to legislate; that is not \n     their function. Judges interpret and apply the law, keeping \n     in mind the purposes of the law.\n\n  Finally, Judge Chin has plenty of bipartisan support. His nomination \ngarnered glowing letters from former Attorney General Michael Mukasey \nand Republican-appointed U.S. Attorney John Martin, who hired him 30 \nyears ago and has practiced before Judge Chin. He had not a single vote \nagainst him, Democrat or Republican, in committee.\n  On the topic of diversity: It goes without saying that Judge Chin's \nconfirmation would improve the diversity of the Federal appellate \nbench. He already has the distinction of being the only Asian American \njudge to serve on the Federal district court outside of the Ninth \nCircuit. With his confirmation, he will be the only currently active \nAsian American appellate judge on the Federal bench.\n  So, let us proceed to approve Judge Chin without further delay, and \nkeep one of the busiest dockets in the Federal judiciary functioning \nsmoothly. I am proud and pleased to have a role in this historic moment \nfor our Federal courts.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I am pleased to rise today in \nstrong support of the nomination of fellow New Yorker, Judge Denny \nChin, to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit. Judge Chin has a distinguished legal career, having dedicated \nthe majority of his life to public service and education. His \nexperience in the court room spans more than a decade as a litigator, \nand over 15 years as a Federal judge.\n  When he was 2 years old, Judge Chin moved with his parents from Hong \nKong to New York, where he later attended Stuyvesant High School. \nThrough hard work, he was able to attend Princeton University, where he \nreceived the Athlete Award from the National Football Scholarship \nFoundation and graduated magna cum laude. After graduating from \nPrinceton, Judge Chin attended Fordham School of Law, where he earned \nhis juris doctorate and became managing editor of the Fordham Law \nReview.\n  As impressive as his educational background is, Judge Chin has \nenjoyed an equally notable legal career in public service and private \npractice, beginning with a job clerking for U.S. District Judge Henry \nWerker in the Southern District of New York for 2 years. He then spent \nanother 2 years at Davis Polk & Wardwell before resuming his commitment \nto public service at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. As a Federal prosecutor, Judge Chin honed his \nlitigation skills by arguing cases in the U.S. District Court and the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Following his time at the \nU.S. Attorney's Office, Judge Chin went back into private practice, \nworking as a litigator and a partner at several law firms in New York, \nand also as a solo practitioner, becoming a specialist in employment \nand commercial law.\n  In 1994, Judge Chin was the first Asian American appointed to Federal \ndistrict court outside the Ninth Circuit, where he has served for 15 \nyears. During his time on the bench, Judge Chin has presided over more \nthan 4,700 civil and 650 criminal cases, issuing more than 1,500 \nopinions. He has served as designated judge on the Second Circuit Court \nof Appeals on 84 appellate cases, of which nine decisions are his \nwritten opinions. Notably, Judge Chin presided over the high profile \ntrial of Bernard Madoff, whom Judge Chin ultimately sentenced to 150 \nyears in prison for defrauding billions of dollars from New Yorkers and \nindividuals from across the United States.\n  Judge Chin has demonstrated a strong commitment to education and the \nnext generation of the legal profession as a professor of law for more \nthan 23 years at his alma mater, Fordham University's School of Law. He \nhas contributed to legal scholarship by publishing seven law review \narticles and is frequent speaker at bar associations, law schools, law \nfirms, corporations, and non-profit organizations. In 2009, he received \nthe Professor of the Year Award from the Fordham Law School Public \nInterest Resource Center, and previously was awarded the Fordham Law \nSchool Alumni Association's Medal of Achievement in 2006. He currently \ncochairs the Fordham Law School Minority Mentor Program.\n  Judge Chin's dedication to public service extends to community \nleadership, and he is actively involved in local community and in legal \nassociations. He is a member of the Second Circuit's bar association, \nthe Federal Bar Council, formerly serving as the President, and \ncurrently serving on the Public Service Committee. Prior to assuming \nthe bench, he also served on numerous community boards, including the \nBrooklyn Center for Urban Environment, Care for the Homeless, Hartley \nHouse, and St. Margaret's House. Upon assuming the bench, Judge Chin \nremained involved in his local community by becoming a member of \nnumerous cultural organizations in New York. The outstanding dedication \nhe demonstrated throughout his career and years of community \ninvolvement has led to numerous awards and honors--such as the J. \nEdward Lumbard Award for Public Service from the United States \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the \nLifetime Achievement Award from the New York State Division of Human \nRights.\n  The American Bar Association gave Judge Chin its highest rating, as \nhe is an exceptional and highly competent judge. He has always followed \na thoughtful, reasoned approach to each case, strictly adhering to the \napplication of facts and legal precedent.\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\n  There are currently 129 judicial nominees waiting to be confirmed by \nthis Senate. It is unfortunate that when there are such highly \nqualified nominees as Judge Chin, they cannot be quickly voted on so \nthat they may begin to handle the many critically important cases that \nare currently pending in our Federal courts.\n  In conclusion, Judge Denny Chin possesses the judicial temperament, \nbreadth of legal knowledge, and commitment to justice, civil rights, \nand the rule of law necessary for this appointment. He is well \nqualified, and I am confident that he would make an outstanding judge \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to support his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Denny Chin, of New York, to be U.S. \ncircuit judge for the Second Circuit?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, over the years, Members of Congress \nhave had a lot of perks, but one of them stands out; that is, the \nability to raise their own pay. Not many Americans have the power to \ngive themselves a raise whenever they want, no matter how they are \nperforming. To make it worse, Members do not even have to vote on this \npay raise. Congress has set up a system whereby every year Members \nautomatically get a pay raise. No one has to lift a finger.\n  I do not take these pay raises, and I have been fighting for years to \npass my bill to end this cozy system. Thanks to the majority leader, we \ntook an important step last year when the Senate passed legislation to \nend automatic annual pay raises for Members of Congress. Unfortunately, \nthe leadership of the other body has, so far, refused to take up that \nbill.\n  Well, I am going to keep fighting to pass it, but there is another \nstep we can take in the meantime; that is, to make sure we do not get a \npay raise next year. We already enacted legislation to block a pay \nraise this year, and now we have to do the same thing for 2011. With so \nmany Americans looking for jobs and trying to figure out how to pay \ntheir bills, now is no time to give ourselves a taxpayer-funded $1,600 \npay increase.\n  I have a bill to block the scheduled 2011 pay raise.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Burr, Vitter, \nBennet, Lincoln, Grassley, McCaskill, Begich, and McCain all be added \nas cosponsors to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Whitehouse be added as a cosponsor to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3244, a bill to \nprohibit a cost-of-living adjustment for Members of Congress in 2011; \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements relating to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nSenator to add me as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, be added as a cosponsor to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3244) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, after the actions of some bad apples on \nWall Street wreaked havoc on Main Street, America, there is no doubt we \nneed financial reform to prevent another credit crisis.\n  It is disappointing that bipartisan consensus on a financial reform \npackage was not reached in committee and instead the majority chose a \ngo-it-alone approach. I hope this is a process Democrats truly want to \nbe bipartisan because my constituents have some good ideas about how to \nenact real reform that will not stifle economic growth and activities.\n  I have told my good friend Senator Dodd and others that I want to \nwork with them to ensure the concerns I have heard from Missourians--a \nthousand miles away from Wall Street--are addressed as the process \nmoves forward. I have heard from Missourians who want to end too big to \nfail, and I have heard from Missourians who want to stop taxpayer-\nfunded bailouts and Missourians who are fearful of empowering \ngovernment bureaucrats with the power to pick winners and losers. I \nhave also heard from folks in Missouri who are key to job creation. \nThey have well-founded concerns about some of the bill's unintended \nconsequences.\n  This is a bill that could alter significantly the way Americans do \nbusiness with the financial services industry, whether it be in the \nform of a home or auto loan, financing for college, credit for family \nfarms, or much needed financing for small business. In the heartland, \nwhere I am from, we understand Wall Street provides critical financing, \nbut we want to make sure they do it the right way.\n  A bipartisan and responsible bill should ensure that the failures \nthat led to our financial collapse are properly addressed and that \ntaxpayers never again are left footing the bill for the egregious \nmistakes of a few bad actors. It is time to stop taking a piecemeal and \nad hoc approach to addressing the financial crisis. Burying our \ncollective heads in the sand to avoid what needs to be done and simply \nhoping things will get better by throwing more money at these failed \ninstitutions and just believing they will get better on their own is \nunrealistic.\n  Americans are rightfully angry and frustrated about the trillions of \ndollars the government has committed to rescuing the financial \nindustry, when so many of them are still struggling to find jobs, pay \nbills, and get the loans they need for cars, home, college, or to farm. \nThey believe--and rightly so--that it is fundamentally unfair for the \nbad actors who caused the financial crisis to get bailed out while many \nof them lost their jobs and their savings as a direct result of the \nirresponsibility of others.\n  We need a clear path to unwinding and ending these institutions that \nare too large and that pose systemic risk to the financial health of \nour market without doing so at the expense of the American taxpayer. No \ninstitution should ever again be considered too big to fail.\n  Today, I remind my colleagues that the government played a role in \ncontributing to our financial and economic crisis. Government policies \nand actions to promote home ownership to buyers who could not afford to \nbuy were irresponsible. That is why I am shocked that this bill does \nnothing to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored \nenterprises that contributed to the financial meltdown by buying high-\nrisk loans made to people who could not afford them. These \nirresponsible actions left the Federal Government with the risk and the \nAmerican taxpayer with the bill to bail them out.\n  In addition to the cost to taxpayers, these irresponsible actions \nturned the American dream into the American nightmare for too many \nfamilies who faced foreclosure and devastated entire neighborhoods and \ncommunities as property values diminished. Additionally, government \nfailure to adequately regulate the financial system--specifically, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and other regulators--allowed these \ninstitutions to take on too much risk, which was a major factor in the \ncredit collapse. Collectively, these policies and actions have brought \nus to the economic crisis which has touched every American's life.\n  The current proposal ignores Fannie and Freddie, which were \nsignificant contributors to the crisis. That is a big mistake.\n  We need to be sure the proposals address the needs of Main Street \nAmerica. Leaving them out would be another mistake.\n  Rather than focusing on the concerns of Wall Street, I have spent my \ntime focusing on the concerns shared with me by my constituents back in \nMissouri. Missourians expect real reform but demand that Congress \nprevent an overreach of government that stifles businesses and kills \njobs.\n  One specific area of concern is the creation of the so-called \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB. This new, massive \ngovernment bureaucracy has unprecedented authority and enforcement \npowers to impose duplicative and costly mandates on any entities that \nextend credit. We are not talking about just big Wall Street banks but \nalso the community banker, the local dentist, farm lender, or auto \ndealer. As a result, there will be no choice but to pass these added \ncosts on to consumers--the very people this bill was designed to \nprotect.\n  The only way to ensure the CFPB does not unintentionally hurt well-\nperforming institutions that issue credit\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\nis to narrow the scope and authority with clear language outlining \nexactly whom this new regulator will regulate. Surely my colleagues \nwould not want to vote for a bill that creates a new government \nbureaucracy without knowing exactly what the bureaucracy is empowered \nto do.\n  Instead of unlimited authority, this new regulator should focus on \nthe shadow banking entities that operate outside of the regulatory \nframework and prey on vulnerable people. We have all heard horror \nstories from our constituents about the bad operators pushing no-money-\ndown or no-doc home mortgages and the reverse mortgage scam artists who \nsell too-good-to-be-true financing.\n  There must be appropriate oversight of this regulator. The last thing \nwe need is a new government bureaucracy that, under the guise of \nconsumer protection, is really just pushing one party's political \nagenda. The current business climate is overwhelmed with uncertainty, \nand we need to ensure this bureau does not create additional \nuncertainty for any investor or business that operates in this country. \nThe prudential regulators should have a final say on anything that \nwould put the safety and soundness of institutions and the credit of \nborrowers at risk.\n  Next, Missourians refuse to be on the line for another bank bailout. \nI share their frustration over the concept of an institution being \nconsidered too big to fail. We must put an end to too big to fail. We \nneed a mechanism in place that allows for immediate liquidation of \nfailing financial firms.\n  In my recent conversation with Larry Summers, I expressed this \nconcern, and he agreed that the administration wants euthanasia for \nfailed companies, not resurrection. The government should not be in the \nbusiness of creating zombies.\n  The era of bailouts must be over. Any mechanism of resolution must be \nfair and evenhanded. Missourians will not accept government bureaucrats \npicking winners and losers in creditor repayment.\n  In addition, the $592 trillion over-the-counter derivative market \nneeds stronger rules of transparency. Some of the derivatives traded in \nthis market played a significant role in the recent credit crisis \nthrough products such as credit default swaps. These and other \ntransactions--which I call video game transactions, where there is no \nsubstance involved and they are making bets on the financial system--\nshould have been cracked down on by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission.\n  However, there is an important distinction to be made here. Not all \nderivative contracts pose systemic risk. As a matter of fact, \ncommercial contracts initiated, for example, by energy companies, \nutilities, and the agricultural industry are used to manage risks \nassociated with daily operation, from cost fluctuations in materials \nand commodities to foreign currency used in international business. \nThese end users, as they are called, do so in order to plan for future \npricing so they can provide the least expensive good or service to \ntheir consumers as possible. Costly margin requirements for these end \nusers will be directly passed on to families. This will increase the \ncost for Americans to turn on their lights and put food on their \ntables.\n\n  My hope is that the ultimate Senate bill, like the House-passed bill, \nwill ultimately address this concern with a strong exemption for end \nusers from the clearing and margin requirements. These end users are \nnot major swap participants and should not be treated as such.\n  Finally, the Federal Reserve Bank's current structure for regulatory \noversight ensures that responsibilities and power are shared across the \ncountry, not just in Washington and on Wall Street. Regional reserve \nbanks give all regions in the country a voice in banking, credit \npolicy, and monetary concerns, which gives a complete picture to the \nBoard of Governors as they decide on Federal monetary policy. This \nsystem was established over 100 years ago and should be maintained in \norder to protect the concerns of small and medium-sized banks. \nFinancial crises can and do occur within small but interconnected \nbanks, which is why the Federal Reserve needs to continue to take the \neconomic temperature of the entire country, not just of those on Wall \nStreet.\n  As hard-working Americans and small businesses struggle to emerge \nfrom this meltdown and drive our economy through the recovery process, \nit is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure we have a \nrobust regulatory system. It is critical that our regulatory system be \nmodern, responsive, and empowered with appropriate authority, while \nallowing for business prosperity as we prevent future crises.\n  In Missouri, I have been working to build an agricultural biotech \ncorridor. This has the potential to foster a whole new interest, \nproviding great jobs in advanced agricultural research and biotech. It \nis the best stimulus to create high-paying, skilled jobs that rural \nMissouri and rural America need.\n  However, today I read in the Wall Street Journal a very disturbing \nreport that this bill would possibly kill small business startups by \ndelaying and limiting the availability of private investor seed \ncapital. Small startups have been at the forefront, driving job \ncreation. In this bill, new requirements by the SEC would insist that \ninvestors register with the Commission for a 4-month review, meanwhile \ntying up vital venture capital or seed capital dollars. This harmful \ndelay for new businesses in need of immediate capital would be \ncrippling.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       No one believes angel investors pose a systemic risk, so \n     it's hard to understand why these proposals are in the bill. \n     The economy needs more private job creation.\n\n  Incidentally, it would triple the minimum wealth of the seed capital \ninvestors who could invest in these from $1 million to over $3 million. \nThat cuts out three-quarters of the people who might invest in starting \nup these companies. This would be devastating to rural job creation in \nMissouri and across the country.\n  Our greatest potential for new jobs depends upon the innovative \nideas, the entrepreneurship of people who are willing to use their own \ntime and ideas but need seed capital to do it. These small companies \ncould not wait 120 days, in many instances. They could not find the \nseed capital investors. In other words, in sum, moving from too big to \nfail, this new bill, if enacted with that provision in it, would say to \nthese innovators, these entrepreneurs: You are too small to succeed.\n  This is not a measure that is going to protect people from Wall \nStreet; this is an overreach by the Federal Government which would shut \ndown the job creation Main Street needs.\n  Neither political party has a monopoly on good ideas. Reforming our \nfinancial system is too important to be done on a partisan basis. I \nurge my colleagues, and I hope they will consider the ideas I have \nheard from Missourians. We haven't just been listening to Wall Street; \nwe have been listening to Main Street. I hope the Presiding Officer and \nall of the Members of this body will listen to what they are saying on \nMain Street about the need for the small companies, whether they be \nstartup companies or small banks, to succeed. We need to make sure we \ndon't kill the backbone of our American economy.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2546-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2546-S2548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I came to the floor on Tuesday of this \nweek to do something I do not think had been done before under the \nrules. We had a new law that went into effect in the early part of 2007 \nthat gave us a mechanism that was supposed to stop secret holds. We are \nall waiting to see if by moving all of the nominations by unanimous \nconsent, in fact, the owners of the secret holds step forward.\n  While we wait to see if the rule that was designed and passed into \nlaw works, a bunch of us have been talking. The folks who have been \ntalking about this are the newest Members of the\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\nSenate in the Democratic Party. There are 21 of us who have arrived in \nthe Senate sometime between now and January of 2007. It is a pretty big \ngroup of Senators.\n  In discussing the secret holds with my colleagues who have been here \nfor a fairly short period of time, we decided: Why don't we just quit \ndoing them? Let's quit worrying about whether you are identifying \nyourself in 6 days, whether you are going to play the switcheroo, pull \nyour secret hold and put on another secret hold. Let's just stop it. No \nmore secret holds.\n  We now have drafted a letter to Leader Reid and Leader McConnell, and \nwe have said: First, we will not do secret holds. We are out of the \nbusiness of secret holds. We are not going to do them. Second, we want \nthe Senate to pass a rule that prohibits them entirely.\n  If a Senator wants to hold somebody, fine, but say who they are and \nwhy they are doing it. If a Senator wants to vote against somebody, \nthat is their right. But this notion that they can, behind closed \ndoors, do some kind of secret negotiation to get something they want \nfrom an agency--let's be honest about it; that is what a lot of this \nis. It is getting leverage, secretly getting leverage for something \nthey want. Those are not appropriate secrets for the public business.\n  We have 80 secret holds right now. About 76 of those are Republican \nsecret holds; 4 are Democratic secret holds. By the way, all 80 of the \nones on which I made the unanimous consent request came out of \ncommittee unanimously. We even checked on the voice votes to make sure \nno one said no in committee. There were no ``no'' votes. These 80 \nnominees were completely unopposed out of committee.\n  They are everything from the Ambassador to Syria to U.S. marshals to \nU.S. attorneys. These are people who need to get to work. They are \ngoing to be confirmed. They are all going to be confirmed. We need to \nget this done. We need to stop secret holds. We need to get these \npeople confirmed. We need to change the way we do business around here.\n  I, once again, give a shout-out to Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley \nwho worked on this issue for a number of years. We are going to open \nthis letter to all Members of the Senate and, hopefully, before we find \nout--we are all waiting to see what happens in the 6 days that are \nlooming for all these secret holds, if people step up into the \nsunshine. If they do not, in the meantime we, hopefully, will get \nunanimous support from Senators that secret holds are now out of \nfashion and no longer going to be tolerated in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for my colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Bennet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nkicking off this discussion. I rise in strong support of this effort by \na group of reform-minded Senators to finally get rid of this ridiculous \nand insane practice of anonymous holds. The American people have little \npatience for this political game when they are going through what they \nare going through.\n  What people should understand is, at least in my view, this is less \nabout partisanship. The Senator from Missouri talked about the fact \nthat these are people who passed unanimously out of committee, with \nRepublicans and Democrats supporting the nominees who somehow, between \nthe committee process and the Senate floor, got stuck. They are getting \nstuck anonymously. I say it is not about partisanship. I say this is a \nperfect illustration of Washington, DC, being completely out of touch \nwith what is going on in the country.\n  No one else in the country invents a set of rules to make sure they \ndo not get their work done. But that is what we are doing in the \nSenate. That is why I think it is high time we got rid of these \nanonymous holds. I would go even further. I have legislation that gets \nrid of the anonymous holds and bans these secret holds. But it would do \nmore. It would also require that a hold be bipartisan or else it \nexpires after 2 legislative days. If a Senator wants to place a hold, \nthat is within their rights, but we are going to make sure it is \nscrutinized. We are going to make sure they can get support from \nsomebody on the other side of the aisle for holding up the country's \nbusiness. All holds under my bill would expire after 30 days, whether \nthey are bipartisan or not.\n  I also wish to highlight that the Senators who have taken this strong \nstance against secret holds are willing to put our money where our \nmouth is. While Washington bats around about this and other reforms, we \nhave all pledged that we will stop the practice of secret holds \nourselves. It was easy for me to do because I have never placed a \nsecret hold on the Nation's business, and I never will.\n  This is a small but important illustration of what is not working \nwell in the Senate, what is blocking progress for the American people. \nIt is a small step but an important step to demonstrate that we can \nactually do our work differently, that we have been sent here to have \nan open and thoughtful debate about the issues that confront our great \ncountry. I am proud to be here today with my other colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that we have to be on \nthe Senate floor this afternoon to talk about so many of the nominees \nwe need to do the work of this country who are being held up, and being \nheld up by people who are not willing to identify themselves or say \nwhat their issue is with these nominees.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues. I am glad we are mounting this \neffort. We need to get rid of the secret holds. But it is unfortunate \nthat we are where we are.\n  I understand why people are frustrated with what is happening here. \nPeople want to see things get done. They understand we have significant \nchallenges facing the country, and they want to see action on those \nchallenges.\n  It is clear that one of the areas where there is a problem is with \nthe 80 or so people who were nominated who have been held up, some of \nthem for months and months, because somebody has an issue, not with the \nperson who is being held up usually, but as my colleague from Missouri \nsaid because someone wants to get the attention of a department or \nagency within government or because somebody wants to keep the Obama \nadministration from doing the work of the people.\n  I wish to point out some of the people who have been on hold. No one \nhas identified themselves as to why they had these people on hold. \nUntil just a few minutes ago, we had five U.S. attorneys and five \nmarshals. We have the Deputy Director of National Drug Policy Control. \nThey come from States all across this country--from New York, Indiana, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Maine, Idaho, and Florida. We \nhave a lot of big States there, a lot of States where the people's \nbusiness is not getting done because those nominees have not been put \nin place.\n  The sad thing is, the people who have these folks on hold are trying \nto get back at somebody in government, but the people who are suffering \nare the constituents in those States where the work is not getting \ndone.\n  I have a very personal example that I have talked about before on the \nfloor of the Senate. A woman from New Hampshire who has now been \nconfirmed to lead the Office of Violence Against Women, Judge Susan \nCarbon. This is someone who was appointed first by Senator Judd Gregg \nto be a judge, and I then made her a full-time judge. She got through \nthe committee on a unanimous vote.\n  I think all of us would like to see the work of the Office of \nViolence Against Women done, just as we want to see the work of the \nU.S. attorneys done and the work of the marshals done. Yet she was held \nup for 2 months, until I came to the floor and started asking questions \nabout who had that secret hold on her. We never did find out. We never \ndid find out why she was on hold or what the concern was. That is the \nproblem with all these different holds.\n  Senator Bennet said he hasn't put any secret holds on anyone. Well, \nneither have I. If I am going to put a hold on somebody, I want the \nworld to know about it because it is somebody whom I have a serious \nissue with or someone we have concerns about the job they would do. \nThat is not the case with any of these folks.\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\n  So I would urge all my colleagues to sign on to say that they will \noppose secret holds and to release those holds on the nominees who are \nbeing held up and let's let the work of the people in this country get \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I also rise to express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. McCaskill, for her \nleadership on this effort to reform the way the Senate advises and \nconsents. Because I have great respect for the traditions of the \nSenate, I was curious as to why holds are a mechanism or a tool \navailable to individual Senators. What I found out is basically \nspeculative; that is, that in the past, there is a belief that \nSenators--because they could only get back to Washington by horse and \nbuggy or by horse itself--needed time to study a potential nominee. It \nwas a courtesy. It maybe made sense in those horse-and-buggy times, but \nthese are modern times, and the secret hold now, in particular, is \nbeing used to accomplish, in many cases, political or perhaps even \npolicy goals. I have great respect for the venerable traditions of the \nSenate, but this seems like one that should be set aside, frankly.\n  I was also curious to study some of the statistics that I will share \nwith the entire Senate. Since President Obama took office--I think it \nis 16 months, give or take a few days--we have voted on 49 nominations. \nOf those 49 votes, 36 of them--which is about 75 percent of the \nnominations--have been delayed. On average, these nominations languish \nor sit on the Executive Calendar for over 105 days. That is on average. \nSome have waited many months more. Then, when we look at the vote \ntotals of the nominations that finally come to the floor, 17 received \nmore than 90 votes, 10 received more than 80 votes, and 6 received more \nthan 70 votes. So out of the 36 nominees, there were 33 that I think \nyou could characterize as being approved overwhelmingly by the Senate, \nafter a very long and unfortunate wait.\n  Right now, on the Executive Calendar, there are 94 nominees awaiting \nthe Senate's advice and consent action. At this time in George W. \nBush's Presidency, there were 12 nominees. So we have 94 on the one \nhand and 12 on the other hand.\n  It is time for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop \nabusing the Senate's responsibility to provide advice and consent for \nthe President's well-qualified nominees.\n  Let me just end on this note. If a Senator wants to place a hold, \nthat is all well and good, but it shouldn't be a secret hold. As the \nprevious two speakers have said--and I think Senator McCaskill as \nwell--I have never used a hold. If I wish to put a hold on a nominee, I \nwill make it public. I will make the case and take a stand on the floor \nof the Senate. That is the way we want our debates to be in the \nSenate--the world's greatest deliberative body. We shouldn't be doing \nthings such as this in secret.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from \nColorado, and I was thinking about our two States. They both are \nbeautiful States. OK, they have a few more mountains than we do, but we \nhave 10,000 lakes. We both have open democracies--governments that \nwork, governments that are open. There is no secrecy in our States. We \nhave blue skies, open prairies, open lands. To me, it is no surprise \nthat we would have Senators from these two States standing and saying \nthis is ridiculous.\n  I thought Senator Udall did a great job of going through all the \nnumbers and the nominations that have been put on hold, but we all know \nwhat is at the root of this. It is a procedural game that allows this \nto happen--the secret hold.\n  When I came to the Senate in 2007, my first priority was ethics \nreform. I was so pleased, and I thought we had gotten rid of the secret \nhold. That is what we said we did. The rule we adopted then--as soon as \nunanimous consent was made regarding a specific nominee--said that a \nSenator placing a hold has to submit to the majority leader a written \nnote of intent that includes the reason for their objection. So they \nhave to put in writing why they are objecting. Then it says that no \nlater than 6 days after the submission, the hold is to be printed in \nthe Congressional Record for everyone to see.\n  So we thought this was a pretty good idea--sunshine being the best \ndisinfectant. By making the hold public and forcing Senators to be \naccountable for their actions, we could have open debate. As I heard \nSenator Shaheen just say, we should be able to tell the world why we \nare putting on a hold. We may have a good idea.\n  But that is not what has been happening. Instead, what has been \nhappening is, Senators are playing games with the rules. They are \nfollowing the letter but not the spirit of the reform. It is \nunbelievable to me. They are actually rotating holds.\n  It is sort of like what we see in the Olympics, where they have a \nrelay and they hand off the baton. This baton is going from one Senator \nto another so they can keep the hold going. One Senator has it for 6 \ndays. Then it is passed off to another for 6 days. So I guess if delay \nwas an Olympic sport, they would get the Gold Medal.\n  What we have is a group of Senators from the other side of the aisle, \nfor the most part, who are gaming the system. We have been spending a \nlot of time in the last few days talking about other people who game \nthe system--people on Wall Street--so I don't think it should be \nhappening in this very Chamber.\n  I am very pleased Senator McCaskill, along with Senators Grassley and \nWyden, have been working on this for so long and have taken a lead on \nit. I urge my colleagues to sign this letter to end the secret hold. \nThere shouldn't be secrets from the public when it comes to \nnominations. This isn't a matter of top-secret national security or \nsome strategy that we would use when we go to war. This is about \nnominations from the White House. This is about people who are going to \nbe serving in public jobs. We should know who is holding them up, who \ndoesn't want them to come up for a vote and why. Then we can make a \ndecision and the public will have the knowledge of what is going on in \nthis place. That is the only way we are going to be able to build trust \nagain with this democracy.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2548-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2548-S2549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY REGULATION\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue that is \nbefore the body and before the country right now with respect to \ncontrol and regulation of the financial services industry. The \nPresident of the United States has given a number of speeches on this \none. I understand the latest one was today, in which he attacked \nRepublicans for listening to the big banks of Wall Street in our \nconcern about the details of the bill that has been offered out of the \nBanking Committee by Chairman Dodd.\n  I am a member of the Banking Committee. I voted against the bill in \nthe Banking Committee. It came out on a straight party-line vote. For \nthat I am being castigated by the President and others for being a tool \nof Wall Street and the big banks.\n  I want to make it very clear that my opposition to parts of this bill \nhave nothing whatsoever to do with Wall Street and the big banks. I \nhave not been to Wall Street to discuss this with any executives of any \nof the big banks. I have been in Utah, and I have been discussing this \nwith businesses in Utah, businesses that you normally would not think \nwould have any interest whatsoever in regulation of financial services.\n  We think of financial services as insurance companies and brokerage \nhouses and banks. What I have discovered, hearing from my constituents, \nis that the people who are the most worried about this are small \nbusiness men and women who have nothing to do\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\nwith banking but who do have a program in their business to extend some \ndegree of consumer credit.\n  I will give an example: a furniture store that sells furniture and \nadvertises you buy the furniture now and payment is delayed for 90 days \nas a come-on to get people to come in. Mr. President, you have seen \nthose ads in the paper in Washington. I have seen those ads. It is the \nkind of thing that goes on.\n  Businesses extend credit in one way or another. It is not the core of \ntheir business, it is just a way of trying to attract customers. \nSuddenly they discover, if this bill passes, they will be under the \ncontrol of the Consumer Protection Agency that is being created for \nthis, and Federal officers will have the right to show up on their \npremises and say: This is not a proper handling of this credit. We are \ngoing to treat you as if you were Citicorp or Goldman Sachs or \nwhatever. We are going to come down with the heavy hand of the Federal \nGovernment to tell you how you can do your business and fine you or \nproduce other kinds of barriers to your doing business.\n  The fellow says: Look, I just want to sell a sofa, and I just want to \nbe able to sell it on credit to somebody who wants to buy it on credit. \nWhat is wrong with that?\n  No, under the terms of this bill, the Consumer Protection Agency of \nthe Federal Government will be looking down your throat.\n  As I move around the State, I have one small business man or woman \nafter another come up to me and say: What in the world are you people \nin Washington thinking about, the kinds of regulations you are going to \nput on me and my business? Some of them are saying they are afraid they \nare going to have to close their doors rather than deal with this \nsignificant challenge.\n  We are, in this bill, overreacting to the seriousness of the crisis \nthat has put us in this recession. I have a friend who has been a \nWashington observer for many years, and he says whenever faced with a \ncrisis, Congress always does one of two things: nothing or overreacts. \nThis is a classic example of overreacting.\n  By creating a Consumer Protection Agency with the sole focus to \nprotect the consumer, we run the risk of doing the kind of damage I \nhave described to small business. I say to people, if safety is the \nonly criterion by which you are going to judge an institution, the \nsafest institution in which no one will lose any money is the one whose \ndoors are closed, the one that offers no risk anywhere because all \nbusiness is a risk. If you are going to say, no, you are going to \nprotect the consumers absolutely, the way to protect the consumers \nabsolutely so that they will never lose a dime is not allow them to \nmake a purchase, not allow them to ever get a loan, not allow them to \never receive any credit.\n  If this bill passes in the form it came out of the House Banking \nCommittee, that will be the impact of this bill. Across the board it \nwill be to reduce credit, it will be to reduce opportunity, it will be \nto damage small businesses.\n  Again, I have not talked to the people on Wall Street. I have talked \nto the people on Center Street--I would say Main Street because every \ntown in America has a Main Street, but in Utah, in addition to Main \nStreet, we have Center Street in many of these small towns. That shows \nhow close to the issue the people in Utah are.\n  There is another issue I feel strongly about, and that is the \ndefinition of ``too big to fail.'' This creates and solidifies the \nnotion that some people, some institutions are too big to fail. I \nbelieve one of the lessons we have learned out of the crisis we went \nthrough starting in September of 2008 is that nobody should be deemed \ntoo big to fail; and, indeed, we should create a circumstance where the \nbankruptcy courts handle things and there is no Federal bailout in the \nfashion of saying: You are too big to fail and the government will \nprotect you from failing.\n  I remember years ago when we had the first bailout with Chrysler at \nthe time. Lee Iacocca made his reputation bringing Chrysler out of the \nbailout and repaying the government with interest. People point to that \nand say: The government kept Chrysler from going under. The money was \nrepaid. It was just a loan guarantee. The government didn't lose any \nmoney.\n  I remember one observer, when asked about it, said: I am not worried \nabout whether the bailout will save Chrysler. What I am worried about \nlong term is that it will work.\n  There were people saying: What happens if it fails?\n  He said: I am not worried about it if it fails. I am worried about it \nif it works and the Federal Government gets the appetite to step in, in \nexample after example, and always point to the Chrysler bailout and \nsay: Well, we made money on that, so we can do it again.\n  By creating that kind of moral hazard of stating these institutions \nare too big to fail, we run the risk of seeing a repetition rather than \navoidance of the crisis we had that created all of the difficulties in \nour economy today.\n  So, on the one hand, I speak for the small businessman and the small \nbusinesswoman who say this bill will be a disaster for them. On the \nother side, I say let's not create, in the name of protecting the \ncustomer, a circumstance where institutions are deemed as too big to \nfail and can be guaranteed, once again, a degree of government backing \nthat the marketplace would not give them. I trust the marketplace. We \nhave learned to do that as we go through the wreckage of what happened \nin the housing crisis.\n  I think we need to be very careful with this bill. Do we need \nfinancial reform? Yes, we do. Would I vote for a sensible bill? Yes, I \nwould. Am I a supporter of the status quo? No, I am not. But I do not \nbelieve the bill that came out of the Banking Committee is an \nimprovement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take this time to commemorate the 40th \nanniversary of Earth Day that we celebrate today, April 22.\n  I think we first need to acknowledge that we have made a lot of \nprogress since the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire in 1969. We have \nmade a lot of progress since the uncontrolled air pollution that killed \n20 people and sickened 7,000 people over just a few days. That happened \nin Donora, PA. We have came a long way since the expose on the New York \nLove Canal, where toxic waste was dumped into neighborhood streams.\n  We have made a lot of progress. I think the most important symbol of \nthat progress is that the environment is now in mainstream America. It \nis mainstream politics. It is a way of life for us, and that is really \ngood news. It has given us the political strength to pass important \nenvironmental laws. We passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, \nthe Superfund law. I am particularly pleased about the Chesapeake Bay \nProgram. I remember when we started that program almost 30 years ago. \nIt was a difficult start, and people wondered whether we would have the \npower to stay with this issue so that we could try to reclaim the \nChesapeake Bay. Well, we did. It is still an issue we are working on \ntoday. We created the Environmental Protection Agency, an agency in the \nFederal Government with the sole purpose to try to help us preserve the \nenvironment for future generations.\n  I think we can take pride in what we have been able to do. We have \nmade great progress as a nation. We should celebrate our success in \naddressing the great environmental challenges of the past. But our work \nis not done. Our environment faces new challenges today that are less \nvisible and more incremental but still pose great threats to our \ntreasured natural resources and all the work we have done to protect \nand restore them. For example, we do not worry that our great water \nbodies such as the Chesapeake Bay will catch fire, but there are small \namounts of pollutants running off millions of lawns that accumulate and \nmake it very difficult for us to reclaim our national treasures.\n  The great wave of water infrastructure we built over 40 years ago is \nnow past its useful life and must be replaced. Water main breaks, large \nand small waste water, destroy homes and businesses, and undermine the \nwater quality benefits this infrastructure was meant to protect.\n  Let me just give you a couple of examples that have happened in the \nlast\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\ncouple of years. In Bethesda, not very far from here, River Road, a \nmajor thoroughfare, became a river because of a water main break. In \nDundalk, MD, right outside of downtown Baltimore, thousands of \nbasements were flooded as a result of a water main break. In Baltimore \nCounty, just a few weeks ago, we had a water main break that denied \nresidential homeowners water service for many days. This is happening \nall over. In the city of Baltimore, 95 percent of their water mains are \nover 65 years old and have not been inspected. We need to pay attention \nto these issues.\n  If I had to mention the single most important challenge we face, it \nis in our energy policies. We all understand that, the impact it has on \nour environment, but we should also acknowledge that doing the energy \npolicy right will be good for our national security. We spend $1 \nbillion a day on imported oil. That compromises our national security.\n  For the sake of our national security, we need to develop a self-\nsustained energy policy on renewable energy sources. For the sake of \nour economy, we need to do that. We developed the technology for solar \npower and wind power. Yet we are not capitalizing on the jobs here in \nAmerica. Jobs are our most important goal. A sound energy policy will \nallow us to create more jobs here in America.\n  But today, on Earth Day, I want to talk about the environment. A \nsound energy policy means we can become a world leader and bring this \nworld into some sense on what is happening on global climate change, on \nthe indiscriminate release of greenhouse gas emissions by the burning \nof fossil fuels and nitrogen and carbon into the air. We know we can do \nbetter on that.\n  So on this Earth Day, let's rededicate ourselves to develop an energy \npolicy that will be not only good for our security and our economy but \ngood for our environment. Addressing the failing health of our world is \nnot just in the hands of our political leaders alone. Each of us can \nmake a difference by changing the way we live and move about the Earth. \nOur history shows us that bold and courageous actions by all of us to \ntackle our environmental challenges make us stronger, more vibrant, and \na healthier nation. That should be our message on this Earth Day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had informed my colleague from Louisiana \nthat I would come to the floor to once again ask unanimous consent on \nan issue he has been holding or blocking, and it is the issue of the \npromotion of General Walsh, a distinguished American soldier who has \nserved his country for 30 years and served in wartime, who has been \napproved to have a promotion to the rank of major general by the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, and that committee approved that promotion \nunanimously, the committee headed by Senators Carl Levin and John \nMcCain. Both strongly support the promotion of General Walsh. That \nsupport was given and the notice of promotion was voted on by the Armed \nServices Committee in September of last year.\n  This soldier's career has been put on hold by the hold of one \nSenator, the Senator from Louisiana. I informed him that I would speak \non the floor on this, so I am not being impolite. I normally would not \nspeak of another person solely on the floor of the Senate. Yet the \nSenator from Louisiana is the one who has exhibited the hold to prevent \nthe promotion of this soldier.\n  I know this soldier. That is not why I am on the floor. I know \nGeneral Walsh. He commands the Mississippi Valley Division of the Corps \nof Engineers and does a great job, in my judgment. But, again, his \ncareer has been stalled by the actions of one Senator.\n  That Senator indicates there are certain demands he has of the Corps \nof Engineers and unless they are met, he will not allow this soldier to \nbe promoted. The point is, this solder executes; this solder is not \nmaking policy in the Corps of Engineers, and he cannot do what the \nSenator from Louisiana demands he do. The Corps of Engineers does not \nhave the legal authority to do what the Senator from Louisiana demands \nhe do.\n  I have put in the Record the two letters the Senator from Louisiana \nhas given to the Corps of Engineers making certain demands. I have put \nin the Record the response from the Corps of Engineers.\n\n  I believe 2 days ago when we had this discussion that my colleague \nfrom Louisiana indicated the corps had missed 14 deadlines or deadlines \non 14 reports and he was not happy with the Corps of Engineers. I went \nback and found out what that was about. Let me just say that 10 of \nthose 14 reports dealt with the Louisiana coastal area. All of those \nreports were authorized in WRDA 2007. Prior to initiating the studies, \nthe corps was required by other law that exists to execute a \nfeasibility cost-sharing agreement with the State of Louisiana. To cost \nshare the study would result in the feasibility report. At the State of \nLouisiana's request, the corps did not execute this agreement until \nJune of 2009. I can describe the other four as well.\n  But to come to the floor and suggest that somehow the Corps of \nEngineers is slothful and indolent, or at least slothful, for missing a \ndeadline on reports, 10 of which they missed because the State of \nLouisiana requested they be delayed--I don't know, it seems to me that \nthis may not be on the level.\n  Let me make one final point. When a natural disaster hit Louisiana \nand New Orleans, I was one of those who cared a lot about reaching out \nto say: You are not alone. And it was not just me; it was all of my \ncolleagues. But I chair the subcommittee that provides the majority of \nthe funding for this. We provided all of the funding for the Corps of \nEngineers. The fact is, we have put--listen to this--$14 billion--$14 \nbillion--into New Orleans and Louisiana. I am proud of having done it. \nIt is what we ought to do as a country. But I must say that it wears \nout the welcome a bit for someone to come to the floor to disparage the \nCorps of Engineers and the efforts of the Corps of Engineers. That $14 \nbillion--much of that runs through the Corps of Engineers, and I wonder \nwhere that city and that State would be without the Corps of Engineers \nto be engaged with them in these battles.\n  So let me say to my colleague from Louisiana that demands being made \nof the Corps of Engineers that the corps cannot possibly comply with \nbecause the law will not allow them to comply are demands that are \nnever going to be met. To hold up the career of one distinguished \nsoldier who has served in wartime because the corps cannot meet demands \nrequired by the Senator from Louisiana is unfair. It is always and will \nalways be a disservice to uniformed soldiers anywhere to hold hostage \npromotions of soldiers in order to get demands that cannot possibly be \nsatisfied.\n  So I am going to once again ask unanimous consent that the nomination \nthat has existed on this calendar since September of last year to \npromote a distinguished soldier who has a distinguished record--I am \ngoing to ask once again that, at long last, perhaps my colleague will \nrelent and allow the promotion to proceed and allow this soldier's \ncareer to continue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar \nNo. 526, the nomination of BG Michael J. Walsh; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, any \nstatements related to the nomination be printed in the Record, and the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, as my colleague knows, I object. Let my \nsay why I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, may I proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Let me explain why I object, as I have explained very \nopenly, very clearly every step of the way. Michael Walsh is one of the \ntop nine officers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He is part of \nthe key leadership.\n  Senator Dorgan is a fierce, active, vocal defender of that \nbureaucracy, but before he continues and plunges into\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\nthat fierce and vocal defense, I suggest he step back for just a minute \nand truly think about and understand what he is defending. Before he \naccepts every suggestion, every argument of the Corps of Engineers' \nbureaucracy, I suggest he step back and look at the history of the \ncorps and look at the source he is accepting as gospel truth.\n  Senator Dorgan mentioned Hurricane Katrina, called it a great natural \ndisaster. It was a great natural disaster, a horrible natural disaster. \nIt was also a horrible manmade disaster because if we want to talk \nabout the greatest damage--not the only damage but the greatest \ndamage--inflicted upon the country from Hurricane Katrina--the flooding \nof the city of New Orleans--that was manmade by the Corps of Engineers.\n  That was due directly to the design flaws of the outfall canals in \nNew Orleans by the Corps of Engineers. The Corps of Engineers has \nadmitted this, and we have laid that out in congressional testimony \nsince Katrina. The problem is, no one in that bureaucracy has ever been \nheld accountable for that. I don't want to focus on looking back. The \neven greater problem is looking forward because that bureaucracy has \nnot fundamentally changed.\n  I challenge my distinguished colleague, Senator Dorgan, to spend half \nas much time working with others to change the truly broken bureaucracy \nof the Corps of Engineers, spend half as much time as he has spent as a \nfierce, active, and vocal defender of that broken bureaucracy.\n  I am fighting for that change. I will continue to fight for that \nchange. I will use every tool available to me as a Senator to do so. \nFor instance, in the last WRDA bill, I worked very hard to craft \nlanguage to include in the bill the Louisiana Water Resources Council, \nan outside peer review body, to bring outside, independent expertise \nand analysis to work with the corps on key projects following Hurricane \nKatrina. That was included in the 2007 WRDA bill. It passed into law. \nDo my colleagues know what the corps did to implement that? Nothing. Do \nthey know how they acted to move that forward, an absolute, clear, \nstatutory authorization from Congress? They did nothing. They said they \nare not going to do it.\n  Finally, I got them to change their tune. Finally, they are committed \nto beginning to move forward 3 years later, but I had to get their \nattention through this scenario.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the only item on which they have ignored \nmandates from Congress and ignored pressing needs all around the \ncountry, including my part of the country. I tried to pinpoint specific \nitems where they were not living up to their mandate or to Congress's \ndirection. I could have listed dozens. Instead, I focused on nine \nspecific items. I worked closely with the corps, had several meetings \ndiscussing those items in an abundance of trying to work with them \ntoward resolution. After that, I focused on three of the nine, rather \nthan all nine. I laid out why they did have the authority to move \nforward in some positive way on all that. I am going to continue to do \nso until we get real, positive change at the corps and real, positive \nprogress on these important issues.\n  The Senator's main argument, apparently spoon-fed by the corps, is \nthat the corps has no authority to do anything in these areas, no \nauthorization language from Congress. That is flat wrong. Again, before \nthe distinguished Senator simply accepts every little e-mail, every \nlittle memo the corps feeds him, perhaps he should consider the source \nof that information. If the corps was always right, New Orleans would \nhave never flooded. If everything the corps said was good and true and \ngospel, we would never have had those billions of dollars of damage in \nterms of the catastrophic flooding of New Orleans caused solely by \nbreaches in canals which were design flaws of the Corps of Engineers.\n  Let me go through a few specifics and explain--I have done this with \nthe corps over and over--the authority they do have. One of my top \nconcerns--\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will yield when I am through. One of my top concerns is \nthe critical outfall canals in New Orleans. It was the breaches in \nthose canals that led to 80 percent of the catastrophic flooding of New \nOrleans. It was those breaches that were caused by design flaws of the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers. All I am asking under this category is \nthat the corps do a risk/cost analysis of the different options they \nhave identified in terms of fixing the outfall canals.\n  The reason I am concerned about the path they are moving down, which \nis their option 1, is that I truly believe it is much less safe and \nmuch less robust than their identified option 2. It is not only I who \nbelieves that. It is the corps who admits it. In the corps' report to \nCongress, which we mandated, the corps itself said: Option 2--that is \nthe option they are rejecting--is generally more technically \nadvantageous and may be more effective operationally over option 1 \nbecause it would have greater reliability and further reduces the risk \nof flooding.\n  In addition, Chris Accardo, the corps' chief of operations in New \nOrleans, said he is in favor of option 2 over option 1, absolutely.\n  In light of that, all I am asking, with the rest of the Louisiana \ndelegation, with all the affected communities in southeast Louisiana, \nis that the corps perform a risk/cost analysis comparing these \ndifferent options before they forge ahead building the option they \nthemselves admit is less safe, less dependable.\n  It is also important to note that the corps clearly has authorization \nfrom Congress to do this study. General Van Antwerp, in my office, \nclearly said they do. They have authorization. They have authority. \nThey can do the study. They are not going to do it. Why don't we \ncompare these options, the relative risk and the relative cost, before \nthe Corps of Engineers plunges ahead to build the option they \nthemselves say is less secure and less safe?\n  The second key issue I have focused on in my letters to the corps is \nthe mandated AGMAC project, including the buildup of protection banks \nin Vermilion Parish to give that parish greater protection from storm \nsurge. They were devastated during Hurricane Rita, in particular, and \nalso in significant events since then. Again, the corps has authority \nto do this project. This project is in the WRDA bill. The corps says: \nWe have busted our spending limits. We have explained to them various \nways they can solve that problem by using O funds, exactly as they \nhave used O funds for bank buildup in the MRGO project. We have given \nthem another route, to use the CWPPRA program in conjunction with the \nWRDA-mandated project. The corps' response has been pretty simple. Its \nresponse has been: No, we don't want to do it.\n  Third and finally, the other big concern I have highlighted and the \nmost obvious case of the Corps of Engineers ignoring the mandate of \nCongress, not having authorization, actively ignoring the mandate of \nCongress, is the critical Morganza to the gulf flood protection \nproject. That project was initiated in 1992, 18 years ago. Senator \nDorgan, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, wants to say that \nthe corps has no authority in this area. This project was included in \nthree different water resources bills, once, then twice, and then a \nthird time. Every step of the way, the corps has come up with excuses \nwhy they cannot move forward. Under their present plan, they are \nrestudying the project, and that restudy is due in December 2012. There \nis one little problem with that. That will be after the next water \nresources bill, which we hope to pass in 2011. All the people of \nLaFourche and Terrebone Parishes who are going without adequate \nprotection, who are in danger every additional hurricane season, having \nmissed three WRDA trains because of the foot-dragging of the corps, now \nunder the corps' present plan, they will miss a fourth.\n  We wish to talk about authorization from Congress. Is specific, full \nconstruction authorization in three WRDA bills not good enough? If that \nis not good enough, I don't know how to meet the corps' criteria.\n  If those three particular concerns are not enough, we can expand the \nlist. In an attempt to work with the corps, in an attempt to find \nresolution, I have narrowed the list. I have tried to compromise. I \nhave offered to meet with them. I am offering to meet with them again, \nas I have done consistently throughout the process. But if narrowing \nthe list is going to be held\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\nagainst me, we can expand the list. How about the final report of the \nLouisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration effort, a comprehensive \nanalysis mandated in Public Law, an emergency appropriations bill after \nHurricane Katrina? It was due in December 2007. It is not finished. It \nis not delayed because of the State of Louisiana. It is delayed because \nof the corps.\n  I know Senator Dorgan is anxious for a promotion of the corps \nleadership. I have to say, I am anxious for this critical report that \nwas due in December 2007. We haven't seen it.\n  Is that not good enough? How about the Louisiana Water Resources \nCouncil I talked about? That was mandated in the 2007 WRDA bill. The \ncorps has not produced it yet. It wasn't just authorized; it was \nmandated. It is not up and running. Senator Dorgan is anxious for a \npromotion for the pristine corps leadership. I am anxious for that.\n  How about the establishment of a Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem \nProtection and Restoration Task Force? That was mandated in the 2007 \nWRDA. We haven't seen that yet. The integration team under that task \nforce was a separate team mandated in the 2007 WRDA, 3 years ago. \nNowhere to be seen. That is not being held up by the State. That is the \ncorps. Clear authorization, clear mandate, nowhere to be seen.\n  How about a comprehensive plan for protecting and preserving the \nLouisiana coast? That was due in November 2008. That was mandated in \nthe 2007 WRDA. It is not being held up by the State, but it is nowhere \nto be seen. Senator Dorgan is anxious for promotion for the pristine \ncorps leadership. I am anxious for this important work to protect \nLouisiana citizens.\n  That is not the whole list. How about the Mississippi River Gulf \nOutlet Ecosystem Restoration Plan? That was due in May of 2008. We \nhaven't seen it. It has not been submitted. It is a corps report, not a \nState of Louisiana report. Nowhere to be seen.\n  How about section 707 of the WRDA? That actually mandates that the \nState can get credit from one project and it can be transferred to \nanother project. It is in clear language. The corps says they are not \ngoing to do it. You want clear authorization? We have it. The corps is \nignoring it.\n  How about section 7006 in the same 2007 WRDA. That requires that five \nconstruction reports be submitted to Congress to move forward with key \nprojects authorized in that WRDA, five critical projects. They are \nauthorized in the WRDA bill. They can't move forward until those \nconstruction reports are submitted by the corps.\n  We have not seen the first thing of any of those five reports. The \nState is not holding them up. We are waiting on the corps. The \ndistinguished Senator is anxious about a promotion for the pristine \ncorps leadership. Well, great. I am anxious to see that mandated \nreport.\n  We can go on and on. The point is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Louisiana describes me \nas anxious. I will tell you what I am anxious about. I am anxious to \nhave a Member of this Senate stop using a U.S. soldier and the \npromotion of a soldier as a pawn to meet certain demands. I am anxious \nnever to see that happen again.\n  We are talking about a soldier who has served in wartime, has served \n30 years, who, 6 months ago, was supposed to have been promoted by a \nunanimous vote of the Armed Services Committee under the leadership of \nCarl Levin and John McCain. Six months later, that soldier's career is \non hold because of one Senator.\n  I wish to say this. I think it was Will Rogers who said: It is not \nwhat he says that bothers me. It is what he says he knows for sure that \njust ain't so. I have just heard the most unbelievable amount of \nfiction on this floor. Let me describe some of it. My colleague has \njust gone through a tortured lesson in the most unbelievable \ninterpretation of the authority and the law with respect to the Corps \nof Engineers.\n  I said when I started today that we have put $14 billion into New \nOrleans and Louisiana. I have been proud to be a part of that as \nchairman of the subcommittee on Appropriations that actually funds \nthese issues--$14 billion. But I will say to my colleague, my colleague \nis fast wearing out his welcome with me and I expect the Corps of \nEngineers with this kind of behavior.\n  I do not normally do this personally, but I tell you what, when a \nsoldier serves his country and then my colleague says to that soldier: \nI am not going to allow you to be promoted until the Corps of Engineers \ndoes what I demand, when, in fact, the Corps of Engineers cannot \nlegally do what he demands, then I say that is using a soldier's \npromotion as a pawn, and I think that is unbelievably awful to do.\n  I wish to say this. My colleague described--in fact, he said I was \nusing information the corps feeds me. He went into a whole series of \npieces of language, suggesting we have all swallowed the minnow \nsomehow.\n  Let me say this. On the first item my colleague raised, he forgot to \nmake one important point. He said: I demand they do this. That is the \nfirst issue of his letter to the Corps of Engineers--the outfall canals \nand pump to the river. I demand they do this, he said. Well, they \ncannot do that, actually. What he is proposing, by the way, for his \nState and his city is to spend more money for less flood protection. \nThat is what he is proposing.\n  The corps will not do it, and I will tell you why. He knows why, but \nhe would not tell the rest of the folks here. But we actually had a \nvote on that in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Guess how that \nvote came out. The majority of the Democrats and the Republicans on the \nAppropriations Committee said: We do not intend to spend more money for \nless flood control protection. We do not intend to do that. We voted \nno. It is just one little piece of information my colleague left out on \nthe floor of the Senate. Convenient perhaps, but, nonetheless, he left \nit out.\n  I am not going to go through this. We have the majority leader and \nthe minority leader on the floor. But I offered, as a courtesy, to tell \nthe Senator from Louisiana when I was coming to the floor today. He did \nnot extend the same courtesy to me when I asked him to yield so I could \nmake a point about the vote, so I will not be extending that courtesy \nin the future.\n  I am going to come to the floor again on a unanimous consent request \nsaying: Let's have one person in this Senate stop using the promotion \nof a dedicated, decorated, American soldier as a pawn in order to meet \ndemands that the Corps of Engineers cannot meet. My colleague seems to \nthink somehow that the Corps of Engineers is something, an organization \nwithout merit. I will say this to him: There are plenty of things wrong \nwith, I suppose, every government agency and every government \norganization.\n  But I will say this. If you know much about the Corps of Engineers, \nyou are not going to want to be in a big flood fight without them as a \npartner. Oh, they have made mistakes, I tell you. But nobody has had \nmore floods than we have had in North Dakota, I expect, over a long \nperiod of time, and I wish to see the corps as a partner in the flood \nfight because they are good. They know what they are doing.\n  Yes, they have made mistakes. But when my colleague comes to the \nfloor of the Senate and says there are 14 reports, the Corps of \nEngineers blew it--14 reports--they cannot meet any deadlines, he does \nnot tell the rest of the story. I went and checked on those 14 reports. \nLet me describe 10 of them. I will not describe the other four because \nit would take some time. But for 10 of the reports the deadline was not \nmet on, it was because the reports required there be the execution of a \nfeasibility cost-sharing agreement with the State of Louisiana, and at \nthe request of the State of Louisiana, the corps did not execute the \nagreement until June of 2009.\n  So my colleague criticizes the Corps of Engineers, calls them a bunch \nof elitists. He says they miss all these deadlines. Well, at least on \n10 of the deadlines the State of Louisiana asked them not to proceed \nwith respect to that agreement until June of 2009. That is \nfundamentally unfair--fundamentally unfair.\n  With respect to Morganza to the gulf--and I could go through a whole\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\nlist of things to demonstrate that--as much as my colleague would like \nfor the corps to have complete authority and funding to do everything \nhe would like and then for them to say: Yes, absolutely, whatever you \nlike, we are willing to do--as much as he would like that, he is flat \nout dead wrong when he says they have the authority to do these things.\n  I put the demands in the Record, two letters from my colleague. They \nare in the Record and I have read and will read--but I will not do it \nnow because my colleagues are here and waiting to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest and then the Senator will maintain the floor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I will say to my friend, we have 99 other holds, but this \none, I will have to acknowledge, is a little egregious. One of our \nfinest military people is being held up for this. There are ways we can \nmove around this, and we will do it as quickly as we can with cloture.\n  I appreciate my friend yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have to get this done. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2553-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2553-S2566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RESTORING AMERICAN FINANCIAL STABILITY ACT OF 2010--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m., \nMonday, April 26, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 349, S. 3217, a bill to promote the financial stability of the \nUnited States by improving accountability and transparency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, here \nwe go again. The majority leader is once again moving to a bill, even \nwhile bipartisan discussions on the content of the bill are still \nunderway.\n  Just about an hour ago, the majority leader said:\n\n       I'm not going to waste any more time of the American people \n     while they come up with some agreement.\n\n  Well, I do not think bipartisanship is a waste of time. I do not \nthink a bill with the legitimacy of a bipartisan agreement is a waste \nof time.\n  Is it a waste of time to ensure that the taxpayers never again bail \nout Wall Street firms? Is it a waste of time to ensure that the bill \nbefore us does not drive jobs overseas or dry up lending to small \nbusinesses? Is it too much to ask, should an agreement be reached, that \nwe take the time to make sure every Member of the Senate and our \nconstituents can actually read the bill and understand the details?\n  This bill potentially affects every small bank and lending \ninstitution in our country. It has serious implications for jobs and \nthe availability of credit to spur economic growth. It has important \nconsequences for the taxpayers, if done incorrectly.\n  I think Americans expect more of us. I think they expect us to take \nthe time to do it right. I would add, my impression was that serious \ndiscussions were going on. I think they should continue. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Here we go again. This is a bill that has been out here for a month--\nweeks. I think people even reading slowly would have a chance to work \ntheir way through that in a month. This Kabuki dance we have been \ninvolved in for months now--my friend, and he is my friend, the ranking \nmember of that committee, the distinguished senior Senator from \nAlabama, worked with the chairman of the committee for weeks and \nweeks--weeks going into months--trying to come up with a deal we could \nmove forward on. That was no longer possible. No negotiations went on. \nMy friend from Alabama said that is enough.\n  Then we get the Senator from Tennessee coming in and spending weeks \nwith my friend, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd. \nThat fell through.\n  We are moving to this bill because we need transparency, we need \naccountability, we need someone to respond to Wall Street because they \nhave not responded to us.\n  This game is apparent to the American people. My friends on the other \nside of the aisle are betting on failure again, as they did with health \ncare, as they have done on everything this year. They did not get--\nhealth care was not Obama's Waterloo. Maybe they want this to be his \nWaterloo, but it is not going to be. We are going to move forward on \nthis piece of legislation because the American people demand it.\n  I have said publicly on many occasions, we need to get on this bill. \nRemember, we are not finalizing the bill. We are asking for the simple \ntask we used to do easily: move to the bill. I am only asking \npermission to get on the bill--to get on the bill--and then start \noffering amendments. I am not asking everybody to approve the bill as \nit is written. All I am asking for is we move to the bill.\n  If there is an agreement reached between the ranking member and the \nchairman of the committee, it is easy to take care of that. There would \nbe a substitute amendment. They would agree to it and probably it would \nbe accepted pretty easily. So to think this is some way to bail out \nWall Street firms is an absolute joke. Read the bill.\n  So in light of the objection, I now move to proceed. I am moving to \nproceed. It takes me 2 days. It takes the Senate 2 days for this to \nripen. We are going to have a vote Monday. We should be on the bill \ntoday offering amendments, having opening statements on the bill. Those \nwho think it is good, say something good about it. Those who think it \nneeds to be improved, improve it. But, no, we are going to waste the \nnext 4 days getting on the bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  So in light of the objection, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. \n349, S. 3217, and I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 349, S. 3217, the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010:\n         Harry Reid, Christopher J. Dodd, Byron L. Dorgan, Mark \n           Udall, Roland W. Burris, Daniel K. Inouye, Sherrod \n           Brown, Robert P. Casey, Jr., Mark Begich, Patrick J. \n           Leahy, Tom Udall, Patty Murray, Tom Harkin, Richard J. \n           Durbin, Frank R. Lautenberg, Benjamin L. Cardin, Bill \n           Nelson, Jack Reed.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just so the American public knows this also, \nif there is an agreement reached between Senators Dodd and Shelby and \nanyone objected to that agreement, I would have to start all over with \na bill because it would be a new bill and we would have the same games \nbeing played. So if they can come to an agreement, more power to them. \nThey will work this out as an amendment to the bill or a substitute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed occur at 5 p.m., Monday--I will \ndrag the vote; some people wanted it earlier, some wanted it later, and \nwe will not close the vote until at least a quarter to 6--so that will \nbe on Monday, April 26, at 5 p.m., and with the mandatory quorum being \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would only add, briefly, that Senator \nDodd and Senator Shelby are on the floor. I would encourage them to \ncontinue to do what they have been doing, which is to try to reach an \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\n  The only place where I would disagree with my good friend, the \nmajority leader, is I think it does make a difference which bill we \nturn to. Hopefully, the bill we turn to will not be a bill that came \nout of the committee on a party-line vote but, rather, a bill \nnegotiated on a bipartisan basis by those who know the most about the \nsubject: Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, and the members of their \ncommittee.\n  It is still my hope we will be able to go forward on a bipartisan \nbasis, and I look forward to hearing from Chairman Dodd and Ranking \nMember Shelby about the progress they make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n            Nomination of Brigadier General Michael J. Walsh\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am tempted to ask the minority leader, \nwhile he is on the floor, whether he might help us proceed to overcome \nthe objections of Senator Vitter and achieve the promotion that was \noffered 6 months ago but since has been blocked for a distinguished \nsoldier. I guess I will withhold on that and wait for another moment.\n  But let me indicate quickly--and I will be happy to respond to a \nquestion then--the Outfall Canals/Pump to the river, which my colleague \nis so significantly criticizing the Corps of Engineers for--let me read \nspecifically:\n\n       The Corps will conduct a supplementary risk reduction \n     analysis as part of the detailed engineering feasibility \n     study, including the NEPA compliance documentation, for \n     options 2 and 2a, if Congress appropriates funds for the \n     study.\n\n  Congress has actually voted on these funds through the Appropriations \nCommittee and said: No, we would not do that.\n  So my colleague knows that holding up the promotion of a soldier is \nnot going to achieve his ends. The Appropriations Committee has already \nvoted.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Virginia for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I have a question. I \nappreciate the comments of the Senator from North Dakota, and I agree \nwith his comments. I have to say--and I know some of my colleagues were \nhere earlier.\n  Before I came to this body, I spent a career as a CEO of a business \nand a CEO of a State. While I have great respect for this body and the \nrules and traditions of this body, something seems a little strange \nwhen 15 months into a new administration, this President can't get his \nnominees up for a straight up-or-down vote--put the management team in \nplace. If there is a challenge or a problem with the qualifications of \nthe gentleman the President proposes to be the head of the Corps of \nEngineers, we ought to debate that and vote him down, but he should not \nbe held in this kind of gray secret hold or this area of abeyance. A \nnumber of my colleagues have spoken about this already. All of the \nfreshman and sophomore Democratic Members--and I am sure we would \nwelcome our Republican colleagues to do the same--are saying this \nprocess of putting people on hold, particularly seeking holds that have \nno relationship to their qualifications for the job, is wrong.\n  I don't know how to answer this when people around Virginia ask me: \nWhy can't you get stuff done, and why can't these things be moved \nforward?\n  So a number of us--we may be new to the body, but just because of the \nvery action that is being debated right now--are going to continue to \npress this issue. I commend the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Again, is the Senator from North Dakota aware of any substantive \nreasons this man who served our country for so long in our military \nshould not be confirmed as the head of the Army Corps of Engineers?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Virginia, \nthere are no reasons with respect to this person's military service. I \nhave not heard any reasons from the Senator from Louisiana. He is not \nholding up his promotion because he thinks the man is unfit or didn't \nearn the promotion; he is holding up the promotion because he says he \nis demanding other things from the Corps of Engineers.\n  Despite my irritation, let me say I don't dislike my colleague from \nLouisiana. I intensely dislike what he is doing, and I expect most \ninformed soldiers in this country should dislike what he is doing \nbecause I believe it puts a soldier in the position of being a pawn as \nbetween the demands of a U.S. Senator and some agency.\n  I will go through at some point--the Senator, I know, is leaving this \nafternoon, and that is why I, as a matter of courtesy, told him when I \nwould come to the floor. But at some point later when others aren't \nwaiting, I will go through and describe the issues, responses to the \nissues, because the rest of the story is much more compelling than the \nhalf story given to us by the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The Ouachita River levees, the authorization for that Ouachita River \nand tributaries projects specifies that levee work is a nonfederal \nresponsibility. Congress has not enacted a general provisional law that \nwould supplant this nonfederal responsibility and allow the corps to \ncorrect levee damages not associated with flood events.\n  As much as a person--as someone here--doesn't like that answer, that \nis the answer. Again, my colleague is saying--if you strip away all the \nbark, my colleague is saying: I demand we spend more money on something \nthat will give us less flood control. Well, look, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has been confronted with that, and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee said: No way, we are not going to do it.\n  One final point, and then I will come back at some later point and \nthe Senator from Louisiana will respond and I will respond to him and, \nhopefully, someday he will decide there are other ways for him to \nachieve the means to an end rather than use the promotion of this \ndedicated soldier as a pawn in this effort he is making.\n  This Congress has appropriated $14 billion to help the people of New \nOrleans and Louisiana. How do I know that? Because I chair the \nappropriations subcommittee that funds these things. I chair that \nsubcommittee. I have been willing and anxious to help the people of \nLouisiana and New Orleans. I have been willing to do that because I saw \nwhat they were hit with: an unbelievable tragedy. I saw it. But I think \nit is pretty Byzantine to come to the floor and hear the relentless \ncriticism of the Corps of Engineers that has stood with the people of \nLouisiana and New Orleans, and even today is helping rebuild with that \n$14 billion. I think there is a time when you wear out the welcome of \ncertainly this Senator and others who have been so quick and so anxious \nto help, and you wear out the welcome of agencies such as the Corps of \nEngineers when you suggest somehow that they are a bunch of slothful \nbureaucrats who can't do anything right.\n  I have seen people wear out their welcome, and I tell my colleagues \nthis: This exercise in using this soldier as a pawn in this little \ngame, trying to misread the law and the authorities of the Corps of \nEngineers to demand that they do what they can't do in order to satisfy \none Senator, it is the wrong way to do business in this Senate.\n  I have not convinced my colleague to release his hold and allow, \nafter 6 months, this soldier's career to move forward. I know this is \njust one. There are 100 of them on the calendar. This is one, but it is \none that is unusual. It is one that is unusual because one soldier's \ncareer that has been recommended for promotion by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike is being held up by only one person. I have not heard \none other person come to this Chamber and say: I think it is a good \nidea to use a soldier's promotion as a pawn to try to get what I want. \nThere is not one other person who has done that, and I don't think \nthere is another Senator who would do it. If there is, let's hear from \nthem.\n  I will come back later. I know my colleague wishes to speak. Had he \nwanted me to yield, I certainly would have yielded, even though he \nwould not yield to me. There are certain things we shouldn't do around \nhere. Again, I don't dislike him, but I certainly dislike what he is \ndoing because I think it is so fundamentally wrong and undermines the \nkinds of circumstances in which we have always evaluated the merit of \npromotions for soldiers who have served this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am disappointed. I am disappointed. I am \ndisappointed my distinguished colleague is continuing to simply \nblindly, in my opinion, be a fierce defender of a bureaucracy which is \ntruly broken. Not a pawn in anything, a member of the leadership, one \nof the top nine officers of the leadership of this bureaucracy.\n  For my part, I will continue to fight to change, to fundamentally \nchange that bureaucracy and, for starters, to have them follow the law, \nto have them follow their mandates, their authorizations in the WRDA \nbill and the other legislation I have outlined.\n  I have outlined the authorization clearly to the corps. I will \noutline it again. I have outlined these significant studies that are \noverdue, have never been produced, not because of the fault of anyone \nelse, not because of the State of Louisiana. I will meet with them next \nweek. I will continue to work on that. I invite the Senator to work on \nthat sort of fundamental change, not just fiercely defending this, in \nmy opinion, truly broken bureaucracy.\n  I will also note, as the majority leader noted, one Senator cannot \nkill this nomination. One Senator cannot stop this promotion. The \nSenate can move on it, so I invite the Senate and the majority leader \nto do that. It is completely within the majority leader's--his party's \npower to move on that and to proceed with this nomination, and \ncertainly one Senator cannot stop that. But this one Senator will \ncontinue to fight to hold the corps' feet to the fire to make them live \nby their mandates, to move forward on these critical protection issues \nfor Louisiana.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me just quickly say I intend to work with everybody \nin this Chamber who comes here to work in good faith to solve problems. \nBut in my judgment, it is an unbelievable mistake to use the promotion \nof soldiers as a pawn in these circumstances.\n  I would say that as chairman of the subcommittee that funds all of \nthese projects and all of these issues, I have been pleased to send all \nof that money--$14 billion--down to Louisiana. But as I said, my friend \nis fast wearing out his welcome. I think my friend might want to learn \nthe words ``thank you,'' thank you to this Chamber, thanks to the rest \nof the American people who said to some people who were hit with an \nunbelievable tragedy: You are not alone. You are not alone. This \ncountry cares about you and is going to invest in your future. But I \nalso think thank you to the Corps of Engineers. It is quite clear they \nhave probably made some mistakes in all of our States. It is also clear \nthat it would be a pretty difficult circumstance for a State or for \npeople in any State to fight these battles without the experience and \nthe knowledge and the capability of the Corps of Engineers.\n  I just think from time to time constructive criticism is in order. I \nthink also from time to time a thank-you is in order. I also think in \nevery case--in each and every case, the truth is in order. I will go \nthrough and in every single circumstance describe where the Senator \nfrom Louisiana has said the Corps of Engineers has the authority and \nhas the funding, and I will show him that he is dead wrong, and I think \nhe knows it.\n  But if this impasse continues, my colleague, Senator Reid, the \nmajority leader, does have the capability to take 2 days of the \nSenate's time to file a cloture motion, and my expectation would be \nthat the vote would be 99 to 1 because I don't know of one other Member \nof the Senate who wants to hold up the promotion of soldiers in order \nto meet demands that a specific Federal agency cannot possibly meet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, just to close, I have said thank you many \ntimes, certainly to the American people, to these bodies in Washington \nrepresenting the American people. The Senator is certainly right about \nthat generosity and about a lot of the work of the corps.\n  I do disagree with the Senator in sort of lightly tripping over as a \nminor mistake design flaws that caused 80 percent of the catastrophic \nflooding of the city of New Orleans. I wouldn't think that is a minor \nmistake to trip over. But I will continue to work with the corps to \nresolve these issues, and I will go through every one of those \nadditional 11 items I outlined because we are waiting on that critical \nwork and on those critical reports. That is not only authorized, but it \nis mandated in the 2007 WRDA bill and other bills, and we need that to \nmove forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the presence of my colleague and \nfriend from Alabama, the former chairman and now ranking member of the \nBanking Committee on the Senate floor, and I will be very brief. We \nhave heard the proposal by the majority leader, the objection by the \nminority leader, and the announcement that there will be a filing of a \ncloture motion which will mature, I think, on Monday around 5 o'clock \nor so when a vote will occur.\n  Let me briefly express, first of all, my thanks to Richard Shelby, my \ncolleague from Alabama. For many months--going back more than a year, \nactually--we have been working together now on this. Over the last 38 \nor 39 months that I have been privileged to be chairman of the \ncommittee, we have sat next to each other. There have been some 42 \nproposals that have come out of the Banking Committee over the last 38 \nmonths, and I think 37 of them are now the law of the land.\n  There have been a wide range of issues, including things such as \nflood control, but also dealing with port securities, with risk \ninsurance, with housing issues, with credit cards--all sorts of issues \nthat our Banking Committee has wrestled with in the midst of the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression.\n  So before another word is said, before another amendment is filed or \nanother motion made, let me say thank you to Richard Shelby and my \nother members of the committee for their cooperation and the work we \nhave done together on that committee. Very few votes that have occurred \nhave been negative votes. We had a few of them that happened; that is \nunderstandable from time to time. But, by and large, we have worked \ntogether.\n  I want our colleagues to know, but also I think most of us want the \nAmerican public to know, that despite political differences, the fact \nthat we come from different parts of the country doesn't separate our \ncommon determination to see to it that we put ourselves on a much more \nsolid footing than, obviously, we were at the time this crisis emerged. \nWe want to never again see our Nation placed in economic peril as it \nwas over the last several years, with as many jobs and homes lost and \nretirements evaporating, health care disappearing because of job loss. \nWe have been dealing with all of the problems: small businesses \ncollapsing, credit shutting down, capital not available for new starts \nand new ideas.\n  So we have put together a bill. Granted, it was not a bipartisan vote \nin committee, but as I am sure my colleague will recognize, much of \nwhat is in this bill today is different than the one I offered in \nNovember. I am not going to suggest that my friend from Alabama and \nothers loved every dotted I and crossed t, but I believe he will \nacknowledge that there is a lot of cooperation represented in this \nbill, trying to come to some common territory so we can say to the \nAmerican public: Never again will you be asked to spend a nickel of \nyour money to bail out a financial institution. The presumption is \nfailure and bankruptcy. We want to wind you down in a way that doesn't \njeopardize other solvent companies and the rest of our economy in the \ncountry. We want to make sure consumers get protected, when they have a \nplace to go--when a product they buy fails, there is a place they can \ngo. We recently saw an automobile company where the accelerator jammed \nand people were put at risk. There was a recall on that product because \nit placed people at risk. Nothing exists today that allows for a recall \nof a financial product that puts you at risk. Our bill tries to do \nthat. We try to complete an early-warning system so we can pick up \neconomic problems before they metastasize into major issues. There are \nother pieces of it as well.\n\n  We are working to come to a common understanding of how best to \nachieve those goals and results. My hope is, because of the magnitude \nof the bill, we\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\ncan get to a debate and discussion. My experience over 30 years in this \nChamber is that we never get to a resolution of issues until we have \nto. As long as there are sort of discussion groups going on in various \nrooms of the Capitol and meetings that we have--that is all helpful and \ncan help us understand issues better, but the only way we get to a \nresolution of conflicting ideas, in the final analysis, is to be on the \nfloor of this Chamber, where Members bring their ideas and we work on \nthem together. We try to accept the good ones or modify them to make \nthem fit into the structure. The bad ideas we try to reject when we \ncan. But you have to be here.\n  Senator Shelby and I, as hard as we work, we know we don't represent \n98 other people in this Chamber. Other Members who are not members of \nour committee or who are members of our committee certainly have every \nright to be heard on this bill and to express their ideas as to how we \ncan do a better job of achieving what we are trying to achieve. But we \nneed to get there. If we don't even have the chance to start this \nprocess, you can't ask the two of us to resolve it for everybody. It is \ntoo much. We can try to come close and we can try to reflect the views \nof our respective caucuses and the American people, but don't expect us \nto sit there and write a complete bill to deal with an entire meltdown \nof the financial sector of our Nation. We can help get there. We have \ngood ideas on how to achieve it. But we need this body to function. It \ncannot function as long as we are debating whether we can even get to \nthe bill.\n  We have spent more than a year on this, and over a month ago we \nfinished our work in the committee. It was voted out of committee. It \nwasn't a bipartisan vote, but we moved forward. Now we have a chance \nfor this body to act on the product that came out of committee, which \nwill be before us. Where we can get agreement and some changes, we will \nhave a managers' amendment or a substitute or whatever procedural way \nnecessary to try to accommodate those, reflecting the ideas of our \ncolleagues. Others can bring their ideas to the debate. We need to have \nthat. That cannot occur until we are actually here doing it.\n  I urge my colleagues, principally, I say, on the minority side but \nnot exclusively--I think there are those on the majority side as well--\neverybody can play hold-up and say: If I don't get my way and if you \ndon't do what I want, then I will object to getting to the bill. If \nthat is the case, who wins on this matter? Certainly not the American \npeople, who expect a little more out of this Chamber than whether each \n100 of us insists upon our own agenda. It doesn't work that way, \nunfortunately. This is not an executive body. We are coequals here, \neven those in the leadership. We have a right to be heard.\n  My colleague from Arkansas, chairman of the Agriculture Committee--\nthey marked up a bill dealing with derivatives and other matters, as \nthey should. There is jurisdiction of that matter in their committee. \nWe did the same. We have some jurisdiction over the subject matter. We \nneed to harmonize the rulemaking on that subject matter.\n  I hope that on Monday afternoon, Senator Shelby and I will continue \nworking with each other, as will our staffs today, tomorrow, and over \nthe weekend, to try to come to some understanding on some of these \nmatters. I am not going to tell you to count on the two of us to solve \nall of our problems. We cannot.\n  I ask everybody, let's get to the debate. The American people cannot \ntolerate us doing nothing, waiting around to see if another crisis \ncomes and whether we can respond to it. That is unacceptable.\n  About 5 on Monday, we need to have the votes to go forward. The two \nof us will sit in our respective chairs and present our ideas and talk \nand discuss how these ideas can emerge, and we will invite our \ncolleagues to come to the floor to debate, discuss, and offer their \nideas, and we will try to make this an even better bill. We think we \nhave a good one, but we also know that anybody who suggests to you that \nthey have written the perfect piece of legislation, be wary of them. I \nhave never seen a perfect bill in 30 years--maybe a Mother's Day \nresolution or something, but aside from that, don't count on perfection \nto be offered here. It is anything but perfect. I hope we get to that \nmoment.\n  We have had our discussions over the last week, and I will continue \ntalking about the substance of our bill. We cannot turn into a petulant \norganization here that screams at each other. We need to get about the \nbusiness the American people sent us here to achieve. With the \nrelationship I have had with my friend from Alabama, I remain \noptimistic we will get the job done.\n  Legislative processes are not the most beautiful things to watch. It \nis what our Founders designed, what those who have come before us have \nbeen able to use to achieve some of the great successes of our Nation \non many different matters.\n  We are now confronted with another great challenge as to whether we \ncan step up and resolve the kinds of issues that would avoid the kind \nof catastrophe we almost witnessed in our Nation. That is our job. We \nare chosen by the citizens in our States to represent not only their \ninterests but our fellow countrymen's interests as well.\n  I look forward to the vote on Monday. I hope we may not have to have \nit, that we can proceed to the bill and let Senator Shelby and I and \nthe committee members and others do the work and shape a good bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Dodd for his \nleadership on the Banking Committee. I worked with him, as he said, \nday-in and day-out, and this is the fourth year of his chairmanship. We \nhave achieved a lot together in a bipartisan way.\n  Both sides of the aisle are working together for a common goal. We \nshare a lot of these goals. What are some of the goals?\n  Ending bailouts. Senator Dodd and I both believe that nothing should \nbe too big to fail--financial institutions and, I believe, \nmanufacturing and anything else. Nothing should be too big to fail. We \nare working toward that end.\n  Protecting consumers. We are very interested in a consumer agency. We \nwant to balance that, while protecting the deposit insurance fund and \nso forth.\n  Regulating derivatives. Let's be honest, they played a big role--a \nlot of them in the closet, unknown, and so forth--in our financial \ndebacle. Derivatives are used every day legitimately by so many of our \nbusinesses, not only in America but all over the world. So we need to \nregulate derivatives while protecting jobs and our economic growth. It \nis a common desire. Details matter here. The Presiding Officer \nunderstands that. Senator Dodd understands it very well.\n  As we are moving down the road in the process, we are continuing to \nnegotiate and to do it in good faith, trying to reach a common goal. \nWho knows what will happen between now and Monday or next Tuesday or \nWednesday or Thursday. I hope it is a bipartisan bill and that we can \ngather a lot of people on both sides of the aisle to support it. I \nthink that is one of our goals.\n  What is the main goal? To do it right. Don't just do it, but do it \nright. Will it be perfect? Nothing is perfect, as Senator Dodd talks \nabout. But if we work in good faith, as we are trying to while the \nprocess is going forward, I think we can make some real progress toward \nthe common goal--to have a strong financial system that is well \nregulated, to have derivatives that are brought out of the closet to \nwork, and to have a consumer agency that will work for all of us. There \nare many other things, but that is my goal, and I share that with \nSenator Dodd.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Udall of Colorado pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 3247 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3248 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                               Earth Day\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment about\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\nEarth Day. This is the 40th anniversary of Earth Day--the 40th Earth \nDay, in fact, the 22nd of April. I am speaking now because of my great \nadmiration for the work of Senator Gaylord Nelson in establishing this \nEarth Day. I was reminded of it in two respects in the last week. One \nwas getting to visit with his widow, Carrie Lee Nelson, who is a great \npersonage herself, who made a great contribution to his career in \npublic service and continues today to advocate for the same issues he \nadvocated for, particularly as they relate to the environment.\n  Also earlier this year, Don Ritchie, our Senate Historian who speaks \nto us on Tuesdays at the Democratic lunch each week when we get \ntogether, gave what I thought was a fitting tribute to Gaylord Nelson \nthat I wanted to share with people. I asked permission to do that. Don \nRitchie agreed that was something that was acceptable. I would like to \nread through this and take 2 or 3 minutes.\n  As the Senate Historian, he recounted the facts as follows:\n\n       This past weekend, the Mini Page, a syndicated children's \n     supplement that appears in 500 newspapers across the country, \n     paid special tribute to a former U.S. Senator, Gaylord \n     Nelson, for launching the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. \n     Five years after his death, Senator Nelson remains an icon of \n     the environmental movement.\n       Senator Nelson used to say he came to environmentalism by \n     osmosis, having grown up in Clear Lake, WI. He promoted \n     conservation as Governor of Wisconsin and, after he was \n     elected to the Senate in 1962, he used his maiden speech to \n     call for a comprehensive nationwide program to save the \n     natural resources of America. He went on to compile an \n     impressive list of legislative accomplishments, which \n     included preserving the Appalachian Trail, banning DDT, and \n     promoting clean air and clean water. But it was Earth Day \n     that gave him international prominence and served as his \n     lasting legacy.\n       Senator Nelson worried that the United States lacked a \n     unity of purpose to respond to the increasing threats against \n     the environment. The problem, in his words, was how to get a \n     nation to wake up and pay attention to the most important \n     challenge the human species faces on the planet. Then a \n     number of incidents converged to help him frame a solution. \n     In 1969, a major oilspill off the coast of Santa Barbara \n     covered miles of beaches with tar. Senator Nelson toured the \n     area in August and was outraged by the damage the oilspill \n     had caused, but was also impressed with the many people who \n     rallied to clean up the mess. Flying back from California, \n     the Senator read a magazine article about the anti-Vietnam \n     War teach-ins that were taking place on college campuses. \n     This inspired him to apply the same model to the environment.\n       In September 1969, the Senator charged his staff with \n     figuring out how to sponsor environmental teach-ins on \n     college campuses nationwide, to be held on the same day the \n     following spring. Rather than organize this effort from the \n     top down, they believed that Earth Day would work better as a \n     grassroots movement. They raised funds to set up an office \n     staffed by college students, with a law student, Denis Hayes, \n     serving as the national coordinate. They identified the week \n     of April 19 to 25 as the ideal time for college schedules and \n     the possibility of good spring weather. Calculating that more \n     students were on campus on Wednesday made Wednesday, April \n     22, the first Earth Day. Critics of the movement pointed out \n     that April 22 happened to be Vladimir Lenin's birthday, but \n     Senator Nelson rebutted that it was also the birthday of the \n     first environmentalist, Saint Francis of Assisi.\n       An astonishing success, the first Earth Day in 1970 was \n     celebrated by some 20 million Americans on 2,000 college \n     campuses, at 10,000 primary and secondary schools, and in \n     hundreds of communities. Forty years later, its commemoration \n     this week is expected to attract 500 million people in 175 \n     countries.\n\n  I will at some later point talk about the environmental legacy of one \nof our own Senators from New Mexico, Senator Clinton Anderson, who was \none of the prime sponsors and promoters of the Wilderness Act and \nworked with Gaylord Nelson on many of these same environmental issues \nand, of course, with President Kennedy, Stewart Udall, and with \nPresident Johnson.\n  There are many people who deserve great credit for the legacy in this \ncountry and the focus on environmental issues, and Earth Day is an \nappropriate time to acknowledge their contributions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Mexico for \ndrawing our attention to Earth Day. It has certainly become a national, \nif not global, observance that calls to mind the relationship we have \nwith this Earth that we live on and our responsibilities. We are now \nconsidering legislation involving carbon and the impact of carbon on \nthe environment and on this planet. There are some differences of \nopinions on the floor of the Senate about whether this is a challenge \nand, if it is, how to address it.\n  Early next week, three of our colleagues are going to step forward \nwith a proposal. Senator John Kerry has spearheaded an effort, working \nwith Senator Barbara Boxer and Senator Bingaman, to come forward with \nan idea of clean energy. He will be joined by Senator Joseph Lieberman \nand Senator Lindsey Graham. It is a bipartisan effort.\n  What they are seeking to do in this bill is certainly consistent with \nthe goals of Earth Day and our national goals: First, to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, to encourage domestic energy sources that \nare renewable and sustainable so we can build on our future; second, to \ncreate jobs, which is our highest priority in this Congress with the \nrecession we face. We understand the reality that countries such as \nChina see a great potential for building solar panels and wind turbines \nand a variety of different forms of technology to promote energy \nefficiency and to promote the kind of clean energy approach that we \nshould have as part of our future. Third, of course, is that we want to \ndo something about pollution--carbon emissions, the impact they have on \nour lungs and on our atmosphere.\n  I think this is a noble agenda. It is an ambitious agenda because it \nengages the entire American economy. We want to be sure we do the right \nthing, the responsible thing, when it comes to clean energy and our \nfuture but not at the cost of economic growth and development. I happen \nto believe a case can be made that absent our effort, we are going to \nfall behind in the development of industries that have great potential.\n  There was a time that the two words, ``Silicon Valley,'' sent a \nmessage not only to America but to the world that we were leading in \nthe information technology development arena. I cannot even guess at \nthe number of jobs, businesses, and wealth that was created by that \ninformation technology leadership in the United States. Now we need to \nseize that leadership again.\n  It is frustrating, if not infuriating, to think that 50 years ago, \nBell Labs in the United States developed solar panels. Now, of the 10 \nlargest solar panel producers in the world, not one is in the United \nStates. That has to change. It is something of a cliche, but I say it \nin my speeches and it resonates with people, that I would like to go \ninto more stores in America and find ``Made in America'' stamped on \nthose products.\n  When it comes to this type of technology--solar panels, wind \nturbines--there is no reason we can't build these in the United States \nso that we are achieving many goals at once: a clean energy \nalternative, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, creating good-\npaying jobs in industries with a future, and in the process doing the \nright thing for Mother Earth. Earth Day is a time to reflect on that.\n  I have often spent Earth Day back in Illinois, downstate with \nfarmers, and I can't think of any class of people in America closer to \nMother Nature every single day of their lives. Most of them are not all \nthat comfortable with these so-called environmentalists. They think \nthey are too theoretical and not grounded in the reality that farmers \nface in their lives. But I have tried to draw them together in \nconversation, and almost inevitably they come up with some common \napproaches.\n  Whether we are talking about soil and water conservation or reduction \nof the use of chemicals on the land, all of these things are consistent \nwith both environmental goals and profitable farming. So I look at our \nstewards of the agricultural scene in America as part of our \nenvironmental community who can play a critical role in charting a \ncourse in making policies for the future.\n  Mr. President, I hope that soon we will be moving to financial \nregulatory reform. It is a Washington term known as Wall Street reform, \nor basically trying to clean up the mess that was created by this last \nrecession. This is a bill that is controversial. It has been worked on \nby many committees in the Senate. Senator Blanche Lincoln in the \nAgricultural Committee took on a\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\nbig part of it. Most people are surprised to think of Wall Street and \nthe Ag Committee at the same time, but those of us from Chicago are \nnot. We have a futures market which has been in place for almost a \ncentury, starting with the Chicago Board of Trade, and it deals in \nfutures--derivatives, if you will--that are based on agricultural \ncommodities and currency and interest rates and a certain index. That \noperation in Chicago is governed and regulated by the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. The jurisdiction of that, as it started with \nagricultural products, has been relegated to the Agriculture Committee.\n  Senator Lincoln met this week and did an outstanding job of reporting \na bill on that section of the bill related to derivatives and futures \nregulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. She was \nsuccessful in reporting the bill from her committee, with the support \nof Senator Grassley of Iowa making it a bipartisan effort. Another \nRepublican Senator expressed an interest in helping as well. So I give \nher high praise in this charged political atmosphere in which we work \nin this body. It says a lot for her that she can put together this type \nof bipartisan coalition.\n  At the same time, Senator Dodd, in the Banking Committee, has been \nworking on a bill as well, trying to bring the two together on the \nSenate floor and have a joint effort to deal with this issue.\n  Now, why are we doing this? Well, we are doing this for very obvious \nreasons. We know that leading into this recession, Wall Street and the \nbig banks in America got away with murder. At the end of the day, the \ntaxpayers of this country were called on to rescue these financial \ninstitutions from their own perfidy.\n  When we look at the things they did in the name of profit, it turned \nout to be senseless greed. At the end of the day, many people suffered. \nAs a result of this recession, $17 trillion was extracted from the \nAmerican economy--$17 trillion in losses. Mr. President, $17 trillion \nis more than the annual gross national product of the United States. So \nif we took the sum total value of all the goods and services produced \nin our country in 1 year, we lost that much value in this recession. It \nwas the hardest hit the American economy has taken since the Great \nDepression in 1929.\n  Of course, a lot of it had to do with bad decisions. Some individual \nfamilies and businesses made bad decisions. They borrowed money when \nthey shouldn't have. They got in too deeply, bought homes that were too \nexpensive. They might have been lured into it, but they made bad \ndecisions. The government made some bad decisions. We thought, as a \ngeneral principle, encouraging home ownership was great for our \ncountry; that the more people who own a home, the more likely they will \nmake that home a good investment for themselves, and the more likely \nthey will be engaged in their neighborhood and their churches and in \ntheir communities, and the stronger we will be as a nation. That was \nthe starting point. So we opened up opportunities for home ownership, \nreaching down to levels that had not been tried before, and, \nunfortunately, that went too far.\n  The private sector was to blame. When we look at so many people who \nwere lured into mortgages and borrowing far beyond their means, we see \nthere was also a lot of deception going on. People were told they could \nget a mortgage and make an easy monthly payment and weren't told their \nmortgage would explode right in front of them, as the subprime \nmortgage, in a matter of months or years, would have a monthly payment \nfar beyond their means. They weren't told there was a provision in that \nmortgage which had a prepayment penalty that stopped them from \nrefinancing, and that they were stuck with high interest rates from \nwhich they couldn't escape. They weren't told that just making an oral \nrepresentation about their income was not nearly enough; that they \nneeded to produce documentation about their real net worth.\n  These so-called no-doc closings, which became rampant in some areas, \nled to terrible decisions, encouraged by greedy speculators in the \nfinancial industries. So the net result was that the bottom fell out of \nthe real estate market and $17 trillion in value was lost in the \nAmerican economy. Most of us felt it in our 401(k)s, in our savings \naccounts, and in our retirement plans. We saw it with businesses that \nlost their leases and lost their businesses and had to lay off their \nemployees.\n  The President was faced with 800,000 unemployed Americans in his \nfirst month in office. That is an enormous number of people. The total \ntoday is about 8 million actively unemployed, with 6 million long-term \nunemployed. It is huge, and it affects every single State. In my State, \nthere is over 11 percent unemployment. In Rockford, IL, it is close to \n20, and Danville about the same. I have visited those communities, and \nI can see the pain and the sacrifices that are being made by people who \nhave lost their jobs.\n\n  So the President came in and asked us to pass a stimulus bill, which \nwe did. It was some $787 billion that was injected into the economy in \nan effort to get it moving again, providing tax breaks for 95 percent \nof working families and middle-income families across America. It was a \nsafety net for those who had lost their jobs, not only in unemployment \nbenefits but also COBRA or health insurance benefits, and finally an \ninvestment in projects such as highway construction, which would create \ngood-paying American jobs right now and produce something that would \nhave value for our economic growth in the years to come.\n  At the same time, though, as we go through this painful process of \ncoming out of this recession, we have to make changes in Wall Street \nand the financial institutions to guarantee that we would not face this \nagain. That means taking an honest look at some of the practices that \nare taking place today, and that are legal today. We got into this \nthinking--and I was part of it; most of us were--that if we had an \nexpanding financial sector in the United States, it would expand jobs \nand opportunities and business growth and global competition.\n  Unfortunately, it went overboard. Many financial institutions, which \nare now being called on the carpet, took the authority given them by \nthe Federal Government to an extreme. That is what we are trying to \nchange. We want to make sure there is some accountability on Wall \nStreet and with the big banks, so that we understand what they are \ndoing and that their investments don't end up being a gamble where \npeople can lose their life savings or investments.\n  We want to make sure as well that we empower consumers in the United \nStates. This bill that is going to come before us has the strongest \nconsumer financial protection ever enacted into law in the United \nStates. We are going to create an agency which is going to protect and \nempower consumers--protect them from the tricks and traps and shadowy \nagreements and fine print stuck in mortgages and credit card \nstatements, in student loans, in retirement plans, and all of the \nthings that people engage in daily in their lives where one sentence \nstuck in a legal document can end up being someone's downfall.\n  We want to protect consumers from that and empower consumers to make \nthe right decisions, so that there will be clarity in these legal \ndocuments that can bring a person's financial empire to ruin. That kind \nof clarity and plain English is going to be guaranteed by a Federal \ngroup that is going to keep an eye on the financial industries.\n  Some of these large banks are fighting us. They don't want to see \nthis happen. They do not believe there should be this kind of consumer \nfinancial protection. But we are going to fight to make that happen so \nconsumers across America have a fighting chance when they enter into \nagreements, so that they will have a legal document they can understand \nand one that they can work with, and then they will have an agency to \nback them up.\n  Currently, we have only had one Republican Senator vote for this kind \nof reform--Senator Grassley of Iowa voted for it in the Agriculture \nCommittee version that came out of Senator Lincoln's committee. But on \nthe Banking Committee, not a single Republican would vote for it. I \nhope they will have a change of heart.\n  I understand there are negotiations underway, but I hope the \nnegotiations don't water down the basic agreement in this bill. We need \na strong bill. We need a bill that meets the test of what\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\nwe have been through as a nation. After all of the suffering that has \ntaken place--the businesses lost, the savings lost, the jobs lost--for \ngoodness' sake, let's not come up with some halfhearted effort. Let's \nstand up to the Wall Street lobbyists who are going to try to water \ndown this bill and tell them no. We are going to call for a vote on a \nbill that has some teeth in it, something worth voting for, something \nthat will guarantee that we will never go through this kind of \nrecession ever again in our economy.\n  I think we owe that to the American people, and I hope that next \nweek, come Monday afternoon at 5 o'clock, when this Senate convenes for \na vote, I hope we have a strong bipartisan vote to move forward on this \nwhole idea of Wall Street reform. I believe that is in the best \ninterests of our country. I commend Senator Dodd and Senator Lincoln. I \nurge them to come together, bring their two bills together, and to come \nup with an agreement that can lead us into this kind of happy day where \nwe have this kind of legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me to speak in morning \nbusiness, and if there is no one seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Rhode Island Flooding\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, last month, my State was hit by the worst \nnonhurricane floods in the history of the State, at least in the last \n200 years.\n  Our Governor has preliminarily assessed the damage in the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, which is a significant figure for the smallest \nState in the Union. This disaster came at the worst moment for my \nstate. Rhode Island is struggling with an economic collapse that has \nleft it with a 12.7-percent unemployment rate and decimated State and \nlocal financial resources.\n  Indeed, many of the homeowners and businesses who were hit hardest by \nthe floods were among those already struggling to make ends meet. I \ntoured the State, along with my colleague, Sheldon Whitehouse, and met \nwith constituents from Cumberland to Westerly, from the north to the \nsouth, as they worked to clean their homes and businesses. We could see \nthe turmoil, as well as their physical and emotional strain and stress. \nThey are tired. They are frustrated, and they are asking for our help. \nI admire the spirit of people who are willing to pitch in and help \ntheir neighbors, and that was evident throughout the crisis. This \nsignificant blow came on top of the economic blows we have already \nsuffered. A flood like this is difficult in good times and it is truly \ntrying in bad times, as we have seen in Rhode Island.\n\n  I wish to commend FEMA and all the professionals in emergency \nmanagement who have come to Rhode Island for their help in the \nrecovery. They are doing a marvelous job. The speed of the response, \nincluding from Secretary Napolitano, has been tremendous. She was up \nthere on Good Friday looking at the flood damage. The FEMA teams were \non the ground. Deputy FEMA Administrator Rich Serino was there. He \nvisited the damage with me. This is emblematic of the commitment of the \nFEMA task force. It is not only FEMA. It is also the Small Business \nAdministration. The regional EPA director was there, the regional small \nbusiness administrator was there. We had representatives from the Army \nCorps of Engineers and the district engineer.\n  The most emblematic story was told to me in Washington by a Rhode \nIslander who was visiting. She was a visiting nurse. She said her \nsister was at home on Easter. She had some flood damage. The doorbell \nrang, and it was FEMA. They said: We work 7 days a week. Here is the \nestimate of the damages, and we will be able to help you in this way.\n  Even with this dramatic and effective response, the damage was \nwidespread. It covered every corner of the State. This was the first \ntime we have seen, in my lifetime and going back a long time, not only \nsurface water coming over the banks of rivers--there are some areas \nthat perennially flood, similar to anywhere in the country--this was \ngroundwater. We had been so saturated with rain for weeks and weeks. \nWhen the final deluge came, there was no place to hold the water. It \ncame up through cellars, through sump pumps, through everything. There \nwere very few parts of the State, very few homes unaffected by at least \nminor basement flooding; in some cases, very major water damage.\n  The story of the Pawtuxet River is an example of what transpired. Let \nme also say that in my course of traveling around, I was reeducated in \nthe development of northern industrial communities. I am looking at the \nSenator from New Hampshire. The development started with a mill on a \nstream for water power. Then they built mill cottages around that. \nThose mills are still there. Those cottages are generally occupied \ntoday by relatively low- or moderate-income people. The mill owner, I \nrecall now, put his house on the top of the hill, not around the mill. \nSo that is Rhode Island. That is Massachusetts. That is Connecticut. \nThat is New Hampshire. When these waters flood, you perennially get \nsome communities that see damage from surface water. This is the first \ntime we saw this incredible groundwater as well.\n  We are a community of rivers and mill villages. The Blackstone River \nis where the American Industrial Revolution began, the Pawtuxet River \nin Cranston, the Pawcatuck River, the Pocasset River in Johnston and \nCranston--they all were above flood stage. The Pawtuxet River, in my \nhometown of Cranston, on March 15, crested at a record high of 15 feet. \nRemarkable. Neighborhoods along the banks flooded as homes and \nbusinesses were evacuated. I toured those neighborhoods later in the \nweek and saw the damage. Again, along with Senator Whitehouse, I worked \nto support a major disaster declaration which was promptly granted. The \npeople of Rhode Island appreciate President Obama very quickly \nsupporting a major disaster declaration, not only for individuals but \nalso for public entities, the cities and towns. This is something he \ndid with great speed and great efficiency. I thank him personally.\n  Actually, the initial flooding was around March 12 or 13. Then we got \nthe second deluge. It was a two-stage event. As the rains were falling, \none woman profiled on local television looked in exhaustion at the new \nfurnace she just installed. In anticipation of the second flood, there \nwas an attempt to move vehicles, furnaces, et cetera around, to shore \nup or raise equipment on factory floors. But the rapidity and extent of \nthe rain was such that the flood was there before many people could \nreact.\n  Let me try and give a sense of the damage. This horizontal axis runs \nsouth-north under the overpass. This is Route 95, the principal \ninterstate running along the east coast. It was shut down for two days \nbecause of flooding. The road was completely inundated with water, \ncompletely covered. Then, in the next picture, this is the city of \nWarwick's wastewater plant, totally engulfed in water. In addition to \nthat, the city of Warwick is also home to our airport. So for 2 days, \nwhen you got off a plane, you saw a sign that asked you to respectfully \nuse restrooms someplace else or the Porta-John because the airport \ncould not use their toilets. The whole city asked their citizens to \nsuspend flushing for 2 days. So this impact is something we have never \nwitnessed before. The next photograph is the Warwick Mall, one of the \nmajor shopping centers in the State of Rhode Island. It is totally \nengulfed in water and the inside is flooded. These are stores and \nretail establishments. They are still trying to reopen it. This \nfacility employs about 1,000 people. They are still out of work. When \nyou a have 12.7-unemployment rate and 1,000 people can't work because \nthey have been flooded, that is adding excruciating pain to something \nthat is already difficult. I must commend the owner of the mall, Aram \nGarabedian. Aram is indefatigable. Nothing is going to defeat him. \nImmediately, he was in here cleaning up. It is on the road to recovery \nand return, but this has been a blow economically to the State. As I \nsaid, in Rhode Island, because of our small size and community, there \nare five or six principal malls. Essentially, 20 percent of our mall \nsector is out of business.\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\n  The next photograph is typical of the property damage. This is in my \nhometown of Cranston. Notice the sign: ``Give this land back to the \nriver.''\n  The river decided for a moment to reclaim it. This is the result of \nthe surface flooding and the subsurface water coming up. This looks \nlike the entire inside of the home has been destroyed and removed. Here \nis a hot water heater, a toilet. Although the house is standing, what \nis inside is basically a shell. This is a homeowner who now has to \nrebuild their house, essentially, and replace water heaters, toilets. \nOne of the issues we have is that in some of these areas, because of \nthe subsurface flooding, they are not a flood zone. Unless they have \nrecently borrowed money on a mortgage, there is probably little \nrequirement for them to have flood insurance. Typically, in these \ncommunities, the houses have been occupied for 20, 30, 40 years by one \nfamily. They have either paid off the mortgage or they don't require \nflood insurance. So many people, frankly, don't have flood insurance. \nThen, of course, there is going to be wrangling with the insurance \ncompanies because, in some cases, where it was just subsurface water, \nthat does not fit their definition of a flood. So depending on your \npolicy, or if you have coverage, there are thousands of homes in Rhode \nIsland that are significantly damaged. The owner has no resources to \nrebuild unless he gets some assistance. Again, FEMA has been very good \nfor temporary assistance, but we have to look more long term.\n  Finally, this is Hopkinton, RI, which is part of our rural area in \nthe west. This photo shows the scope of the flooding there. This \nstructure is totally surrounded by water. I was in other parts of this \narea, in another community, Charlestown. There was a bridge that was \nclosed. As you walked across the bridge on the other side, because of \nthe water moving under the ground, it looked as if someone had dropped \na 500-pound bomb. It was a huge crater. Now the town has to rebuild the \nbridge. Of course, they don't have the money to do so.\n  All this is indicative of the situation in Rhode Island. A further \npoint. This photograph was taken a week after the flooding. Notice it \nis sunny. This is a week after the flooding. These owners couldn't even \nget to their building after a week. This could have been worse in this \nparticular locale because farther upstream there is a dam, the Alton \ndam. It was overtopped and the waters were going over it. There was so \nmuch concern that it was in danger of collapsing that there was an \nemergency evacuation order for the town of Westerly, which is a sizable \ncommunity to the south on the coast. They were afraid the dam would \ngive and a major metropolitan area, in Rhode Island terms, would be \nengulfed with water. Luckily the dam held, and the damage was \nsignificant but restricted to flooding along the Pawcatuck.\n  Within the context of jobs, too, several of our facilities and \nfactories were knocked out. Bradford Printing and Finishing has already \nlet go of its employees. They were underwater. They are still trying to \nliterally get back to work. It has been closed for cleanup. Again, \nworkers are on the street, not because they don't have demand for their \nproduct. It is because they can't get to the machines where they are \nflooded. Another company in northern Rhode Island, along the Blackstone \nRiver, Hope Global, an extraordinary CEO Cheryl Merchant, they were \nflooded in 20005. I was there. I had to take a boat into their factory. \nThis time, in anticipation, they literally lifted the equipment. This \nis a major producer of OEM for the auto industry, webbing and belts, \nseatbelts, et cetera. They pushed up all that heavy equipment. The \nwater came in, but it didn't reach the equipment. They are back in \nproduction, but the preparations and the cleanup are about $1 million. \nIt is hard for the manager of the plant to explain to the board of \ndirectors why they are going to spend $1 million every 5 years just to \nkeep the equipment dry.\n  We have to do something in terms of mitigation. Even in the best \ntimes, FEMA would have been necessary. But we are in a very difficult \nsituation. The State is, as we speak, trying to fill a $220 million \nshortfall in this year's budget. Again, this is a State where $220 \nmillion is a significant part of the budget. It is not a rounding \nerror. They are already anticipating a $400 million shortfall next year \nin the 2011 budget. The bond rating has been lowered once in the last \nseveral weeks. It may be lowered again, if this economic distress and \nthis flood damage can't be, in some way, mitigated and supported in \nterms of cleanup or reconstruction.\n  Frankly, my constituents know--and we all have seen similar scenes of \nflooding from the Midwest, from the Southwest, from the Central part of \nAmerica--every time, at least in my recollection, this Senate has stood \nand provided support for those communities.\n  I have supported emergency expenditures for flooding in communities \nelsewhere in the country, except really up in Rhode Island because we \nhave never had an experience before of this nature, of this size, of \nthis scope. They, frankly, do not begrudge the aid because, as I sense \nand as my colleagues and constituents sense, someday we might be in \nthat position where we are going to have to ask for it. Well, we are in \nthat position right now. So for everyone who has been here--and it is a \nsignificant number--and asked on behalf of their constituents for help \nbecause of a devastating flood, I am joining those ranks. We will have \nan opportunity, I hope, in the appropriations process through the \nsupplementals to provide additional assistance to the State of Rhode \nIsland, for my constituents to deal with this situation, both the \neconomic distress and the physical damage from this flooding.\n  So, Madam President, I again thank you for the opportunity to talk \nabout what happened, and I will be back again because, as we have \nresponded to the needs of other parts of the country, we ask that we be \ngiven the same treatment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Reuters Investigation of WellPoint\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, earlier today my staff brought to my \nattention an article that had just come out on Reuters. I read it and \nfelt an outrage and dismay and decided I was going to come to the floor \nand speak about it.\n  Today, an investigative story published by Reuters details how \nWellPoint, a medical insurance company--as a matter of fact, the \nNation's largest health insurance company, with 33.7 million \npolicyholders--used a special computer program to systematically \nidentify women with breast cancer and target their health policies for \ntermination--in other words, an effort to specifically target women \nwith breast cancer and then drop their health insurance. I would like \nto ask every American to read this jaw-dropping story. Instead of \nproviding the health care for which these seriously ill women have \npaid, WellPoint subjected these paying customers to investigations that \nended with WellPoint's administrative bureaucrats canceling their \ninsurance policies at their time of greatest need.\n  Under attack by both cancer and WellPoint, these women were left \nailing, disabled, and broke. Let me give you a few examples.\n  Yenny Hsu, a woman from Los Angeles, was kicked off of her insurance \npolicy after a breast cancer diagnosis because WellPoint said she \nfailed to disclose that she had been exposed to hepatitis B as a child. \nNow, that has nothing to do with breast cancer, but it did not stop \nWellPoint from terminating her coverage.\n  In Texas, a woman named Robin Beaton was forced to delay lifesaving \nsurgery because WellPoint decided to investigate whether she had failed \nto disclose a serious illness. The serious illness in question was a \ncase of acne. WellPoint delayed her surgery for 5 months, causing the \nsize of the cancerous mass in her breast to triple. By the time they \nfinally dropped their investigation, she needed a radical double \nmastectomy.\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\n  Another loyal, paying WellPoint customer who faced this situation was \nPatricia Relling of Louisville, KY. Ms. Relling was an interior \ndesigner and art gallery owner who never missed a payment. But that did \nnot stop WellPoint from canceling her insurance in the middle of her \nfight with breast cancer. WellPoint abandoned her at her weakest \nmoment, forcing her to pay enormous medical bills on her own. This \nwoman, who was once a highly successful business owner, is now \nsubsisting on Social Security and food stamps.\n  Meanwhile, WellPoint made a profit of $128 million by stripping \nseriously ill Americans of their insurance coverage in this manner, \naccording to the House Energy and Commerce Committee. This is likely a \nlow estimate because WellPoint refuses to provide a total number for \nrescissions across the company's subsidiaries. WellPoint earned a $4.7 \nbillion profit in 2009--a $4.7 billion profit in 1 year. Angela Braly, \nthe CEO of WellPoint, received $13.1 million in total compensation in \n2009. This was a 51-percent increase in her salary over the prior year.\n  WellPoint is not alone in doing this to people, but they are an \negregious offender. According to the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee:\n\n       WellPoint and two of the nation's other largest insurance \n     companies--UnitedHealth Group Inc and Assurant Health, part \n     of Assurant Inc--made at least $300 million by improperly \n     rescinding more than 19,000 policyholders over one five-year \n     period.\n\n  According to Health Care for America Now, these large companies--the \nbig, for-profit American medical insurance companies--have seen their \nprofits jump 428 percent from 2000 to 2007. All during this period, \nthey have doubled premium costs. So they have made huge profits in 7 \nyears, and they doubled premium costs.\n  Time and time again, our for-profit insurance corporations have \ndemonstrated that their hunger for profit trumps any moral obligation \nto their customers. This latest story is just the latest example of the \nkind of outrageous behavior we have come to expect from certain medical \nhealth insurance companies.\n  The health insurance reform law passed by Congress and signed by \nPresident Obama will end the practice of unfair rescission and \ndiscrimination because of preexisting conditions. But we must clearly \nbe vigilant in order to ensure that the law has teeth and is heavily \nenforced. We cannot turn our backs for 1 minute because left to their \nown devices, I truly believe these companies will look for ways to \nthrow paying customers to the sharks for the sake of profit. These are \nstrong words, and I am not known for these strong words. But the more I \nlook into the large, for-profit medical insurance industry of the \nUnited States, the more I am embarrassed by it.\n  A situation unfolding in my own State now is further proof of this. \nOn May 1--that is 9 days from now; it is 1 week from Saturday--more \nthan 800,000 Californians who hold insurance policies issued by \nWellPoint's Anthem Blue Cross subsidiary will face rate hikes of up to \n39 percent.\n  I have received deeply personal letters from literally hundreds, if \nnot thousands, of Californians whose lives are going to be devastated \nby these rate increases. We have 12.7 percent unemployment. We have \nover 2.3 million people unemployed. We are very high in house \nforeclosures, people can't find jobs, and at the same time the \ninsurance premiums are being jacked up. This is terrible because many \nof these people had a premium increase almost as large as the 39 \npercent that is going to happen on May 1, last year, and then they know \nthey face it again the next year.\n\n  I cannot say that all of this is responsible for these premium \nincreases, but in my State alone, 2 million people in the last 2 years \nhave gone off of health insurance. That is 1 million people a year who \nfind they can't afford health insurance. So they have gone off of it, \nmore on Medicaid, and many have no coverage whatsoever. This is at a \ntime when this same company is reaping billions of dollars of profit. \nSo what do I conclude? There is no moral compass. There is no ethical \nconduct.\n  These are families with children. They are students or the elderly. \nOne woman had been a client of Anthem for 30 years. She had never been \nsick, and she got sick. Cancer survivors, small business owners, they \nare about to be crushed.\n  WellPoint will tell us that these premium rate hikes cannot be \navoided. They will tell us that others are to blame: hospital charges, \nprescription drug prices, the rising cost of medical care. They blame \nthe government. They blame the economy. But the fact is, they are \nmaking money, and billions of dollars of money.\n  If there was any doubt about whether corporate greed has anything to \ndo with WellPoint's plan to jack up rates on customers, I think today's \nstory by Reuters answers the question definitively.\n  In order to prevent these kinds of unfair premium rate hikes on \nAmericans, I have introduced a bill that would establish a health \ninsurance rate authority. It would give the Secretary of Health the \nmandate to see that rates are reasonable. Two days ago, the HELP \nCommittee held a hearing on this bill. The chairman of the committee, \nSenator Harkin, made some very strong statements in favor of it, as did \nother Democrats. The Republicans who spoke, of course, opposed it \nbecause they are in a mode where they oppose virtually everything right \nnow, but they opposed it.\n  So here is what my bill would do. It would give the Secretary of \nHealth the authority to block premiums or other rate increases that are \nunreasonable. In many States, insurance commissioners, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, already have this authority. They would not be affected. \nCommissioners have the authority in some States--in some insurance \nmarkets they have it--and in others they do not. In about 20 States, \nincluding my own, California, companies are not required to receive \napproval for rate increases before they take effect. So my legislation \nwould create a Federal fallback, a fail-safe, allowing the Secretary to \nconduct reviews of potentially unreasonable rates in States where the \ninsurance commissioner does not already have the authority or the \ncapability to do so. The Secretary would review potentially \nunreasonable premium increases and take corrective action. This could \ninclude blocking an increase or providing rebates to consumers.\n  Under this proposal, the Secretary would work with the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners to implement this rate review \nprocess and identify States that have the authority and capability to \nreview rates now. States doing this work obviously should continue. \nThis legislation would not interrupt or effect them. However, consumers \nin States such as California and Illinois and others--about 20 some-odd \nStates--would get protection from unfair rate hikes.\n  The proposal would create a rate authority, a seven-member advisory \nboard to assist the Secretary. A wide range of interests would be \nrepresented: consumers, the insurance industry, medical practitioners, \nand other experts.\n  I think the proposal strikes the right balance. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, we have worked with the administration in drafting it. \nWe worked with the Finance Committee. We worked with the Secretary of \nHealth. We tried to get it into the Finance Committee's health reform \nbill. We were not able to do so. The President took this bill and put \nit in the reconciliation bill. Unfortunately, the Parliamentarian found \nthat its policy implications overcame its budgetary savings, and \ntherefore a point of order would rest against it. So it was dropped at \nthat time. So we are trying again. It is necessary.\n  Nine days from now, 800,000 Californians will get up to a 39-percent \nincrease in their premium rate. It is greed, pure and simple.\n  So the legislation I have introduced provides Federal protection for \nconsumers who are currently at the mercy of these large, for-profit \nmedical insurance companies whose top priority is their bottom line. \nThe bottom line for us is we have a duty to protect the American people \nfrom this kind of greed and this kind of lack of any moral compass.\n  If these companies were having a hard time, I would say: Look, it \ncan't be helped. But they are not. They have enjoyed something no other \nAmerican business has, and that is an antitrust exemption. Only Major \nLeague Baseball has an antitrust exemption. So\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nthey are able to go all over the country and merge and acquire \ninsurance companies in order to control market share. Once they control \nmarket share, they then begin to boost rates. Therefore, over the past \n7 years of doing this, they have developed a 428-percent increase in \ntheir bottom line, which is their profits.\n  If a CEO thinks it is OK to deprive women of their health coverage \nwhen they become seriously ill with breast cancer, we can't trust them \nto do the right thing, period. This ought to be convincing to every \nMember of this body, whether it is this side of the aisle or the other \nside of the aisle, that we need to move to see that there is a \nreasonable, prudent system where people don't have to endure when they \nhave breast cancer and they go in, that they are going to lose their \nmedical insurance. This Reuters story points it out chapter and verse \ntoday, and I have indicated several stories.\n  So, in my view, it is time for Congress to step in and fix this rate \nhike loophole in the health insurance reform law. We have to put \npatients before profits. We have to protect the American people from \nthis kind of a lack of moral compass and candidly unchecked greed. I \nhate to say that, but that is the way I see it.\n  I will likely attempt to put this as an amendment to the regulatory \nreform bill. As I say, the matter has had a committee hearing, and in \nview of the fact that 800,000 people face these rate increases a week \nfrom Saturday, I think we need to take some action.\n  I would implore Anthem to understand and to not raise these rates. \nThey have postponed this rate increase once before; they certainly can \ndo it again.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise today to address the financial \nregulation proposal that is before us right now. I wish to talk about \nsome of the conversations that are taking place about our status. No. \n1, I think everybody in this body knows that people on both sides of \nthe aisle would like for us to come to an agreement that makes our \ncountry's financial system stronger, protects consumers, and tries to \ninsure us against the kinds of things we have all witnessed over the \nlast couple of years. I think on both sides of the aisle there is \ntremendous desire to see that happen.\n  There has also been some discussions, though, about the process \nleading up to this. I know the Senator from Nevada has talked a little \nbit about the fact, for instance, that they negotiated with Senator \nCorker for 30 days. This bill is 1,400 pages long, and I think by all \naccounts most people felt as though we were almost completed--the \nanalogy that is being used is, we were on the 5-yard line and the \nlights went out. Somehow or another, taking 30 days to try to discuss a \n1,400-page bill and get it right has been discussed as taking a long \ntime. I don't consider that a long time at all.\n  As a matter of fact, I think it is remarkable the kind of progress we \nhave made when we actually sat down as two parties trying to reach a \ncompromise on something that is as important to the American people. So \nI wish to say that a lot of us on this side of the aisle have dealt in \ngood faith, have actually gone out on a limb to deal in good faith--as \na matter of fact, have broken protocol, in some cases, to try to deal \nin good faith.\n  When statements are made that if you try to negotiate and you get to \nthe 5-yard line but for some reason the White House and people on the \nother side of the aisle decide to go on because they are losing some \nDemocrats--which, by the way, I would assume in a bipartisan \nnegotiation you lose some Republicans, you lose some Democrats, because \nyou have reached a middle-of-the-road piece of legislation. So to \ncategorize that as making that much progress and then: Well, we are \nlosing a few Democrats so we have to stop and go our own way--which has \nbeen publicly stated by my friends on the other side of the aisle as to \nwhat happened--to talk about that as if that is a problem on our side \nof the aisle creates a little bad faith, just to be candid. I mean, for \nthe next person who comes along and tries to work something out with my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle and this happens, I think it is \ngoing to discourage that from happening in the future. So I hope we \nwill tone down those kinds of things.\n  Then they talked about the fact that we went through the committee \nwith this bill. At the time it was only a 1,336-page bill. It has \nexpanded since that time. But we voted this bill out of committee in 21 \nminutes with no amendments. This was not a real vote. The understanding \nwe all had was that the makeup of the Banking Committee was such that \nit would be difficult to get to a bipartisan agreement there and that \nwe might harden ourselves against each other by offering amendments. I \nfiled 60 amendments myself, none of which were messaging amendments. \nThey were all technical amendments, and others, to try to fix this \nbill. But for some reason, the rules changed and we weren't going to be \nable to do that in committee, and we didn't want to harden ourselves \nagainst each other, and we were going to fix it before it came to the \nSenate floor.\n  Now we file a motion to proceed to the bill without it being fixed \nbefore it comes to the floor. It just seems as though there is this \nlittle shell game where we keep moving the goalpost to such a point \nwhere, again, we are going to end up with a situation where a bill \ncomes to the floor, but there has been no bipartisan consensus.\n  Now, I will say this: I do think Chairman Dodd has tried to do some \nbipartisan things, and I know I personally have had an effect on this \nbill. I thank him for that. I thank Senator Warner for the work we have \nbeen able to do together, and Senator Reed and Senator Gregg and \nothers. But the fact is, we haven't reached a bipartisan agreement. So \nI hope some of the statements that are being made about where we are \nand how we got here and the revisionist history that is being created \nto sort of make one side of the aisle look worse than the other side of \nthe aisle will cease. It doesn't do any good.\n  The fact is, there are people on both sides of the aisle who want to \nsee financial regulation take place. This whole notion that if you are \nagainst this bill as written, you are for Wall Street, and if you are \nfor this bill as written, you are against Wall Street, is an \nunbelievably silly argument. The fact is, I think everybody in this \ncountry knows when major regulation takes place, the big guys always do \nbest. They have the resources to deal with compliance and all of those \nkinds of things. As a matter of fact, I doubt there are many people on \neither side of the aisle who are hearing much from Wall Street right \nnow. Who they are hearing from is their community bankers who are \nconcerned about a consumer protection agency that has no bounds and has \nno veto.\n  All of a sudden, it is used potentially as a social justice mechanism \nin this country. They are concerned about that. They are probably \nhearing from manufacturers who actually make things and buy hedges or \nderivatives to make sure their material prices can be hedged again down \nthe road so they don't lose money fulfilling a contract.\n  When we talk about that either you are for this bill and against Wall \nStreet or vice versa, that is just a low-level argument. It has nothing \nto do with the facts. The fact, from where I sit, is we have a lot of \npeople in this body who want a good bill. It seems to me the best way \nto get to a good bill is to at least get the template of the bill \nagreed to in advance, to get the bill agreed to as it relates to \norderly liquidation.\n  I think we all want to make sure that if a large organization or any \norganization fails, it fails, but certainly with these highly complex \nbank holding companies, we want to see that happen. Make sure we deal \nwith revenues in such a way that most of the trades go through a \nclearinghouse, so at the end of the day, people who are making money \nbad, make money good so we don't have an AIG-type situation again. Yet \nwe have an appropriate end-user exclusion for people using these \nderivatives to actually make their businesses safer. We want to make \nsure we have appropriate consumer protection. We want to make sure that \nis done in balance; that a consumer protection agency doesn't undermine \nthe safety and soundness piece; that those people are making sure that \nour banks and financial institutions are sound; that people who do \nbusiness with them know they are going to be sound; and\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nthat we don't have a consumer protection agency undermining that by \ntrying to, again, use financial mechanisms as a way of creating social \njustice in this country.\n  Those are three big titles. It seems to me, if we can get agreement \nthere, before the bill comes to the floor, then we can then do all \nkinds of amendments on the floor. I think there are a lot of good ideas \nthat my friends on the other side have. I think there are a lot of good \nideas that would come from this side of the aisle. It seems to me that \nthe best way to have a great debate is to start with a template that is \nbipartisan and then let people change it in ways they see fit. We can \nvote on those. To me, that is the best way to go.\n  I hope that instead of the tremendous interference that is taking \nplace at the White House--I have never seen such involvement in what \nappears to be the actual drafting of legislation, sending it straight \nto a committee, and it being voted out. I have never seen such \ninvolvement. I hope we can tone that down, that we can tone our \nrhetoric down as far as trying to blame the other side for how we ended \nup in this position, when there are a lot of people on both sides who \nhave exercised good faith in trying to get here. It just pushes people \napart when these realignment of history discussions take place, when \nthat is not what has happened.\n  Let's give Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby some time to work \nthrough these issues. That is what needs to happen. They and their \nstaffs need to finish working through these issues, with input from \nother Members, and then let's have a great debate. I know we have a \nweekend coming up and the floor will shut down in the next 24 hours or \nso. I hope the staffs and these two Members will continue to work \nthrough the weekend and try to get this bill right. I hope we will quit \nthrowing accusations back and forth and that we will cool down the \nrhetoric, and I hope we have an opportunity to begin again with a \nbipartisan template that we can amend and then create some great \nlegislation for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not. We are on the motion to proceed to \nS. 3217.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as much time as I may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The START Treaty\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have come to speak about the New START \nTreaty--Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty--with the Russians. I wish to \ntalk about that in some detail.\n  A week ago, I and other colleagues were in Russia at a site near \nMoscow looking at a facility that we in the United States are funding \nto try to make this a safer world, to safeguard nuclear materials and \nnuclear warheads in the Soviet Union. I wish to talk a bit about this \nprogram as it relates to this new START Treaty.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed concern and are determined that \nthey are not necessarily supportive of the START arms reduction treaty \nunless other things are done. I wish to talk about that just a bit.\n  First, I will describe the unbelievable succession of something we \nhave been doing called the Nunn-Lugar program, the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program. We talk about what doesn't work \nand what fails, but we don't talk so much about what does work. I will \ndo that for a moment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show three things I have had in my desk \ndrawer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a wing strut from a backfire bomber, a Soviet \nbackfire bomber. This is a bomber that would have carried nuclear \nweapons that would threaten this country as a potential adversary. This \nis from this airplane. As you can see, this airplane, this backfire \nbomber, doesn't exist anymore. We didn't shoot it down. I have the wing \nstrut because we sawed it up as part of an arms control and reduction \ntreaty reducing delivery vehicles. This bomber don't exist and carry \nnuclear weapons because the Nunn-Lugar program helped dismantle that \nbomber under agreements we have had with the Soviet Union and now with \nRussia.\n  This photo is of a typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine the \nSoviets had. It carried missile launch tubes. This is a missile tube \nfrom that submarine. You will see that these tubes don't exist in the \nsubmarine anymore. They are now scrap metal. This is copper wire that \ncomes from that Soviet submarine that used to prowl the seas with \nnuclear weapons threatening our country. This ground-up copper wire \nfrom that submarine was not because we sank the submarine but because \nwe have a program by which we reduced the delivery vehicles for nuclear \nweapons. We and the Soviets--now the Russians--have agreed to a \nsystematic reduction of weapons and delivery vehicles.\n  This photo is of a missile silo in the Ukraine. This is an SS-18 \nmissile silo. It was blown up as part of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program. This is what is left of the scrap metal.\n  I have a hinge here from this particular site in the Ukraine that \nhoused a missile that had a nuclear warhead aimed at our country. \nInstead of a missile being on the ground in the Ukraine, there is now a \nfield of sunflowers. A field of sunflowers is now planted where a \nmissile that carried a nuclear warhead once existed.\n  This is unbelievable success, in my judgment, and something we ought \nto celebrate. With the help of the Nunn-Lugar program Ukraine, \nKazakhstan, and Belarus are now nuclear weapons-free. Albania is \nchemical weapons-free; 7,500 deactivated nuclear warheads; 32 ballistic \nmissile submarines gone; 1,419 long-range nuclear missiles gone; 906 \nnuclear air-to-service missiles gone; 155 nuclear bombers gone. We \ndidn't shoot them down. We didn't destroy them in air-to-air combat or \nundersea warfare. We paid some money in a program called Nunn-Lugar \nwith the Soviets and Russians to saw the wings off bombers and grind up \nthe metal in submarines and take out missile silos in the Ukraine with \nmissiles aimed at our country. Therefore, it is a safer world. The \nquestion is, How much safer and what more do we need to do?\n\n  I have previously read a portion of something into the Congressional \nRecord. I will do it again ever so briefly.\n  On October 11, 2001--not many Americans know this--1 month after the \n9/11 attack, George Tenet, Director of the CIA, informed the President \nthat a CIA agent, code-named ``Dragonfire,'' had reported that al-Qaida \nterrorists possessed a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb, evidently stolen from \nthe Russian arsenal. According to Dragonfire, the CIA agent, this \nnuclear weapon was now on American soil in New York City. That was 1 \nmonth after 9/11. The CIA had no independent confirmation of this \nreport, but neither did it have any basis on which to dismiss it. Did \nRussia's arsenal include a large number of 10-kiloton weapons? Yes. \nCould the Russian Government account for all the nuclear weapons the \nSoviets built during the Cold War? No. Could al-Qaida have acquired one \nof those weapons? It could have. If a terrorist had acquired it, could \nthey have detonated it? Perhaps. Smuggled it into an American city? \nLikely.\n  So in the hours that followed this report on October 11, 2001, 1 \nmonth after 9/11, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice analyzed what \nstrategists then called the ``problem from hell.'' Unlike the Cold War, \nwhen the United States and the Soviet Union knew that an attack against \nthe other would elicit a retaliatory strike in greater measure and \ntherefore perhaps destroy both countries, the al-Qaida terrorist \norganization had no return address and had no such fear of reprisal. \nEven if the President were prepared to negotiate, al-Qaida had no phone \nnumber to call.\n  This comes from a book that was published by Graham Allison, a former \nClinton administration official. I first learned about the incident \nfrom a piece in Time magazine, on March 11, 2002. The book that \ndescribes the detail of it is pretty harrowing. It is a pretty \nfrightening prospect. I will not read more of it. I have read a fair \namount of it.\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\n  After some while, it was determined that this was not a credible \nintelligence piece of information. But for a month or so, there was \ngreat concern about the prospect of a terrorist group having stolen a \nnuclear weapon, smuggled it into an American city, and being able to \ndetonate it. Then we were not talking about 9/11; we were talking about \na catastrophe in which hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people \nwould be killed and life on Earth would never be the same. When and if \never a nuclear weapon is detonated in the middle of a major city on \nthis planet, life will change as we know it.\n  That brings me to this question of nuclear reduction treaties and the \nwork that has gone on. We have about 25,000 nuclear warheads on this \nplanet. I have just described the apoplectic seizure that existed in \nOctober of 2001 because one CIA agent suggested he had credible \nevidence or a rumor that one terrorist group had stolen one small 10-\nkiloton nuclear weapon. Think of the angst that caused for about a \nmonth, which most Americans don't know about. But that was one weapon. \nThere are 25,000 on this Earth--25,000 nuclear weapons. Russia probably \nhas around 15,000.\n  This is not classified, by the way. This is from a recent estimate by \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists. Most people say it is accurate. The \nUnited States has 9,400. China has 240. France has 300. Britain has \n200.\n  The loss of one to a terrorist group--the detonation of that nuclear \nwarhead in a major city would change life as we know it on planet \nEarth. So the question is, What do we do about that? We struggle to try \nto accomplish two goals--one, to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons \nto others who don't now have it, to prevent terrorists from ever \nacquiring it, and working very hard to accomplish both even while we \nagain try a systematic reduction of nuclear weapons from the 25,000 \nlevel and particularly among those that have the most nuclear weapons. \nWe understand it is very difficult to reach these agreements, and when \nreached, it is very difficult to get them agreed to, get the support by \nwhat is necessary in the Senate.\n  About 95 percent of the nuclear weapons are owned by the United \nStates of America and by Russia. There are a lot of groups in this \nworld that are very interested in acquiring one nuclear weapon with \nwhich to terrorize this planet.\n  We are now operating under the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, \nknown as the Moscow Treaty. It requires the United States and Russia to \nhave no more than 2,200 deployed nuclear weapons--there are many more \nthan that; I am talking about deployed in the field--by 2012.\n  The Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty we are now operating under \ndoes not restrict any nuclear delivery vehicles at all--airplanes, \nmissiles, and so on--and it does not have any verification measures and \nit expires in 2012.\n  A few weeks ago in Prague, the Czech Republic, President Obama and \nRussian President Medvedev signed a new strategic arms control treaty. \nIt is called START. I compliment the administration for successfully \ncompleting this treaty. I was part of a group in the Senate that \ncontinued to meet with and review with the negotiators the progress of \ntheir work. Their work was long and difficult, but they reached an \nagreement with the Russians.\n  It limits each side to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, \nwhich is 30 percent lower than the Moscow Treaty under which we are now \noperating.\n  It limits each side to 800 deployed and nondeployed ICBM launchers, \nSLBM launchers, and heavy bombers--these are all delivery vehicles--\nequipped for nuclear armaments. That is one-half of what the START \ntreaty allowed.\n  It sets a separate limit of 700 deployed ICBMs and SLBMs and deployed \nheavy bombers that are equipped for nuclear weapons.\n  The treaty, in addition, has a verification regime, which is very \nimportant. You can have a treaty with someone, but if you cannot verify \nand inspect, then you have a problem. This treaty with the Russians has \nonsite inspections and exhibitions, telemetry exchanges, data exchanges \nand notifications, and provisions to facilitate the use of a national \ntechnical means for treaty monitoring.\n  This, in my judgment, is a good treaty that will strengthen this \ncountry. It will reduce by 30 percent the number of strategic nuclear \nwarheads that Russia could possess and target at the United States. It \nallows our country to determine our own force structure and gives us \nthe flexibility to deploy and maintain our strategic nuclear forces in \na way that best serves our own national security interests.\n  The new Nuclear Posture Review, as my colleagues know, says the \nUnited States will maintain the nuclear triad of land-based missiles, \nballistic missile submarines, as well as bombers. The Obama \nadministration has said as long as nuclear weapons exist, this country \nwill maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal to deter any \nadversary and to protect our allies.\n  This new START treaty gives us an important window into Russia's \nstrategic arsenal and to ensure that Russia will not be able to \nsurprise us and try to change that balance.\n  This treaty contains no limits on our ability to continue developing \nand fielding missile defenses. Our country is doing some of that. \nFrankly, I have some questions about the cost and the effectiveness of \nsome of what we are doing. Nonetheless, there is no limitation on that \nin this treaty.\n  As was done in the case of START, Russia has made a unilateral \nstatement regarding missile defenses. Its statement is not legally \nbinding and does not constrain us in any of our U.S. missile defense \nprograms.\n  In my judgment, this treaty is very important. It is a very important \nfirst step--only a first step--because much more needs to be done. But \nit is important in terms of enhancing our security and world security. \nThis will bolster, in my judgment, the Nonproliferation Treaty. It \ndemonstrates that the United States and Russia are living up to their \npart of the deal under the NPT to begin reducing arms. I think it will \nstrengthen Washington's hand in a tighter nuclear nonproliferation \nregime, especially at the May NPT conference.\n  Some Senators have said, as would be the case, I suppose, with any \ntreaty: We are concerned about this because we think it weakens \nAmerica's hand; we think it cuts our nuclear arsenal too deeply. I \nthink they are wrong on that point. They are wrong. We have plenty of \nnuclear weapons. Not enough nuclear weapons is not among our problems; \nwe have plenty. So do the Russians. We can blow up this planet 150 \ntimes and more. We have plenty of nuclear weapons. The question is, How \ndo we and the Russians and others begin to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons, and, most important, how do we stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons?\n  Let me put up a chart that shows what the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff said last month:\n\n       I, the Vice Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our \n     combatant commanders around the world, stand solidly behind \n     this new treaty, having had the opportunity to provide our \n     counsel, to make our recommendations, and to help shape the \n     final agreements.\n\n  This is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He says he and the Joint \nChiefs believe this represents our country's best national security \ninterest.\n  Here is what some others are saying. Douglas Feith, not particularly \nunexpected. I can pretty much guess what he will say on anything \ndealing with security if I saw his name tag, I guess. Doug Feith, a \nformer Defense official under the previous administration, says:\n\n       Since the administration is so eager for [the treaty], the \n     main interests of conservatives--\n\n  Meaning him and his friends, neo-cons among other things--\n\n     will relate to modernization. Republicans are interested in \n     the U.S. nuclear posture, the political leverage they have \n     will be the treaty . . . One of the hot issues is going to be \n     the replacement warhead . . .\n\n  What does he mean? We are going to use this treaty as leverage to \nforce the government to develop a new nuclear warhead program called \nthe RRW, the Reliable Replacement Warhead.\n  I am chairman of the subcommittee that funds that program. We stopped \nfunding that warhead. That warhead was an outgrowth of the Congress \ndeciding we are not going to fund the provision before it for another \nnuclear warhead. We remember the provision: Now we have to build earth-\npenetrating, bunker-buster nuclear weapons. That was the thing about 5 \nyears ago.\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\n  The Congress said: We are not going to build earth-penetrating, \nbunker-buster nuclear weapons. There is no end to the menu of nuclear \nweapons some people want. We are not going to do that. That morphed \ninto Reliable Replacement Warhead, RRW, that was to begin replacing our \nexisting stock of warheads in a big program with the Navy, Air Force, \nand so on. We stopped that as well. We did not stop it because we did \nnot have the money or anything like that. We stopped it because it is \nnot necessary.\n  We have a process by which we certify that the current nuclear \nstockpile works, that it is effective. We have a process by which we do \nthat. We have a lot of interest by other groups that have weighed in on \nthe science of this, saying our existing stock of nuclear weapons will \nlast much longer than some had suggested without spending hundreds of \nbillions of dollars for replacement. Yet some will never be satisfied.\n  Here are statements by some Senators who also will want to use the \nratification of this START treaty as leverage. One Senator said:\n\n       Well, I can tell you this, that I think the Senate will \n     find it very hard to support this treaty if there is not a \n     robust modernization plan.\n\n  That is the need to design and build new nuclear weapons.\n  Another one said:\n\n       The success of your administration in ensuring the \n     modernization plan is fully funded in the authorization and \n     appropriations process could have a significant impact on the \n     Senate as it considers the START follow-on treaty.\n\n  And another one:\n\n       My vote on the START treaty will thus depend in large \n     measure on whether I am convinced the administration has put \n     forward an appropriate and adequately funded plan to sustain \n     and modernize the smaller nuclear stockpile it envisions.\n\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee, I can tell my colleagues that the proposed budget for \nnuclear weapons, which is in my subcommittee, for fiscal year 2011 from \nthis administration is more than enough to maintain the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear weapons; sufficient so that any Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs can say with confidence and authority whose \nrequirement it is to certify each year, that we have a nuclear arsenal \nthat can be maintained as reliable and safe for the long-term future.\n\n  The National Nuclear Security Agency, the agency that oversees \nnuclear weapons, would see a 13-percent or $1.3 billion increase under \nthis President's proposal. There are some who have argued this budget \nincrease and planned future increases may not be sufficient to maintain \nthe current stockpile. But that is just not the case. If we look at the \nbudget request, the administration's budget request includes $7 billion \nfor nuclear weapons activities. That is an increase of $624 million in \nthis coming year. It invests significant money in what is called life \nextension programs. The nuclear weapons in our arsenal are not just the \nold nuclear weapons. We spend money all the time on life extension \nprograms to make sure they are reliable.\n  I can go on and talk about the budget. The fact is, this President \nhas sent us a budget that does what he thinks is necessary for the life \nextension programs and the additional funding. At a time when we have \nsignificant financial problems, he is proposing additional funding in \nthis area.\n  This is a quote from Linton Brooks, who was the NNSA Administrator \nfrom 2003 to 2007 under George W. Bush, in February of this year:\n\n       START, as I now understand it, is a good idea on its own \n     merits, but I think for those who think it's only a good idea \n     if you only have a strong weapons program, I think this \n     budget ought to take care of that.\n       Coupled with the out-year projections, it takes care of the \n     concerns about the complex and it does very good things about \n     the stockpile and it should keep the labs healthy. . . .\n\n  That is what he said. That is important to understand when my \ncolleagues come to the floor of the Senate and say: I don't know that I \ncan support arms reductions because we want to make sure we have more \nmoney spent on nuclear weapons to build a whole class of new nuclear \nweapons.\n  Understand, there is nothing partisan here. The person who last \nheaded this agency under George W. Bush said this budget takes care of \nthat. It will give us the confidence we need.\n  The September 2009 ``Report on the Lifetime Extension Program'' by \nthe JASON Program Office, which is a very respected group of \nscientists, said this:\n\n       JASON finds no evidence that accumulation of changes \n     incurred from aging and life extension programs have \n     increased risk to certification of today's deployed nuclear \n     warheads.\n\n  Simple.\n\n       Lifetimes of today's nuclear warheads could be extended for \n     decades, with no anticipated loss in confidence, by using \n     approaches similar to those employed in the life extension \n     programs to date.\n\n  We have people around here who are just unbelievably anxious to get \nmoving to begin building an entire new class of nuclear weapons. Yet we \nhave evidence from the science of nuclear weapons that the existing \nstock of nuclear weapons can be maintained with life extension programs \nfor decades. Why would we do that?\n  I wish to make a concluding point. I wanted to talk about the START \nprogram because it is so important to the future of our relationship \nwith Russia. But much more important than that, it is important for the \nworld.\n  I pulled out of my desk a wing strut from a backfire bomber and \nground-up copper from a Russian submarine. I have taken a hinge from a \nmissile silo in the Ukraine that had an SS-18 with a nuclear warhead \naimed at the United States. I have all those in my desk just to remind \nme every day there is a way to reduce the number of nuclear weapons: \nreduce the delivery vehicles without having air-to-air combat, without \nfiring intercontinental ballistic missiles, and without detonating \nnuclear warheads. It is the kind of program we have engaged in, the \nNunn-Lugar program, the Global Threat Reduction Program, and it is also \ntreaties such as the START treaty.\n  If it is not our responsibility and if it does not fall on our \nshoulders to provide the world leadership to stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons, who else is going to do that? Who else? If you read the book \nby Graham Allison or understand the consequences of both 9/11 and also \nOctober 11 of the same year and the report by a CIA agent code named \nDragonfire, that a terrorist group had stolen a 10-kiloton weapon and \nwould detonate it in an American city, if that doesn't send chills down \nyour spine for the future of this world, then there is something \nfundamentally wrong with your system.\n  We have to understand if we do not back away from this difficult \nspecter of a new world in which terrorists are trying very hard to \nacquire nuclear weapons--they don't have to acquire very much. They \nhave to acquire the equivalent of perhaps a 2-liter bottle of highly \nenriched uranium. Think of one of those 2-liter Coke bottles at the gas \nstation that sits on the counter the next time you go past, 2 liters of \nsoft drink. Think of 2 liters of highly enriched nuclear material to \nproduce one nuclear weapon.\n  Some of my colleagues, at least some folks kind of made light of, and \nsome commentators on the radio made fun of the very large group of \nforeign leaders that was called to this town a week ago to deal with \nthis question of how we get our arms around and begin securing loose \nnuclear materials that exist around the world. That was nothing to \nlaugh at. That was a historic opportunity by this administration, a big \ndeal by this President to say: You know what. That leadership is our \nresponsibility, and we are going to call leaders from all around the \nworld to talk about these loose nuclear materials that can be acquired \nby a terrorist organization and made into a bomb, and we are going to \nsecure these materials. We are spending money to do that. We are \nspending money in our budget to do that. But this President said: Let's \nwork much harder. Let's rededicate ourselves, and not just us, let's \nall of us rededicate ourselves to gather and secure the loose nuclear \nmaterial and prevent access to that material by a terrorist \norganization.\n\n  Again, this responsibility falls to us. It is our responsibility to \nlead, to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons. It is also our \nresponsibility, hopefully, to lead toward where the nonproliferation \ntreaty insists we go; that is, to fewer and fewer and fewer nuclear \nweapons on this planet.\n  I understand we will not and should not disarm unilaterally. I fully \nunderstand that. But I also understand that\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\nhaving 25,000 nuclear weapons stored in various locations on this \nplanet is not healthy for the long-term prospect of life on Earth. So \nit is our responsibility. It is an important step, a step only in the \ndirection because it is not the giant step. But an important first step \nis to ratify this START treaty.\n  The Russians and the Americans worked very hard to construct a treaty \nthat I think has great merit and will provide for a safer world. \nFollowing the ratification of this treaty, then there is even more work \nto do, much more work to do. But this is the step along the way that is \nimportant for all of us to embrace.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate \na message from the House with respect to S. 1963.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair lays before the Senate a message \nfrom the House, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                                S. 1963\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 1963) entitled \n     ``An Act to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \n     assistance to caregivers of veterans, to improve the \n     provision of health care to veterans, and for other \n     purposes.'', do pass with an amendment.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I am proud to urge our colleagues to support S. 1963, the \nproposed ``Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of \n2010,'' as amended. This bill reflects a compromise agreement between \nthe Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives on health care and related provisions for veterans and \ntheir caregivers. The House passed this bill, by a vote of 419-0, on \nApril 21, 2009.\n  When this bill was passed by the Senate on November 19, 2009, it \nwould have greatly expanded assistance for veterans and family members. \nThe bill in its current form, after being reconciled with legislation \nin the other body, provides even more robust services, but is also \nsignificantly less expensive than when this legislation was originally \napproved unanimously by the Senate.\n  The centerpiece of this bill is a new program of caregiver assistance \nfor our most seriously wounded veterans. The Committee has heard over \nand over about family members who quit their jobs, go through their \nsavings, and lose their health insurance as they stay home to care for \ntheir wounded family members from the current conflicts. For those \nfamily members who manage to keep their jobs, their employers, \nincluding many small businesses already struggling in these difficult \neconomic times, lose money from absenteeism and declining productivity. \nThe toll on the caregivers who try to do it all can be measured in \nhigher rates of depression, and worse health status as they struggle to \ncare for their seriously injured family members, an obligation that \nultimately belongs to the Federal Government.\n  The caregiver program that will be established by this compromise \nbill will help VA to fulfill its obligation to care for the Nation's \nwounded veterans by providing their caregivers with vital support \nservices and a living stipend. These vital caregiver support services \ninclude training, education, counseling, mental health services, and \nrespite care. This measure also provides health care to the family \ncaregivers of injured veterans through CHAMPVA. These caregivers \ndeserve our support and assistance and this new program will begin to \nmeet that obligation.\n  Another key part of the bill relates to women veterans. Women make up \na significantly increasing portion of the overall veteran population. \nThanks to the leadership of Senator Murray, this bill will increase \nfunding for mental health services for women who have suffered military \nsexual trauma, and for medical services for newborn children. In \naddition, this bill requires VA to report on the barriers facing women \nveterans who seek health care at VA.\n  With the help of Senator Tester, this bill also will improve veteran \naccess to care in rural areas by authorizing VA to carry out \ndemonstration projects for expanding care for veterans in rural areas \nthrough partnerships with other federal entities, such as the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Indian Health Service. \nStates which have an especially high number of veterans living in rural \nareas will benefit greatly from these programs.\n  This bill also expands the scope of VA's Education Debt Reduction \nProgram to include retention in addition to recruitment so that VA can \naddress staff shortages in rural areas. Where VA has a shortage of \nqualified employees due to location or hard-to-recruit positions, this \nlegislation would increase the total education debt reduction payments \nmade by VA from $44,000 to $60,000.\n  The bill also attacks another very difficult and painful problem--\nthat of homeless veterans. On any given night, the best estimate is \nthat more than 107,000 veterans are homeless. We know that homelessness \nis often a consequence of multiple factors, including unstable family \nsupport, job loss, and health problems. This bill will create programs \nto help ease the burden of veteran homelessness and, in so doing, \nsupport Secretary Shinseki's efforts to end homelessness among \nveterans.\n  Senator Durbin has helped keep attention on issues of overall quality \nmanagement in VA, and resolving and preventing such problems as those \nidentified at the Marion, IL, VA medical center, and other facilities. \nProvisions of this bill will make needed improvements in these areas.\n  I am grateful to all who have worked diligently on this bipartisan \nbill--including the committee's ranking member, Senator Burr--and the \nveterans service organizations, who made this one of their priorities. \nWe are particularly indebted to the Disabled American Veterans and the \nWounded Warrior Project for being in the vanguard on advocating for \nfamily caregivers and for their unrelenting support for this \nlegislation.\n  Various other advocates have supported this bill as well, including \nthe American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, the Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs, the \nBrain Injury Association of America, the American Academy of \nOphthalmology, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and \nmany others.\n  It has taken us several years to see this legislation through to what \nI hope will be final passage today. As we reach this final point in the \nlegislative process, I take a moment to thank the members of the \ncommittee staff who worked so hard on this legislation, including \nformer committee staffers who helped craft many of the provisions in \nthis bill, Alexandra Sardegna, Aaron Sheldon, and Andrea Buck. I also \nthank current committee staff, Ryan Pettit, Preethi Raghavan, Nancy \nHogan, and Lexi Simpson, and all the others who, in addition to their \nwork on specific elements of the final agreement, have worked to bring \nthis legislation to final passage.\n  We have promised to care for veterans when they return from service \nto the Nation. The provisions in this bill will help us keep our \npromise by going beyond words and ceremony, and providing the care that \nveterans have earned through their sacrifices.\n  I ask my colleagues to give this legislation their unanimous support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an explanatory statement developed \njointly with our counterparts in the House to accompany this compromise \nbill be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Explanatory Statement Submitted by Senator Akaka, Chairman of the \n                 Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n  Amendment of the House of Representatives to S. 1963 Caregivers and \n              Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010\n\n       S. 1963, as amended, the ``Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus \n     Health Services Act of 2010,'' reflects the Compromise \n     Agreement between the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives (the Committees) on \n     health care\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\n     and related provisions for veterans and their caregivers. The \n     provisions in the Compromise Agreement are derived from a \n     number of bills that were introduced and considered by the \n     House and Senate during the 111th Congress. These bills \n     include S. 1963, a bill to provide assistance to caregivers \n     of veterans, to improve the provision of health care to \n     veterans, and for other purposes, which passed the Senate on \n     November 19, 2009 (Senate bill); and H.R. 3155, a bill to \n     provide certain caregivers of veterans with training, \n     support, and medical care, and for other purposes, which \n     passed the House on July 27, 2009 (House bill).\n       In addition, the Compromise Agreement includes provisions \n     derived from the following bills which were passed by the \n     House: H.R. 402, a bill to designate the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Knoxville, Tennessee, \n     as the ``William C. Tallent Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Outpatient Clinic,'' passed by the House on July 14, 2009; \n     H.R. 1211, a bill to expand and improve health care services \n     available to women veterans, especially those serving in \n     Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, from \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, \n     passed by the House on June 23, 2009; H.R. 1293, a bill to \n     provide for an increase in the amount payable by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs to veterans for improvements \n     and structural alterations furnished as part of home health \n     services, passed by the House on July 28, 2009; H.R. 2770, a \n     bill to modify and update provisions of law relating to \n     nonprofit research and education corporations, and for other \n     purposes, passed by the House on July 27, 2009; H.R. 3157, a \n     bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient \n     clinic in Alexandria, Minnesota, as the ``Max J. Beilke \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic,'' passed by \n     the House on November 3, 2009; H.R. 3219, a bill to make \n     certain improvements in the laws administered by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs relating to insurance and \n     health care, and for other purposes, passed by the House on \n     July 27, 2009; and H.R. 3949, a bill to make certain \n     improvements in the laws relating to benefits administered by \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, \n     passed by the House on November 3, 2009.\n       The Compromise Agreement also includes provisions derived \n     from the following House bills, which were introduced and \n     referred to the Subcommittee on Health of the House Committee \n     on Veterans' Affairs: H.R. 919, to enhance the capacity of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain \n     nurses and other critical health care professionals, and for \n     other purposes, which was introduced on February 9, 2009; \n     H.R. 3796, to improve per diem grant payments for \n     organizations assisting homeless veterans, which was \n     introduced on October 13, 2009; and H.R. 4166, to make \n     certain improvements in the laws administered by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs relating to educational \n     assistance for health professionals, and for other purposes, \n     which was introduced on December 1, 2009, and was \n     concurrently referred to the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce.\n       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of the Compromise \n     Agreement. Differences between the provisions contained in \n     the Compromise Agreement and the related provisions in the \n     bills listed above are noted in this document, except for \n     clerical corrections and conforming changes, and minor \n     drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.\n\n\n                       Title I--Caregiver Support\n\n     Assistance and Support Services for Family Caregivers \n         (section 101)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 102) that \n     would create a new program to help caregivers of eligible \n     veterans who, together with the veteran, submit a joint \n     application requesting services under the new program. \n     Eligible veterans are defined as those who have a serious \n     injury, including traumatic brain injury, psychological \n     trauma, or other mental disorder, incurred or aggravated \n     while on active duty on or after September 11, 2001. Within \n     two years of program implementation, the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) would be required to submit a report on \n     the feasibility and advisability of extending the program to \n     veterans of earlier periods of service. Severely injured \n     veterans are defined as those who need personal care services \n     because they are unable to perform one or more independent \n     activities of daily living, require supervision as a result \n     of neurological or other impairments, or need personal care \n     services because of other matters specified by the VA. For \n     accepted caregiver applicants, VA would be required to \n     provide respite care as well as pay for travel, lodging and \n     per-diem expenses while the caregiver of an eligible veteran \n     is undergoing necessary training and education to provide \n     personal care services. Once a caregiver completes training \n     and is designated as the primary personal care attendant, \n     this individual would receive ongoing assistance including \n     direct technical support, counseling and mental health \n     services, respite care of no less than 30 days annually, \n     health care through the Civilian Health and Medical Program \n     of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA), and a \n     monthly financial stipend. The provision in the Senate bill \n     would require VA to carry out oversight of the caregiver by \n     utilizing the services of home health agencies. A home health \n     agency would be required to visit the home of a veteran not \n     less often than once every six months and report its findings \n     to VA. Based on the findings, VA would have the final \n     authority to revoke a caregiver's designation as a primary \n     personal care attendant. The provision also would require an \n     implementation and evaluation report, and provide for an \n     effective date 270 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       The House bill contains comparable provisions (section 2 \n     and section 4) with some key differences. The provisions in \n     the House bill would provide educational sessions, access to \n     a list of comprehensive caregiver support services available \n     at the county level, information and outreach, respite care, \n     and counseling and mental health services to family and non-\n     family caregivers of veterans of any era. For family \n     caregivers of eligible veterans who served in Operation \n     Enduring Freedom (OEF) or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), \n     the House bill would require VA to provide a monthly \n     financial stipend, health care service through CHAMPVA, \n     and lodging and subsistence to the caregiver when the \n     caregiver accompanies the veteran on medical care visits. \n     Eligible OEF or OIF veterans are defined as those who have \n     a service-connected disability or illness that is severe; \n     in need of caregiver services without which the veteran \n     would be hospitalized, or placed in nursing home care or \n     other residential institutional care; and are unable to \n     carry out activities (including instrumental activities) \n     of daily living.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision \n     modified to no longer require VA to enter into relationships \n     with home health agencies to make home visits every six \n     months. In addition, the Compromise Agreement follows the \n     House bill in creating a separate program of general family \n     caregiver support services for family and non-family \n     caregivers of veterans of any era. Such support services \n     would include training and education, counseling and mental \n     health services, respite care, and information on the support \n     services available to caregivers through other public, \n     private, and nonprofit agencies. In the event that sufficient \n     funding is not available to provide training and education \n     services, the Secretary would be given the authority to \n     suspend the provision of such services. The Secretary would \n     be required to certify to the Committees that there is \n     insufficient funding 180 days before suspending the provision \n     of these services. This certification and the resulting \n     suspension of services would expire at the end of the fiscal \n     year concerned.\n       The overall caregiver support program for caregivers of \n     eligible OEF or OIF veterans would authorize VA to provide \n     training and supportive services to family members and \n     certain others who wish to care for a disabled veteran in the \n     home and to allow veterans to receive the most appropriate \n     level of care. The newly authorized supportive services would \n     include training and certification, a living stipend, and \n     health care--including mental health counseling, \n     transportation benefits, and respite.\n       The Compromise Agreement also includes an authorization for \n     appropriations that is below the estimate furnished by the \n     Congressional Budget Office. The lower authorization level is \n     based on information contained in a publication (Economic \n     Impact on Caregivers of the Seriously Wounded, Ill, and \n     Injured, April 2009) of the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA). \n     This study estimated that, annually, 720 post-September 11, \n     2001 veterans require comprehensive caregiver services. The \n     Compromise Agreement limits the caregiver program only to \n     ``seriously injured or very seriously injured'' veterans who \n     were injured or aggravated an injury in the line of duty on \n     or after September 11, 2001. CNA found that the average \n     requirement for such caregiver services is 18 months, and \n     that only 43 percent of veterans require caregiver services \n     over the long-term. CNA also found that, on average, veterans \n     need only 21 hours of caregiver services per week. Only 233 \n     family caregivers were referred by VA for training and \n     certification through existing home health agencies in FY \n     2008. This represented five percent of all home care \n     referrals. In FY 2009, only 168 family caregivers were \n     referred to home care agencies for training and \n     certification.\n     Medical Care for Family Caregivers (section 102)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 102) that \n     would provide health care through the CHAMPVA program for \n     individuals designated as the primary care attendant for \n     eligible OEF or OIF veterans and who have no other insurance \n     coverage.\n       The House bill contains a comparable provision (section 5), \n     with a difference in the target population. Under the House \n     bill, the target population would include all family \n     caregivers of eligible OEF or OIF veterans, defined as those \n     who have a service-connected disability or illness that is \n     severe; are in need of caregiver services without which \n     hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential \n     institutional care would be required; and, are unable to \n     carry out activities (including instrumental activities) of \n     daily living.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Counseling and Mental Health Services for Family Caregivers \n         (section 103)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 102) that \n     would provide counseling and mental health services for \n     family caregivers of OEF or OIF veterans.\n       The House bill contains a comparable provision (section 3), \n     except that counseling and mental health services would be \n     available to caregivers of veterans of any era.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\n     Lodging and Subsistence for Attendants (section 104)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 103) that \n     would allow VA to pay for the lodging and subsistence costs \n     incurred by any attendant who accompanies an eligible OEF or \n     OIF veteran seeking VA health care.\n       The House bill contains a comparable provision (section 6), \n     with a difference in the target population. Under the House \n     bill, the target population would include all family \n     caregivers of eligible OEF or OIF veterans, defined as those \n     who have a service-connected disability or illness that is \n     severe; are in need of caregiver services without which \n     hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential \n     institutional care would be required; and, are unable to \n     carry out activities (including instrumental activities) of \n     daily living.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n\n\n              Title II--Women Veterans Health Care Matters\n\n     Study of Barriers for Women Veterans to Health Care from the \n         Department of Veterans Affairs (section 201)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 201) that \n     would require VA to report, by June 1, 2010, on barriers \n     facing women veterans who seek health care at VA, especially \n     women veterans of OEF or OIF.\n       H.R. 1211 contains a comparable provision (section 101) \n     that would require a similar study of health care barriers \n     for women veterans. The House provision also would define the \n     parameters of the research study sample; direct VA to build \n     on the work of an existing study entitled ``National Survey \n     of Women Veterans in Fiscal Year 2007-2008;'' mandate VA to \n     share the barriers study data with the Center for Women \n     Veterans and the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans; and \n     authorize appropriations of $4 million to conduct the study. \n     VA would be required to submit to Congress a report on the \n     implementation of this section within six months of the \n     publication of the ``National Survey of Women Veterans in \n     Fiscal Year 2007-2008,'' and the final report within 30 \n     months of publication.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.\n     Training and Certification for Mental Health Care Providers \n         of the Department of Veterans Affairs on Care for \n         Veterans Suffering From Sexual Trauma and Post-Traumatic \n         Stress Disorder (section 202)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 204) that \n     would require VA to implement a program for education, \n     training, certification, and continuing medical education for \n     mental health professionals, which would include principles \n     of evidence-based treatment and care for sexual trauma. VA \n     would also be required to submit an annual report on the \n     counseling, care, and services provided to veterans suffering \n     from sexual trauma, and to establish education, training, \n     certification, and staffing standards for personnel providing \n     treatment for veterans with sexual trauma.\n       H.R. 1211 contains a similar provision (section 202), \n     except it included no provision requiring VA to establish \n     education, training, certification, and staffing standards \n     for the mental health professionals caring for veterans with \n     sexual trauma.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.\n     Pilot Program on Counseling in Retreat Settings for Women \n         Veterans Newly Separated From Service in the Armed Forces \n         (section 203)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 205) that \n     would require VA to establish, at a minimum of five \n     locations, a two year pilot program in which women veterans \n     newly separated from the Armed Forces would receive \n     reintegration and readjustment services in a group retreat \n     setting. The provision also would require a report detailing \n     the pilot program findings and providing recommendations on \n     whether VA should continue or expand the pilot program.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision but \n     specifies that the program be carried out at a minimum of \n     three, not five, locations.\n     Service on Certain Advisory Committees of Women Recently \n         Separated From Service in the Armed Forces (section 204)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 207) that \n     would amend the membership of the Advisory Committee on Women \n     Veterans and the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans to \n     require that such committees include women recently separated \n     from the Armed Forces and women who are minority group \n     members and are recently separated from the Armed Forces, \n     respectively.\n       H.R. 1211 contains a similar provision (section 204) except \n     that it would allow either men or women who are members of a \n     minority group to serve on the Advisory Committee on Minority \n     Veterans.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Pilot Program on Subsidies for Child Care for Certain \n         Veterans Receiving Health Care (section 205)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 208) that \n     would require VA to establish a pilot program through which \n     child care subsidies would be provided to women veterans \n     receiving regular and intensive mental health care and \n     intensive health care services. The pilot program would be \n     carried out in no fewer than three Veterans Integrated \n     Service Networks (VISNs) for a duration of two years and, at \n     its conclusion, there would be a requirement for a report to \n     be submitted within six months detailing findings related to \n     the program and recommendations on its continuation or \n     extension. The provision also would direct VA, to the extent \n     practicable, to model the pilot program after an existing VA \n     Child Care Subsidy Program.\n       H.R. 1211 contains a comparable provision (section 203), \n     but it does not stipulate that the child care program shall \n     be executed through stipends. Rather, stipends are one option \n     among several listed, including partnership with private \n     agencies, collaboration with facilities or program of other \n     Federal departments or agencies, and the arrangement of \n     after-school care.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision, \n     with a modification to clarify that the child care subsidy \n     payments shall cover the full cost of child care services. In \n     addition, the provision expands the definition of veterans \n     who qualify for the child care subsidy to women veterans who \n     are in need of regular or intensive mental health care \n     services but who do not seek such care due to lack of child \n     care services. Finally, the Compromise Agreement follows the \n     House provision by allowing for other forms of child care \n     assistance. In addition to stipends, child care services may \n     be provided through the direct provision of child care at an \n     on-site VA facility, payments to private child care \n     agencies, collaboration with facilities or programs of \n     other Federal departments or agencies, and other forms as \n     deemed appropriate by the Secretary.\n     Care for Newborn Children of Women Veterans Receiving \n         Maternity Care (section 206)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 209) that \n     would authorize VA to provide post-delivery health care \n     services to a newborn child of a woman veteran receiving \n     maternity care from VA if the child was delivered in a VA \n     facility or a non-VA facility pursuant to a VA contract for \n     delivery. Such care would be authorized for up to seven days.\n       H.R. 1211 contains a comparable provision (section 201), \n     but would allow VA to provide care for a set seven-day period \n     for newborn children of women veterans receiving maternity \n     care.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n\n\n                  Title III--Rural Health Improvements\n\n     Improvements to the Education Debt Reduction Program (section \n         301)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 301) that \n     would eliminate the cap in current law on the total amount of \n     education debt reduction payments that can be made over five \n     years so as to permit payments equal to the total amount of \n     principal and interest owed on eligible loans.\n       H.R. 4166 contains a provision (section 3), that would \n     expand the purpose of the Education Debt Reduction Program \n     (EDRP), set forth in subchapter VII of chapter 76 of title \n     38, United States Code., to include retention in addition to \n     recruitment, as well as to modify and expand the eligibility \n     requirements for participation in the program. In addition, \n     the provision would increase the total education debt \n     reduction payments made by VA from $44,000 to $60,000 and \n     raise the cap on payments to be made during the fourth and \n     fifth years of the program from $10,000 to $12,000. The \n     provision would also provide VA with the flexibility to waive \n     the limitations of the EDRP and pay the full principal and \n     interest owed by participants who fill hard-to-recruit \n     positions at VA.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.\n     Visual Impairment and Orientation and Mobility Professionals \n         Education Assistance Program (section 302)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 302) that \n     would require VA to establish a scholarship program for \n     students accepted or enrolled in a program of study leading \n     to certification or a degree in the areas of visual \n     impairment or orientation and mobility. The student would be \n     required to agree to maintain an acceptable level of academic \n     standing as well as join VA as a full-time employee for three \n     years following their completion of the program. VA would be \n     required to disseminate information on the scholarship \n     program throughout educational institutions, with a special \n     emphasis on those with a high number of Hispanic students and \n     Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n       H.R. 3949 contains the same provision (section 302).\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n     Demonstration Projects on Alternatives for Expanding Care for \n         Veterans in Rural Areas (section 303)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 305) that \n     would authorize VA to carry out demonstration projects to \n     expand care to veterans in rural areas through the \n     Department's Office of Rural Health. Projects could include \n     VA establishing a partnership with the Centers for Medicare \n     and Medicaid Services to coordinate care for veterans in \n     rural areas at critical access hospitals, developing a \n     partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services \n     to coordinate care for veterans in rural areas at community \n     health centers, and the expanding coordination with the \n     Indian Health Service to enhance care for Native American \n     veterans.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\n     Program on Readjustment and Mental Health Care Services for \n         Veterans Who Served in Operation Enduring Freedom and \n         Operation Iraqi Freedom (section 304)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 306) that \n     would require VA to establish a program providing OEF and OIF \n     veterans with mental health services, readjustment counseling \n     and services, and peer outreach and support. The program \n     would also provide the immediate families of these veterans \n     with education, support, counseling, and mental health \n     services. In areas not adequately served by VA facilities, VA \n     would be authorized to contract with community mental health \n     centers and other qualified entities for the provision of \n     such services, as well as provide training to clinicians and \n     contract with a national non-profit mental health \n     organization to train veterans participating in the peer \n     outreach and support program. The provision would require an \n     initial implementation report within 45 days after enactment \n     of the legislation. Additionally, the Secretary would be \n     required to submit a status report within one year of \n     enactment of the legislation detailing the number of veterans \n     participating in the program as well as an evaluation of the \n     services being provided under the program.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision, but \n     does not include the reporting requirement and authorizes \n     rather than requires VA to contract with community mental \n     health centers and other qualified entities in areas not \n     adequately served by VA facilities.\n     Travel Reimbursement for Veterans Receiving Treatment at \n         Facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (section \n         305)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 308) that \n     would authorize VA to increase the mileage reimbursement rate \n     under section 111 of title 38, United States Code, to 41.5 \n     cents per mile, and, a year after the enactment of this \n     legislation, allow the Secretary to adjust the newly \n     specified mileage rate to be equal to the rate paid to \n     Government employees who use privately owned vehicles on \n     official business. If such an adjustment would result in a \n     lower mileage rate, the Secretary would be required to submit \n     to Congress a justification for the lowered rate. The \n     provision also would allow the Secretary to reimburse \n     veterans for the reasonable cost of airfare when that is the \n     only practical way to reach a VA facility.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Pilot Program on Incentives for Physicians Who Assume \n         Inpatient Responsibilities at Community Hospitals in \n         Health Professional Shortage Areas (section 306)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 313) that \n     would require VA to establish a pilot program under which VA \n     physicians caring for veterans admitted to community \n     hospitals would receive financial incentives, of an amount \n     deemed appropriate by the Secretary, if they maintain \n     inpatient privileges at community hospitals in health \n     professional shortage areas. Participation in the pilot \n     program would be voluntary. VA would be required to carry out \n     the pilot program for three years, in not less than five \n     community hospitals in each of not fewer than two VISNs. In \n     addition, VA would be authorized to collect third party \n     payments for care provided by VA physicians to nonveterans \n     while carrying out their responsibilities at the community \n     hospital where they are privileged.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Grants for Veterans Service Organizations for Transportation \n         of Highly Rural Veterans (section 307)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 315) that \n     would require VA to establish a grant program to provide \n     innovative transportation options to veterans in highly rural \n     areas.

To conduct this study, VA \n     would be required to coordinate with the Secretary of \n     Defense, veterans' service organizations, the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, and state public health \n     offices and veterans agencies.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n\n\n                   Title V--Other Health Care Matters\n\n     Repeal of Certain Annual Reporting Requirements (section 501)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 501) that \n     would eliminate the reporting requirements, set forth in \n     sections 7451 and 8107 of title 38, United States Code, on \n     pay adjustments for registered nurses. These reporting \n     requirements date to a time when VA facility directors had \n     the discretion to offer annual General Schedule (GS) \n     comparability increases to nurses. Current law requires VA to \n     provide GS comparability increases to nurses so that that pay \n     adjustment report is no longer necessary. The provision would \n     also eliminate the reporting requirement on VA's long-range \n     health care planning which included the operations and \n     construction plans for medical facilities. The information \n     contained in this report is already submitted in other \n     reports and plans, in particular the Department's annual \n     budget request.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Submittal Date of Annual Report on Gulf War Research (section \n         502)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 502) that \n     would amend the due date of the Annual Gulf War Research \n     Report from March 1 to July 1 of each of the five years with \n     the first report due in 2010.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Payment for Care Furnished to CHAMPVA Beneficiaries (section \n         503)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 503) that \n     would clarify that payments made by VA to providers who \n     provide medical care to a beneficiary covered under CHAMPVA \n     shall constitute payment in full, thereby removing any \n     liability on the part of the beneficiary.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Disclosure of Patient Treatment Information from Medical \n         Records of Patients Lacking Decision-making Capacity \n         (section 504)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 504) that \n     would authorize VA health care practitioners to disclose \n     relevant portions of VA medical records to surrogate \n     decision-makers who are authorized to make decisions on \n     behalf of patients lacking decision-making capacity.

The \n     grantees would be selected for their ability to increase \n     outreach, enhance the coordination of community, local, \n     state, and Federal providers of health care, and expand the \n     availability of care and services to transitioning \n     servicemembers and their families. The two-year pilot program \n     would be required to be implemented in five locations and, in \n     making the site selections, the Secretary would be required \n     to give special consideration to rural areas, areas with high \n     proportions of minority groups, areas with high proportions \n     of individuals who have limited access to health care, and \n     areas that are not in close proximity to an active duty \n     military station.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision, but \n     would give VA 180 days to implement the pilot program.\n     Specialized Residential Care and Rehabilitation for Certain \n         Veterans (section 507)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 509) that \n     would authorize VA to contract for specialized residential \n     care and rehabilitation services for certain veterans. \n     Eligible veterans would be those who served in OEF or OIF, \n     suffer from a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and possess an \n     accumulation of deficits in activities of daily living and \n     instrumental activities of daily living that would otherwise \n     require admission to a nursing home.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Expanded Study on the Health Impact of Project Shipboard \n         Hazard and Defense (section 508)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 510) that \n     would require VA to contract with the Institute of Medicine \n     (IOM) to study the health impact of veterans' participation \n     in Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD). The study \n     would be intended to cover, to the extent practicable, all \n     veterans who participated in Project SHAD and may utilize \n     results from the study included in IOM's report on ``Long-\n     Term Health Effects of Participation in Project SHAD.''\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Use of Non-Department Facilities for Rehabilitation of \n         Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury (section 509)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 511) that \n     would clarify when non-VA facilities may be utilized to \n     provide treatment and rehabilitative services for veterans \n     and members of the Armed Forces with TBI. Specifically, the \n     provision would allow non-VA facilities to be used when VA \n     cannot provide treatment or services at the frequency or \n     duration required by the individual plan of the veteran or \n     servicemember with TBI. The provision also would allow the \n     use of non-VA facilities if VA determines that it is optimal \n     for the recovery and rehabilitation of the veteran or \n     servicemember. Such non-VA facility would be required to \n     maintain standards that have been established by an \n     independent, peer-reviewed organization that accredits \n     specialized rehabilitation programs for adults with TBI.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Pilot Program on Provision of Dental Insurance Plans to \n         Veterans and Survivors and Dependents of Veterans \n         (section 510)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 513) that \n     would require VA to carry out a three-year pilot program to \n     provide specified dental services through a contract with a \n     dental insurer. Additionally, the provision would provide \n     that the pilot program should take place in at least two but \n     no more than four VISNs and that enrollment would be \n     voluntary. The program would provide diagnostic services, \n     preventive services, endodontic and other restorative \n     services, surgical services, emergency services, and such \n     other services as VA considers appropriate.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision, \n     modified to provide that the pilot program may take place in \n     any number of VISNs the Secretary deems appropriate. The \n     purpose of providing the Secretary with this authority is to \n     ensure the capability, should it be required, to maximize the \n     number of voluntary enrollees insured under the dental \n     program so as to reduce premium expenditures.\n     Prohibition on Collection of Copayments from Veterans who are \n         Catastrophically Disabled (section 511)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 515) that \n     would add a new section 1730A in title 38, United States \n     Code, to prohibit VA from collecting copayments from \n     catastrophically disabled veterans for medical services \n     rendered, including prescription drug and nursing home care \n     copayments.\n       H.R. 3219 contains the same provision (section 203).\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n     Higher Priority Status for Certain Veterans Who Are Medal of \n         Honor Recipients (section 512)\n       H.R. 3519 contains a provision (section 201) that would \n     amend section 1705 of title 38, United States Code, to place \n     Medal of Honor recipients in priority group 3 for the \n     purposes of receiving health care through VA.

First, VA would be given the authority to \n     apply the title 38 hybrid employment system to additional \n     health care occupations to meet the recruitment and retention \n     needs of VA. Next, the probationary period for full-time and \n     part-time registered nurses would be set at two years; part-\n     time registered nurses who served previously on a full-time \n     basis would not be subject to a probationary period. In \n     addition, VA would be authorized to waive the salary offset \n     where the salary of an employee rehired after retirement from \n     the Veterans Health Administration is reduced according to \n     the amount of their annuity under a federal government \n     retirement system.\n       Section 601 also would provide for a number of new or \n     expanded pay authorities, including setting the pay for all \n     senior executives in the Office of the Under Secretary for \n     Health at Level II or Level III of the Executive Schedule; \n     authorizing recruitment and retention special incentive pay \n     for pharmacist executives of up to $40,000; amending the pay \n     provisions of physicians and dentists by clarifying the \n     determination of the non-foreign cost of living adjustment, \n     exempting physicians and dentists in executive leadership \n     positions from compensation panels, and allowing for a \n     reduction in market pay for changes in board certification or \n     a reduction of privileges; modifying the pay cap for \n     registered nurses and other covered positions to Level IV of \n     the Executive Schedule; allowing the pay for certified \n     registered nurse anesthetists to exceed the pay caps for \n     registered nurses; increasing the limitation on special pay \n     for nurse executives from $25,000 to $100,000; adding \n     licensed practical nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and \n     nursing positions covered by title 5 to the list of \n     occupations that are exempt from the limitations on increases \n     in rates of basic pay; and expanding the eligibility for \n     additional premium pay to part-time nurses. Finally, section \n     601 would improve VA's locality pay system by requiring VA to \n     provide education, training, and support to the directors of \n     VA health care facilities on the use of locality pay system \n     surveys.\n       H.R. 919 contains a comparable provision (section 2) which \n     would not, in contrast to the Senate bill, restrict VA from \n     applying hybrid title 38 status to positions that are \n     administrative, clerical or physical plant maintenance and \n     protective services, would otherwise be included under the \n     authority of section 5332 of title 5, United States Code; do \n     not provide direct patient care services, or would otherwise \n     be available to provide medical care and treatment for \n     veterans. The House provision also would not place \n     restrictions on the categories of part-time nurses for whom \n     the probationary period would be waived. The House section \n     contains an additional provision which would provide \n     comparability pay up to $100,000 per year to all individuals \n     appointed by the Under Secretary for Health under the \n     authority of section 7306 of title 38, United States Code, \n     who are not physicians or dentists and who would be \n     compensated at a higher rate in the private sector.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision, \n     modified to eliminate the provision of the Senate bill that \n     would provide VA with the authority to waive salary offsets \n     for retirees who are reemployed in the Veterans Health \n     Administration.\n     Limitations on Overtime Duty, Weekend Duty, and Alternative \n         Work Schedules for Nurses (section 602)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 602) that \n     would prohibit VA from requiring nurses to work more than 40 \n     hours in an administrative work week or more than 8 hours \n     consecutively, except under unanticipated emergency \n     conditions in which the nurses' skills are necessary and good \n     faith efforts to find voluntary replacements have failed. The \n     provision also would strike subsection 7456(c) of title 38, \n     United States Code, which provides that nurses on approved \n     sick or annual leave during a 12-hour work shift shall be \n     charged at a rate of five hours of leave per three hours of \n     absence. Finally, for recruitment and retention purposes, VA \n     would be authorized to consider a nurse who has worked 6 \n     regularly scheduled 12-hour work shifts within a 14-day \n     period to have worked a full 80-hour pay period.\n       H.R. 919 contains the same provision (section 3).\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n     Reauthorization of Health Professionals Educational \n         Assistance Scholarship Program (section 603)\n       H.R. 919 contains a provision (section 4) that would \n     reinstate the Health Professionals Educational Assistance \n     Scholarship Program. Section 2 of H.R. 4166 contains a \n     similar provision which would also direct VA to fully employ \n     program graduates as soon as possible following their \n     graduation, require graduates to perform clinical rotations \n     in assignments or locations determined by VA, and assign a \n     mentor to graduates in the same facility in which they are \n     serving.\n       The Senate bill contains a similar provision but did not \n     include the requirement to fully employ graduates as soon as \n     possible.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the provision from \n     section 2 of H.R. 4166.\n     Loan Repayment Program for Clinical Researchers From \n         Disadvantaged Backgrounds (section 604)\n       H.R. 919 (section 4) and H.R. 4166 (section 4) contain \n     identical provisions that would allow VA to utilize the \n     authorities available in the Public Health Service Act for \n     the repayment of the principal and interest of educational \n     loans of health professionals from disadvantaged \n     backgrounds in order to employ such professionals in the \n     Veterans Health Administration to conduct clinical \n     research.\n       The Senate bill contains the same provision (section 603).\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n\n\n                  Title VII--Homeless Veterans Matters\n\n     Per Diem Grant Payments (section 701)\n       H.R. 3796 contains a provision that would authorize VA to \n     make per diem payments to organizations assisting homeless \n     veterans in an amount equal to the greater of the daily cost \n     of care or $60 per bed, per day. The provision would also \n     require VA to ensure that 25 percent of the funds available \n     for per diem payments are distributed to organizations that \n     meet some but not all of the criteria for the receipt of per \n     diem payments. These would include (in order of priority) \n     organizations that meet each of the transitional and \n     supportive services criteria and serve a population that is \n     less than 75 percent veterans; organizations that meet at \n     least one but not all of the transitional and supportive \n     services criteria, but have a population that is at least 75 \n     percent veterans; or organizations that meet at least one but \n     not all of the transitional and supportive services criteria \n     and serve a population that is less than 75 percent veterans.\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision, but \n     does not require the minimum amount of $60 per bed, per day \n     for the Grant and Per Diem program. In addition, VA would be \n     authorized but not required to award the per diem grants to \n     non-profit organizations meeting some but not all of the \n     criteria for the receipt of such payments.\n\n\n       Title VIII--Nonprofit Research and Education Corporations\n\n     General Authorities on Establishment of Corporations (section \n         801)\n       H.R. 2770 contains a provision (section 2) that would \n     authorize Nonprofit Research and Education Corporations \n     (NPCs) to merge, thereby creating multi-medical center \n     research corporations.\n       The Senate bill contains the same provision (section 801).\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n     Clarification of Purposes of Corporations (section 802)\n       H.R. 2770 contains a provision (section 3) that would \n     clarify the purpose of NPCs to include specific reference to \n     their role as funding mechanisms for approved research and \n     education, in addition to their role in facilitating research \n     and education.\n       The Senate bill contains the same provision (section 802).\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n     Modification of Requirements for Boards of Directors of \n         Corporations (section 803)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 803) that \n     would require that a minimum of two members of the Board of \n     Directors of an NPC be other-than-federal employees. \n     Additionally, the provision would allow for the appointment \n     of individuals with expertise in legal, financial, or \n     business matters. The provision also would conform the law \n     relating to NPCs to other federal conflict of interest \n     regulations by removing the requirement that members of the \n     NPC boards have no financial relationship with any entity \n     that is a source of funding for research or education by VA.\n       H.R. 2770 contains a comparable provision (section 4), but \n     provides that the executive director of the corporation may \n     be a VA employee.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision, with \n     a modification which removes the provision allowing VA \n     employees to serve as executive directors.\n     Clarification of Powers of Corporations (section 804)\n       H.R. 2770 contains a provision (section 5) that would \n     clarify the NPCs' authority to accept, administer, and \n     transfer funds for various purposes. NPCs would be allowed to \n     enter into contracts and set fees for the education and \n     training facilitated through the corporation.\n       The Senate bill contains the same provision (section 804).\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n     Redesignation of Section 7364A of Title 38, United States \n         Code (section 805)\n       H.R. 2770 contains a provision (section 6) that would \n     provide clerical amendments associated with implementing this \n     legislation concerning Nonprofit Research and Education \n     Corporations.\n       The Senate bill contains the same provision (section 805).\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n     Improved Accountability and Oversight of Corporations \n         (section 806)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 806) that \n     would strengthen VA's oversight of NPCs by requiring those \n     NPCs with revenues of over $10,000 to obtain an independent \n     audit once every three years, or with revenues of over \n     $300,000 to obtain such an audit each year, and to submit \n     certain Internal Revenue Service forms.\n       H.R. 2770 contains a comparable provision (section 7), but \n     would instead raise to $100,000 the threshold for requiring \n     three-year audits and to $500,000 the revenue threshold that \n     would require yearly audits. The provision also would revise \n     conflict of interest policies to apply to the policies \n     adopted by the corporation.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.\n\n\n               Title IX--Construction and Naming Matters\n\n     Authorization of Medical Facility Projects (section 901)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 901) that \n     would authorize funds for the following major medical \n     facility projects in FY 2010: Livermore, California; Walla \n     Walla, Washington; Louisville, Kentucky; Dallas, Texas; St. \n     Louis, Missouri; Denver, Colorado and Bay Pines, Florida.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision, but \n     strikes the authorization for the construction project in \n     Walla Walla, Washington, since authorization for this \n     construction project was provided in Public Law 111-98, \n     enacted on November 11, 2009.\n     Designation of Merrill Lundman Department of Veterans Affairs \n         Outpatient Clinic, Havre, Montana (section 902)\n       The Senate bill contains a provision (section 903) that \n     would name VA outpatient clinic in Havre, Montana, as the \n     ``Merrill Lundman Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient \n     Clinic.''\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Designation of William C.

The provision would provide \n     a uniform allowance in an amount which is the lesser of the \n     amount prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management or \n     the actual or estimated cost as determined by periodic \n     surveys conducted by VA.\n       There was no comparable House provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Submission of Reports to Congress by Secretary of Veterans \n         Affairs in Electronic Form (section 1003)\n       Under current law, there is no requirement for VA to submit \n     Congressionally mandated reports in an electronic form.\n       Neither the House nor Senate bills contained a provision to \n     change this procedure.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains a provision which would \n     create a new section 118 in title 38, United States Code, \n     which would require VA to submit reports to Congress, or any \n     Committee thereof, in electronic format. Reports would be \n     defined to include any certification, notification, or other \n     communication in writing.\n     Determination of Budgetary Effects for Purposes of Compliance \n         with Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010 (section 1004)\n       Neither the Senate nor House bills contain a provision \n     relating to compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act \n     of 2010, Title I of P.L. 111-139, 124 Stat. 8.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains a procedural provision to \n     require the determination of the budgetary effects of \n     provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement to be based \n     upon the statement jointly entered into the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairmen of the Committees on the Budget of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, our Nation has been at war for nearly a \ndecade now in Afghanistan and nearly as long in Iraq and we owe a huge \ndebt of gratitude to the men and women who have fought on the front \nlines as well as to their families who have sacrificed so much.\n  The Senate is considering S. 1963, the Caregivers and Veterans \nOmnibus Health Services Act of 2009. While I will support its passage, \nI believe this legislation represents a significant failure of Congress \nto uphold the responsibility entrusted to us by the citizens of this \nNation and our obligation to military families and taxpayers.\n  While there will be self-congratulating press releases from Members \nof Congress and some Veteran Service Organization lauding the bill's \npassage, I believe the shortcomings of this legislation--discriminating \nagainst most veterans and adding billions of dollars to our national \ndebt--represent a failure of leadership and lack of responsibility.\n  I had hoped that the House of Representatives would make some \nsignificant improvements to the legislation over the Senate. Sadly, \nthey did not.\n  The legislation that the Senate will consider still unfairly \ndiscriminates against severely disabled veterans from wars and combat \nprior to September 11, 2001.\n  Many of these brave men and women have needed the assistance of \ncaregivers for decades and have done so without help from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Many of these veterans were not the \nbeneficiary of recent advancements in military medical care. The \ncaregivers of these veterans will be left out of this benefits package.\n  There are currently 35,000 veterans receiving aid and attendance \nbenefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is \napproximately the number of veterans in need of caregiver assistance. \nOut of this population, around 2,000 veterans received their injuries \nafter September 11 and would qualify for extra caregiver assistance in \nthis bill.\n  Caregivers for almost 95 percent of severely disabled veterans from \ncombat would not receive the level of caregiver assistance afforded to \nthose veterans who were injured after September 11, 2001. When I \noffered an amendment that would provide equivalent caregiver benefits \nfor all severely disabled veterans of all wars, the Senate summarily \nrejected that idea.\n  Unfortunately the House of Representatives also ignored the danger \nthat our massive debt poses to our Nation and did not eliminate or \nreduce any current programs in the Federal budget to pay for this \nlegislation. The bill is not paid for by trimming any wasteful, \nduplicative, obsolete, or lower priority Federal programs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost \n$3.6 billion over 5 years, which is slightly less than the version the \nSenate passed. The Senate also rejected my attempt to pay for this \nlegislation out of the fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer dollars that \nwe send each year to the United Nations.\n  Instead the Congress has decided, as it always does, to pass the debt \nonto our children and grandchildren, rather than bear the cost and \nsacrifice today as our veterans have done.\n  I fear that if we do not start paying for new spending then the \nsacrifice made by our veterans for future generations will have been in \nvain. At some point, the debt we are incurring today must be paid for \nand when that day comes, the promises we are making to veterans, \ncaregivers, and others will no longer be affordable because Congress \nrefused to be responsible by being fiscally responsible by trimming \nlower priority spending.\n  When the Senate first considered this legislation last fall, some of \nthe proponents of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services \nAct attempted to rebut my facts about our\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\ngrowing national debt by saying that the bill does not actually \nappropriate any money for these programs.\n  In a technical sense, they are correct. I suspect that these same \nproponents will issue statements celebrating its passage, which will \ndisappoint any caregiver of a disabled veteran expecting the promised \nassistance soon.\n  No caregiver will be helped unless the appropriations committee \nallocates the funding for this new program authorized in this bill.\n  Until then, this bill is an empty promise to veterans and benefits no \none except perhaps the career politicians who will claim credit for \ndoing something to help veterans without really having to make any \ndifficult choices.\n  We owe an enormous sacrifice to our veterans who fought and died in \nour defense. This debt, which was incurred on a battlefield far from \nhome, should be borne by this generation so that we ensure that the \nfuture they fought to secure for our children and grandchildren is not \nthreatened by our own fiscal irresponsibility and shortsightedness.\n  Congress has once again failed taxpayers, veterans, and their \nfamilies today.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Res. 497\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month'' as an annual tradition \n     initiated in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System \n     reports that 772,000 children were victims of abuse and \n     neglect in the United States in 2008, causing unspeakable \n     pain and suffering for our most vulnerable citizens;\n       Whereas approximately 95,000 of those children were younger \n     than 1 year old;\n       Whereas more than 4 children die each day in the United \n     States as a result of abuse or neglect;\n       Whereas children younger than 1 year old accounted for over \n     40 percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2008, \n     and children younger than 4 years old accounted for nearly 80 \n     percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2008;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome, is recognized as the leading cause of \n     death among physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome and other forms of \n     abusive head trauma are being misdiagnosed or left \n     undetected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent and \n     irreparable brain damage or death of the infant and may \n     result in extraordinary costs for medical care\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\n     during the first few years of the life of the child;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for preventing Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome is to prevent the abuse, and it is clear that \n     the minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     avert enormous medical and disability costs and immeasurable \n     amounts of grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how to protect their children from injury can \n     significantly reduce the number of cases of Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs raise awareness and provide \n     critically important information about Shaken Baby Syndrome \n     to parents, caregivers, childcare providers, child protection \n     employees, law enforcement personnel, health care \n     professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week and \n     efforts to prevent child abuse, including Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome, are supported by groups across the United States, \n     including groups formed by parents and relatives of children \n     who have been injured or killed by shaking, whose mission is \n     to educate the general public and professionals about Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome and to increase support for victims and their \n     families within the health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas 20 States have enacted legislation related to \n     preventing and increasing awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas the Senate has designated the third week of April \n     as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' each year \n     since 2005; and\n       Whereas the Senate strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April 2010 as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'';\n       (2) commends hospitals, childcare councils, schools, \n     community groups, and other organizations that are--\n       (A) working to increase awareness of the danger of shaking \n     young children;\n       (B) educating parents and caregivers on how they can help \n     protect children from injuries caused by abusive shaking; and\n       (C) helping families cope effectively with the challenges \n     of child-rearing and other stresses in their lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to remember the victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome; and\n       (B) to participate in educational programs to help prevent \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2574-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Madam President, we are talking about financial reform. \nThere is a lot of attention and a lot of the Members of the Senate are \ntrying to keep up with it and trying to make sure we create a reform \npackage that effectively deals with corporations that have so \nmismanaged their business that they need to be dissolved or broken up \nor liquidated, as is normally the case when a company in America cannot \npay its bills.\n  This happens every day for smaller companies. It becomes a bit more \ncomplicated, sometimes a great deal more complicated, when the \ncorporations get bigger and bigger and bigger. The way our corporations \nare normally dissolved, if they are financially insolvent and cannot \noperate, has always been bankruptcy court.\n  There are bankruptcy judges all over America. It is a Federal court \nsystem. Bankruptcy is referred to in the U.S. Constitution. It has \nworked very well. I guess what I am concerned about is, some of the \nprovisions that are in the proposed legislation that is floating about \nwould alter that traditional idea in ways that may be unwise.\n  Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am the \nranking Republican on that committee, and I have talked about this a \nlittle bit. It is getting to a point where we need to figure out what \nis happening here. The matter is highlighted by a letter from the \nJudicial Conference of the United States--Mr. James Duff, the Presiding \nSecretary, of the Judicial Conference of the United States. Chairman \nLeahy asked them their opinions on some of the proposals for \ndissolution of companies, the orderly liquidation of companies.\n  The Judicial Conference responded in a letter that was received by \nSenator Leahy, and I do believe it raises important questions. I truly \ndo. I am a person who spent a lot of time practicing law, both as U.S. \nattorney and in private practice in Federal court, and have some \nappreciation for how bankruptcy courts operate. I would say, we ought \nto pay attention to what the Judicial Conference says to us. It is a \nkind of correspondence they take seriously. They do not lightly send \noff letters to the Senate. This was in response to a question. So this \nis what Mr. Duff replies on behalf of the Judicial Conference, in reply \nto Senator Leahy:\n\n       As you noted, Title II would create an ``Orderly \n     Liquidation Authority Panel'' within the Bankruptcy Court for \n     the District of Delaware for the limited purpose of ruling on \n     petitions from the Secretary of the Treasury for \n     authorization to appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver for a failed financial \n     firm.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       This is a substantial change to the bankruptcy law because \n     it would create a new structure within the bankruptcy courts \n     and remove a class of cases from the jurisdiction of the \n     Bankruptcy Code. The legislation, by assigning to the FDIC \n     the responsibility for resolving the affairs of an insolvent \n     firm, appears to provide a substitute for a bankruptcy \n     proceeding.\n\n  You see, when people loan money to a corporation, people buy stock in \na\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\ncorporation, they buy bonds of a corporation or otherwise loan them \nmoney, they have an expectation that if that company fails to prosper \nand pay what they owe, that company at least will be hauled into \nbankruptcy court and they will have an opportunity to present their \nclaims and to receive whatever fair proportion of the money that is \nstill left in the company as their payment.\n  It may be 10 cents on a dollar, it may be 90 cents on a dollar or \nwhatever you get. They understand that bankruptcy judges have the \nauthority to try to allow the company to continue to operate, to stay \nor stop people from filing lawsuits against the company and collecting \ndebts, to allow the company a while to see if they cannot pay off more \ndebtors by continuing to operate than shutting them down.\n  But if they see the company is so badly in financial crisis that it \nis going to collapse anyway, they come in and shut it down before they \ncan rip off more people. So that is what bankruptcy courts do every \nday. So this letter indicates that by assigning the FDIC responsibility \nfor resolving these affairs, it provides a substitute for bankruptcy, \nwhich is denying the lawful expectations of people who loan money to or \nbought stock in these corporations.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       We note, however, that the legislation will result in the \n     transition of at least some bankruptcy cases to FDIC \n     receivership in situations where a firm is already in \n     bankruptcy, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\n  In other words, it appears that legislation would allow a case to be \ntaken out of bankruptcy that was already in the bankruptcy court.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The legislation does not envision objection, participation, \n     or input from the bankruptcy creditors (whose rights will be \n     affected) in the course of appointing the FDIC as receiver. \n     Indeed, the legislation deals in a sealed manner; [secret \n     manner, apparently] only the Secretary and the affected \n     financial firm would be noticed and given the opportunity of \n     a hearing.\n\n  That will have major impacts on a stockholder or bondholder or a \ncreditor of a corporation. The FDIC is going to meet with this big \ncompany, this big bank, and work out a deal and not even tell the \npeople who loaned the corporation money in good faith and have certain \nlegal rights, at least they always had previously. These rights, \nsomehow, will be extinguished or cut off.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The financial position of affected creditors may have been \n     changed within the context of the firm's bankruptcy case in \n     such a way that the creditors' rights might have changed \n     dramatically. Any resulting due process challenges would \n     impose significant burdens on the courts to resolve novel \n     issues for which the bill provides no guidance.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       In addition, we note that petitions under this title \n     involving financial firms would be filed in a single judicial \n     district. The Judicial Conference favors distribution of \n     cases to ensure that court facilities are readily accessible \n     to litigants and other participants in the judicial process.\n\n  Under the current proposal all of these cases are going to be tried \nin Delaware. I do not know if we have enough judges in Delaware.\n  They go on to say this:\n\n       With respect to the limited review [that means appellate] \n     to be conducted by the panel created in section 202, [of the \n     proposed legislation] we note that the authority may exceed \n     what is constitutionally permitted to a non-Article III \n     entity.\n\n  What does that mean? That means some of these powers are judicial \npowers given only to Federal district courts presided over by \nsenatorially confirmed, presidentially-appointed, lifetime Federal \njudges. We can't just give them off to somebody else to decide. It is \njust not constitutional. We don't have the powers in the Congress, or \nthe President doesn't have the powers to take over judicial roles.\n  They continue:\n\n       A previous statute was held unconstitutional because it \n     conferred on the bankruptcy courts the authority to decide \n     matters reserved for Article III courts.\n\n  It goes on to talk about that.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what CEOs don't like. Do we want to be \ntough on CEOs? I will give some suggestions.\n  If they can't run their companies and they can't pay their \nbondholders, can't pay their debtors, their stock has become worthless. \nPeople invested in their companies believing they were legitimate, \nbelieving the representations of their financial condition, and it \nturned out to be false. They do not want to be in a court where they \nraise their hands and have to give testimony under oath. They don't \nwant to be in that position.\n  The way the law has been thought of and is worked out to handle these \ncases is to have a Federal bankruptcy judge preside over this process. \nThere are bankruptcy rules about what the judge can and cannot do. Each \nentity that has an interest in the matter can have lawyers. The \nstockholders can have lawyers. The bondholders can have lawyers. The \ncreditors can have lawyers. The workers can have lawyers. The employees \ncan have lawyers. The guys have to come in under oath. They have to \nbring their financial statements. If they lie, they go to jail for \nperjury. This is a powerful thing. A lot of these big wheels don't want \nto subject themselves to it. I would say, if we want to be tough on \nthese companies, don't create some FDIC buddy group that has been \nsupervising them and sees their role as trying to work with them. Have \na real judge.\n  We can create a system where we select experienced judges, create \nsome special procedures for larger bankruptcy cases. We should consider \nthat.\n  My one comment before I wrap up is, we should listen to the Judicial \nConference and recognize there is a danger to the rule of law to \nlegitimate expectations of creditors and stockholders by this new \nchange, this unexpected change in the law. We should allow classical \nprocedures to work. If we need to improve them and make some special \nprovisions for dissolution of corporations to help bankruptcy judges do \nthe job better, I would certainly favor that. That would allow us to \nfunction in a lawful way, a principled way, and not allow people to \nmeet in private and secret, as we have seen happened recently, and \ndissolve their cases in a matter that is not open and free to the \nentire public, as would happen in bankruptcy court.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe Judicial Conference.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your letter \n     of March 25, 2010, seeking the views of the Judiciary with \n     regard to provisions relating to bankruptcy that are \n     contained in the financial regulation bill recently approved \n     by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs. We appreciate your soliciting the views of the \n     courts on this matter. You identified several of the issues \n     that are of concern to the courts, and I will address each of \n     those.\n       As you noted, Title II would create an ``Orderly \n     Liquidation Authority Panel'' within the Bankruptcy Court for \n     the District of Delaware for the limited purpose of ruling on \n     petitions from the Secretary of the Treasury for \n     authorization to appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver for a failing financial \n     firm. This is a substantial change to bankruptcy law because \n     it would create a new structure within the bankruptcy courts \n     and remove a class of cases from the jurisdiction of the \n     Bankruptcy Code. The legislation, by assigning to the FDIC \n     the responsibility for resolving the affairs of an insolvent \n     firm, appears to provide a substitute for a bankruptcy \n     proceeding. The Judicial Conference has not adopted a \n     position with regard to the removal from bankruptcy court \n     jurisdiction of the class of financial firms identified in \n     this legislation.\n       We note, however, that the legislation will result in the \n     transition of at least some bankruptcy cases to FDIC \n     receivership in situations where a firm is already in \n     bankruptcy, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Section \n     203(c)(4)(A) provides that a pending bankruptcy case would be \n     evidence of a firm's financial status for purposes of \n     triggering the Treasury Secretary's authority to seek to \n     appoint the FDIC as receiver. The bill does not specify how \n     the transition from a bankruptcy proceeding to an \n     administrative proceeding would be effected. Further, the \n     bill does not specify the effect of the transfer on prior \n     rulings of the court. For example, would any stays or other \n     rulings continue in effect or be dissolved upon the transfer \n     to the FDIC? This could be especially problematic if \n     creditors have changed position based upon rulings in \n     the course of the bankruptcy proceeding. The legislation \n     does not envision objection, participation, or input from \n     the bankruptcy creditors (whose rights will be affected) \n     in the course of appointing the FDIC as receiver. Indeed, \n     the legislation proposes to deal with this petition in a \n     sealed manner; only the Secretary\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\n     and the affected financial firm would be noticed and given \n     the opportunity of a hearing. The financial position of \n     affected creditors may have been changed within the \n     context of the firm's bankruptcy case in such a way that \n     the creditors' rights might have changed dramatically. Any \n     resulting due process challenges would impose a \n     significant burden on the courts to resolve novel issues, \n     for which the bill provides no guidance.\n       In addition, we note that petitions under this title \n     involving financial firms would be filed in a single judicial \n     district. The Judicial Conference favors distribution of \n     cases to ensure that court facilities are reasonably \n     accessible to litigants and other participants in the \n     judicial process. Although we are aware that a large number \n     of companies are incorporated in Delaware, it is not clear \n     that Delaware would necessarily be a convenient location for \n     many of the affected companies, nor indeed the proper venue \n     for that petition, absent changes to title 28, United States \n     Code.\n       We also note that the legislation requires the designation \n     of more bankruptcy judges for the panel than are permanently \n     authorized for Delaware under existing law. The District of \n     Delaware is authorized one permanent bankruptcy judge and \n     five temporary judgeships. If Congress were to choose not to \n     extend these judgeships or convert them to permanent status, \n     it would be impossible to implement section 202's requirement \n     to appoint three judges to the Orderly Liquidation Authority \n     Panel from the District of Delaware.\n       With respect to the limited review to be conducted by the \n     panel created in section 202, we note that the authority may \n     exceed what is constitutionally permitted to a non-Article \n     III entity. A previous statute was held unconstitutional \n     because it conferred on the bankruptcy courts the authority \n     to decide matters that are reserved for Article III courts. \n     Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 \n     U.S. 50 (1982). The review of the Secretary's decision in \n     this instance appears to resemble more closely appeals of \n     agency decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act than \n     a bankruptcy petition and, therefore, appears more \n     appropriate for an Article III court. Moreover, the \n     affirmation of the Secretary's petition to designate the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as a receiver \n     effectively removes a case from the application of bankruptcy \n     law. Accordingly, it seems anomalous to subject this petition \n     to review by a bankruptcy court.\n       Your letter particularly questioned whether the time limit \n     of 24 hours for a decision by the panel would be sufficient \n     or realistic. The Judicial Conference has consistently \n     opposed the imposition of time limits for judicial decisions \n     beyond those already set forth in the Speedy Trial Act or \n     section 1657 of title 28. We appreciate that a matter \n     affecting the operation of the national economy warrants a \n     prompt resolution. We note that the courts, recognizing this \n     concern, have already demonstrated an ability to move swiftly \n     in resolving bankruptcy petitions involving large \n     corporations with broad impact on the national economy. In \n     each of these instances, the initial determinations were \n     made by a single judge. The resulting appeals in some \n     cases were also adjudicated on an expedited basis without \n     a statutory requirement to do so.\n       Requiring a panel of three judges to assemble, conduct a \n     hearing, and craft a written opinion within 24 hours presents \n     practical difficulties that may be insurmountable. Although \n     Sec. 202(b)(1)(A)(iii) could be read to limit the court's \n     review to the question of whether the covered financial \n     company is in default or danger of default, the Secretary is \n     required to submit to the panel ``all relevant findings and \n     the recommendation made pursuant to section 203(a),'' which \n     specifies consideration of multiple factors (repeated in \n     subsection (b) of that section as the basis for the \n     Secretary's petition). Even with the full cooperation of the \n     financial firm affected by the proceeding, which is not a \n     predicate for the consideration of a petition, it would \n     appear difficult to hear and consider the evidence and \n     prepare a well-reasoned opinion addressing each reason \n     supporting the decision of the panel within 24 hours. Even \n     assuming that factors other than the solvency of the firm \n     would be excluded from this special panel's review, it may \n     well be that the subject financial firm or one of its \n     creditors would seek judicial review of one of the prior \n     administrative evaluations of the statutory factors, either \n     in the course of the hearing conducted by the Orderly \n     Liquidation Authority Panel or in another court. Such \n     challenges would also make it difficult to meet the proposed \n     timeline. It is possible that the facts of a particular case \n     may be so clear that a decision could be rendered within 24 \n     hours, but the statutory requirement of such speed seems \n     inconsistent with the thoughtful deliberation that would be \n     appropriate for a decision of such great significance.\n       Although it is to be hoped that only a small number of \n     large financial firms would ever become subject to this \n     legislation, each of the petitions would involve large \n     volumes of evidence regarding complex financial arrangements. \n     Thus, the legislation could result in a large proportion of \n     the judicial resources of a single bankruptcy court being \n     devoted exclusively to review of the Secretary's petitions. \n     Further, the bill provides that the Secretary may re-file a \n     petition to correct deficiencies in response to an initial \n     decision, thus extending the time in which the court's \n     resources would be diverted from other judicial business. The \n     District of Delaware is one of the busiest bankruptcy courts \n     in the nation; to draw the court's limited judicial resources \n     away from the fair and timely adjudication of those \n     bankruptcy cases to process petitions under this bill would \n     be inequitable and unjust to the debtors and creditors in \n     those pending cases. If, as seems possible given recent \n     economic developments, the failure of one firm weakens other \n     firms in the financial services sector, the demand could \n     exceed the court's resources. This consideration alone \n     counsels against the assignment of all such cases to a single \n     court.\n       Finally, we note that both the Administrative Office of the \n     United States Courts (AO) and the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO) are directed to conduct studies which will \n     evaluate: (i) the effectiveness of Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 of \n     the Bankruptcy Code in facilitating the orderly liquidation \n     or reorganization of financial companies; (ii) ways to \n     maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the Panel; and \n     (iii) ways to make the orderly liquidation process under the \n     Bankruptcy Code for financial companies more effective.\n       With respect to those firms that are to be treated under \n     Chapters 7 and 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the vagueness of, \n     and/or lack of criteria for determining ``effectiveness'' \n     will hamper the ability of the AO and GAO to produce \n     meaningful reports. Some would regard rapid payment of even \n     small portions of claims as an effective resolution, while \n     others would prefer a delayed payment of a greater share of a \n     claim. There would also be significant disagreements between \n     creditors holding different types of secured or unsecured \n     claims as to the most effective resolution of an insolvent \n     firm. Some would argue that effectiveness should be measured \n     by the impact of the resolution on the larger economy, \n     regardless of the impact on the creditors of the particular \n     firm. Without clearer guidance for the studies, both agencies \n     will be required repeatedly to expend resources on the \n     development of reports that may not provide the information \n     Congress is seeking.\n       Thank you for seeking the views of the Judiciary regarding \n     this legislation and for your consideration of them. If we \n     may be of assistance to you in this or any other matter, \n     please do not hesitate to contact our Office of Legislative \n     Affairs at (202) 502-1700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James C. Duff,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As we prepare to consider legislation that includes some \nof the strongest reforms of Wall Street ever, it is important that we \nnot lose sight of exactly what is on the line for the American people; \nthat we will not allow complicated financial products and terminology \nto distract from the fact that this is a debate about fairness, about \nfamily finances, and protecting against another economic collapse; that \nwe remember for Wall Street lobbyists, this may be complex, but for the \nAmerican people it is pretty simple. For them this is a debate about \nwhether they can walk into a bank and sign up for a mortgage or apply \nfor a credit card or start a retirement plan.\n  Are the rules on their side when they do that, or are they with the \nbig banks on Wall Street? For far too long, the financial rules of the \nroad have favored big banks and credit card companies and Wall Street. \nFor far too long they have abused those rules. Whether it was gambling \nwith the money in our pension funds or making bets they could not cover \nor peddling mortgages to people they knew could never pay, Wall Street \nmade expensive choices that came at the expense of working families. \nWall Street used its ``anything goes'' rules to create a situation \nwhere everybody else paid, and Wall Street created a system that put \ntheir own short-term profits before the long-term interests of this \ncountry.\n  The simple truth is, it is time to end this system that puts Wall \nStreet before Main Street. It is time to put families back in control \nof their own finances. It is time to focus on making sure the rules \nprotect those sitting around the dinner table, not those sitting around \nthe board room table. To do that, we have to pass strong Wall Street \nreform that cannot be ignored. Those reforms, I believe, have to \ninclude three core principles: a strong, independent consumer \nprotection agency; an end to taxpayer bailouts; and tools to ensure \nthat Americans have the financial know-how that empowers them to make \nsmart choices about their own finances and helps them avoid making the \nsame poor decisions that helped create this crisis.\n  First and foremost, Wall Street needs a watchdog. Right now what we \nhave is a patchwork of Federal agencies, none of which are tasked with \nfocusing solely on consumer protection. What we\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\nhave is confusion and duplication and an abdication of responsibility. \nWhat we have, quite simply, is not working. What we need is a single, \nstrong, independent agency, a cop on the beat whose sole function is to \nprotect consumers, a cop on the street who will expose big bank ripoffs \nand end unfair fees and curb out-of-control credit card and mortgage \nrates. We need a cop on the street that ensures when one makes \nimportant financial decisions, the terms are clear. The risks are laid \nout on the table, and the banks and other financial companies offering \nthem are being upfront. What we need is one agency with one mission \nlooking out for one group of people, and that is American families.\n  Secondly, Wall Street reform must spell an end to the taxpayer-\nfinanced bailout. There is nothing that makes me or my constituents in \nWashington State angrier than the fact that Wall Street ran up this \nhuge bill, and we had to pick up the tab. Wall Street reform has to end \nthat once and for all. It has to be a death sentence for banks that \nengage in reckless practices, and it must make them pay for their \nfuneral arrangements, if they do.\n  Third, reform has to address the fact that Wall Street is not alone \nin deserving blame for this crisis. Therefore, it must not be the only \ntarget of reform. We cannot ignore the fact that millions of Americans \nwalked into sometimes predatory home loan agencies all across the \ncountry, unprepared to make big, important financial decisions. We have \nto acknowledge that too many Americans put too little thought into \nsigning on the dotted line. Those bad decisions had a huge impact. That \nis why I have been working so hard to pass a bill I introduced called \nthe Financial and Economic Literacy Improvement Act.\n  That legislation would change the way we approach educating Americans \nabout managing their own finances and making good decisions about \nhousing and employment and retirement. We add a fourth R to the basics \nof reading and writing and arithmetic. That is resource management. It \ngives Americans, young and old, the basic financial skills to heed \nwarnings in the fine print they are signing and avoid mounting debt. I \nbelieve if we are going to avoid many of the mistakes that led to this \ncrisis, we need a similar component in the bill we work on next week.\n  We all know the old adage that sunlight is the best disinfectant. \nWith all of the reforms I have been talking about today, we have the \npotential to bring a whole lot of sunlight to Wall Street. But as we \nhave seen in the lead up to this crisis and with Wall Street's response \nnow to our reform effort so far, they don't like to do their work in \nthe sunlight. They like to do it in back rooms. I have heard they have \nhad some company recently in those back rooms. I have heard that over \nthe last several days, some of our colleagues on the other side have \nbeen huddling with Wall Street lobbyists to figure out how they can \nkill this bill that is coming to us. They want to figure out how they \ncan preserve the status quo and what they have today. They want to talk \ntheir way out of change. They have been calling out to special \ninterests in Washington and bankers back on Wall Street and big money \ndonors. In fact, just about everyone has been invited to those meetings \nexcept, of course, the American people. That is because the vast \nmajority of Americans, including the hard-working families in my State \nwho were hurt by this crisis through no fault of their own, want to see \nthe strong Wall Street reforms I have talked about today passed. They \nwant to hold Wall Street accountable for years of irresponsibility and \ntaxpayer-funded bailouts. And more than anything, they want to make \nsure we never go through this again.\n  There is still a widely held view on Wall Street--and with too many \nstill in DC--that the voices of the people can somehow be drowned out \nwith big money and even bigger fabrications. Wall Street still thinks \nthey can get away with highway robbery because, for all too long, they \nhave. They think they can get away with telling the American people \nthat more regulation is bad, when the absence of regulation is largely \nwhat got us into this mess.\n  They think people will be satisfied with watered-down rules that Wall \nStreet can then simply step aside or go around or ignore. They think \nthey can pull a fast one on Main Street. They are flatout wrong. I know \nthat because I grew up literally on Main Street in Bothell, WA, working \nfor my dad's 5-and-10-cent store with my six brothers and sisters.\n  I know they are wrong because Main Street is where I got my values, \nvalues such as the product of your work is what you can actually show \nin the till at the end of the day; that if that money was short, you \ndealt with the consequences. If it was more than you expected, you knew \nthat more difficult days could lie ahead; values like a good \ntransaction was one that was good for your business and for your \ncustomer; that personal responsibility meant owning up to your mistakes \nand making them right; that one business relied on all the others on \nthe same street; and, importantly, that our customers were not prey and \nbusinesses were not predators, and an honest business was a successful \none.\n  Those are the values I learned on Main Street growing up. Believe me, \nthose same values are still strong for our country today. They exist in \nsmall towns such as the one in which I grew up and in big cities in \nevery one of our States.\n  Next week, when we bring a strong Wall Street reform bill to the \nfloor, everyone in the Senate is going to hear from people who still \nhold values like that very dear. I am sure they will tell us in no \nuncertain terms: It is time to end Wall Street's excesses. It is time \nto bring some sanity back into the system, to protect our consumers, to \nend bailouts and back-room deals, to restore personal responsibility \nand bring back accountability.\n  I am hopeful we will all listen because there certainly is a lot on \nthe line for the American people. They deserve all of our support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from the State of Washington \njust talked about Wall Street reform. It is such an important subject. \nIt is the case that all of us who have lived through these last several \nyears will understand when the history books record these years that we \nhave lived and existed and struggled through a period that is the \ndeepest recession since the Great Depression.\n  Mr. President, 15 million to 17 million people wake in the morning, \nnow as I speak, jobless, get dressed, and go out to look for a job. \nMost do not find it. It has been a tough time. Yet those who read the \nnewspaper and understand the difficulty of those who are losing homes, \nlosing jobs, losing hope, also read the business pages and see that one \nof the heads of the largest investment banks last year was paid $25 \nmillion in salary. One of the folks who was one of the largest income \nearners in this country earned $3 billion running a hedge fund. That is \n$3 billion, by the way. That is almost $10 million a day.\n  So they see record profits from the biggest financial interests in \nthis country--many of whom pursued policies that steered us right into \nthe ditch. They wonder what is the deal here. The people at the top, \nthe ones who caused most of the problem--the ones many of which would \nhave gone broke had the Federal Government not come in with some \nfunding to try to provide some stability--they are now at record \nprofits, paying record bonuses. The folks at the bottom are out \nstruggling to find a job because they have been laid off.\n  So it always comes back to something I have described often and it \nseems to never change and it is even more aggressive now. Bob Wills and \nHis Texas Playboys, in the 1930s, had a verse in one of their songs: \n``The little bee sucks the blossom, but the big bee gets the honey.'' \nThe little guy picks the cotton, but the big guy gets the money.\n  So it is and so has it always been but even more aggressive now. The \nsame newspaper talks about the trouble given the workers of this \ncountry and the families of this country by the big financial \ninstitutions having steered this country into the deepest recession \nsince the Great Depression; even as in\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nthe same newspaper they read about the largess, the record profits and \nrecord bonuses.\n  So the question is, What do we do about that? We are going to bring a \nfinancial reform bill, a Wall Street reform bill, to the floor of the \nSenate. I wish to talk a bit about that and say we need to review, just \nfor a moment, the unbelievable cesspool of greed that existed--not \neverywhere but in some places--and at levels that steered this country \ninto very dangerous territory.\n  Yes, new things, new instruments we had never heard of before: credit \ndefault swaps, naked credit default swaps. Some might say: What is a \ncredit default swap? And, for God's sake, what is a naked credit \ndefault swap? How do you get a credit default swap naked? Well, let me \ntake you not just to default swaps, let me take you back about a year \nand a half ago to a time when the futures market in oil was like a \nRoman candle and went up to $147 a barrel--$147 for a barrel of oil in \nday trading--just like a Roman candle and then went back down.\n  That market was broken. A bunch of speculators--they did not want to \nbuy any oil. They have never hauled around a can or a case or a barrel \nof oil. They just wanted to speculate on the futures market. So they \nbroke that market, ran it way up. Well, that is one symptom of \nfinancial systems that are broken and do not work.\n  Credit default swaps. We have been hearing recently about the SEC \ndecision to file a criminal complaint against a large investment bank, \nGoldman Sachs. What we have discovered with the interworkings of this \nscheme that was created is, I think, based on my knowledge of it, that \nthe development of--excuse me, it was a civil case by the SEC, not a \ncriminal case, and that is an important distinction, but, nonetheless, \nit is a civil complaint against Goldman Sachs. My understanding is, \nthere was created some billions of dollars of naked credit default \nswaps that had no insurable interest in anything of value. These were \npeople who were betting on what might happen to the price of bonds.\n  Bonds selected by a person whom I have spoken about on the floor of \nthe Senate previously over the last couple years, a man named John \nPaulson, who, in 2007, was the highest income earner on Wall Street--he \nearned $3.6 billion. That is $300 million a month or $10 million a day. \nHow would you like to come home and your spouse says: How are you \ndoing? How are we doing? And he says: Well, we are doing pretty good, \n$10 million every day.\n  So my understanding of the SEC complaint is they set up a system \nwhere Mr. Paulson could short what I believe were naked credit default \nswaps and others took the long position and you had rating agencies \nrating these things apparently with high ratings, until they discovered \nwhat they truly were and then the ratings collapsed. Mr. Paulson made a \nbunch of money and everybody else got duped out of their money.\n  Well, that is a short description and probably not even a very good \ndescription, but it is close enough to understand what has been going \non in this country: betting--not investing--betting on credit default \nswaps, naked swaps that have no insurable interest in anything, no \nvalue on either side. You just put together a contract and say: I am \ngoing to bet you this issue happens, this stock goes up, this bond goes \ndown. Let's have a wager. Well, you do not have to own anything. Let's \njust have a bet.\n  That is not an investment; that is a flatout wager. We have places \nwhere you should do that. If you want to do that, you can go to Las \nVegas, and they say what goes on there stays there. Who knows. You can \ngo to Atlantic City. We have places where you can do that. But those \nplaces are not places where you do activities that are equivalent to \nwhat we now see having been done in the middle of some of the \ninvestment banks and financial institutions in this country.\n  I have spoken many times on the floor about this, and I am going to \nrepeat some things I have said just because, as I talk about what needs \nto be done in a couple cases on this reform bill, we need to understand \nwhat happened and how unbelievably ignorant it was.\n  The subprime loan scandal--everybody was involved in that. When I say \n``everybody,'' I am talking about all the biggest financial \ninstitutions because they were securitizing mortgages and selling them \nupstream to hedge funds, investment banks, and you name it--all making \nhuge bonus profits, all kinds of fees, and starting with the broker who \ncould place big mortgages for people who could not afford it; and right \non up the line, they were all making big money.\n  So here is an advertisement we all listened to in the last decade \nduring this unbelievable carnival of greed. This was the biggest \nmortgage company in our country, the biggest mortgage bank in America--\nnow bankrupt, of course, now gone--although the head of this company \nleft with a couple hundred million dollars, I am told. So he got out \npretty well-heeled, now under investigation. But here was their ad on \ntelevision and radio.\n  It says: Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \nmortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? Call us. We \nwant to lend you money. Unbelievable. The biggest mortgage bank in the \ncountry says: Are you a bad credit risk? Hey, call us. We have money \nfor you.\n  Zoom Credit, another mortgage company. Here is their advertisement: \nCredit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track. With the \nspeed of light, Zoom Credit will preapprove you for a car loan, a home \nloan, a credit card. Even if your credit is in the tank, Zoom Credit is \nlike money in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \ndebt consolidation too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who cares? \nCome to us. We want to give you a loan.\n  Ignorant? Sounds like it to me. Greedy? It appears to me it is.\n  Millennia Mortgage: 12 months with no mortgage payment. That is \nright. We will give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you \ncall in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program may reduce \nyour current monthly payment by 50 percent, allow you no payments for \nthe first 12 months. Let us give you a loan. You do not have to make \nany payments for a year.\n  Sound strange? It does to me. How about the mortgages that say: Do \nyou know what, you don't want to pay any principle? No problem. You \ndon't want to pay any interest? No problem. You pay nothing--no \ninterest, no principle. And, by the way, if you don't want us to check \non your income--that is called a no-documentation loan--we will give \nyou a no-doc loan with no interest payments and no principle payments. \nWe will put it all on the back side. Do you know what you should do? Go \nahead and do that because you can flip that house. If you can't make \nthe payments a couple years later, when we are going to reset your \ninterest rate at 12 percent--or whatever ridiculous amount they were \ngoing to do--you can sell that house and make the money because the \nprice of that house is always going to go up.\n\n  So it went all across this country, right at the bottom, with teaser \nrates. The result was, a whole lot of folks were talked into mortgages \nthey could not afford. The loan folks, the brokers, who were putting \nout these mortgages, were making a lot of money. They were securitizing \nthem, selling them up. There were fees being paid to everyone, and \neverybody was making a lot of money--very fat and happy.\n  By the way, it has not changed. If you go to the Internet, you can \nfind on the Internet, today, EasyLoanForYou: Get the loan you seek. \nFast. Hassle-free. Our lenders will preapprove your loan regardless of \nyour credit score or history.\n  Go to the Internet. See if it has stopped.\n  Here is an Internet solicitation: Bad Credit Personal Loans. How \nabout that? Is that unbelievable? I wonder what college they teach this \nin. You start a company called Bad Credit Personal Loans. It says: \nPrevious bankruptcy? No credit? Previous bad credit? Recent job loss? \nRecent divorce? Need a larger loan amount? Well, click here now. For \ngosh sake, take advantage of what we are offering. If you are a bad \nperson, we want to give you money.\n  Speedy Bad Credit Loans--same thing. Bad credit? No problem. No \ncredit? No problem. Bankruptcy? No problem. Come to us.\n  Well, is it a surprise that a lot of greedy people and a lot of the \nbiggest\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\ninstitutions in this country whose names you recognize instantly loaded \nup on this nonsense? They loaded up--loaded to the gills. Why? Because \nthey were all making massive amounts of money by buying and selling and \ntrading these securities. Yes, not just the securities, not just \nsecuritization of loans but credit default swaps and CDOs and you name \nit. It was a carnival and a field day.\n  So that has all happened in the last 10 years--and even much worse. \nBut let me end it there to say, we are now talking about: What do we do \nabout all this? This kind of behavior steered the country right into \nthe ditch. We lost $15 trillion when the economy hit rock bottom. \nSomething like $12 trillion has been lent, spent or pledged by the \nFederal Government to prop up private companies--many of them that were \ndoing exactly as I have just described. This has been a very difficult \ntime. So the question now is, What do we do about this? Do we just \ndecide, do you know what, it is OK? We are not going to do anything \nabout this?\n  I just mentioned naked credit default swaps. I do not know the number \nin this country, but in England they estimate, of their credit default \nswaps, 80 percent of them are so-called naked; that is, they have no \ninsurable interest on any side of the transaction. It is simply making \na wager. When you have banks that make wagers just as if they are using \na roulette wheel or a blackjack table or a craps table, they just as \nwell ought to put that in the lobby, except my feeling is, it is \nfundamentally antithetical to everything we know about sound, \nthoughtful finance in this country to have allowed this to have \nhappened--we did allow it--and now to continue to allow it to happen.\n  So I wish to take you back 11 years to the floor of the Senate \nbecause I have been through this before in something called financial \nmodernization. It was 11 years ago now, actually: financial \nmodernization. This is not the first time we have had substantial \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate to address the issue of finances \nand the financial system. We had something called financial \nmodernization on the floor of the Senate, and it was the piece of \nlegislation--big piece of legislation--that pooled everything together. \nIt said you can create one, big, huge holding company and bring \neverything in together--the investment banks, the commercial banks, \nFDIC-insured banks, the securities trading--bring them all together as \none, big, happy family, one big pyramid. It will be just fine because \nit will make us more competitive with the European financial \ninstitutions, and it is going to be great. I said I think that is nuts. \nWhat are we doing?\n\n  I have some quotes from 1999 of things I said on the floor of this \nSenate. On November 4, I said:\n\n       Fusing together the idea of banking, which requires not \n     just safety and soundness to be successful but the perception \n     of safety and soundness, with other inherently risky \n     speculative activity is, in my judgment, unwise.\n\n  I said:\n\n       We will, in 10 years time, look back and say: We should not \n     have done that--repeal Glass-Steagall--because we forgot the \n     lessons of the past.\n\n  I said during debate in 1999:\n\n       This bill will in my judgment raise the likelihood of \n     future massive taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the \n     consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial \n     services industry at the expense of customers, farm \n     businesses, and others.\n\n  I said:\n\n       We have another doctrine at the Federal Reserve Board. It \n     is called too big to fail. Remember that term, too big to \n     fail. They cannot be allowed to fail because the consequence \n     on the economy is catastrophic and therefore these banks are \n     too big to fail. That is no-fault capitalism; too big to \n     fail. Does anybody care about that? Does the Fed, the Federal \n     Reserve Board? Apparently not.\n\n  That is what I said 11 years ago on the floor of the Senate.\n  I said:\n\n       I say to the people who own banks, if you want to gamble, \n     go to Las Vegas. If you want to trade in derivatives, God \n     bless you. Do it with your own money. Do not do it through \n     the deposits that are guaranteed by the American people with \n     deposit insurance.\n\n  I said during that debate:\n\n       I will bet one day somebody is going to look back and they \n     are going to say: How on Earth could we have thought it made \n     sense to allow the banking industry to concentrate, through \n     merger and acquisition, to become bigger and bigger and \n     bigger; far more firms in the category of too big to fail? \n     How did we think that was going to help our country?\n\n  Those are quotes I made 11 years ago on the floor of this Senate. I \ndidn't know then that within a decade, within 10 years, we would see \nhuge taxpayer bailouts, but I thought this was fundamentally unsound \npublic policy. I was one of only eight Senators to vote no. The whole \ntown stampeded. In fact, as the Presiding Officer knows, this Financial \nModernization Act was Gramm-Leach-Bliley, three Republicans, but this \nwas firmly embraced by the Clinton administration and by the then-\nSecretary of the Treasury and others. It was bipartisan: We have to do \nthis, have to compete with the rest of the world, and it was, Katey, \nbar the door. We are going to allow these big companies to get bigger, \nand it is going to be just great for the country.\n  It wasn't so great for the country. What I wish to show is what \nhappened as a result of that piece of legislation. This graph shows \nfrom 1999 forward the growth of total assets in the largest financial \ninstitutions. Look at this graph: Bigger and bigger. Not just a bit \nbigger; way, way, way up, the growth in assets of those six largest \nfinancial institutions.\n  This chart shows the four banks, total deposits in trillions of \ndollars, and we see what has happened there: liabilities in the six \nlargest institutions, deposits in the four largest banking \ninstitutions.\n  This chart shows the aggregate assets of the top six commercial and \ninvestment banks and what has happened in 10 years.\n  It doesn't take a genius and it doesn't take somebody with higher \nmathematics or having taken an advanced course in statistics to \nunderstand what this picture shows. We have seen a dramatic amount of \nconcentration--some of it, by the way, aided and abetted by the Federal \nGovernment because as we ran into this problem, this very deep \nrecession--the deepest since the Great Depression--our government \narranged the marriages of some of the biggest companies, and so the big \nbecame much bigger.\n  I have said all of that simply to say: That is where we have been, \nand now the question is, Where are we going? What kind of legislation \nare we going to take up on the floor of the Senate? Already there has \nbeen a big dust-up. The minority leader came to the floor of the Senate \nand said what was done in the Banking Committee will be a big bailout \nof the banks. Of course, that isn't the case at all. This is a fact-\nfree zone with respect at least to some debates. I don't think there is \nanybody in this Chamber who believes we don't have a responsibility now \nto address these issues, and address them in the right way.\n  Let me be quick to say a couple of things. No. 1, there are some \nawfully good financial institutions in this country run by some good \npeople who have done a good job, and we need them. You can't have \nproduction without the ability to finance production. We need \ncommercial banks. We need all of the other financial industries and \ninstitutions, but we need to make sure the excesses and the greed and \nthe unbelievable things that were done by some in the last decade \ncannot be repeated, cannot happen again.\n  The piece of legislation that is going to come to the floor of the \nSenate from the Senate Banking Committee is a good piece of \nlegislation. I commend Senator Dodd. I think he has done an excellent \njob. By the way, those who have said in the Senate that somehow this is \njust partisan, they didn't reach out to others; that is not the case, \nand everybody knows it.\n  Chris Dodd reached out to Republicans week after week and month after \nmonth to try to get some cooperation. Finally, they just walked away \nand they said: We are all going to vote no, no matter what. So it is \nnot the case that this was designed to be some sort of partisan bill. I \nstill hope there will be Republicans and Democrats who together \nunderstand what needs to be done to fix the problems that exist in our \nfinancial services industry.\n  In addition to Senator Dodd bringing a bill from the Banking \nCommittee, let me say Senator Blanche Lincoln, under her leadership in \nthe Agriculture Committee, has brought a piece of legislation to the \nSenate floor on derivatives that I think is a good piece of legislation \nthat needs to be a part of the banking reform bill.\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\n  What I wish to talk about ever so briefly is two other things. There \nare a number of people who have bills that I am going to be supportive \nof that I think have great merit that are necessary. I think they are \nnecessary to fix the real problems that exist. The issue of repairing \nwhat was done to Glass-Steagall, Senator Cantwell, Senator McCain have \na bill on that. There are others who have a bill on proprietary \ntrading, and there are others as well. But I wish to talk about two \nthings very briefly.\n  No. 1, I am preparing an amendment that deals with what are called \nnaked credit default swaps. I don't think that is investing. That is \nsimply betting. If there is no insurable interest on either side of \ncredit default swaps, that is not investing. I think there ought to be \na requirement that there be an insurable interest on at least one side \nin order for it to be a legitimate function because it seems to me if \nwe don't ban naked credit default swaps, we will have missed the \nopportunity to do something that is necessary to fix part of what \nhappened in the last decade, No. 1.\n  No. 2 is the issue of too big to fail. It has not been described, it \nseems to me, by either the Banking Committee or by amendments that have \nbeen suggested--it has not been described that we should take seriously \ntoo big to fail by deciding if you are too big to fail, you are too \nbig. This country has, on occasion--when we have a systemic risk that \nis unacceptable, when we have a moral imperative to do something about \nsomething such as this, this country has decided we will break Standard \nOil into 23 parts; we will break up AT, by the way, the 23 parts \nturned out to be much more valuable in their sum than the value of the \nwhole.\n  But having said all that, I believe there needs to be an amendment--\nand I am preparing an amendment--that deals with the issue of too big \nto fail. Very simply it says if the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil develops an approach that says, all right, this is an \ninstitution that is just too big to fail and the moral hazard for our \ncountry and the systemic risk for our country is too great and \ntherefore we judge it too big to fail, I believe what ought to happen \nover a period of time--perhaps 5 years--is a symptomatic divestiture \nsufficient so that the institution remains an institution that is not \nthen too big to fail. I believe that ought to be something that we \nconsider as we develop our approach to these financial reform measures.\n\n  I don't think big is always bad, and I don't think small is always \nbeautiful. I want us to be big enough to compete. I want us to have the \nresources to be able to make big investments in big projects. I \nunderstand all of that, and I can point to some terrific financial \ncompanies in this country run by first-rate executives.\n  So understand what I am talking about are the abuses and the \nunbelievable cesspool of greed we have seen in a decade from some \ninstitutions that were big enough and strong enough to run this country \ninto very serious trouble. That is why I think we have a responsibility \nat this point to address all of those issues that are in front of us as \nwe deal with banking reform.\n  I know this is going to be a long and a difficult task, but one of my \nhopes would be that Republicans and Democrats can all agree on one \nthing: What we have experienced in the last decade cannot be allowed to \ncontinue. It cannot be allowed to continue. No one, I believe, would \nwant our financial institutions to continue to bet rather than invest, \nto continue to invest in naked credit default swaps where there is no \ninsurable interest. Nobody, I would hope, would believe that represents \nthe kind of productive financing that we need to produce in this \ncountry again. I want the financing to be available from good, strong \nfinancial institutions to good, strong companies that need to expand to \nproduce American goods that say ``Made in America'' again.\n  That is what I want for our country. That kind of economic health can \nonly come if you have a strong system of financial institutions that \nare engaged in the things that originally made this a great country, \nnot trading naked credit default swaps but making good investments in \nthe productive sector of this country.\n  I believe we can do that again, and I believe we will. I don't \napproach this banking reform debate with trepidation. I think \nultimately cooler heads will prevail and all of us will understand the \nneed, and when we meet that need, this country will be much better off.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2580-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2580-S2581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOOD SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that \nwas the subject of a Foreign Relations Committee hearing today, of \ncourse, chaired by our chairman, John Kerry, and the ranking member, \nSenator Dick Lugar.\n  Today in America and worldwide, every 5 seconds a child dies from \nstarvation. Every 5 seconds across the world, every 5 seconds every day \nis the reality that stares us in the face. While the United States has \nhistorically played an important role in addressing hunger \ninternationally, this simple fact should serve as a galvanizing call to \naction on this issue.\n  The 2008 global food crisis brought attention to the fact that \nemergency food assistance was not enough, as generous as our country is \nand as important as that strategy is to confronting the problem. The \nemergency food assistance that year was not enough, and donors in \nrecipient countries that need to work together to address this systemic \nproblem need to do so even more so today.\n  The Obama administration has rightly prioritized food security and \nthe political support in the Senate is growing every day for the Lugar-\nCasey Global Food Security Act. I commend Senator Lugar for his work on \nthese issues for many years and, of course, I wish to commend and thank \nthe work that our chairman, Senator John Kerry, is doing on this issue \nevery day as well.\n  Creating an environment where local farmers can produce for \nthemselves and their communities as well as easily trade to get their \ngoods to market is the key to fundamentally changing this ongoing \ncrisis.\n  With a host of competing priorities for the attention of the United \nStates, I believe there are at least two reasons food security matters, \neven in the midst of some of the challenges we are facing domestically.\n  First, this is a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions that we \ncan go a long way toward solving. I think when we talk about this \nissue, no matter who we are, no matter what our station in life is, \nthis is an issue that we come to, summoned by our conscience, and I \nthink that is true in the Senate as well.\n  As one of the richest countries in the world, I believe we have a \nmoral obligation to do all we can to help. This crisis is solvable with \na combination of assistance and emphasis on providing small farmers \naround the world the know-how, the technology, and the means to provide \nfor themselves.\n  The second reason, in addition to this being a humanitarian crisis as \nto why this is so important, is global hunger is a national security \nissue. Instability arising from conflict across the world over access \nto food is a documented problem. The 2008 food crisis, unfortunately, \nbrought this into sharp, acute focus.\n  We saw it in Somalia, where struggles to gain access to food have \nenveloped population centers in violence. We have seen it in Egypt as \ncitizens rioted for access to bread. We have seen it in Haiti more \nrecently, where hospital beds filled in 2008 with those injured during \nfood riots. Increased instability in any of these countries has a \ndirect impact on U.S. national security interests.\n  The root causes of this perfect storm of crisis are well known but \nworth recounting. In 2008, food demand was driven higher due to \nexpanding population and rising incomes. More cereals were needed to \nfeed livestock for the production of meat and dairy products and to \nfill increasing demand for biofuels across the world. Higher oil \nprices, combined with weak harvests and rising global demand, created a \nscramble for resources. Wheat prices more than doubled and rice prices \nmore than tripled between January and May of 2008.\n  Twenty-eight countries imposed export bans on their crops, driving up\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\ncommodity prices and limiting supply. This led to political unrest \nacross the globe. It concentrated among developing countries with \nlarge, food-insecure, poor urban populations.\n  While this was indeed a perfect storm of events, the underlying \nissues that created this crisis continued. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for \nexample, 80 to 90 percent of all cereal prices remain 25 percent higher \nthan they were before the crisis began. In many Asian and Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean countries, prices are still more than 25 percent \nhigher than in the precrisis period of time. In the wake of the \neconomic crisis, the World Food Programme began receiving requests for \nassistance even from countries that previously were able to provide for \nthemselves.\n  The peripheral effects of food insecurity are considerable. High \nrates of hunger are shown to be linked to gender inequality, especially \nin terms of education and literacy, which also negatively affects the \nrate of child malnutrition. This number is stunning. It is estimated \nthat 60 percent of the world's chronically hungry are women and girls--\n60 percent--20 percent of whom are children under the age of 5. It is \nalmost incalculable. Those numbers are staggering and should do more \nthan just bother us and just inform our conscience; they should also \nmotivate us to do something about this crisis. I cite these figures, \nand too often in Washington we are guilty of doing just that--citing \nfigures. But they have real impact and real meaning.\n  I have had the privilege of personally working with some very special \nwomen in Pennsylvania who took it upon themselves to really highlight \nsome of these issues. The Witnesses to Hunger is a project that started \nin Philadelphia, PA. These women were given cameras to photograph their \nown lives, to tell us the truth of their experiences, and to raise \nawareness on many critical issues, including specifically hunger.\n  Last year, I had the honor, as did my wife Teresa, of bringing their \nexhibit to Washington, and in November we launched a tour across \nPennsylvania to highlight this issue. I cannot begin to describe how \nmoved I was--as were so many others who saw this exhibit--to see the \nphotographs taken by these women and to hear their stories of hunger \nand of poverty. Their bravery and rare courage in sharing the struggles \nthey face to provide a safe, nurturing home for their children will \nalways stay with me.\n  These mothers who brought Witnesses to Hunger to life are constant \nreminders that the programs we in Congress advocate for and the new \ninitiatives we can develop can have a profound impact on people's \nlives, whether it is in our towns and communities in Pennsylvania or in \nany other State or around the world, because this is a problem our \nworld and our country face.\n  Hunger in a country such as Pakistan poses both a humanitarian and a \nsecurity issue. Last year, over 77 million people in that country, \nPakistan, were considered food insecure by the World Food Programme. \nThat is nearly half of their population. As their military conducts its \ncontinued operations against extremist forces, their numbers could \nincrease. Hunger and competition for food can lead to further \ninstability and potentially undermine the Pakistani Government's \nleadership at a very critical time.\n  The global food crisis is still a serious problem, and despite the \nefforts of the administration, we still have a lot of catching up to do \nin order to respond properly. According to the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, the U.S. commitment to agricultural development \nhas declined in recent years, though emergency food assistance \ncontinues at robust levels. Worldwide, the share of agriculture in \ndevelopment assistance has fallen from a high of 13 percent in 1985 to \n4 percent between 2002 and 2007. The U.S. development assistance to \nAfrican agriculture fell from its peak of about $500 million in 1988 to \nless than $100 million in 2006. We can do a lot better than that.\n  The USAID has been hardest hit during this period. The USAID once \nconsidered agricultural expertise to be a core strength but today \noperates under diminished capacity. That is an understatement. Here is \nwhat I mean. In 1990, USAID employed 181 agricultural specialists, but \nin 2009 just 22--from 181 to 22 in just those years, less than 20 \nyears. That number has gone up from 22 recently, with the new \nadministration, but it is still far too few to work on this problem.\n  In the 1970s, the U.S. Government sponsored 20,000 annual \nscholarships for future leadership in agriculture, engineering, and \nrelated fields. Today, that number has fallen to less than 900. So we \nare not developing the workforce and expertise we need.\n  We simply don't currently have adequate infrastructure in our \ngovernment to respond to this crisis. The administration is making \nprogress, though. The administration's Global Hunger and Food Security \nInitiative, known by the acronym GHFSI, is a comprehensive approach to \nfood security based on country- and community-led planning and \ncollaboration. I welcome this opportunity to hear directly from the \nadministration about this effort. While I know the Obama administration \nhas worked assiduously to coordinate an interagency process and \nselection criteria for country participation around the world, \nquestions remain in terms of overall leadership of the initiative, as \nwell as its plan to develop internal expertise and capacity that is \nsustainable over the long term.\n  In the Senate, we have worked to bring attention to the world's \nhungry. Senator Lugar, as I mentioned before, a respected leader in \nthis field for decades, and I have joined together to introduce the \nGlobal Food Security Act. I will highlight three provisions before I \nconclude.\n  First, the Global Food Security Act would provide enhanced \ncoordination within the U.S. Government so that USAID, the Department \nof Agriculture, and other agencies are working together and not at \ncross-purposes.\n  Second, this bill would expand U.S. investment in the agricultural \nproductivity of developing nations, so that other nations facing \nescalating food prices can rely less on emergency food assistance and \ninstead take steps to expand their own crop production. Every dollar \ninvested in agricultural research and development generates $9 for \nevery dollar worth of food in the developing worlds.\n  Third, this bill, the Global Food Security Act, will modernize our \nsystem of emergency food assistance so that it is more flexible and can \nprovide aid on short notice. We do that by authorizing a new $500 \nmillion fund for U.S. emergency food assistance.\n  This is one of those rare occasions--unfortunately, too rare--where a \nserious crisis was greeted with substantial response by an \nadministration--in this case, the Obama administration--as well as \nbipartisan collaboration in the Senate and the House. I am encouraged \nthat there has been positive movement toward fundamentally changing how \nwe look at food security issues. Such support, however, is not \npermanent, and we should enact this multiyear authorization bill to \nensure that such congressional support exists in the future, many years \nfrom now. We cannot wait for another massive food crisis before taking \naction on this legislation. This is the right thing to do, and we will \nultimately enhance the security of the United States and our allies.\n  Mr. President, this isn't just a matter of being summoned by our \nconscience. That we know is part of the reason we are doing this. This \nis also a grave national security issue for us and our allies. For that \nreason and so many others, we need to pass the Global Food Security Act \nand support the administration's efforts on the Global Hunger and Food \nSecurity Initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2581-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2581-S2582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRIAN DUFFY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about a resolution \ndesignating April 23 through 25, 2010, as ``Global Youth Service \nDays.'' S. Res. 493 recognizes and commends the significant community \nservice efforts that youth are making in communities across the country \nand around the world on the last weekend in April and every day. This \nresolution also encourages the citizens of the United States to \nacknowledge and support these volunteer efforts. S. Res. 493 passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent on April 20, 2010. This sends a very strong \nmessage of support to the thousands of youth across our great Nation \nwho contribute positively to their communities--your efforts are \nrecognized and appreciated.\n  Beginning this Friday, April 23, youth from across the United States \nand around the world will carry out community service projects in areas \nranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. Through this \nservice, many will embark on a lifelong path of service and civic \nengagement.\n  This event is not isolated to one weekend a year. Global Youth \nService Days is an annual public awareness and education campaign that \nhighlights the valuable contributions that young people make to their \ncommunities throughout the year.\n  The participation of youth in community service provides an \nopportunity to identify and address the needs of their communities and \nmake positive differences in the world around them, learn leadership, \norganizational skills, and gain insights into the problems of their \nfellow citizens.\n  High-quality service-learning activities help young people make \nimportant connections between the school curriculum and the challenges \nthey see in their communities. Youth who are engaged in volunteer \nservice and service-learning activities do better in school than their \nclassmates who do not volunteer are also more likely to avoid risky \nbehaviors, such as drug and alcohol abuse. Service within the community \ncontributes positively to young people's character development, civic \nparticipation, and philanthropic activity as adults.\n  It is important, therefore, that the Senate encourage youth to engage \nin community service and to congratulate them for the service they \nprovide.\n  In an effort to recognize and support youth volunteers in my State, I \nam proud to acknowledge some of the activities that will occur this \nyear in Alaska in observance of National and Global Youth Service Days:\n  Anchorage's Promise, which works to mobilize all sectors of the \ncommunity to build the character and competence of Anchorage's children \nand youth, has sponsored the annual KidsDay events in Anchorage again \nthis year. Youth provided significant service to their peers and to \nadults who attended KidsDay activities:\n  The Spirit of Youth Teen Action Council's Herb Project provided youth \nwith the task of building organic hanging gardens for local elders who \nare unable to get out and garden this year.

DOROTHY I. HEIGHT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great Civil \nRights leader of our Nation, who passed away recently. I come to the \nfloor in her memory to pause for just a moment and to remember this \ngreat lady.\n  Tuesday, the Nation lost a powerful advocate for justice, equality, \nand opportunity for all people. Dr. Dorothy I. Height was truly a \nheroine of the civil rights movement. She was a civil rights \ntrailblazer whose courage and determination has allowed women around \nthe nation to break through glass ceilings and realize their dreams. \nShe has certainly been an inspiration to me personally.\n  Dr. Height was the chair and president emerita of the National \nCouncil of Negro Women, Incorporated. The council was founded by Mary \nMcLeod Bethune. She brought 28 national women leaders together to \nimprove the quality of life for women. Dr. Height embraced that vision \nand continued the crusade for justice. Through her leadership, she \nchanged our nation by shining a light on discrimination and injustice \nthat was all too common in America during the 20th century.\n  Dr. Height was also a member of many other organizations such as the \nYWCA and the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. Through her dedication \nand commitment in these organizations, she encouraged women to be \nleaders in national and community organizations and on college \ncampuses. She had an extraordinary presence, a really big and wonderful \nheart, she was a great intellect, and she had a passion for people. She \nis an example of the impact that women have on leadership. She was born \nnot only to be all a woman could be, but all a person could be, all a \nleader could be. Dr. Dorothy Height will always be respectfully \nremembered.\n  She has received many awards including the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom Award, the Congressional Gold Medal Award. I was proud to join \nmy Senate colleagues on sponsoring a Senate resolution honoring the \nlife and legacy of Dr. Height. She will be greatly missed and her \nlegacy will live on in the women she inspired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2583-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICAN CITY QUALITY MONTH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize April as the \n22nd Annual National American City Quality Month. Led by the National \nLeague of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, American City Planning \nDirectors' Council/American City Quality Foundation, Urban Land \nInstitute, City Planning and Management Division of the American \nPlanning Association, International City/County Management Association, \nAmerican Public Transportation Association, American Society of \nLandscape Architects and others, this valuable program brings together \na wide range of public and private partners. Their efforts demonstrate \nwhat it takes to plan and develop better quality communities addressing \nvital issues including land use, building design, transportation, \nhousing, parks and recreation, energy efficiency, economic development, \nenvironmental protection, sustainability and livability.\n  City planners across my State of Maine and throughout the Nation are \ncalling on public and private sector leaders to commit to preparing, \nadopting and implementing a nationwide better quality communities plan \nthat will lead to better planning, redevelopment and development of our \nNation's cities and surrounding regions. This is essential to \naccommodate U.S. Census projected population growth of about 30 million \nby the year 2020 and 100 million within 30 to 40 years. This is the \nequivalent of building eleven cities the size of Chicago. Also, it will \nhelp to create jobs, stop urban sprawl, guide billions of dollars of \ninvestment to improve communities while lowering governmental operating \nexpenses and taxes.\n  This public-private partnership is necessary to meet the growing need \nfor higher quality, more energy efficient and sustainable housing, \nbuildings, public transportation, infrastructure, agriculture, and \nindustry. All citizens are urged to get involved by contacting their \ncommunity planners. I applaud these collaborative efforts to improve \nurban and rural communities across our Nation.\n  This collaborative planning works. Just last year, Forbes Magazine \nnamed Portland, ME, my State's largest city, as the most livable city \nin America. In addition, Portland's busy Commercial Street was voted as \none of the country's great streets by the American Planning \nAssociation. The transformation of Portland did not happen by accident. \nIt is the result of citizens and organizations working together. \nAmerican City Quality Month celebrates this effort. This year our \nGovernor, John Baldacci, proclaimed April as American City Quality \nMonth. Other Governors and officials are invited to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2583-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I speak often about the excellent higher \neducation opportunities that are available in Vermont. Today, I want to \nhonor Middlebury College for a new business venture that builds upon \nits academic reputation in foreign languages.\n  A small, liberal arts school of 2400 students, located in Addison \nCounty, Middlebury is a campus that is rooted in Vermont's rich \nculture, while charting the way forward to the future. From using wood \nchips to heat and cool buildings across the campus, to local food \ninitiatives, to recycling building materials, students, faculty and \nstaff use creativity and build on a tradition of excellence in helping \nto take the college to the next level.\n  This week, Middlebury College was hailed as one of the Nation's top \n``green colleges'' in a new ranking by the Princeton Review. And a \nrecent article in the New York Times described the college's new and \ninnovative business partnership to develop an online language program \nfor precollege students. Already well known for its intensive summer \nlanguage programs, Middlebury will be able to broaden its reach and \nimpact by bringing a language program directly into the homes of \nAmerican students wanting to learn new languages.\n  The Internet has emerged as a significant learning tool, and \nconnecting students with language instruction on the Web is a wonderful \nacademic idea as well as an innovative business initiative.\n  I know that Middlebury College will continue to be a leader in \nacademic innovation, and I wish them the best in their new endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2583-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2583-S2584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNIZING CLEMSON UNIVERSITY SCROLL OF HONOR\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \nrecognizing a historic event taking place in Clemson, SC. Today, \nClemson University and the Clemson Corps are dedicating its Scroll of \nHonor Memorial, which recognizes the 473 Clemson University alumni who \nsacrificed their lives protecting and defending our Nation.\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\n  Clemson University has a long and distinguished military history, and \ntodays dedication of the Scroll of Honor is a testament to this \nschool's continued commitment to honoring those who serve our country. \nI truly appreciate the Clemson Corp for spearheading this important \nproject.\n  As Senator, I have had the great honor to meet many of our Nation's \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and marines serving abroad. They are \ndedicated, proud individuals who take their jobs to protect our Nation \nvery seriously.\n  Like the millions of veterans who served before them, they also know \nthe great truth that freedom is never free. It was won and protected \nfor more than two centuries by patriotic Americans willing to risk \ntheir lives to defend this great country of ours.\n  Millions of Americans have given their blood, sweat, and tears in \ndefense of this great land. Many, like the individuals we honor today, \npaid the ultimate price. Words cannot adequately express the great \nrespect and admiration I have for these individuals.\n  I, like all Americans, will forever be indebted to them for their \nsacrifice.\n  I ask that the U.S. Senate join me in honoring these distinguished \nSons of Dear Old Clemson, their families, and the thousands of \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who continue to serve our \nNation.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Gerard \nBaker, Superintendent of Mount Rushmore National Memorial. \nSuperintendent Baker has accepted a new assignment as Assistant \nDirector for American Indian Relations for the National Park Service. \nWhile his leadership at Mount Rushmore will be greatly missed, the \nentirety of the Park Service will benefit from this new role. I have \nenjoyed working with Gerard in his capacity as Superintendent and want \nto take this opportunity to recognize his accomplishments.\n  During his tenure, Gerard has helped promote a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the significance of Mount Rushmore and the surrounding \nBlack Hills. In addition to telling the story of the four Presidents \nwhose likenesses are carved into the mountain, he and his staff have \nworked to broaden the perspectives of history, culture, and natural \nresources at the memorial. Visitors, young and old alike, have enjoyed \nexpanded interpretive programs, including an award-winning audio tour \navailable in Lakota and a Heritage Village highlighting the history and \ncustoms of local American Indian communities. Gerard has done an \nadmirable job of promoting understanding and celebration of all of the \ncultures that make up our democracy.\n  Gerard's long and accomplished career with the National Park Service \nbegan in 1979 at the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site \nwhere he worked as a park technician. He worked his way up and \neventually became Superintendent of Little Big Horn Battlefield \nNational Monument. He would later serve as the first Superintendent of \nthe Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail before coming to Mount \nRushmore. Throughout his career, Gerard has been recognized with \nnumerous awards for exceptional work. He was also recently featured in \nthe Ken Burns documentary ``The National Parks: America's Best Idea.''\n  National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis should be commended for \nrecognizing the importance of working with tribes across our country on \ncultural and natural resources issues central to the Park Service's \nmission. He could not have picked a better person to represent the Park \nService in this capacity. In addition to vast experience with the Park \nService, Gerard brings a lifetime of learning from his own heritage as \na Mandan-Hidatsa Indian. That perspective, coupled with the charisma \nand good humor Gerard is so well known for, will be a great asset for \nthe Park Service.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Gerard and his wife Mary Kay for \ntheir dedication to Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills area. I wish him \nall the best in his new position as Assistant Director for American \nIndian Relations for the National Park Service. Gerard's efforts at \nMount Rushmore will continue to benefit visitors for years to come, and \nI congratulate him on his accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2584-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING VERNON C.

A memorial \nservice will be held on the campus of Eastern Michigan University today \nto celebrate the life of this wonderful man.\n  Dean Polite's efforts to enrich the educational experiences of \nstudents in Michigan and across the country are truly inspiring. His \nguidance has left an indelible mark on the institutions in which he has \nplayed a part. From his work as principal at Oak Park Public Schools \nand professor at Catholic University of America, to his roles as \nfounding dean of Bowie State University's School of Education and dean \nof the Eastern Michigan University College of Education, Dean Polite \nhas set an example of conscientious and courageous leadership.\n  Dean Polite was embraced by colleagues, students, family, and friends \nas much for his impressive accomplishments as for his generous heart \nand personal kindness. He has been called ``an ambassador for education \nand for social justice across the nation.'' His dedication to social \njustice is not only evident in the research he conducted on \norganizational change and minority educational issues and in his active \npursuit of diversity at Eastern Michigan and other institutions but \nalso in the graceful and respectful manner in which he interacted with \nthose around him each day. Dean Polite leaves a void at Eastern \nMichigan University and in the countless lives he helped to shape. His \nmemory will be a vivid and lasting inspiration to many.\n  Vernon C.

Mr. President, though we often say in Maine that \nApril can still be considered a winter month, we are hopeful that \nwarmer weather is just around the corner. And one of our Nation's \nfavorite summer pastimes is grilling outdoors--eating good food while \nenjoying the company of friends and family. While barbecue is \ntraditionally considered Southern cuisine, one Maine company is out to \nredefine that notion--and having great success in this endeavor. As \nsuch, I rise today to recognize DennyMike's 'Cue Stuff Inc. for its \nnumerous award-winning barbecue products.\n  DennyMike's got its start in 2002 when Dennis Michael--or DennyMike--\nSherman, a born and bred Mainer, opened DennyMike's Smokehouse BBQ and \nDeli in the popular seaside town of Old Orchard Beach. Mr. Sherman's \npurpose in opening this unique restaurant in Maine was to expose New \nEnglanders to a cuisine he has loved since the 1970s, when he first \nexperienced authentic Texas-style barbecue. In 2008, Mr. Sherman also \nlaunched a line of genuine, hand-crafted barbecue rubs and sauces for \nuse by customers at home, whether it be to spice up meatloaf made in \nthe oven or add flavor to seafood or steak cooked on the grill. The \ncompany is a member of the Kansas City BBQ Society and the National BBQ \nAssociation, among other organizations, ensuring that it is at the \nforefront of this burgeoning industry.\n  To create its unique sauces and rubs, DennyMike's utilizes high-\nquality ingredients such as clover honey, natural sea salt, and \nBarbados molasses. The company creates these products, which are all-\nnatural and gluten-free, in small batches to ensure a richer flavor. \nThe company markets a broad range of sauces like the Sweet 'N Spicy, \nDennyMike's original standard-bearer, as well as rubs that include the \nFintastic, seasoned with a hint of citrus for a tangy twist on \ntraditional Maine cuisine such as fresh fish and shrimp. From sweet and \nsavory to strong and spicy, DennyMike's products are designed to please \nany discerning set of taste buds. DennyMike and his wife, Patty, \naccompanied by one full-time employee, produce the sauces and rubs, \nwith five part-time workers supplementing as needed.\n  While some may scoff at the notion of an award-winning barbecue \nmaster hailing from Maine, Mr. Sherman has put such critics to shame \nwith an impressive display of awards from organizations nationwide. In \nNovember, one of DennyMike's sauces was named the best barbecue sauce \nin the ``All-Natural Hot'' category at the 2010 Scovie Awards, while \nanother of its distinctive rubs won top place in the ``Dry Rub/All-\nPurpose'' class. Decided through scrupulous blind tastings, the Scovie \nAwards are prestigious in the barbecue industry, and now comprise one \nof the world's most competitive gourmet food competitions. \nAdditionally, DennyMike's received five medals--two gold, one silver, \nand two bronze--from the National Barbecue Association, or NBBQA, last \nyear, while also winning several awards for its distinct packaging from \nvarious organizations. At this year's NBBQA Conference and Expo, \nDennyMike's racked up seven awards, building on its record of \naccomplishment and success within the industry.\n  DennyMike's 'Cue Stuff has quickly made a name for itself by \nintroducing quality, all-natural barbecue products to our home State. \nAs he continues to promote his sauces and rubs at regional trade shows \nacross New England, I am confident that word will only spread faster of \nMr. Sherman's creative and celebrated line of products. I thank Mr. \nSherman for so vividly embodying the entrepreneurial spirit, and wish \nhim continued success in his tasty quest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2585-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2585-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/22/senate-section/article/S2585-5", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2585-S2586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1585.

A bill to exclude from consideration as income under the \nNative American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 \namounts received by a family from the Department of Veterans Affairs \nfor service-related disabilities of a member of the family; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, my colleague Senator Thune and I are \nintroducing a piece of legislation that will correct a flaw in the \nNative American Housing and Self-Determination Act of 1996, NAHASDA, \nthat could leave some disabled Native American Veterans having to \nchoose between living with their families or having enough money to \nsurvive without them. No veteran should ever be faced with having to \nmake that painful choice. Their service to our nation demands that they \nbe treated with the greatest care, and this bill would help ensure \nthat.\n  Native Americans serve in the U.S. military at a higher rate, per \ncapita, than any other group. However, if a Native American veteran \nreturns home with injuries suffered in battle, they face additional \nchallenges because of the rules covering tribal lands.\n  Currently, NAHASDA counts veterans disability payments and survivor \nbenefits as income when determining both eligibility for housing \nassistance and rental payments. Since virtually the only criteria for \nreceiving public housing assistance on tribal lands is income--and the \nincome levels on tribal lands are historically low--it does not take a \nlarge veterans disability payment to make them cross the threshold of \nbeing ``too wealthy'' to qualify for tribal housing. And in Indian \nCountry,\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\nalternatives to tribal housing are few and far between.\n  In addition, because disability payments are based on the level of \ndisability, the larger the sacrifice a soldier has made, the less \nlikely he or she will be able to return to tribal housing. This also \nmeans that a soldier who has been disabled could not move in with his \nfamily if they receive housing assistance without putting the entire \nfamily at risk of losing their housing if the payments would put them \nabove 80 percent of area median income. No family should have to choose \nbetween a roof over their head and caring for a wounded son or \ndaughter, father or mother. Nor should they have to choose between \nliving on their native homelands or being forced to move off the \nreservation to care for this wounded veteran. Yet, this is the Catch-22 \nthat wounded Native American veterans currently face, and it must be \nfixed.\n  Our bill would do that, in a very simple way. It would exempt \nveterans' disability and survivor benefits from counting as ``income'' \nfor tribal housing programs. This does not affect the amount of money \nCongress appropriates for tribally designated housing entities. It \nwould just allow those programs to serve Native American veterans who \nhave been injured in combat, or the families of those killed on the \nbattlefield. Our bill is a simple, budget-neutral way to fix a law \nwritten with the best of intentions. I urge the speedy passage of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act with respect \nto fair and reasonable fees for credit scores; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, earlier, I listened to the \ncolloquy between the two members of the Banking Committee as they \noutlined the importance of true Wall Street accountability and the Wall \nStreet reforms we will consider in the future.\n  I rise to speak about a particular opportunity we have as we consider \nthis important and far-reaching reform legislation, and that is to \ndiscuss a piece of legislation I have introduced today called the Fair \nAccess to Credit Scores Act of 2010.\n  Senator Lugar and I joined along with eight other colleagues, to \nintroduce this bill that would put consumers back in control of their \nfinances. This bill takes a commonsense yet significant step in that \ndirection by offering Americans annual access to their credit score \nwhen they access their annual free credit report.\n  Making the distinction between your score and your report, a report \ntells consumers what outstanding credit accounts they have open, such \nas student loans or credit cards, maybe a car or home loan. \nUnfortunately, it tells Americans little else. Often, they already \nknow--they hopefully should know that information in their credit \nreport. In contrast, your credit score, which our legislation would \nmake available, is what banks and lenders and increasingly even \nemployers have access to. It is critical information that each one of \nus needs to know.\n  Today, you and I would have to jump through hoop after hoop and \nultimately have to pay to have access to our credit score, while banks \nand lenders can get this information more easily. Mr. President, I know \nyou have been a strong advocate for fairness in America, and that is \nsimply not fair.\n  In 2003, Congress enacted legislation that required the three major \nconsumer credit reporting agencies to provide a free annual report to \neach one of us on a yearly basis. This was known as the FACT Act. It \nwas an important step in ensuring that financial records of American \nconsumers are accurate. You could cross-check, as a consumer, what was \nin your report.\n  Many of my constituents in Colorado have seen frequent television \ncommercials and Internet advertisements, and they are led to believe \nthat the annual credit report under law includes this credit score I am \ndiscussing. Unfortunately, we were all disappointed--I have been \npersonally--to find out that you only have access to your credit \nreport, not the critical information that helps you judge your \ncreditworthiness. You actually have to purchase your score or subscribe \nto a credit-monitoring service that costs you up to $200 a year to \nreceive it. There are some troubling cases that even go further, where \nconsumers believe they are signing up for a free credit score, only to \nfind out later that they have actually signed up for a costly monthly \nmonitoring service instead. This is simply not fair. It is why the \nConsumer Federation of America and the Consumers Union support this \nlegislation.\n  Your credit score is a critical piece of information that impacts \nyour interest rates, your monthly payments on home loans, and it could \nbe the difference between whether a child is able to afford college or \nnot. As I alluded to earlier, this information is increasingly being \nused to decide whether you will be offered a job. When you apply for a \njob, your potential employer has access to that information, and you \ndon't even know what it is. This is personal information, and the \nconsumers themselves seem to be the only people who don't have easy \naccess to it.\n  We are talking about empowering American consumers when we pass--and \nI know we will--Wall Street accountability legislation. We want to \nempower consumers to be able to shape their own financial futures and \nthereby the country's financial future. To do that, we have to have \ntransparency.\n  When you have free access to your credit score, although that is a \nsmall part of the larger reforms we need, it addresses one of the \nfundamental inequities that pervade our current financial system. Put \nsimply, the one-sided marketplace today is rigged to benefit large \nfinancial institutions at the expense of hard-working Americans who are \nstruggling to support their families and save for retirement. Consumers \ncontinually find themselves on the losing end of this bargain.\n  With so much at stake, this legislation we filed today is a small \nstep to help restore balance and put Americans back in charge of their \nfinancial health. My hope is that, as this Chamber considers the Wall \nStreet accountability bill, we will consider adding this legislation as \nan amendment and restore a greater dose of fairness to consumers in \nColorado, to the Presiding Officer's constituents, and to all the rest \nof our Nation.\n  Let me close by thanking a group of Senators who have joined me: \nSenators Lugar, Scott Brown, Hagan, Levin, Lieberman, Klobuchar, \nMenendez, Shaheen, and Tom Udall. They have all joined me in putting \nconsumers first by cosponsoring this commonsense, proconsumer \nlegislation.\n  I ask each one of my colleagues as well to join me in supporting its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. McCain, \n        and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 3248. A bill to designate the Department of the Interior Building \nin Washington, District of Columbia, as the ``Stewart Lee Udall \nDepartment of the Interior Building''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last month our country lost a great \nAmerican with the passing of Stewart Udall, who, among his many \nachievements, is probably best remembered for his accomplishments as \nSecretary of the Interior during the Presidencies of President Kennedy \nand President Johnson.\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\nHis lifetime of work to protect our public lands and his efforts to \nimprove the quality of our environment are unequaled. Stewart Udall was \ninstrumental in the passage of virtually all of our Nation's landmark \nenvironmental laws, including the Clean Air Act of 1963, the Wilderness \nAct of 1964, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1965, the \nEndangered Species Act of 1966, the National Historic Preservation Act \nof 1966, the National Trails System Act of 1968, and the Wild and \nScenic Rivers Act of 1968. Nearly half a century later, these laws \nremain the key protections for our Nation's land, air, and water. In \naddition, he oversaw significant additions to the National Park System \nand the National Wildlife Refuge System. Many years after he left \noffice, he was a driving force behind the enactment of the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act of 1990.\n  In the 161-year history of the Department of the Interior, there have \nbeen many exceptional individuals who have served as Secretary of the \nInterior, and Stewart Udall certainly ranks among the best of those. In \nrecognition of his lifetime of work pursuing the common good and \nprotecting our Nation's public lands and waters and in particular his \nachievements as the Secretary of the Interior, today I am introducing \nlegislation to designate the Department of the Interior Building in \nWashington, DC, as the ``Stewart Lee Udall Department of the Interior \nBuilding.'' I am pleased to have Senator Mark Udall, Senator John \nMcCain, and Senator Harry Reid, our majority leader, as cosponsors of \nthis bill. Dedication of the Department of the Interior's headquarters \nhere in Washington will be a small but fitting tribute to Stewart \nUdall's legendary accomplishments, many of which took place in that \nvery building.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Mark Udall, is here to also speak in \nsupport of this legislation. Let me defer to him, and then I will ask \nrecognition again on a somewhat separate matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his courtesy.\n  I rise in support of this legislation. I intend at some later date to \nspend additional time on the floor talking about my Uncle Stewart, who \nwas a wonderful man, an uncle to me, but more than that, he was a \nmentor, he was a leader. In the last 12 years of his life after my \nfather died, he really served as a second father to me; therefore, I \nfeel as though I lost a second father recently.\n  I thank the Senator on behalf of at least my side of the family. I \nknow my cousin Tom will, at the right time and in the right way, \nexpress his thanks as well.\n  My uncle was many things, but he was at his heart a student of the \nWest. He was a son of the West. He always looked for the lessons that \nthe landscapes and the people of the West could provide all of us.\n  I know the Senator from New Mexico knows of the many books he wrote. \nHe wrote over half a dozen books. One of the books I took the most \ninsight from was a book called ``The Founding Fathers and Mothers of \nthe West.'' He pointed out in that book that people came to the West--\nthe Presiding Officer will be interested in this--to find a new life. \nHe continued in that vein by talking about the great western director \nof western movies, John Ford. He once asked John Ford if his movies \nportrayed the West as it was. Ford's answer was: No; they portrayed the \nWest as it should have been, doggone it. My uncle's point was that the \nWest was not settled by the gunfighters and those who had gotten into \nconflicts. The West was settled by those who came looking to create \ncommunities and to work together. It was the people standing on the \nwooden sidewalks watching the gunfights who in the end settled the \nWest, established the West as we know the West today.\n  My uncle in particular had great affection and respect for the Native \npopulations in the West. That led him to have great passion and even \noutrage about the way Native Americans had been treated. In his later \nyears, as the Presiding Officer knows, he went to battle in the courts \nthrough his words in every form possible advocating justice and fair \ntreatment for our Native American brothers and sisters. In our family, \nwe characterized him as being outraged without being outrageous.\n  We are going to, obviously, miss him. I am going to miss his wise \ncounsel. I will do everything I can to live by the credo he carried \nforward, I say to Senator Bingaman, which he believed deeply: We didn't \ninherit the Earth from our parents; we are borrowing it from our \nchildren. I think that is the fundamental lesson our uncle left with \nus. The inspiring step of the Senator from New Mexico to name the \nInterior Building after my uncle will help us keep that firmly in our \nview and keep committed to that purpose for our time on this Earth.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his graciousness. I look \nforward to this bill becoming the law of the land.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Udall, for \nhis very eloquent statement. Obviously, the Udall family has a great \ndeal of which to be proud: his father's great public service, his \nuncle's great public service, and, of course, he is carrying on with \nthat tradition, as is Tom Udall, my colleague from New Mexico. We are \nvery fortunate in this country to have the Udall family working hard to \nmake this a better place.\n  I hope this legislation I have introduced today can become law soon. \nWe will have that additional recognition for Stewart Udall and his \ncontribution to the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 3250. A bill to provide for the training of Federal building \npersonnel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation that I believe will help the Federal Government cut its \nenergy bill, save taxpayers' money and benefit the environment. Today \nis Earth Day, when people are thinking about how they can take better \ncare of our planet. Federal agencies need to do the same.\n  Also important, the last few years have underscored the need for our \nNation to rethink its energy use. Constantly shifting energy costs and \nour Nation's severe economic problems have resulted in families, \nhomeowners, and businesses all taking a hard look at how much they are \nspending, including for energy needs. Governments should be no \ndifferent, and they are no different.\n  Over the past few months, my Subcommittee on Federal Financial \nManagement, Government Information, Federal Services, and International \nSecurity held hearings to examine how the Federal Government can lead \nby example in being more energy efficient. We learned, among other \nthings, that the Federal Government is the single largest energy user \nin the Nation.\n  In fiscal year 2008, the total energy consumption of Federal \nGovernment buildings and operations was roughly 1.5 percent of all \nenergy consumption in the United States. The energy bill for the \nFederal Government that year was $24.5 billion. Of that $24.5 billion, \nover $7 billion was spent on energy to operate Federal buildings alone.\n  With a price tag that large, there are significant opportunities for \nsavings. Today, I offer a series of proposals that I believe will allow \nthe Federal Government to take better advantage of these opportunities.\n  The Government Accountability Office has noted that Federal agencies \nface a number of challenges in meeting their energy management goals. \nOne of those is rapidly building and retrofitting our buildings with \nadvanced technologies, without regard for the skills necessary to \noperate and maintain these facilities to their optimum efficiency.\n  The Federal Government has spent billions of dollars on technology \nand hardware to improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. \nHowever, if this significant investment is not safeguarded by well-\ntrained individuals, we will never be able to achieve the biggest bang \nfor our buck. New technology demands new skills. My legislation would \nbetter ensure that the individuals who manage our Federal facilities \npossess the knowledge they need to meet these demands.\n  The Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010, which I am \nintroducing today along with Senator Collins, and Representatives \nCarnahan\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\nand Biggert in the House, will ensure that the General Services \nAdministration has all of the tools necessary to not only upgrade our \ninfrastructure, but also guarantee that these buildings are properly \nmaintained and operated at their highest performance levels. You \nwouldn't give a race car to an inexperienced driver and expect them to \nwin the Indy 500. In the same way, we can't expect our Federal \nbuildings to run at peak efficiency if we don't make sure our personnel \nhave adequate training.\n  I am also introducing a second bill, the Improving Energy Efficiency \nand Renewable Energy Use By Federal Agencies Act of 2010.\n  Federal agencies are pursuing many ideas and technologies to reduce \nthe amount of energy they consume, and adopt renewable energy such as \nsolar panels on top of Federal buildings. These proven technologies \nhave resulted in financial savings that have more than paid for the \ninitial financial investment. This is in addition to the environmental \nand energy security benefits of reduced energy use.\n  In fact, earlier this year the Administration announced plans for \nFederal agencies to reduce its greenhouse gas pollution by 28 percent \nby 2020, representing between $8 billion and $11 billion in cost \nsavings. These goals are part of a very useful and effective executive \norder signed last year directing agencies to not only devote more \nattention to energy reduction, but share their best ideas.\n  While the Administration's Executive Order, Federal Leadership in \nEnvironmental, Energy and Economic Performance, represents an important \nstep forward, there is more we can do.\n  Federal agencies can make use of some creative financial tools where \ngovernment partners with the private sector. For example, with Power \nPurchasing Agreements a Federal agency allows a company to use \ngovernment land, for example an unused portion of military base, to \nbuild solar, wind or other renewable power production with private \nsector funding, and in exchange gives the Federal facility cheaper \nelectricity. This means that governments can reduce the cost of its \nenergy use and help clean up the environment by promoting renewable \nenergy--all without having to spend a single taxpayer dollar. Not a bad \nway to do business.\n  Currently, DOD is more successful with Power Purchasing Agreements \nbecause their facilities are allowed to enter into longer term \nagreements, as compared to civilian agencies which are restricted to \nonly 10 years. My bill will allow longer-term agreements for all \nagencies.\n  It is important to remember, the cleanest, most efficient--and \ncheapest--energy, is the energy we don't use. That is why I would like \nFederal agencies to quicken the pace of its efforts to implement energy \nefficiency measures. To help accomplish this, my bill establishes a \n$500 million revolving fund to provide financial support for Federal \nagency energy efficiency and renewable projects. This fund would \nincrease the number of agency energy efficiency projects, such as new \nheating and cooling systems, which save on operations costs. Savings \nfrom the projects would be paid back into the fund over time, and \neventually fund additional projects.\n  Other provisions of my bill adopt some good, common-sense ideas. For \nexample, President Obama's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal outlined \nhow the Department of Veterans Affairs is saving money by operating \ntheir computers more efficiently. Using new computers that use less \nenergy, and software that automates when a computer is turned on and \noff, the agency plans to save around $32 million over the next 5 years. \nMy bill would require other Federal agencies to consider and adopt \nsteps similar to that of the Department of Veteran Affairs' successful \nexample.\n  I am also interested in expanding cutting edge advanced metering \ntechnology throughout government. There's an old saying that goes, \n``You can't manage, what you can't measure.'' It can easily be applied \nto energy use. At my recent hearings I learned that, with new digital \ntechnology, we can save energy and money by connecting facilities \nacross an organization and monitoring buildings--and even parts of \nbuildings and individual pieces of machinery--on their energy use in \nreal-time. Wal-Mart uses this technology because they understand the \nfinancial savings it brings. From their headquarters in Bentonville, \nAR, they will know if a freezer door has been left open for too long at \ntheir store in Middletown, Delaware. The Federal Government should do \nthe same so that building managers can make more effective decisions. \nThe best part about deploying advanced metering is the fact that the \ninvestment pays for itself in less than a year.\n  As America's largest consumer of energy, Federal agencies can and \nshould be good stewards of precious taxpayer dollars by using energy as \nefficiently as possible. The proposals contained in my two pieces of \nlegislation will help the Federal Government lead by example, and \ndemonstrate to the American people that energy efficiency efforts can \npay real dividends in saving both money and the environment. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues and the Administration to get \nthese two bills signed into law, and implement these important ideas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of these two \nbills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to submit a resolution recognizing Child Abuse Prevention Month. \nI am honored to be joined by a longtime advocate of children, Senator \nDodd, in turning a spotlight on the issue of child abuse and neglect in \nthis country. Senator Dodd and I share a common belief that children \nshould be valued and nurtured by both their families and the larger \nfamily of humankind.\n  The effort to address child abuse transcends ideological and partisan \nlines. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue--this is an \nAmerican issue--one that we can't wish away, but that we must face head \non and work to eradicate.\n  Abuse of children occurs in all segments of our society, in rural, \nsuburban, and urban areas and among all racial, ethnic, and income \ngroups. According to the 2008 Child Maltreatment Study compiled by the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, during 2008, an estimated \n772,000 children were determined to be victims of abuse or neglect, and \nan estimated 1,740 children died as a result.\n  My home State of Maine is mourning the death of 15-month old Damien \nLynn, who was allegedly murdered by his mother's boyfriend. Autopsy \nreports show that little Damien had broken bones and ribs, head and \nabdominal injuries, and a human bite mark on his right arm. It is in \nDamien's memory, and that of the thousands of children who are abused \nand neglected each year, that I come to the floor today.\n  The time has come for Americans to unite in an all-out effort to \neradicate child abuse. Child Abuse Prevention Month is an opportunity \nfor communities across the country to keep children safe, provide the \nsupport families need to stay together, and raise children and youth to \nbe happy, secure, and stable adults.\n  To paraphrase Mahatma Gandhi, ``You can judge a society by how they \ntreat their weakest members.''

Res. 499\n\n       Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being completely \n     preventable and treatable;\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, 35 \n     countries, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa, \n     account for 98 percent of global malaria deaths;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, with \n     estimates that children under the age of 5 account for 85 \n     percent of malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal health, \n     causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth \n     weights, with estimates that malaria infection causes 400,000 \n     cases of severe maternal anemia and from 75,000 to 200,000 \n     infant deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria over recent years have \n     made measurable progress and have helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization's World Malaria \n     Report 2009 reports that ``[i]n countries that have achieved \n     high coverage of their populations with bed nets and \n     treatment programmes, recorded cases and deaths due to \n     malaria have fallen by 50%'';\n       Whereas the World Health Organization's World Malaria \n     Report 2009 further states that ``[t]here is evidence from \n     Sao Tome and Principe, Zanzibar and Zambia that large \n     decreases in malaria cases and deaths have been mirrored by \n     steep declines in all-cause deaths among children less than 5 \n     years of age'';\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment is critical to continue to reduce malaria deaths \n     and to prevent backsliding in those areas where progress has \n     been made;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a major \n     leadership role in the recent progress made toward reducing \n     the global burden of malaria, particularly through the \n     President's Malaria Initiative and the United States \n     contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama said on World Malaria Day in \n     2009, ``It is time to redouble our efforts to rid the world \n     of a disease that does not have to take lives.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 255, which was \nreceived from the House.\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 255) commemorating \n     the 40th anniversary of Earth Day and honoring the founder of \n     Earth Day, the late Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today is the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, \na day set aside to appreciate the environment. In 1970, Senator Gaylord \nNelson from Wisconsin recognized the power of campus activism and \nestablished Earth Day as a way to highlight the environmental problems \nthis Nation faced--air pollution from factories, water pollution from \nunregulated discharges, and toxic waste dumps. After Congress passed \nlegislation to designate April 22 as Earth Day, Congress passed several \nbills to protect the environment including the Clean Water Acts, the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the Federal Pesticides Act, the \nClean Air Act, the Environmental Education Act, and the National Hiking \nTrails and the National Scenic Trails Acts.\n  Because Michigan is surrounded by four of the five Great Lakes, the \nproblems plaguing the lakes have an enormous impact on Michigan. A \ngeneration ago, the Great Lakes were a huge reservoir of persistent \ntoxic substances, but they have improved markedly since that time. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, estimates that the Great Lakes \nCritical Programs Act, which I sponsored in 1990, has reduced direct \ntoxic water discharges by millions of pounds per year. In addition, \nsince 2002, the EPA estimates that close to 900,000 cubic yards of \ncontaminated sediment have been removed under the Great Lakes Legacy \nAct at 5 of the 31 U.S. ``Areas of Concern'' in the Great Lakes, \nthirteen of which are found in Michigan.\n  While the Great Lakes have made strides in recovering, historical \nproblems still exist and new problems are on the horizon. There are \nstill hundreds of fish advisories issued every year; the number of \nbeach closings remains high; Lake Erie is once again experiencing a \n``dead zone'' from high levels of phosphorus; and a new invasive \nspecies enters the Great Lakes about every 8 months. Last year, \nCongress provided $475 million for comprehensive Great Lakes \nrestoration efforts.\n  Because of its industrial past, Michigan has faced some challenges \nwith contaminated properties, including complications related to \nredevelopment. This is why I have also long been a supporter of \nbrownfields redevelopment and smart growth efforts, which connect \nenvironmental goals with economic and community development objectives. \nIn 1999, I joined my former colleague, Senator Jim Jeffords to form the \nSenate Smart Growth Task Force. The task force serves as a forum for \nSenators interested in sustainable and sensible growth, and has \nsupported locally driven, federally supported smart growth practices.\n  Supporting and enjoying Michigan's parks and trails are also \nimportant aspects of this Earth Day celebration. Last year, I helped \nestablish the Beaver Basin area as Wilderness at Pictured Rocks \nNational Lakeshore and I am currently working on another Wilderness \ndesignation in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. It is \nimportant for the public to have access to these areas so they can \nenjoy magnificent vistas, quiet streams, freshwater lakes, forests and \nprairies, and other natural beauty. To promote access and conservation, \nI have also worked to improve the North Country National Scenic Trail, \nwhich runs through Michigan, by helping to provide ``willing seller \nauthority'' to help the trail be completed more quickly. When \ncompleted, the trail will span seven States and roughly 4,600 miles, \napproximately 1,000 miles of which will be located in Michigan, \npreserving critical outdoor recreational opportunities while providing \na boost to the local economies along the trail.\n  Michigan is blessed to have so many natural resources. It is \nimportant that we recognize that we are just temporary stewards and \nthat we protect and restore our resources for current and future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today our Nation marks the 40th anniversary \nof Earth Day. For four decades, Americans have joined together on April \n22 to celebrate our environment and to commit ourselves to fostering a \nhealthier world. What Senator Gaylord Nelson began as a grassroots \nresponse to widespread environmental degradation in the 1970s has grown \nto become the foundation of the modern environmental movement and an \nannual recognition of Earth Day. For 40 years, Americans have used this \nday to organize events and participate in activities to draw attention \nto environmental issues and to promote environmental awareness and \nreform. Today, on the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, we can be proud of \nthe many steps we have taken to clean up the environment. With the hard \nwork and dedication of many, we have made progress. But there is more \nwork to be done and we are facing many new threats.\n  Now for the first time since the passage of the landmark \nenvironmental laws of the 1970s, we are close to making significant \nstrides to address environmental, climate, and energy-related issues. \nBipartisan legislation is being developed in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, and significant steps have been taken \nalready by this administration to ease the impact of human activities \non the natural world, for our benefit, and for the benefit of \ngenerations to come. We do not have to choose between creating jobs and \nprotecting the environment or between jobs and solving climate change. \nThe economy of the 21st century will be built on infrastructure powered \nby clean energy, and, as Gaylord Nelson once wrote, ``all economic \nactivity depends upon the . . . air, water, soil, forest, minerals, \nwetlands, rivers, lakes, oceans, wildlife habitat, and scenic beauty.'' \nThese, he said, ``are the accumulated capital resources of a nation. \nTake them away and what you have left is a wasteland.''\n  Today, as the world pauses to consider the awe-inspiring power of our \nchoices, let us reflect on what we stand to lose if we fail to act and \nwhat we stand to gain if we make the commitment to improve the air, \nwater, and land upon which we depend. It is clear that Earth Day is not \nabout the next government proclamation or regulation; this day is about \nthe actions of individuals the amazing power of one person to \naccomplish change.\n  The threats to our planet are global; they are broad and \noverwhelming. But they are also very personal. The choices we make \ntoday will shape our world for generations to come. Though it may seem \nimprobable to suggest that each person has the power to make a change, \nin saving our planet and improving our communities, it is certainly \ntrue.\n  It is estimated that by the year 2050, 40 years from now, the global \npopulation will be 9.4 billion people, adding more strain to our \necosystems. If personal responsibility for the Earth is truly as simple \nas conserving water, choosing public transportation or carpooling \nwhenever possible, making your home more energy efficient, buying local \nsustainably produced food, recycling and reusing goods, there is little \nreason for any of us to deny our individual power to bring about \nchange.\n  It is all too easy to imagine that the problems people currently face \nare a world away--across an ocean, on other continents. It is too easy \nto imagine problems such as a lack of clean water, vicious storms, and \ninsufficient food supplies as not our own. I know that when it comes to \nthe future of the Earth, the continent that seems so removed could just \nas easily be my backyard. On this 40th Earth Day, I am proud to call \nVermont, the Green Mountain State, my home, and Vermont has been a \nleader in helping to show the way forward in protecting the Earth.\n  As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, each of us can \nrenew our commitment to our planet--our home. We can use our power as \nindividuals to work together toward a cleaner environment and a \nhealthier planet. As part of the legacy we leave for our children and \nour grandchildren, let them enjoy a society that is secure in its \ncommitment to a healthy and environmentally sound future. On this 40th \nanniversary of Earth Day, while we remember the pioneering spirit of \nGaylord Nelson, we must honor his legacy and continue turning his words \ninto action.\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize one of our most \nprominent Wisconsinites, Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth Day.\n  On April 22, 1970, 20 million Americans paused for a day to celebrate \nour planet and press for the urgent actions needed to preserve and \nprotect it. As we observe this 40th anniversary of the first Earth Day, \nwe once again reflect on the necessity of a clean and safe environment, \ncelebrate the successes of the last four decades, and consider the long \nway we still must go to achieve the goals laid out that day.\n  In Wisconsin, we also stop to remember and honor one of our most \nprominent citizens.\n  Earth Day was born out of the passion of Gaylord Nelson. His life was \none of service from the Pacific theater during World War II, to the \nState House as a State Senator and Governor, and to Washington, DC \nwhere he served Wisconsin as a U.S. Senator for nearly 20 years.\n  When Gaylord came to Washington, he did so with a mission to bring \nenvironmental causes to the forefront of the national debate. He \nbelieved that the cause of environmentalism needed as much attention as \nnational defense. For his first years in the Senate, his cause was \nlonely. In 1966, his bill to ban the pesticide DDT garnered no \ncosponsors.\n  Gaylord knew that only with the grassroots support of regular \nAmericans, could the environmental agenda rise to prominence. His idea \nfor Earth Day came from the student teach-ins of the 1960s, but his \ncause inspired people across boundaries of age, race and location. This \nyear, more than one billion people around the world will come together \nin the same way they did 40 years ago.\n  In a speech on that historic day in 1970, Gaylord noted that his goal \nwas not just one of clean air and water, but also ``an environment of \ndecency, quality and mutual respect for all other human beings and all \nother living creatures.'' He told the crowd that America could meet the \nchallenge through our technology. The unanswered question was, he said, \n``Are we willing?''\n  That question was answered with a resounding yes. That year saw the \ncreation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the \nClean Air Act. In 1972, 6 years after Gaylord Nelson stood alone on his \nproposed DDT ban, its use was ended. Later years would bring better \nprotection of drinking water, emissions and efficiency standards for \ncars, programs to cleanup brownfields sites, and the protection and \npreservation of our forests, rivers, mountains and oceans.\n  Despite that progress and I imagine Gaylord would be the first to \nnote this we still have much work ahead of us. We must use this \nanniversary to commit to another environmental decade. The needs of 40 \nyears ago cleaner water, cleaner air, more protection of our lands are \nstill here, but the next challenge we must face is climate change.\n  From lower lake levels, to more invasive species, the consequences of \nunchecked climate change could be devastating to the people of \nWisconsin. Climate change isn't just a threat, it is also an \nopportunity. Structured correctly, the solutions to slowing climate \nchange can also speed up our economic recovery.\n  Remarkable research and development is happening today in Wisconsin \non products for cleaner water, advanced battery technology, and using \nwaste from farms and forests to make advanced biofuels. We have \ncompanies developing products to harness the power of the sun to \nreplace traditional interior lighting, retrofitting heavy-duty trucks \ninto hybrids, and manufacturing energy-efficient hot water heaters.\n  In Congress, legislative work to address climate change is ongoing. \nWith the right mixture of requirements and incentives, we can achieve a \npolicy that reduces our dependence on foreign oil, cuts greenhouse gas \nemissions, lowers prices at the pump and on the electricity bill, and \ncreates good-paying jobs that cannot be outsourced.\n  We do not have to choose between the environment and the economy, \nbetween jobs and solving climate change. Gaylord Nelson made this point \nover and over again. He once wrote that ``all economic activity depends \nupon the air, water, soil, forest, minerals, wetlands, rivers, lakes, \noceans, wildlife habitats, and scenic beauty.'' These, he said, ``are \nthe accumulated capital resources of the nation. Take them away and \nwhat you have left is a wasteland.''\n  On this 40th anniversary of Earth Day, while we remember the \npioneering sprit of Gaylord Nelson, we must honor his legacy by turning \nwords into action.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, 40 years ago, Senator Gaylord Nelson \nattempted to bring attention to a degraded environment through a day \ndedicated to our planet. On April 22, 1970, environmental issues, as \nthey are today, were challenging oxygen levels in the Androscoggin \nRiver in my great state of Maine frequently reached zero during the \nsummer, resulting in the death of nearly all fish and other aquatic \nlife in the river and carbon monoxide and ozone emissions significantly \ndegraded our country's air quality. The environmental, economic, and \npersonal costs of a failure to recognize the benefits of a healthy \nenvironment had reached a tipping point for many American citizens who \ndemanded action both through greater awareness of personal \nenvironmental decisions and through new public laws. Millions of \nAmericans, as Senator Nelson said, ``organized themselves'' to not only \nprotest the degradation of our environment, but also to educate each \nother on personal steps to reduce waste, increase recycling, and \ntogether improve the condition of environment around us.\n  Four decades later, Earth Day serves as a consequential reminder of \nwhat we have achieved since 1970, and what we still have left to \naccomplish, especially as we evaluate the current state of our \nenvironment. In that light, on this Earth Day, as the ranking member of \nOceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, I held a hearing on the \nthreat of acidification on the largest ecosystems of the world, our \noceans. And while the expert witnesses outlined the daunting hurdles of \nthis 21st century challenge to our lobster industry and the beautiful \ncoral reefs of the world, it is encouraging at the same time to reflect \nupon the past challenges we've met that seemed insurmountable.\n  In 1970, there were less than 50 bald eagle nesting pairs in Maine, \ntoday there are at least 477. This extraordinary increase came to \nfruition through a combination of the federal banning of DDT and a \nconcerted effort by Mainers who volunteered to track our sacred \nnational symbol and conserve its habitat. Furthermore, just last year, \nthe Commissioner of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and \nWildlife remarkably and thankfully was able to recommend the removal of \nthe Bald Eagle from Maine's list of Endangered and Threatened Species. \nIt was a combination of dedicated attention by Mainers as well as \npublic policies that made this success a reality. And in Maine's iconic \nrivers and waterways fish are returning and our air quality has \nimproved.\n  Nationally, for nearly 10 years, I have been pleased to join forces \nwith my good friend and colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein, to \nimplement technology available today and raise fuel economy standards \nfor our Nation's automobile fleet. And finally, in 2007 we passed \nlegislation that will cut air pollution, reduce our consumption of \nforeign oil, and save money at the gas pump which will be of benefit to \neveryone, especially those in the rural parts of my state. And earlier \nthis month, these rules were finalized and will save 1.8 billion \nbarrels of oil over the life of cars and trucks sold between the 2012 \nand 2016 model years. This welcomed and long overdue advancement will \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions from our vehicles by 21 percent by 2030 \nand represents the most significant effort so far to combat climate \nchange.\n  When we commemorate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day in just 10 \nyears from now, let it be said that in 2010, we made great strides in \nimproving our energy efficiency in our homes and offices, we reduced \nthe number of miles that we drive on a weekly basis, we mitigated \ncarbon dioxide emissions, and we reduced the amount of oil we import. \nAbove all, let us hope we can look back and say we were able to forge \ncomprehensive energy legislation that spoke not just to our goals for \nprotecting the environment and harnessing new sources for energy, for \nensuring greater not lesser energy\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\nindependence, but that reflected once again the hallmark vision, \ningenuity, and can-do spirit that have always driven this great land \nfor whom no task is too daunting and no adversity too steep.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, earlier today--the 40th Anniversary \nof Earth Day--on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, I test drove the \nenergy-efficient, fuel cell-powered Chevy Cruze.\n  Across Ohio, next-generation fuel-efficient vehicles are being built. \nGM recently announced that its plant in Lordstown, OH--near Youngstown \nin Trumball County--would bring back a third shift of workers to the \nassembly line to build the Cruze.\n  Twelve hundred jobs are expected to be created building this new line \nof fuel-efficient cars that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil \nand reduce the pollution of our air.\n  Forty years ago, many were hard-pressed to see how environmental and \neconomic objectives could coexist.\n  The Cuyahoga River burned in Cleveland and oil spills marred the \nbeaches of Santa Barbara.\n  With Lake Erie dying, Americans demanded an end to the polluted air \nand water that threatened the public health and safety of our Nation.\n  Such tragedies served as catalysts that established the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, passed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and \nformed a public and political conscience to safeguard our environment.\n  Today, the Cuyahoga River--41 years after the fire--is cleaner and \nhealthier; more than 60 different fish species are thriving, and \ncountless families are again enjoying its natural beauty.\n  The modern environmental movement was marked by the efforts of \ncitizens demanding that their government protect our health by \nprotecting our environment.\n  Like so many times throughout our Nation's history, citizen activism \nserved as vehicle for change.\n  The 1960s, the third progressive era of the 20th century, was defined \nby passage of Medicare and Medicaid, the Higher Education Act, the \nVoting Rights Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the \nCivil Rights Act.\n  Rachel Carson's 1962 ``Silent Spring'' helped the environmental \nmovement educate elected officials and industry leaders about threats \nto human safety and the importance of environmental sustainability.\n  U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin persuaded President Kennedy \nto raise the importance of the conservation through a 5-day, 11 State \ntour in September 1963.\n  Senator Nelson took the energy of that tour and found it mirrored \nacross the country in the public's desire for cleaner air and water.\n  Today, we celebrate Senator Nelson's vision of Earth Day--how his \nteach-ins and grassroots plea translated the public's concern for the \nenvironment into political action.\n  On April 22, 1970, after years of planning, Earth Day activities \nstretched from college campuses, to city parks, to community halls \nacross the country.\n  That citizen call to action spurred decades worth of environmental \nprotections that have improved the health of our Nation's air, streams, \nlakes, and rivers.\n  Today, Earth Day is celebrated around the world. And today, our \ncollege campuses are once again spurring our Nation's environmental \ninnovation.\n  In northeastern Ohio, Oberlin College built one of the Nation's \nfirst--and at the time the largest--solar-powered building in the \nNation. The college is also working with the city of Oberlin to develop \ngreen spaces and energy efficient living.\n  Baldwin Wallace has one of the Nation's only academic programs \nstrictly devoted to sustainability practices.\n  Case Western is partnering with the Cleveland Foundation to build the \nworld's first wind turbines in fresh water.\n  In northwestern Ohio, the University of Toledo's Clean and \nAlternative Energy Incubator has helped entrepreneurs and business make \nToledo a national leader in solar energy jobs.\n  Bowling Green State University has the first and largest commercial \nscale wind farm in Ohio and the Midwest.\n  In Central Ohio, the Ohio State University is partnering with \nBattelle and Edison Welding to develop cutting-edge advanced \nalternative energy sources.\n  In southern Ohio, Ohio University is conducting a full-scale wind-\ndata collection project in Appalachia to identify the best wind-energy \nresources within a 2,000-square-mile 7-county region.\n  And just this week the University of Cincinnati was named one of the \ngreenest universities in the country.\n  Across Ohio, from Youngstown State University to Akron University to \nthe University of Dayton and Stark State Community College, Ohio's \ncampuses continue to be a breeding ground of innovation.\n  The activism and expertise of our students and entrepreneurs mark \ntremendous progress toward a more sustainable environment.\n  It is a progress that has led to the largest investment in clean \nenergy and environmental sustainability in our Nation's history.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is making historic \ninvestments to make our water and sewer systems safer, our clean energy \nsources more affordable and available.\n  And Ohio's history of manufacturing excellence and cutting edge \nentrepreneurs is leading the Nation in Recovery Act funds used for \nclean energy.\n  For four decades, the environmental movement has made clear that \nwithout action, we face dangerous consequences. We risk the health of \ncitizens, the viability of our coastal areas, and the productivity of \nour State's farms, forests, and fisheries.\n  We risk our long-term economic and national security.\n  Yet no longer do environmental and economic objectives conflict with \neach other. No longer do we needlessly pick winners and losers among \nregions, workers, and industries.\n  We have seen how despite our population growing by 50 percent in the \npast 40 years and the number of cars on the road having doubled over \nthat same time, our air is 60 percent cleaner than at the time of the \nfirst Earth day in 1970, all while our economy has grown like no other \nin the history of the world.\n  Done right, our Nation can become energy independent, improve its \nglobal competitiveness, and create new jobs and technologies for our \nworkforce.\n  As we plant the seeds for economic growth--for new jobs in new \nindustries--we are also planting the seeds for a cleaner, more \nsustainable environment.\n  And that is what Earth Day represents--for workers making the Cruze \nin Lordstown or activists continuing to push for a cleaner environment.\n  Earth Day reminds us to call upon our history of innovation and \nperseverance to usher in a new era of prosperity for our Nation and \nsustainability for our plant.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 40th anniversary \nof Earth Day. Started in 1970 by Wisconsin's Senator Gaylord Nelson as \nan environmental teach-in, Earth Day has become a global event. More \nthan 20 million people participated in the first Earth Day and that \nnumber has grown to over 500 million in 175 countries.\n  Since the first Earth Day, the United States has made significant \nstrides in improving the quality of our environment--our air, our \nwater, our land, and our natural resources. The days of having to turn \non street lights in downtown Pittsburgh at noon because of the \npollution emitted by coal plants, steel mills, and other industries are \nlong gone.\n  No longer does the Cuyahoga River in Ohio catch fire due to the \nuncontrolled discharge of oil and other pollutants. Long gone too is \nthe mining of coal and other minerals without regard to the impact on \nland or water. And today, one can hike through Yellowstone National \nPark or the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and hear the howling of wolves, \na species that was almost completely wiped out in the lower 48 States. \nThese are just a few examples of how our Nation has embraced the \ntenants of environmental awareness put forth on that first Earth Day in \n1970.\n  Let me relate to you another story of our Nation's environmental \nprogress that is a source of particular pride for Pennsylvanians. \nRachel Carson is considered one of the pioneers of the environmental \nmovement in the United States. Ms. Carson was born in 1907 and grew up \non a small family farm near Springdale in western Pennsylvania,\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\nwent to the Pennsylvania College for Women in Pittsburgh, which later \nbecame Chatham College, and completed her M.A. in zoology at Johns \nHopkins University. She began her career as a biologist with what was \nthen the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries.\n  Her seminal work in 1962, Silent Spring, brought to the forefront the \ndangers of DDT and other pesticides. DDT was a major cause of decline \nin the population of birds of prey, including the peregrine falcon. \nBecause of the efforts of Ms. Carson and others, DDT was eventually \nbanned from use in the United States in 1972. Today, peregrine falcons \nhave returned to much of their former range, including a pair of \nfalcons that have been nesting on the Pennsylvania Department of \nEnvironmental Protection office tower in Harrisburg, which fittingly, \nis named the Rachel Carson Building.\n  Ms. Carson's call to action on the environment was also a driving \nforce behind a 1972 amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution clearly \narticulates the right of Pennsylvania's citizens to clean air, pure \nwater, and the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and \nesthetic values of the environment, and ensuring these rights to \ngenerations yet to come.\n  The first Earth Day was also a major impetus for our Nation to move \nforward with a myriad of Federal legislation--including the Clean Water \nAct, Clean Air Act, Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, and the \nEndangered Species Act--that provided the regulatory framework for \nAmerica to be a world leader in environmental stewardship.\n  Just as importantly, we have seen since the first Earth Day that \nenvironmental protection can go hand-in-hand with economic growth. \nAccording to US EPA, since 1980, total emissions of six principal air \npollutants--carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic \ncompounds, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide--decreased by 54 \npercent.\n  And during this same period, gross domestic product, GDP, increased \nby more than 126 percent while the U.S. population grew by 34 percent, \nclearly demonstrating that we can maintain a strong, robust economy \nwhile at the same time protecting and promoting a safe and healthy \nenvironment for all Americans.\n  Today, as a nation, we need to applaud the accomplishments we have \nmade since the first Earth Day in improving the quality of our air, \nwater, and land. But we also need to acknowledge that the task of \nprotecting our environment is far from complete.\n  The remaining challenges are many. Nutrient pollution is still a \nconcern for the Chesapeake Bay and other waterways. Mercury from large \nstationary sources still threatens the health of our Nation's \nvulnerable population of infants and pregnant woman. And many of our \nurban areas still exceed national standards for air quality.\n  But the most daunting environmental challenge today is climate \nchange. The scientific evidence about the threat of climate change \ncannot be disputed. We must move forward with climate and energy \nlegislation that will put us on a path that ends our unsustainable \nreliance on foreign energy. A path that will create new, clean energy \njobs and that will regain our competitive edge over countries like \nChina, which is out-investing us and out-innovating us when it comes to \nnew energy technologies. A path that regains control of our \nenvironment, our economy, and our national security.\n  Let me close with a quote from Rachel Carson. It goes, ``Those who \ncontemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will \nendure as long as life lasts.'' So, as we celebrate Earth Day today, \nlet us all take a moment to consider the beauty and wonder of the \nnatural world around us.\n  And let us use the strength we take away from these moments to \ncontinue to preserve and protect our Nation's rich natural history and \nenvironment for our children and grandchildren. So that future \ngenerations will always have a clean environment, a robust economy, and \na secure Nation.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to; that a Coburn substitute amendment to the \npreamble be agreed to; the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate, and that any statements relating to the measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thomas Porteous, Jr., to the Articles of Impeachment.\n       A copy of this letter and the Amended Replication will be \n     served upon counsel for Judge Porteous today through \n     electronic mail.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Alan I. Baron,\n                                      Special Impeachment Counsel.\n\n                   In the Senate of the United States\n\nSitting as a Court of Impeachment\n                                  ____\n\n\n In re: Impeachment of G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., United States District \nJudge for the Eastern District of Louisiana\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                AMENDED\n\nREPLICATION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO THE ANSWER OF G. THOMAS \n             PORTEOUS, JR., TO THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT\n\n       The House of Representatives, through its Managers and \n     counsel, respectfully replies to the Answer to Articles of \n     Impeachment as follows:\n\n                        Response to the Preamble\n\n       Judge Porteous in his Answer to the Articles of \n     Impeachment, denies certain of the allegations and makes what \n     are primarily technical arguments as to the charging language \n     that do not address the factual substance of the allegations. \n     However, it is in Judge Porteous's Preamble that he sets \n     forth his real defense and, without denying he committed the \n     conduct that is alleged in the Articles of Impeachment, \n     insists that nevertheless he should not be removed from \n     Office.\n       At several points in his Preamble, Judge Porteous notes \n     that he was not criminally prosecuted by the Department of \n     Justice, the implication being that the House and the Senate \n     should abdicate their Constitutionally assigned roles of \n     deciding whether the conduct of a Federal judge rises to the \n     level of a high crime or misdemeanor and warrants the Judge's \n     removal, and should instead defer to the Department of \n     Justice on this issue. Judge Porteous maintains that \n     impeachment and removal may only proceed upon conduct that \n     resulted in a criminal prosecution, no matter how corrupt the \n     conduct at issue, or what reasons explain the Department's \n     decision not to prosecute. Judge Porteous provides no support \n     for this contention because there is none--that is not what \n     the Constitution provides.\n       Indeed, the Senate has by its prior actions made it clear \n     that the decision as to whether a Judge's conduct warrants \n     his removal from Office is the Constitutional prerogative of \n     the Senate--not the Department of Justice--and the existence \n     of a successful (or even an unsuccessful) criminal \n     prosecution is irrelevant to the Senate's decision. The \n     Senate has convicted and removed a Federal judge who was \n     acquitted at a criminal trial (Judge Alcee Hastings). The \n     Senate has also convicted a Federal judge for personal \n     financial misconduct (Judge Harry Claiborne) while at the \n     same time acquitting that same Judge of the Article that was \n     based specifically on the fact of his criminal conviction.\\1\\ \n     Thus, Judge Porteous's repeated references to what the \n     Department of Justice did or did not do adds nothing to the \n     Senate's evaluation of the charges or the facts in this \n     case.\\2\\\n       Further, according to Judge Porteous, pre-Federal bench \n     conduct cannot be the basis of Impeachment, even if that \n     conduct consisted of egregious corrupt activities that was \n     beyond the reach of criminal prosecution because the statute \n     of limitations had run, and even if Judge Porteous \n     fraudulently concealed that conduct from the Senate and \n     the White House at the time of his nomination and \n     confirmation. There is nothing in the Constitution to \n     support this contention, and it flies in the face of \n     common sense. The Senate is entitled to conclude that \n     Judge Porteous's pre-Federal bench conduct reveals him to \n     have been a corrupt state judge with his hand out under \n     the table to bail bondsmen and lawyers. Such conduct, \n     which, as alleged in Articles I and II, continued into his \n     Federal bench tenure, demonstrates that he is not fit to \n     be a Federal judge.\n       Finally, the notion that Judge Porteous is entitled to \n     maintain a lifetime position of Federal judge that he \n     obtained by acts that included making materially false \n     statements to the United States Senate is untenable. Judge \n     Porteous would turn the confirmation process into a sporting \n     contest, in which, if he successfully were to conceal his \n     corrupt background prior to the Senate vote and thereby \n     obtain the position of a Federal judge, he is home free and \n     the Senate cannot remove him.\n\n                               Article I\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     statement in the Answer to Article I that denies the acts, \n     knowledge, intent\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\n     or wrongful conduct charged against Respondent.\n\n\n                       FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense and further \n     states that Article I sets forth an impeachable offense as \n     defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                       SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, namely, \n     that Article I is vague. To the contrary, Article I sets \n     forth several precise and narrow factual assertions \n     associated with Judge Porteous's handling of a civil case \n     (the Liljeberg litigation), including allegations that Judge \n     Porteous ``denied a motion to recuse himself from the case, \n     despite the fact that he had a corrupt financial relationship \n     with the law firm of Amato & Creely, P.C. which had entered \n     the case to represent Liljeberg'' and that while that case \n     was pending, Judge Porteous ``solicited and accepted things \n     of value from both Amato and his law partner Creely, \n     including a payment of thousands of dollars in cash.'' There \n     is no vagueness whatsoever in these allegations. Article I's \n     allegation that Judge Porteous deprived the public and the \n     Court of Appeals of his ``honest services''--a phrase to \n     which Judge Porteous raises a particular objection--could not \n     be more clear and free of ambiguity as used in this Article, \n     and accurately describes Judge Porteous's dishonesty in \n     handling a case, including his distortion of the factual \n     record so that his ruling on the recusal motion was not \n     capable of appellate review.\\3\\\n\n\n                       THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of the purported affirmative defense that Article \n     I charges more than one offense. The plain reading of Article \n     I is that Judge Porteous committed misconduct in his handling \n     of the Liljeberg case by means of a course of conduct \n     involving his financial relationships with the attorneys in \n     that case and his failure to disclose those relationships or \n     take other appropriate judicial action. The separate acts set \n     forth in Article I constitute part of a single unified scheme \n     involving Judge Porteous's dishonesty in handling Liljeberg. \n     Further, the charges in this Article are fully consistent \n     with impeachment precedent.\\4\\\n\n\n                       FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which, in \n     effect, seeks to suppress the statements of a highly educated \n     and experienced Federal judge, made under oath, before other \n     Federal judges. Judge Porteous was provided a grant of \n     immunity in connection with his Fifth Circuit Hearing \n     testimony, and the immunity order provided that his testimony \n     from that proceeding could not be used against him in \n     ``any criminal case.'' Simply put, an impeachment trial is \n     not a criminal case.\\5\\ Accordingly, there is simply no \n     credible basis to argue that the Senate should not \n     consider Judge Porteous's immunized Fifth Circuit \n     testimony.\n\n                          Answer to Article II\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     statement in the Answer to Article II that denies the acts, \n     knowledge, intent or wrongful conduct charged against \n     Respondent.\n\n\n                       FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense and further \n     states that Article II sets forth an impeachable offense as \n     defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                       SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, namely, \n     that the Article is vague. To the contrary, Article II sets \n     forth several precise and narrow factual assertions \n     associated with Judge Porteous's relationship with the \n     Marcottes--both prior to and subsequent to Judge Porteous \n     taking the Federal bench. Article II alleges with specificity \n     the things of value given to Judge Porteous over time and \n     identifies the judicial or other acts taken by Judge Porteous \n     for the benefit of the Marcottes and their business.\n\n\n                       THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, namely, \n     that the Article improperly charges multiple offenses. The \n     plain reading of Article II is that Judge Porteous engaged in \n     a corrupt course of conduct whereby, over time, he solicited \n     and accepted things of value from the Marcottes, and, in \n     return, he took judicial acts or other acts while a judge to \n     benefit the Marcottes and their business.\n\n\n                       FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, namely, \n     that Article II improperly charges pre-Federal bench conduct \n     as a basis for impeachment. First, Article II plainly alleges \n     that Judge Porteous's corrupt relationship with the Marcottes \n     continued while he was a Federal Judge. Second, Judge \n     Porteous's assertion that pre-Federal bench conduct may not \n     form a basis for impeachment finds no support in the \n     Constitution and is not supported by any other sound legal or \n     logical basis.\\6\\ As a factual matter, it is especially \n     appropriate for the Senate to consider Judge Porteous's pre-\n     Federal bench corrupt relationship with the Marcottes where \n     it was affirmatively concealed from the Senate in the \n     confirmation process, where it involved conduct as a judicial \n     officer directly bearing on whether he was fit to hold a \n     Federal judicial office, and where that conduct, having now \n     been exposed, brings disrepute and scandal to the Federal \n     bench.\n\n                              Article III\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     statement in the Answer to Article III that denies the acts, \n     knowledge, intent or wrongful conduct charged against \n     Respondent.\n\n\n                       FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense and further \n     states that Article III sets forth an impeachable offense as \n     defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                       SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which \n     alleges in substance that the allegations in Article III are \n     vague. To the contrary, Article III sets forth several \n     specific allegations associated with Judge Porteous's conduct \n     in his bankruptcy proceedings. There is no credible \n     contention that Judge Porteous cannot understand what he \n     is charged with in this Article.\n\n\n                       THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which \n     alleges, in substance, that Article III charges more than one \n     offense. The plain reading of Article III is that Judge \n     Porteous committed misconduct in his bankruptcy proceeding by \n     making a series of false statements and representations, and \n     by incurring new debt in violation of a Federal Bankruptcy \n     Court order. This Article alleges a single unified fraud \n     scheme, with the purpose of deceiving the bankruptcy court \n     and creditors as to his assets and his financial affairs, so \n     that Judge Porteous could enjoy undisclosed wealth and income \n     for personal purposes--including gambling.\n\n\n                       FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which, in \n     effect, seeks to suppress the statements of a highly educated \n     and experienced Federal judge, made under oath, before other \n     Federal judges. Judge Porteous was provided a grant of \n     immunity in connection with his Fifth Circuit Hearing \n     testimony, effectively eliminating the possibility that any \n     of that testimony could be used against him in any criminal \n     case. An impeachment trial is not a criminal case. There is \n     simply no credible basis to argue that the Senate should not \n     consider Judge Porteous's immunized Fifth Circuit testimony.\n\n\n                       FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense--which does \n     not take issue with the proposition that Judge Porteous \n     committed misconduct in a Federal judicial bankruptcy \n     proceeding, but contends only that the acts as alleged do not \n     warrant impeachment. First, this is not an affirmative \n     defense. It is up to the Senate to decide whether the facts \n     surrounding the bankruptcy warrant impeachment.\n       Second, the Senate has in fact removed a judge for personal \n     financial misconduct, and in 1986 convicted Federal Judge \n     Harry Claiborne and removed him from office for evading \n     taxes. It is significant that the Senate did not convict \n     Judge Claiborne for the crime of evading taxes. Rather, the \n     Senate acquitted Judge Claiborne of the one Article that \n     charged him with having committed and having been convicted \n     of a crime.\n       Third, what the Department of Justice may consider material \n     for purposes of a criminal prosecution has nothing to do with \n     what the Senate may deem to be material for purposes of \n     determining whether Judge Porteous should be removed from \n     Office--an Office which requires that he oversee bankruptcy \n     cases and administer and enforce the oath to tell the truth.'\n\n                               Article IV\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     statement in the Answer to Article IV that denies the acts, \n     knowledge, intent or wrongful conduct charged against \n     Respondent.\n\n\n                       FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense and further \n     states that Article IV sets forth an impeachable offense as \n     defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                       SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which \n     alleges the Article is vague. The allegations sets forth in \n     Article IV are specific and precise. In fact, Judge \n     Porteous's description of the charge fairly characterizes the \n     offense: ``In essence, Article IV alleges that Judge Porteous \n     gave false answers on various forms that were presented in \n     connection with the background investigation. . . .'' It is \n     apparent, therefore, that Judge Porteous has a clear \n     understanding of these allegations in Article IV, which \n     specify the dates and circumstances\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\n     when the statements were made, and the contents of the \n     statements that are alleged to have been false. There is no \n     credible contention that the Article IV does not provide \n     Judge Porteous specific notice as to what this Article \n     alleges.\n\n\n                       THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense. The \n     allegation sets forth in Article IV are specific and precise. \n     They charge in substance that Judge Porteous made a series of \n     false statements to conceal the fact of his improper and \n     corrupt relationships with the Marcottes and with attorneys \n     Creely and Amato in order to procure the position of United \n     States District Court Judge. Charging these four \n     false statements, all involving a single issue, in a \n     single Article is consistent with precedent.\\8\\\n\n\n                       FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, alleging \n     that the Senate cannot impeach Judge Porteous based on pre-\n     Federal bench conduct. First, Judge Porteous's assertion that \n     pre-Federal bench conduct may not form a basis for \n     impeachment is not supported by the Constitution. \n     Notwithstanding Judge Porteous's assertions to the contrary, \n     the Constitution does not limit Congress from considering \n     pre-Federal bench conduct in deciding whether to impeach, and \n     there are compelling reasons for Congress to consider such \n     conduct--especially where such conduct consists of making \n     materially false statements to the Senate. The logic of Judge \n     Porteous's position is that he cannot be removed by the \n     Senate, even though the false statements he made to the \n     Senate concealed dishonest behavior that goes to the core of \n     his judicial qualifications and fitness to hold the Office of \n     United States District Court Judge. The proposition that the \n     Senate lacks power under these circumstances to remedy the \n     wrong committed by Judge Porteous is simply untenable.\n       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                   The U.S. House of Representatives\n\n           By\n     Adam Schiff,\n       Manager,\n     Bob Goodlatte,\n       Manager,\n     Alan I.

Claiborne was acquitted of Article III, \n     charging that he ``was found guilty by a twelve-person jury'' \n     of criminal violations of the tax code, and that ``a \n     judgement of conviction was entered against [him].'' See \n     ``Impeachment of Harry E. Claiborne,'' H. Res. 471, 99th \n     Cong., 2d Sess. (1986) (Articles of Impeachment); 132 Cong. \n     Rec. S 15761 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 1986) (acquitting him on \n     Article III).\n       \\2\\ Moreover, the Department of Justice's investigation \n     hardly vindicated Judge Porteous. To the contrary, the \n     Department viewed Judge Porteous's misconduct as so \n     significant that it referred the matter to the Fifth Circuit \n     for disciplinary review and potential impeachment, and set \n     forth its findings in its referral letter.\n       \\3\\ Judge Porteous treats Article I as if it alleges the \n     criminal offense of ``honest services fraud,'' in violation \n     of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1346, and that \n     because the term ``honest services'' has been challenged as \n     vague in the criminal context, the term is likewise vague as \n     used in Article I. Despite Judge Porteous's suggestion to the \n     contrary, Article I does not allege a violation of the \n     ``honest services'' statute. Moreover, it could hardly be \n     contended that proof that Judge Porteous acted dishonestly in \n     the performance of his official duties does not go to the \n     very heart of the Senate's determination of whether he is fit \n     to hold office.\n       \\4\\ The respective Articles of Impeachment against Judges \n     Halsted L. Ritter, Harold Louderback, and Robert W. Archbald \n     each set forth lengthy descriptions of judicial misconduct \n     arising from improper financial relationships between those \n     judges and the private parties. These consist of detailed \n     narration specifying numerous discrete acts. See \n     ``Impeachment of Judge Halsted L. Ritter,'' H. Res. 422, 74th \n     Cong., 2d Sess. (March 2, 1936) and ``Amendments to Articles \n     of Impeachment Against Halsted L. Ritter,'' H. Res. 471, 74th \n     Cong., 2d Sess.

It \n     provides: ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend \n     further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to \n     hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the \n     United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be \n     liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and \n     Punishment, according to Law.'' U.S. Const., Art. 3, cl. 7. \n     See also, United States v. Nixon, 506 U.S. 224, 234 (1993) \n     (``There are two additional reasons why the Judiciary, and \n     the Supreme Court in particular, were not chosen to have any \n     role in impeachments. First, the Framers recognized that most \n     likely there would be two sets of proceedings for individuals \n     who commit impeachable offenses--the impeachment trial and a \n     separate criminal trial. In fact, the Constitution explicitly \n     provides for two separate proceedings. . . . The Framers \n     deliberately separated the two forums to avoid raising the \n     specter of bias and to ensure independent judgments . . .'').\n       \\6\\ As but one example, if the pre-Federal bench conduct \n     consisted of treason, there could be no credible contention \n     that such conduct would not provide a basis for impeachment.\n       \\7\\ It should be noted that Judge Porteous has testified \n     and cross-examined witnesses at the Fifth Circuit Hearing on \n     the subject of his bankruptcy, and the House therefore \n     possesses evidence that was unavailable to the Department of \n     Justice.\n       \\8\\ As but one example, Article III of the Articles of \n     Impeachment against Judge Walter Nixon charged that he \n     concealed material facts from the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation and the Department of Justice by making six, \n     specified, false statements on April 18, 1984 at an \n     interview, and by making seven discrete false statements \n     under oath to the Grand Jury. ``Impeachment of Walter L. \n     Nixon, Jr.,'' H.
