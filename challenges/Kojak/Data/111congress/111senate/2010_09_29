BARRY C. BLACK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we get into the business of the day, \nI wish to take a minute, while the Chaplain of the Senate is here, \nAdmiral Black, to comment on really a remarkable afternoon. Ted \nStevens, who served in the Senate for many decades, was laid to rest \nyesterday at Arlington National Cemetery. It was strictly a military \nfuneral--caissons came down the hill, the casket was over the grave.\n  The only speaking at the event was from the Senate Chaplain. It was \nvery good, very spiritual. The setting was wonderful. It was a \nbeautiful fall day. There were hundreds of people there. The Chaplain, \nwith this booming voice he was given at birth, was able to do it \nwithout any amplification whatsoever. It was very nice.\n  The one thing that was stunning to everyone there was that the \nChaplain said, ``I am now going to recite,'' and he went through about \neight or nine passages in the Bible. He named which passages he was \ngoing to recite--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight--and \nthen proceeded to do it without a note, without anything. It was \nremarkable. It reminded me so much of Senator Byrd because he also had \nthat ability, the ability to remember. I am sure, for those of us \nthere, it looked so easy for the Chaplain to do that, but I am sure he \nprepared as he did as a young boy, learning these verses of Scripture \nfor his mother and grandmother.\n  While he is here on the floor, I wish to express my appreciation to \nhim. But the appreciation is from everyone who was there who is not \ncapable of doing that because they don't have the ability to speak. So \nI say to my friend the Chaplain, we appreciate your spiritual \nleadership of the Senate and your remarkable qualities as a person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7671-7", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am simply amazed that, when we are \nborrowing $4.2 billion a day from our grandkids--that is what we are \nborrowing, $4.2 billion a day--we are going to run a $1.4 trillion \ndeficit, and we have a unanimous consent request to move to things that \nspend more money, money we do not have that we are going to borrow from \nthe Chinese or Russians to be able to pay for it, and we are going to \nspend the money overseas. There is no question that we should try to \ndevelop consensus in our body, but the first consensus we should have \nis the priorities of the problems that are facing this country. The \nproblems that are facing this country are so big and so massive that \nour attention ought to be focused on those large problems, not on five \nseparate bills that have been proffered for special interest groups. I \ndon't understand the motivations. What I do understand is that the \nAmerican people get it, even if we do not.\n  The fact that we are going to make attempts for political purposes to \nput bills that are not paid for and that will add to the $4.2 billion a \nday that we borrow on the floor when our economy is languishing because \nwe continue to grow the Federal Government, continue to build \nregulations that affect and diminish the desire for people with capital \nto invest it in our economy--and we force people out of this country to \nbuild their plants and manufacturing facilities because of our \nregulations and tax codes, I do not understand.\n  My objections--I will not spend the time exactly outlining my \nobjections to all these bills, but my overall objection is the \npriorities we are setting in the Senate. We ought to be about creating \nconfidence so people will invest in this country rather than continuing \nto undermine that confidence with superfluous, well-meaning bills that \nare put up for political purposes instead of addressing the real \nproblems that are facing our country.\n  Out of a courtesy to Senator Reid and the agreement I just made with \nhim, I will not offer my unanimous consent request at this time, but I \nwill later today after he has had a chance to read them, on the \nfollowing five bills:\n  The Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act. Mr. President, 140,000 \nveterans in this country have lost their second amendment rights. It \nhas never been adjudicated that they were a danger to themselves or \nanybody else. Yet a bureaucrat somewhere has taken away their second \namendment rights. This bill has come out of committee twice. Senator \nBurr is the lead sponsor on it. We treat veterans as second-class \ncitizens when it comes to their second amendment rights. We ought to \npass that. I will ask that later.\n  The Firearms Fairness and Affordability Act. We make firearms \nmanufacturers pay their taxes every 2 weeks instead of quarterly like \nevery other manufacturer in this country. But we penalize them. We \nought to treat them the same as everybody else.\n  The earmark transparency bill gives one Web site so everybody in \nAmerica can see where the earmarks are, who offered them, what the \nbasis for them is, whether they were competitively bid. That is \nsomething America would like to see.\n  Then there are two tax cheat bills, for us as Members of Congress and \nour employees and then other Federal employees.\n  So I will not offer those unanimous consent requests at this time, \nbut I will later in the day. Again, there are important, big problems \nin front of this country. We need to be about addressing those rather \nthan special interest favors at this time.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.)

Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began \nnearly 9 years ago, 72 service members with New Mexico ties have lost \ntheir lives while defending our Nation and the freedoms we hold dear.\n  Seventy-two. They were brothers and fathers and husbands and sons and \nfriends. Each was irreplaceable to his family. Each had a different \nstory. Today, I rise to tell the story of one of those men.\n  U.S. Army PVT Charles High was 21 years old, a son of the city of \nAlbuquerque who attended Eldorado High School.\n  Known as ``Charlie'' to his friends, he played the viola in his high \nschool orchestra. He ran track. And he taught himself how to play \nguitar.\n  Charlie's dad says he always knew that his son would join the \nmilitary. He signed up for Junior ROTC when he was 14, and his dad said \nhe was hooked. He went on to join the Army in June of 2007 and was \nstationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky as part of the elite 101st \nAirborne Division.\n  His tour in Afghanistan was his second overseas. He served his first \ntour in 2008 in Iraq.\n  Charlie was killed last month when an IED detonated near his vehicle, \nwhich was patrolling in Afghanistan's Kunar Province.\n  He leaves behind his dad Charles, his mom Kimberlea Johnson of \nIllinois, his fiancee Maggie Jo Simmonds, four siblings, his \ngrandparents and great-grandmother, and dozens of other family members \nand friends.\n  A month before he was killed, Charlie had gone home to Albuquerque \nfor a visit with friends and family. Here is what his Dad said when \nasked about his son's death:\n\n       I would say he's a true American hero. He fought and died \n     for his country. He died doing what he wanted to do. I hate \n     to see him go so young, but he was quite a young man all the \n     way around. When he was home, we could see how much he had \n     grown.\n\n  Charlie's impact on all who knew him was evident in the messages of \ncondolence left for his family after his death.\n  ``He was a great friend and example,'' read one.\n  ``You never gave up and never surrendered,'' said another.\n  ``He gave his life for freedom.''\n  ``He is a hero to us all.''\n  Private High: you truly are a ``hero to us all.'' You are forever in \nour hearts, and we are forever in your debt.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to S.J. Res. 39.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 hours of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the resolution we are debating today is \nabout keeping a promise. The authors of the new health care law \npromised the American people that if they liked their current health \ninsurance, they could keep it. On at least 47 separate occasions, \nPresident Obama promised: ``If you like what you have, you can keep \nit.''\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration has broken that promise. \nEarlier this year, the administration published a regulation that will \nfundamentally change the health insurance plans of millions of \nAmericans. The reality of this new regulation is, if you like what you \nhave, you can't keep it. The new regulation implemented the \ngrandfathered health plan section of the new health care law. It \nspecified how existing health plans could avoid the most onerous new \nrules and redtape included in the 2,700 pages of the new health care \nlaw.\n  This provision was a critical part of the new law. It allowed \nsupporters to argue that current health insurance plans would be exempt \nfrom all of the rules and regulations created by the new law. Employers \nand health plans were told that the grandfathered protections would \nmean if you have coverage on the day the law passed, you could keep \nthat coverage without having to make any major changes.\n  Employers and employees thought the bill would have cost-cutting \nmeasures, but now they find only cost increases. The new law will \nprovide no relief to increasing costs until at least 2014. But this \nrule and its higher costs kick in now. Unfortunately, the regulation \nwriters at the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human \nServices broke all those promises. The regulation is crystal clear. \nMost businesses--the administration estimates between 39 and 69 \npercent--will not be able to keep the coverage they have.\n  Under the new regulation, once a business loses grandfathered status, \nthey will have to comply with all of the new mandates in the law. This \nmeans these businesses will have to change their current plans and \npurchase more expensive ones that meet all of the new Federal minimum \nrequirements. For the 80 percent of small businesses that will lose \ntheir grandfathered status because of this regulation, the net result \nis clear: They will pay more for their health insurance.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently reported costs as going up between 1 \nand 9 percent because of the mandates included in the new health care \nlaw. Couple this increase with inflation, and small businesses are \nlooking at a 20-percent cost increase. I actually know something about \nsmall business; I used to run one.\n  I ran a shoe store in Wyoming. I stocked the shelves, worked the \ncustomers to fit shoes, ran the cash register. I placed the orders with \nsuppliers. I did the accounting, I swept the sidewalk, I cleaned the \ntoilets. I knew what it was like to worry about making payroll at the \nend of the month. I know firsthand about the struggles and challenges \nAmerica's small businesses face. I understand what this regulation will \ndo to small businesses across the country. Small businesses are \nstruggling every day to find the resources to provide health insurance \nto their employees. Rather than making it easier for those businesses \nto continue to provide this coverage, the new regulation will mean that \nemployers will simply drop their health coverage altogether. That is \nwhy I am so concerned about this grandfathered health plan regulation, \nand that is why I introduced the resolution we are debating today.\n  My resolution would force the administration to actually keep their \npromises. The resolution would overturn this grandfathered health plan \nregulation and allow tens of thousands of businesses across the country \nto keep their current plans. If we pass the resolution, millions of \nAmericans will be spared from paying higher health care costs as a \nresult of new Federal mandates. If we pass the resolution, small \nbusinesses across the country will not have to drop health insurance \nfor their workers.\n  Congress created the Congressional Review Act we are using today \nspecifically to overturn Federal regulations such as the one we are \ndiscussing. The sponsors of the Review Act recognized that too often \nWashington bureaucrats impose sweeping new regulations with little \nthought to the impact these changes will have in the real world. In \nparticular, the Review Act was intended to protect small businesses \nacross the country that are often most vulnerable to new government \nmandates and regulations.\n  That is precisely what happened with the grandfathered health plan \nregulation. The regulation writers went above and beyond what the law \nsaid and came up with a whole slew of requirements businesses must \ncomply\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\nwith if they want to keep what they have. The regulation includes a \nlong list of things that will disqualify businesses from being able to \nkeep what they have. If a business does anything to try to keep costs \nunder control, they lose their grandfathered status.\n  Earlier this year, when the grandfathered regulation was first \npublished by the administration, I came to the Senate floor and warned \nof the negative impact this regulation would have on small businesses. \nThis new regulation appears to ignore the impact it will have in the \nreal world. It will drive up costs and reduce the number of people who \nhave insurance.\n  I recently heard from Jim, an insurance agent in Illinois, who wrote \nto me and said:\n\n       My experience in the last few months is--maintaining \n     grandfather status to my group plans is all but impossible. \n     All my clients' renewal rates in September and October are in \n     excess of thirty percent. To keep grandfather status, the \n     group is limited in deductible changes and contribution \n     levels. The only option is for the employer to accept the \n     premium increase at the worst economic time in forty years. \n     They can't afford to keep the grandfather status and soon \n     won't be able to afford insurance at all. In my opinion, the \n     legislative goal was to make maintaining grandfather status \n     so restrictive, companies are forced out. It's working.\n\n  I have a whole slew of similar stories and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave some of them printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n How the Grandfathered Health Plan Regulation Is Impacting Americans--\n        Real Life Stories From America's Health Insurance Agents\n\n       I recently helped a couple in their 50's who each had their \n     own individual policy. I signed them up with their policies \n     about a year ago and they gave me a call when their annual \n     rates increased the usual 15%. They wanted to look for \n     something more affordable even if it was a higher deductible \n     plan. They settled on a plan. I went to meet with them and \n     began to explain grandfathering and that if they do choose \n     the new plan, they will lose the chance to keep their \n     grandfathered status and either way will have to pay more. \n     They decided to stay with their ``grandfathered plan'' \n     because the benefits are ``better'' than what they would have \n     been if they went to a new plan where they would have more \n     out of pocket costs.\n       Really, either way, it's a lose-lose. At least if things \n     would've remained the same, the benefits would be better. \n     But, now we have to tell our clients and prospects that \n     prices are still going to go up, and benefits are still going \n     to go down, but just at a faster pace. It's been kicked into \n     high gear with ObamaCare. So, kudos to the people that are \n     making these drastic decisions. I'm glad I'm just the \n     messenger, because I wouldn't want to be responsible for \n     killing our healthcare.\n\n                                                  Tressa Girt,\n\n                                           Health Insurance Agent,\n     Milwaukie, OR.\n                                  ____\n\n       Several of the insurance companies doing business in Utah \n     have announced that they will not allow ``grandfathering'' \n     plans for groups under 50 lives because of the expense to \n     them to maintaining multiple plans on their books. This \n     basically leaves those who had coverage with these carriers \n     without any possibility of grandfathering and thus avoiding \n     the expense of new mandates.\n\n                                               Charles Cowley,\n\n                              Charles H. Cowley Employee Benefits,\n     Salt Lake City, UT.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am an agent in Lafayette, IN. My specialty is small group \n     health insurance. I work with many farmers and builders. \n     These are hardworking, honest Americans just trying to make a \n     decent living. Many of my clients struggle to make ends meet \n     and desperately want to continue providing health insurance \n     to their employees. With the healthcare reform, they are \n     extremely confused and disappointed when it comes to being \n     able to grandfather their plans. In particular, I insure a \n     local builder. He has ensured throughout the years that his \n     employees have good health coverage. He has absorbed many of \n     the renewal increases in the past few years. With the \n     downturn in new home sales, his business has struggled. His \n     group health plan renewed Sept 1, 2010. He received a 15% \n     increase. In years past, he was able to absorb the increase \n     and keep the health plan ``as is.'' Financially, this year, \n     that wasn't an option. He had to increase his deductible \n     amount or risk being unable to offer health insurance at all. \n     I explained that this small change would in fact cause his \n     group to lose their grandfathering status. He was upset and \n     concerned about the loss. He didn't want to make the change \n     but it was either that or offer no coverage at all. I believe \n     that a group should be able to retain their grandfathered \n     status when making changes in deductibles such as raising by \n     $500 or adjusting contribution levels. It is unrealistic to \n     believe a small group can absorb 15+% increases for the next \n     4 yrs to maintain their grandfathered status.\n                                  ____\n\n       My client is a 22-life group in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. \n     Currently with Aetna. They received a large increase which is \n     driving all my clients--not just them--out of a grandfathered \n     plan! They feel forced to get a new plan because they made \n     their current plan so expensive. Now, the new plans have much \n     higher deductibles, more out-of-pocket and the affordable \n     plans only offer to pay 50% coinsurance! The options are very \n     limited.\n                                               Jennifer L. Eisler.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Folks all over the country are just like Jim. Insurance \nagents are explaining to small businesses that they will be forced to \nchoose either to absorb premium increases in excess of 15 percent or \nlose their grandfathered health plan status. By the administration's \nown estimate, up to 80 percent of small businesses will lose the right \nto keep what they have. Lots of companies pay 90 percent of the cost of \ntheir employees' and families' insurance. They were hoping to be \ngrandfathered at least until 2014, to see exactly how damaging the \nwhole bill would be. But we are experiencing 2014 now, with no help in \ncost cutting.\n  The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council says it pretty \nsuccinctly. In a letter they wrote to me supporting S.J. Res. 39, they \nwrite:\n\n       Rather than helping small business owners and their \n     workforce keep their plans, it appears the rule has been \n     rigged to force most small businesses and their employers out \n     of grandfathered status.\n\n  The letter also reads:\n\n       The rule, as written, is in clear violation of President \n     Obama's promise that Americans would be able to keep the \n     health plans they currently have upon passage of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  As the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the National Retail Federation, and other business \ngroups supporting this resolution have said: This rule will make it \nharder for employers to make changes that will hold down their health \ncare costs. Large and small businesses will have few options for both \nkeeping costs in check and maintaining the grandfathered status.\n  If employers do almost anything to help slow the growth in their \nhealth insurance costs, they will lose the limited protections against \nthe expensive new mandates in the bill. It is worth noting that two \npages in the law that create the grandfathered plans give infinite \nleeway to the bureaucrats who are writing the rule, and they took it. \nThe law doesn't say anything about cost-sharing requirements or \ncoinsurance rates. The administration made up all of these provisions \nand requirements. They didn't have to write these rules in a way that \nprecludes half of Americans from keeping what they have.\n  Our economy is already struggling. It doesn't need more job killing. \nIt doesn't need cost increasing government mandates. We are hearing \nfrom small businesses across the country which are already being forced \nto swallow large premium increases that will prevent them from hiring \nmore workers. It is about the jobs. We need to create more jobs, not \nwrite more regulations that lead to less jobs. This bill was sold as \nletting people keep what they have. But the devil is in the details. Do \na little digging and it is clear; Americans would not be able to keep \nwhat they have.\n  The simple truth is, because this new rule will drastically tie the \nhands of employers, few employers are expected to be able to pursue \ngrandfathered status. I even have letters from people who have \nindividual situations, and they are concerned as well. That means more \nthan half of Americans who like what they have would not be able to \nkeep it.\n  The final result of the new regulation will be that all Americans \nwill eventually be forced to buy the kind of health insurance the \nFederal Government thinks they should have. Never mind they can't \nafford it. Never mind that employers will be less likely to hire new \nworkers and probably even lay off workers. Simply put, this rule \nstates: Washington knows best.\n  This new rule is pretty clear. If you like what you have, you can't \nkeep it.\n  Later today, the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on the \nresolution that will help small businesses actually keep what they \nhave. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and keep the \npromise that if Americans like the insurance they have, then they can \nkeep it. That should be the bare minimum until at least 2014, so \nbusinesses and employers can assess the\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\ndamage from all the regulations combined--and there is a pile of them \ncoming. Help is not in the bill until 2014, but the rule is for now. \nThe big question is, Why weren't the cost-cutting measures included in \nthe regulation?\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to S.J. Res. 39.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have 1 hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know the Senator from Montana wants to speak. If he \ncould just withhold for a few moments for my opening comment, and then \nI will yield to him.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened to the statement made by my \ngood friend--and he is my good friend--Senator Enzi from Wyoming. We \nare in the seventh month since the Affordable Care Act became law. Ever \nsince the day President Obama signed the bill into law, my friends on \nthe Republican side have made it clear they intend to use every \nconceivable opportunity they have to repeal it. This resolution, \nregrettably, is another attempt to make good on that pledge by undoing \nsome of the law's most critically important patient protections.\n  The resolution offered by Senator Enzi claims to protect small \nbusinesses by repealing the grandfather regulation, which defines which \ninsurance plans and businesses have to comply with certain consumer \nprotection provisions of the Affordable Care Act. However, if passed, \nthe businesses and Americans could be in the worst of all worlds, \nlosing the clear rules that allow them to keep the plans they have \nwhile not gaining additional consumer protections that apply when their \nplan changes.\n  I have a letter from the Main Street Alliance, which strongly opposes \nthis resolution. This is an alliance of small businesses. Let me read \nan excerpt from that letter. They say:\n\n       Opponents of the health law's insurance market reforms \n     continue to hide behind business arguments and claims about \n     increasing costs. But independent analyses show that all the \n     new protections in the law should contribute a mere one to \n     two percent increase to costs next year, a number easily \n     offset by provisions like the small business tax credits--\n\n  That we have given small businesses--\n\n     in the short term and savings from increased bargaining power \n     and investing in prevention in the longer term. Let's be \n     clear: those who seek to block implementation of the new \n     grandfather regulations are acting in the best interests of \n     the insurance industry, not Main Street small businesses.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Main Street Alliance,\n\n                                  Seattle, WA, September 28, 2010.\n     Re Small business opposition to S.J. Res. 39, attempting to \n         block implementation of health law's grandfathering \n         rules.\n\n       Honorable Senators: On behalf of the Main Street Alliance, \n     a national network of small business coalitions that brought \n     the voices of real small business owners to the national \n     dialogue over health reform, we write to urge your opposition \n     to S.J. Res. 39, filed in the Senate on September 21. This \n     resolution of disapproval would prevent the implementation of \n     the grandfathering regulations that are critical to fostering \n     an orderly transition to a reformed insurance market under \n     the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act.\n       Some of the health care law's new protections apply to all \n     health plans, regardless of grandfathered status, including \n     the prohibition of rescissions, ban on lifetime coverage \n     limits, and end to exclusion of children based on pre-\n     existing conditions. Still, other market reforms that are \n     impacted by the grandfather provision are among the new \n     protections most important to small businesses.\n       Small business owners want their health plans to cover \n     basic preventive care at no cost so they can maintain a \n     healthy workforce. We want an end to premium discrimination \n     based on our employees' health status. And we want stronger \n     review of premium increases and a meaningful third-party \n     appeals process to make sure we get a fair shake. What we \n     don't want is to be stuck indefinitely with plans that, \n     because of their grandfathered status, allow insurers to \n     continue ``business as usual'' without fulfilling new \n     protections or submitting their rate increases for meaningful \n     review--that would not be reform.\n       Opponents of the health law's insurance market reforms \n     continue to hide behind business arguments and claims about \n     increasing costs. But independent analyses show that all the \n     new protections in the law should contribute a mere one to \n     two percent increase to costs next year, a number easily \n     offset by provisions like the small business tax credits in \n     the short term and savings from increased bargaining power \n     and investing in prevention in the longer term.\n       Let's be clear: those who seek to block implementation of \n     the new grandfather regulations are acting in the best \n     interests of the insurance industry, not Main Street small \n     businesses.\n       Health reform needs to lower costs for small businesses. It \n     also needs to end the slide toward junk health insurance. The \n     regulations drafted by the Administration to implement the \n     grandfather provision create a reasonable transition to a \n     reformed insurance market. We urge your opposition to S.J. \n     Res. 39.\n       Sincerely, on behalf of the Main Street Alliance,\n     J. Kelly Conklin,\n       Foley-Waite Associates, Inc., Bloomfield, NJ.\n     Leanne Clarke,\n       Haleyanne Jewelry, Seattle, WA.\n     David Borris,\n       Hel's Kitchen Catering, Northbrook, IL.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. One of the things we put in the health care bill when we \ndesigned it was the protection for consumers to keep the plan they have \nif they like it; thus, the term ``grandfathered plans.'' If you have a \nplan you like--existing policies--you can keep them. Well, then we left \nit to the Department of Health and Human Services to craft regulations \nto define exactly what a grandfathered plan is.\n  On the one hand, you want to give some flexibility to plans to be \nable to make reasonable changes. For example, if costs go up, they can \nincrease their premiums somewhat. They can do certain things. But they \ncannot change the fundamental kind of nature of the plan and still call \nit a grandfathered plan. You want to protect consumers to make sure \nthat what plan they signed up for is the grandfathered plan and not \nsomething else.\n  For instance, if the regulations are overturned, which is what the \nSenator from Wyoming wants, insurance plans could change immensely. Yet \nthat is not what you signed up for; for example, the grandfathering \nrule that says the insurer cannot significantly cut your benefits. \nLet's say your insurer decides to cut from your plan conditions such as \ncancer or diabetes or heart disease. Let's say they cut that out of \nyour plan. Well, that plan would no longer be considered grandfathered \nbecause that is not what you signed up for.\n  The second one says they cannot raise your coinsurance charges. For \ninstance, if you are required to pay 20 percent of the cost for all \nhospital visits, your insurer cannot raise that to 50 percent because \nthat is not what you signed up for.\n  They cannot significantly raise copayments. If your plan is \ngrandfathered, you are protected from drastic increases in copays. \nCopays would be allowed to rise nominally each year, but if they \nchanged significantly, that is not what you signed up for.\n  Grandfathered plans cannot significantly raise deductibles. Let's say \nyour plan is grandfathered. You are protected from large increases to \nyour deductible. That keeps your insurance company from shifting more \ncost to you because that is not what you signed up for.\n  Grandfathered plans cannot significantly increase your premiums. \nWell, for example, if 20 percent of your insurance costs are currently \ndeducted from your paycheck, and your employer pays the other 80 \npercent, under the rule that cannot be changed by more than 5 \npercentage points a year. Well, what if a company came in and said: You \nwere paying 20 percent; now you have to pay 40 percent? If they did \nthat, that is not what you signed up for, so that should not be a \ngrandfathered plan.\n  Also, grandfathered plans cannot add or tighten an annual limit on \nbenefits. If your plan is grandfathered, your insurer cannot add a new \ncap on the amount they will pay for covered services each year. Why? \nBecause that is not what you signed up for.\n  Grandfathered plans cannot change insurance companies. If your plan \nis\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\ngrandfathered, you get to keep your plan. This means you will keep your \ninsurance company and with it your network of doctors. Because if that \nis changed on you, that is not what you signed up for.\n  So basically the rule my friend from Wyoming is seeking to overturn \nprotects you, the consumer. It protects you in keeping the plan you \nlike; we said, if you like a plan, you get to keep it, and you can \ngrandfather it in. What if they change the caps on certain annual \nlimits? What if they raise your copays? What if they raise your \ndeductibles? What if they sell out to another insurance company that \nhas a different kind of a policy? Why should that be grandfathered? \nBecause that is not what you signed up for.\n  We want to make sure if you signed up for a plan and you like that \nplan, it can be grandfathered. What cannot be grandfathered is \nsomething drastically different, which puts you at a disadvantage.\n  So it is clearcut on this issue before us: You either stand with \nconsumers and you stand with Main Street businesses--which I just read \na letter from, which recognizes that if they want grandfathered plans, \nthey also want to be protected, they want some certainty out there to \nknow what those plans are going to be; and that is what these rules \nprovide. On the other hand, if you vote to overrule this rule, you are \nobviously standing with the insurance companies one more time, letting \nthem continue what we closed the door on, some of these terrible abuses \nof cutting people off, putting caps on what you can get, changing your \npolicies midstream.\n  Well, the rule says: Yes, insurance company, you can do that, but you \nare no longer a grandfathered plan. That is exactly what this rule is \nabout, to protect consumers and to provide certainty out in the \nmarketplace for small businesses so they know what the grandfathered \nplans are and what they are not. Without this, if you do not have a \nrule, who knows what a grandfathered plan is. It is up in the air.\n  So with that, I yield 15 minutes to my friend from Montana who did \nsuch a great job as chairman of the Finance Committee in shepherding \nthe health care reform bill through. He is one of our great experts in \nthis area, and I know he feels strongly about these grandfathered plans \ntoo. So I yield 15 minutes to my friend from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa, the chairman \nof the HELP Committee, for his excellent service.\n  A weather vane shows when the wind is blowing and in what direction \nit is blowing and a resolution such as this shows when it is election \nseason.\n  This resolution is a political stunt. It is an election-season effort \nto take potshots at the new health care reform law. Before the Senate \nnow is a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review \nAct of 1996. Colleagues will recall that the Congressional Review Act \nis part of what some folks called the Contract with America.\n  This particular resolution would nullify a regulation that is \nessential to implementing the new health reform law. The resolution is, \nthus, a transparent effort to undermine the new law. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the resolution.\n  From the beginning, the new health care reform law has been about \nending the worst insurance company abuses. That is why the new law \nrequires insurance companies to end lifetime limits on coverage. That \nis why the new law prevents insurance companies from canceling coverage \nwhen you get sick. That is why the new law requires insurance companies \nto allow parents to put their children up to age 26 on their insurance \npolicy, and that is why the new law prevents most insurance companies \nfrom discriminating against kids with preexisting conditions.\n  These important new protections took effect just last week. From the \nbeginning, the law has been about preserving what is good about \nAmerican health care. That is why one of the central promises of health \ncare reform has been and is: If you like what you have, you can keep \nit. That is critically important. If a person has a plan, and he or she \nlikes it, he or she can keep it.\n  Now some on the other side of the aisle have tried to pick apart that \npromise. They have tried to find some rare example to the contrary. But \ndespite what some folks might say, we stuck to that promise. If you \nlike your health care plan, you can pretty much keep it.\n  Then the question becomes: How can we be sure that what you have is \nstill the same health care plan? What changes can the insurance plan \nmake and still remain the same plan? That is what this new regulation \nis all about.\n  The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury \npromulgated this regulation on June 17. The regulation defines what \nchanges an existing health care plan can and cannot make in order to \nretain what is called the ``grandfathered'' status.\n  The new health care reform law gives grandfathered plans special \ntreatment. This treatment ensures that satisfied consumers can continue \nto get their current health care plans, and this treatment ensures that \ndissatisfied consumers can get access to a fairer marketplace.\n  Plans with grandfathered status get more time to incorporate some of \nthe consumer protections guaranteed in the new health care reform law. \nGrandfathered status is valuable to the health insurance plans. In some \ncases, it exempts plans from having to make particular changes until \nthe year 2014.\n  Some fundamental consumer protections, however, are so important that \nall plans have to comply with them right away. Many of those \nprotections are the ones that became effective just last week. The new \nregulation strikes a careful balance. It protects consumers from some \nof the insurance companies' most egregious abuses. At the same time, it \nrecognizes the realities of what insurers are able to do. That balance \nis important to maximizing consumer choice, and that balance is \nimportant to minimizing insurance market disruption.\n  The new regulation spells out coverage changes that would cause \ninsurance plans to lose this special grandfathered status. For example, \nplans cannot significantly reduce benefits and still retain their \ngrandfathered status. It makes perfect sense to require plans to \nmaintain their benefits as a condition of their preferred status. After \nall, if a plan significantly reduces its benefits, it is not the same \nplan anymore. If a plan significantly reduces its benefits, the plan is \nnot truly letting you keep what you have.\n  Another example under the new regulation is that plans cannot \nsignificantly increase cost sharing and retain their grandfathered \nstatus. In other words, plans cannot significantly increase \ndeductibles, copays or coinsurance that are more than nominal.\n  Once again, the new regulation is only fair because plans should not \nbe increasing the financial burden on consumers and still qualify for \nthis special status. If a plan significantly increases the financial \nburden on consumers, it is not the same plan. If a plan significantly \nincreases the financial burden on consumers, the plan is not letting \nyou keep what you have.\n\n  A third example under the regulation is that plans cannot add new or \nmore restrictive limits on coverage and remain grandfathered. This, \ntoo, makes sense, because imposing or lowering annual limits has the \nsame effect as reducing benefits, and that is not something for which \nplans should be rewarded.\n  Once again, if a plan adds new or more restrictive annual limits on \ncoverage, it is not the same plan and the plan is not letting you keep \nwhat you have. These examples demonstrate how reasonable the new rules \nfor grandfathered status are. Plans basically have to offer the same \ncoverage. They have to offer the same cost sharing and annual limits as \nthey do today.\n  The resolution before us would allow health insurance plans to leave \nthe path to full compliance with new, commonsense consumer protections. \nThe resolution would leave consumers relying on the kindness of the \ninsurance industry, and we have seen how well that works. That is the \neffect of the resolution before us.\n  The resolution before us would strike down disincentives for plans to \ncut benefits, increase consumers' out-of-pocket costs, or reduce how \nmuch health care a consumer may use in a year. The resolution before us \nwould\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\nthus free the health insurance companies to cut benefits, to increase \nout-of-pocket costs, and to reduce annual limits.\n  The new health care reform law aims to eradicate these abusive \npractices, and the grandfathering regulation ensures a successful \ntransition to a fully reformed insurance market.\n  The new health reform law puts consumers and their doctors--not \ninsurance companies--in charge of their health care.\n  This resolution would put consumers at risk. It would put consumers \nat risk of paying more and getting less. This resolution is the exact \nopposite of health care reform.\n  This resolution is a political stunt. It is about repealing health \ncare reform in an election season. This resolution is an attempt by the \nother side to dismantle the new health care reform law piece by piece. \nThis time, they are sending a message to their friends in the insurance \nindustry. This resolution invites the insurance companies to continue \nto put profits before patients. So I ask: What is next?\n  The other side says they want to repeal and replace the new health \ncare law, but we saw what happened before health care reform. Before \nhealth care reform, insurance companies could discriminate against kids \nwith a preexisting health condition. Before health care reform, health \ninsurance companies did not have to let adults under 26 stay part of \ntheir parents' health insurance plans. Before health care reform, \nhealth insurance companies could kick people off their rolls when they \nwere sick and needed coverage the most. That is what the law was before \nthe new health care reform law. Is that what the other side wants to go \nback to?\n  The bottom line is this resolution would take away consumer \nprotections that the new health care reform law guarantees.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the proposition that insurance \ncompanies know best. They don't know best. I urge my colleagues to \nmaintain the commonsense consumer protections that have just come into \neffect, and I urge my colleagues to reject this election season \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by both of the \nleaders on health care from the other side, but you can't have your own \nfacts. You can't show significant changes as being the only thing that \neliminates grandfathering.\n  If you look at the Federal Register, page 34,568, the last few \nparagraphs say: Any increase in a percentage cost-sharing requirement \ncauses a group health plan or health insurance to cease to be a \ngrandfathered health plan.\n  Another part says: Any increase in a fixed-amount, cost-sharing \nrequirement other than a copayment--any increase in a fixed amount \ncopayment. It doesn't say significant changes, it says any change.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, \nSenator Barrasso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President. As my colleagues know, I have \ncome to the floor week after week after this bill was signed into law \nwith a doctor's second opinion based on my nearly quarter of a century \npractice in Wyoming, taking care of families there. I go home every \nweekend and talk to people.\n  The people of Wyoming remember when the President of the United \nStates spoke to a joint session of Congress and he told the American \npeople about the plan that was later signed into law. During that \nspeech the President said:\n\n       . . . if you are among the hundreds of millions of \n     Americans who already have health insurance through your job, \n     or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan \n     will require you or your employer to change the coverage or \n     the doctor you have.\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.\n\n  I think I heard the chairman of the Finance Committee say that if you \nlike your plan, you can pretty much keep it. That is not what the \nPresident said. Pretty much keep it? With those words, the President--\nand congressional Democrats--made a vow to 170 million people who get \nhealth coverage through their employer. The President and congressional \nDemocrats promised that if you like what you have, then the health care \nlaw would let you keep it. What a difference a year makes.\n  On June 14 of this year, the Obama administration released a 121-page \n``grandfathered health plan'' rule. It is a rule that clearly \nviolates--clearly violates--the President's promise.\n  Let me explain how. ObamaCare included a provision allowing existing \ninsurance plans to be ``grandfathered'' under the new law. \nTheoretically, that means that employers and individuals would not have \nto give up the coverage they have and they like to comply with onerous \ngovernment rules and mandates.\n  So you have to make sure, though, that you read the fine print. Look \nat the chart. The chart in the new administration rules estimates \nbetween 39 and 69 percent of businesses will lose their grandfathered \nhealth plan status.\n  The picture is even worse for small businesses in America, and it is \nsmall businesses that are the engines that drive this economy. The same \nchart in this report estimates that by the year 2013, up to 80 \npercent--80 percent--of small businesses will lose their grandfathered \nstatus. This means American businesses will not be able to keep their \ncurrent insurance plans. That is what this means. They will be required \nby the Federal Government to comply with all the new mandates which are \nvery expensive and are contained in the new health care law. This only \nserves to drive employer health care costs up, making it even more \ndifficult for them to offer health insurance to their workers.\n  I am sorry. Maybe the American people are confused. The American \npeople believed the goal of reform was to lower health care costs. \nAmerica's small businesses struggle each and every day to find a way to \nprovide health insurance to their employees. The government should be \nmaking it easier for businesses to keep providing the coverage. \nInstead, this bureaucratic regulation drives prices up. This is going \nto increase the odds that employers are going to simply choose to stop \noffering health care insurance coverage completely.\n  Additionally, this so-called grandfather regulation makes it much \nharder for employers to make health insurance changes that would \nactually help to keep down the cost of care, to keep down the cost of \ncoverage. Today, businesses have very few options if they want to keep \ncosts in check, as well as keep their grandfathered status. Businesses \nthat lose their grandfathered status are then forced to comply with all \nthe new rules, all the mandates in the health care law, and now, even \nby the White House's own admission, we are talking about up to 80 \npercent of the small businesses in this country.\n  Subjecting employers to these mandates forces them to change and to \nexpand their insurance plans. What does that mean? Well, it means costs \nare going to go up. No surprise. It is obvious this administration \ndoesn't want the American people to be able to keep what they have if \nthey like it. The law wasn't written that way, and certainly the \nregulations were written in a way that violates--and this is the White \nHouse--the White House regulations were written in a way that violates \nthe pledge the President made to the American people.\n  President Obama and congressional Democrats certainly like using \ntheir talking points, but the American people know it is just spin. \nThat is why this bill was unpopular when it was signed into law and \nnow, 6 months later, it is even more unpopular, with 61 percent of the \nAmerican people wanting this bill and this law repealed and replaced.\n  That is why I come to the floor today to support the efforts of my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Wyoming, the ranking member of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, who has introduced \nSenate Joint Resolution 39, a resolution of disapproval that would \noverturn the administration's so-called grandfather rule. It is an \nhonor to stand with Senator Enzi and fight against this job-killing \nWashington mandate. I appreciate his leadership but, more importantly, \nhis dedication to make sure the President\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\nkeeps his promise--a promise that if you like the health insurance you \nhad before the new health care law was passed, then you can actually \nkeep it.\n  That is my second opinion. That is why we need to repeal and replace \nthis health care law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to proceed under my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, I had an opportunity to hear the \nremarks of Dr. Barrasso, the Senator from Wyoming, about health care, \nand I wish to thank him for the ongoing contribution he has made in \nthis very important debate. This is an issue that is not over and we \nwill keep on revisiting the flaws in the coming years. So I thank the \nSenator from Wyoming for his important contribution.\n  I also thank the other Senator from Wyoming who is sitting to my \nleft, who is the author of this measure we will be voting on--a \nnecessary step. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his important \ncontribution as well.\n\n\n                           Voices Grow Louder\n\n  Mr. President, for the past year and a half, Americans have witnessed \nsomething truly remarkable here in Washington. They have watched a \ngoverning party that was more or less completely uninterested in what \nthe governed had to say about the direction of the country. In a nation \nwhere the government's power is derived from the consent of the \ngoverned, that is a pretty risky governing philosophy. That is why the \nvoices of the American people have grown louder and louder.\n  Republicans have listened to those voices. We heard the concerns \nAmericans had with the stimulus bill that was based on the discredited \npremise that having bureaucrats and Democratic lawmakers spend $1 \ntrillion on their favorite programs would revive the economy, and we \nopposed it. We heard the concerns Americans had about a health spending \nbill that was built on the discredited premise that spending more money \nand growing the Federal bureaucracy would make health care less \nexpensive, and we opposed it. We heard the concerns Americans had about \na financial regulatory bill that was built on the discredited premise \nthat hiring more of the same kind of bureaucrats who missed the last \ncrisis was a good formula for preventing the next one, and we opposed \nit.\n  Again and again, Democrats were faced with a problem, and their \nsolution was to ram through some costly, big government solution \nAmericans did not want, but that they are now expected to pay for. And \nthey are still not finished.\n  In order to fund even more programs, more government, our friends on \nthe other side now want to raise taxes. Nearly 15 million Americans are \nlooking for work and can't find it. Another 11 million are \nunderemployed, meaning they have settled for part-time work instead of \na full-time job. Household income is down for the second year in a row, \nand Democrats want to take more money out of people's pockets.\n  Just yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said \nthese tax hikes will hurt the economy and slow the recovery. So what \ndid we do here over the past week in the Senate? An ill-conceived bill \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee said would put U.S. companies at \na competitive disadvantage, and a campaign finance bill, the entire \ngoal of which was to give Democrats an electoral advantage in the \nupcoming elections by muzzling their opponents.\n  If Americans need any further proof that Democrats haven't been \nlistening to them, this past week has provided all the evidence they \nneed. Americans want us to focus on jobs, and our friends on the other \nside focused on preserving their own jobs and spending more taxpayer \ndollars.\n  It has to stop.\n  That is why earlier this month I proposed a bill that would prevent a \nmassive tax hike from going into effect on anyone at the end of the \nyear, and that is why Republicans put forward an appropriations cap \nthat would cut $300 billion from the President's budget, even as our \nfriends on the other side neglected to bring a single appropriations \nbill to the floor.\n  Sometime today or tomorrow, we will be leaving Washington to head \nback to our States and when we do, Democrats will have a lot of \nexplaining to do about how they have spent their time here in the last \nyear and a half. As for Republicans, we will be able to say we \nlistened.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Larry Cox\n\n  Mr. President, in the reception area of my office in the Russell \nBuilding, there is a framed copy of a page from my hometown newspaper \nhanging on the wall. It is from section B, the front page, and the date \nreads January 21, 1985, just days after I was first sworn in as \nKentucky's newest Senator.\n  There is a picture of me sitting in my new Senate office, talking on \nthe phone, with quite the head of dark hair. Behind me you can see a \nman in a sport coat lifting some boxes. And he looks like he can lift \nthem quite easily, too. The caption under that photo reads:\n  ``McConnell made a few telephone calls while aide Larry Cox moved \nboxes in on the first day.''\n  The first day.\n  Now, in too many ways, it feels like an era has reached its final \ndays. Because after more than 25 years of Senate service, and nearly 30 \nyears of setting his own ego aside to help me and my career, on \nSeptember 2 of this year, Larry Cox retired.\n  No other single person worked as hard or did as much for Team \nMcConnell as Larry has. And because Larry was there from the \nbeginning--when on any given day, he could serve as driver, security \ndetail, advance man, political operative, caseworker, legislative \nadvisor, and my eyes and ears all at once--no other single person \nprobably ever will.\n  We have heard the phrase ``jack of all trades,'' but Larry is a \nmaster of all trades--not only because of the many roles he filled in \nmy office, but for the fullness of his life outside the office as well.\n  As the State director in my office beginning in 1985, Larry was my \nchief representative in Kentucky. He oversaw an 18-member field staff, \nspread out amongst six offices in the State, and led my efforts in \nconstituent casework, project development, and outreach.\n  Beyond that, however, Larry was the picture of the perfect Senate \nstaffer. Content to stay in the background, for years he happily worked \nwithout seeking credit. He is a man of fairly strong opinions, and was \nsomewhat our resident keeper of the ideological flame--but he would \nnever force his opinion on you if you didn't ask for it.\n  Most of all, for the hundreds of staffers that have been through my \noffices, he served as a role model, an example of good character, and a \ntrue friend.\n  Larry and I have more in common than just our Senate service. We were \nboth born in Alabama, just a year apart, and after a little traveling, \nwe both ended up about as Bluegrass as one can get. Additionally, both \nLarry's father and mine served in World War II.\n  After the war, Larry's father, Lawrence E. Cox, Jr., worked for Gulf \nOil, and that job took him and his family all across the southern \nUnited States. Larry spent time growing up in Louisiana, Arkansas, and \nTennessee.\n  He attended George Peabody College of Vanderbilt University, and \nearned his master's at the University of Tennessee. A city planner by \ntrade, he finally moved home--that is to say, to Louisville--in 1972.\n  My friendship with Larry began in 1981, when Larry began working for \ncounty government as the deputy secretary for community development. I \nwas the county judge/executive, and I successfully lured Larry away \nfrom his old job. By 1984, he was with me as I made by first run for \nthe Senate.\n  I can't talk much longer about Larry without mentioning his lovely \nwife Joanie. Larry came to start working for me just 3 months after he \nand Joanie got married. It is lucky for me it wasn't 3 months before. \nJoanie didn't know just how much I would take her husband away from her \nover the years.\n  Elaine and I have to thank Joanie for sharing Larry with us, because \nas we all know, sometimes Larry's work obligations have gotten the \nlion's share.\n  Sometimes Larry served as a one-man security detail. It was like \nbeing staffed by Clint Eastwood. You could call him ``Dirty Larry,'' \nand he was\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\njust waiting for someone to make his day.\n  Larry is not a guy you want to make mad, even though those of us who \nknow him know that under that tough exterior is a very kind and caring \nman. I am probably going to get in trouble with him for saying that out \nloud.\n  In the old days, Larry and I crisscrossed every county in the State, \nin a car that Larry faithfully had service every 3,000 miles. Every \nevent, he had planned precisely down to the minute. Executing Larry's \nplans was like executing a military maneuver.\n  This was also when I first learned about Larry's honest-to-gosh \nsuperpower. He is a walking, talking human GPS. Ask him how to get \nanywhere, and he can give you landmarks, travel time, distance and \ncardinal direction.\n  Naturally, a fellow like that became one of my very first Senate \nstaffers after we were victorious in the 1984 election. And he was the \nperfect choice to be my State director.\n  In that job, he has been to every town parade and county festival. I \nbelieve he could name the sitting judge/executive in all 120 Kentucky \ncounties, or tell you which counties towns like Eighty Eight or Grab \nare in. Since 1985, there have been 14 commanding generals at the Fort \nKnox Armor Center, and he has known and worked with every one of them.\n  And in the hundreds of thousands of hours I have spent with Larry, if \nhe ever had a bad day, he did it pretty well.\n  Maybe that is because Larry never got bored. I have already described \nhow he did everything in my office, no job too big or too small. And \nthe rich and complete life he leads has given him plenty else to do as \nwell.\n  Larry knows a lot about a lot of things. If you are on the road with \nhim, and you point out a nice looking Corvette, he will be able to tell \nyou it's a ZR1 with 638 horsepower and over 600 pounds of torque that \ncan pull one `G' in a turn and goes zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds.\n  Larry once stopped me from boarding a plan because he could smell \nthat it had been filled with the wrong kind of fuel. Despite the so-\ncalled experts telling him otherwise, he insisted they double check. \nTurned out he was right. Larry's nose saved some lives that day.\n  Larry's favored method of transportation, however, is not by air, but \nby land--specifically, by motorcycle. You can catch him driving across \nKentucky on his Suzuki Bandit 1250, and he is usually with friends. In \nfact, Larry's got so many friends in the biker community that I have \nbenefited from having a fleet of motorcycles roll in to many of my \nevents. Larry's also a strong supporter of the second amendment. He \nbelieves in gun control--gun control being a firm hand and a steady \ngrip.\n  I don't know how many guns Larry has, he may not even know, but I \nbelieve the number is somewhere north of 50. Years ago, Larry used to \nshoot skeet competitively.\n  You could even say Larry is one of those ``bitter'' people, the type \nwho clings to his guns and his religion. He is a devout Christian who \nhas been attending St. Matthew's United Methodist Church in Louisville \nsince 1978.\n  He has faithfully volunteered countless hours over the years, \nincluding time spent at Susannah House, a daycare center run by the \nchurch. He has held every church leadership position, including serving \non the board of trustees.\n  In what is becoming a recurring theme for Larry, he is always willing \nto do whatever is asked, and whatever it takes. On top of his church, \nhe gives his time generously to the Kiwanis, and to the State \nRepublican Party.\n  Larry is a great lover of the outdoors. He and Joanie have a farm in \nHart County, KY, that is just shy of 100 acres. Now that Larry is \nleaving us I know he will be spending a lot more time there.\n  Larry generously opens up his farm to the McConnell Scholars, \nstudents at the University of Louisville who are part of a scholarship \nprogram for kids that I helped establish in 1991. He has held retreats \nfor them there, mentored the students, and helped bring in speakers for \nother McConnell Center events. His contribution is so great that Dr. \nGary Gregg, the center's director, puts it this way: ``Simply put . . . \nwe would be impoverished without Larry.''\n  Dr. Gregg has a 15-year-old son, and Larry has helped encourage his \ninterest in deer hunting, by letting him use his farm and his fields \nand educating him about shooting and gun safety. Whenever he has a \nchance to share his love of nature and the outdoors, Larry shines.\n  Anyone who thinks Republicans can't be conservationists, I want them \nto meet Larry and go visit his farm. The Green River runs through it, \nand Larry participates in the CREP program--a Kentucky conservationist \neffort to preserve and protect the river.\n  A third of the farm is planted with warm-season native grasses, to \nprevent soil erosion into the river and enhance the local wildlife. A \nthird of the property is in timber, and a third in hayfields. You may \nhave noticed what's missing on this farm--Larry has to abide by \nJoanie's rule, ``No crops, no critters.''\n  Larry is so well known throughout the State for his conservation \nefforts, he was honored this year as the Kentucky Association of \nConservation Districts Person of the Year. He is also the first person \nto receive the Award for Distinguished Service from the Natural \nResources Conservation Service.\n  My wife Elaine is also close to Larry and Joanie, and I know she is \ngoing to miss them a lot. Larry was one of the first Kentuckians she \nmet when she came to the State, and he was so knowledgeable and \nfriendly he made her feel just at home. She liked going to Larry and \nJoanie's home, where she knew she would always find good food and good \ncompany.\n  During my 1996 campaign, Elaine's sister Angela came to Louisville to \nvolunteer, and Larry and Joanie generously put her up in their home. \nThey have done that many times for other volunteers and staffers \nthrough the years. The McConnell Team has always been grateful to stay \nat their home.\n  I have wondered often over the years how a man as unique and special \nas Larry Cox came to be, and how I was lucky enough to find him.\n  To the second question, I can only credit providence. But the first \nquestion, that I can take a stab at answering.\n  I know Larry learned a lot about living from his mother. So did I. So \ndid everyone lucky to know her. Beryl O. Cox was a spirited, \nadventuresome woman--in other words, she was a lot like Larry.\n  She raised three boys, and she was like one of the boys. She knew her \npriorities: She loved her family, her church, her motorcycles, and her \nbourbon--not necessarily in that order.\n  She and Larry would go riding together. She had her own motorcycle, a \nHonda Valkyrie. She didn't drive it--Larry would drive, and she would \nsit on the back.\n  Beryl was a delightful woman--``a real kick,'' according to Joanie. \nAnd may I say she was a close friend of mine as well. I remember how \nmuch she volunteered on many of my campaigns.\n  She was about the same age as my own mother. She lived a full and \nrobust life, until her passing at the age of 95 in 2007.\n  A full and robust life, well lived. Larry obviously learned that from \nhis mother as well. And just like her, he has made countless friends \nalong the way.\n  Those friends will get to see a lot more of Larry now. So will his \nfamily. Whether it is time spent on the farm or on the back seat of his \nmotorcycle, if it is time spent with Larry, I am sure they are \ngrateful.\n  The Cox family includes Larry's wife Joanie; his daughter and son-in-\nlaw Lisa C. and Steve Pieragowski; his son and daughter-in-law J. \nRandall and Kristen A. Cox; his grandchildren Alexa Brooke Pieragowski, \nErin Phoebe Pieragowski, Hayden Lawrence Cox, and Hadley Marie Cox; his \nbrother and sister-in-law Alvin J. and Cammie Cox; his brother and \nsister-in-law Davis S. and Lynn C. Cox; his nieces and nephews \nChristopher L. Cox, Carter Cox, Lindsay F. Cox, and Stephen Cox; and \nmany more beloved friends and family members.\n  Larry, your family's gain will certainly be our loss. It is a loss \nfor my office, and a loss for the entire State of Kentucky that you \nhave faithfully served for so many years.\n  As for me, I am going to miss my old friend.\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\n  After 30 years, there is too much to be said, so I simply say, thank \nyou, Larry. For your dedication, your service, and your friendship, I \ndon't think you can ever be thanked enough.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from \nConnecticut, I listened to my friend from Wyoming before the minority \nleader spoke. He was reading from the Federal Register, if I am not \nmistaken, saying that any change--and he kept repeating ``any change,'' \n``any change,'' any increase because we have been talking about there \nhad to be significant increases and changes. My friend from Wyoming was \nreading from the Federal Register and said ``any increase.''\n  After reading through this, it reminds me of an example I have often \nused about not taking things out of context. It comes from Psalm 14 in \nthe Bible. There is a sentence in the Bible that says, ``There is no \nGod.'' I say to a lot of people, it cannot be true. Yes, there is a \nsentence in Psalm 14. It is right there. The problem is the sentence \nbefore that says: ``The fool in his heart says there is no God.'' You \ncan take things out of context. I started reading this and saw how this \nwas taken out of context.\n  First of all, my friend from Wyoming said ``any increase in fixed \namount cost sharing requirement.'' But, it says--he did not read on--\n``if the total percentage increase exceeds the maximum percentage \nincrease,'' as defined in another paragraph over here, which is \nbasically expressed as a percentage of inflation plus 15 points. So it \nis not any increase, it is any increase based on whether it is \ninflation plus 15 points.\n  Then my friend said: ``Any increase in fixed amount copayment.'' But \nyou have to read on because it says ``determined as of the effective \ndate if the total increase in the copayment exceeds the greater of an \namount equal to $5 or the maximum percentage increase,'' as I mentioned \nbefore, which is medical inflation plus 15 percentage points.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this chart to \nshow that it is not any changes, as my friend was saying.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         CHANGES THAT DISQUALIFY PLANS FROM GRANDFATHERED STATUS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Plan Element                     Disqualifying Change*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopayment.................................

Exceptions may apply to plans that had already\n  filed pending changes at the time that health reform was enacted.\n**If a plan had a lifetime limit but no annual limit on March 23, 2010,\n  it may replace its lifetime limit with an annual limit while\n  maintaining its grandfathered status, as long as annual limit has a\n  dollar value that is equal to or greater than the previous lifetime\n  limit.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, you have to read the whole paragraph. \nThere is one where there is any change at all would disqualify a \ngrandfather plan, and that is any increase in the percentage cost \nsharing. You can understand that. If you have a percentage cost \nsharing, let's say it is 20 percent, if the cost of the plan goes up, \nmedical inflation goes up, then your total cost will go up because 20 \npercent of $100 is $20; 20 percent of $120 is $24. Your out-of-pocket \nwill go up.\n  The only thing that would deny a plan from being grandfathered is if \nthey changed the percentage of your copay. But if they have a fixed \namount of copay, say $20, they can go above that by the maximum \npercentage increase of inflation plus 15 points.\n  I wanted to try to clear that up, that there is only one case in \nwhich any change at all denies grandfathering, and that is if, in fact, \nthe plan changes your percentage of what you have to pay in. I wanted \nto make that clear.\n  Now I yield to my good friend, Senator Dodd, who was the leader on \nour committee in getting the Affordable Care Act through and who knows \nthe importance of making sure we keep these protections, not only for \nconsumers but for small businesses.\n  I yield whatever time he wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to my friend and \ncolleague from Iowa and his terrific work. He, along with so many \nothers, brought us to the point that has defied administrations and \nCongresses for more than half a century. Together, we were finally able \nto expand access, try to stabilize costs, and increase the quality of \nhealth care. It is no easy task. These efforts, obviously, consumed a \ngreat amount of this Congress's time and attention.\n  Despite the rigid opposition of those opposed to these changes, \nwithout an alternative ever being offered, for the first time the \nAmerican people can look forward in the years to come to having \nincreased access to health care, improved quality, in my view, but also \nstabilizing costs. Without these changes, we would put our great \neconomy in this country at significant risk, beyond the other problems \nwe are grappling with today.\n  I say respectfully--because my friend from Wyoming knows he and I \nhave worked together on many issues over my tenure and his--it is with \na deep sense of respect for him that I rise today in opposition to what \nhis resolution would attempt to achieve and to associate myself with \nthe remarks of Senator Harkin, Senator Baucus, and others who worked \nday to day, along with their staffs, to achieve this health care reform \npackage.\n  We are told health reform is not popular. I listened to one of my \ncolleagues give a presentation that this is not terribly popular in the \npolls, as if somehow that is going to determine whether what we are \ndoing is right or wrong.\n  I recall 1948, the Marshall Plan. If popularity in the polls had been \nthe deciding factor as to whether we passed the Marshall Plan, it would \nhave failed miserably. About 17 percent of Americans thought we should \nrebuild Europe. The Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act--I can \nguarantee to this day there were those who said this was not a terribly \npopular idea. I am not sure how it would fare in certain quarters. I do \nnot think anybody in this Chamber would disagree we are a better \ncountry today because of what we did in the Marshall Plan, what we did \nwith the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, and others.\n  I think it is disturbing that we ought to determine the outcome of \ntrying to make America achieve its great potential by the results of \npolling data. I know that has become the standard some people use. It \nought not be the standard by which the Senate determines its course of \naction.\n  Health reform is the culmination of more than a half century--in \nfact, arguably going back to Teddy Roosevelt's day, almost a century \nago--a struggle by Democrats, Republicans, and Congresses to try and \nget to a point where we can get our arms around this very important \nissue. At long last, we set ourselves on a course to manage this issue.\n  At the center of that struggle was the question: Who would control a \nperson's health care? On this issue there seems to be unanimity. I \nthink all of us would like individuals and their health care providers \nto be in control when it comes to deciding what a person's health care \ncoverage would be, and not the insurance industry that has a history of \nabusing those who fall ill and need coverage.\n  Just 6 months ago, we answered this question definitively. Americans \nshould be able to control their own health care, and the insurance \nindustry should not. This resolution before us today would take us \nbackwards once again on that fundamental, underlying question at the \nheart of the long debate that consumed this Congress: Who would control \nwhether a person had good health care, the insurance industry or the \nindividual, their family, and their providers?\n  The law we passed phases in many new protections over several years \nprotecting Americans' rights while ensuring stability of the health \ncare system.\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\nJust last Thursday on the 6-month anniversary of the passage of the \nhealth care reform bill, many consumer protections came into effect \nmaking up what we call the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  This Patients' Bill of Rights, which my colleagues and I fought so \nvery hard to include in our final bill, provides that sense of security \nto people across the Nation and in each of our respective States by \nprohibiting the worst of the insurance companies' abuses and practices. \nThese abuses went on year in and year out, disadvantaging average \ncitizens in our country. As a result of that bill of rights we adopted \nin our health care reform bill and as a result of last Thursday, the \nfollowing rights became the law of this land:\n  All insurance plans must end lifetime limits on coverage. How long \nhave we heard that debate and how important is it today that protection \nexists?\n  All insurance plans must stop canceling coverage when you get sick. \nHow many of my colleagues at townhall meetings heard the frustrations \nexpressed by our constituents that just when they needed the coverage \nthe most, they would be dropped by the insurance industry?\n  And, today, parents who have adult children but under the age of 26 \nknow they can carry those kids on their plan. How many families, \nbecause of the economy we are in with high unemployment, particularly \namong younger people, go through sleepless nights worrying about their \nchildren who have been dropped from their plans, knowing they are \nstruggling to get on their feet? The law today protects those families \nand those young adults.\n  New insurance plans must offer additional benefits and protections to \nconsumers under our bill such as preventive services--which Senator \nHarkin championed day in and day out to be included as part of this \nbill--covered with no cost sharing, an increased choice of providers, \nand no prior authorization requirement for emergency care. Those \nprotections benefit millions of people across this country.\n  If they knew what was at stake with this kind of a resolution, which \ncan throw these back and change these plans in such a way, I suspect \nthose using polling numbers to identify a reason for being for this \nresolution or against the health care bill might have second thoughts. \nWhen we began to debate the health care reform bill, the President of \nthe United States made clear that part of having control of one's \nhealth care was having the right to keep what you have. We enshrined \nthat in the bill during the HELP Committee markup, the Finance \nCommittee markup, and the Senate debate on this bill.\n  No matter how important we thought those protections were, we said \nyou can keep what you have, if that is what you want. But this was not \ncarte blanche for the insurance industry to ignore the new law and \ncontinue abusive practices that have been in place for too long. They \ncan continue their old plans as long as they did not dramatically \nincrease the cost to their customers.\n  It made no significant negative changes to the coverage consumers \nwere paying for. In other words, you can keep what you have. But if the \ninsurance companies try to take away what you have, the law will \nprotect you. In the parlance of Washington, this is called \ngrandfathering.\n  To clarify to businesses, insurers, and all Americans what this meant \nin practice, the administration released a regulation on June 17. This \nregulation strikes an important balance of keeping our businesses \nstrong while ensuring that employees and their families are able to \nweather difficult economic times, such as the ones we are in.\n  Under the regulation adopted on June 17, grandfathered plans are not \nrequired to offer the additional benefits included in the Patients' \nBill of Rights. I wish they were, but they are not. The grandfather \nregulation provides insurers and businesses flexibility to continue to \ninnovate and to grow and still maintain their status.\n  Businesses' health plans will not lose their grandfather status \nunless significant changes are made to policies which unduly burden \nemployees and average American families.\n  For example, if a health plan increases co-payment charges for a \nworking mother in Hartford, CT, as has been pointed out by Senator \nHarkin, by more than 15 percentage points, it will lose the grandfather \nstatus. Or if a health care plan significantly reduces benefits for a \nfamily in New Haven, CT, it loses its grandfather status, as it should.\n  These are not unreasonable requirements as we strive to protect \naverage families in our country.\n  My colleague from Wyoming and I disagree about this new law. We sat \ntogether day in and day out during those long markup periods. He is a \ngood man, a good Senator, and a good friend. But I disagree with him \nstrongly on this resolution. In my view, he wrongly claims this repeal \nwould benefit small businesses. I say today that adopting this \nresolution would not only hurt small businesses but also roll back the \nimportant consumer protections that ended some of the worst insurance \nindustry abuses across our country.\n  If we repeal the grandfather regulations, we will harm small \nbusinesses and their employees because nothing would protect them from \nthe insurance companies raising premiums by double digits each year, \nwithout offering any new and better benefits to the very people who \nwould suffer.\n  Nothing would protect them from insurance companies deciding to drop \nbenefits or price them out of reach for these very employees.\n  This resolution would not guarantee the right to keep what you have. \nWhat this resolution does guarantee is that the insurance industry can \ndecide what you are going to get from them--not what you want. That is \nthe fundamental difference if we adopt this resolution.\n  Health reform changed that by handing control, as we all agreed on, \nback to you and your family. If we adopt this resolution we \nfundamentally shift that equation once again. In order to help small \nbusinesses more easily provide coverage to their workers and make \npremiums more affordable, the law provides tax credits for that \ncoverage. In Connecticut alone, there are 54,000 small businesses that \nwill benefit from these tax credits. This is just the first step toward \nbringing health care costs down, as we all want, and ensuring quality \ncare, as we all want as well, for coverage of average Americans and \ntheir providers.\n  This resolution is not about small businesses and harming them. This \nis another effort to dismantle health reform, and I believe it is \nfundamentally wrong for thousands of small businesses and employees \nacross the country. It is a gift to the insurance industry, which all \nof us agree should no longer be the ones to decide what you get based \non what they want to charge you, but whether you have insurance and \nconfidence you are going to get for your family what you need not what \nthey decide you get.\n  For those reasons, I strongly oppose this resolution and hope my \ncolleagues will join us in that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Congress meets in the District of \nColumbia. The District of Columbia is an island surrounded by reality. \nOnly in the District of Columbia could you get away with telling the \npeople if you like what you have you can keep it, and then pass \nregulations 6 months later that do just the opposite and figure that \npeople are going to ignore it. But common sense is eventually going to \nprevail in this town and common sense is going to have to prevail on \nthis piece of legislation as well. I support the resolution of Senator \nEnzi, disapproving the regulation on grandfathered health plans.\n  The partisan health care overhaul enacted last March and subsequent \nimplementation represents so many broken promises that I hardly know \nwhere to begin. But the resolution of Senator Enzi certainly sheds some \nlight on one of the most glaring broken promises we have seen so far, \nand is as good a place as any for us to start.\n  Time and again throughout the health care debate, supporters of the \nhealth care overhaul assured voters that even after their proposal \nbecame law, ``If you like what your current health plan is, you will be \nable to keep it.''\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\n  The administration's own regulations prove this is not the case. \nUnder the grandfathering regulation, according to the White House's own \neconomic impact analysis, as many as 69 percent of businesses will lose \ntheir grandfathered status by 2013 and be forced to buy government-\napproved plans.\n  The estimates are even more troubling if you are a small business. \nAgain, according to the administration's own estimates in the \nregulation, as many as 80 percent of small employers will be forced out \nof their current plan and into a more expensive government-approved \nplan. It is no wonder that the grandfathering regulation is opposed by \npretty much every employer organization in the country. The National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, the Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and the National Retail \nFederation have all weighed in against this burdensome and disruptive \npolicy. In every one of those cases, businesses that are members of \nthose organizations want to provide health insurance and have been \nproviding health insurance for their employees, and they want to keep \nit. They were believing Congress when they said if you have what you \nlike you can keep it, and now they are finding out otherwise.\n  It is true our economy is in a fragile place right now. Yet the \nimplementation of the new health care law is creating more uncertainty \nand higher costs for American businesses. How can we ask them to go out \nand create jobs and hire new people when each new health care \nregulation adds another layer of bureaucracy and uncertainty? The White \nHouse should be making it easier to do business in this country, not \nharder.\n  This is not just about confusion, it is also about costs. When \nemployers and individuals make even modest changes to their benefits \nand lose grandfathered status, they are forced to buy a new government-\napproved health care plan that in most cases will cost more than their \ncurrent plan. That means the government will tell employers what \nbenefits they have to cover, to whom they have to offer coverage, and \nhow much they are going to have to contribute.\n  We have already seen data from health plans saying that the \nrequirement in the new law could drive up premiums by about 9 percent. \nThis is in line with the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that \nthe overall increase in premiums could be as much as 10 percent to 13 \npercent. When you factor in medical inflation, some people are still \nseeing premium increases of 20 percent or more after the passage of the \nhealth care law.\n  What happened, then, to President Obama's promise about lowering \npremiums by $2,500? Are we supposed to add that to the list as another \nbroken promise? Each day it seems as if another news story comes out \nthat shows why the partisan health care overhaul was the wrong \napproach. Health plans are being forced out of the child-only market. \nSome have stopped selling in individual markets entirely. Premiums \ncontinue to go up at twice the rate of inflation.\n  The White House's own actuary is telling us that health care \ninflation will be worse now than it was before the health care reform \nbill became law. Over 1 million seniors are being forced out of their \ncurrent national Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug \nplans, and this is only going to get worse. Businesses are considering \ndropping retiree health care benefits and possibly dropping health care \ncoverage altogether.\n  With these kinds of stories coming out on a daily basis, it is no \nwonder that polls are showing close to 60 percent of the American \npeople opposed to this new law. I support the efforts of Senator Enzi \nand appreciate that he is willing to shed some light on this issue. \nThere is a lot of misinformation out there and people need to \nunderstand what this health care overhaul means for them.\n  The grandfathering regulation is a clear violation of the promises \nmade by supporters of the health care law that, if you like what you \nhave, you are able to keep it. We owe it to our constituents to fix \nthat misrepresentation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada, Senator Ensign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, many Americans may be wondering what this \nhuge stack of paper is that I have on my desk. Over 2,000 pages of this \nstack of paper represent the actual health care bill. The rest of the \nstack consists of the regulations that have been written to this point.\n  From what we understand, once the whole health care bill and \nregulations are written, this stack of paper will grow much higher; \nestimates are as much as 20,000 pages total. The complexity of the \nhealth care law is incredible. The resolution we have before us today \nconcerns grandfathered health plan status. This regulation is one of \nthose regulations that many of us believe is going to do damage to our \nhealth care system. I want to talk a little bit about the regulations \nunder discussion today.\n  Over the last couple of months, I have gone around to many businesses \nin my home State of Nevada, to talk about many of these regulations as \nwell as the health care bill. Let me tell you, many small business \nowners in my State are very concerned about what this health reform \nbill is going to do to their businesses. A lot of small businesses \nstruggle to do the right thing by giving their employees health care. A \nlot of them cannot afford the Cadillac plans that a lot of big \nbusinesses have, but they are trying to do the right thing. Some \nbusinesses cover half of what their employees pay. Some businesses have \nslimmed-down plans. The vast majority of the health plans that small \nbusinesses offer would not meet the minimum standards that this health \ncare bill is going to require.\n  Why is that important? The President said during the health care \ndebate that if you like your plan you can keep it. If you like your \ndoctor, if you like your plan, you will absolutely be able to keep it. \nThere is a small detail he left out. The detail is this: If you change \nyour health plan--and it does not have to be in a significant way--or \nif you change your copays--you could lose your grandfathered status. If \nyou lose your grandfathered status you now have to comply with the \nminimum standards in the Federal law. That is a problem because, for \nmost small businesses, these standards will dramatically increase the \ncost of their health insurance for their employees and a lot of them \nare barely keeping their doors open today. A lot of small businesses I \ntalk to are actually putting pencil to paper and figuring out whether \nthey are even going to be able to keep the plans they have today.\n  The advocates will say: Well, don't change your plan. The reality is \nthat every single year, businesses look at the health care plans that \nthey offer and almost every year they make changes to those health care \nplans. Under this regulation, if you make changes to your health care \nplan you could lose the grandfather status. That is a major problem.\n  According to the government's own statistics, by 2013 as many as \nalmost 70 percent of all employer plans and 80 percent of small \nbusiness plans will relinquish their grandfathered status. Those are \nthe government's own estimates. Based on these numbers, it doesn't \nsound like everybody is going to be able to keep their plan, as the \nPresident talked about in his promises about this health care \nlegislation.\n  In my view--and I think this view is shared by a lot of experts who \nare studying this health care plan, this bill is going to raise costs \nfor those who currently have insurance. Think about it; if you are \ngoing to cover 30 million people there will be costs associated with \nthat coverage. There was a $500 billion cut in Medicare and there was \nan increase in taxes. We know that a lot of different taxes were \nincreased to pay for this bill. But the other pay-for in this bill, \nthat was not officially scored as a pay-for, is that for people who \nhave insurance--it is going to become more expensive for them because \nof a lot of the mandates in the bill.\n  We have seen recently, insurance company after insurance company, \nwhen they are going to their State commissions bringing forward fairly \nlarge increases.\n  I was talking to a small business owner the other day in Nevada. He \ntold\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\nme his plan is going up 38 percent. That was the lowest bid he could \nget; a 38-percent increase for this year. The insurance companies told \nhim it is because of this health care bill.\n  I was on a telephone call yesterday. I did a telephone townhall \nmeeting back in my State. A senior citizen was on the phone. He was \ntelling me about his Medicare supplemental insurance that is covered by \nhis union. The copays and the premiums for that were going up \ndramatically. He was wondering how he was going to be able to pay his \nrent. He has virtually no discretionary income, so any premium increase \nis going to make it tough for him. He is actually figuring out how he \nis going to be able to make his rent payments. Those are some of the \nunintended consequences with this bill and the regulations that are \nbeing written.\n  I think we need to take a second look at health reform. First of all, \nobviously I wish to see the health reform bill repealed and replaced \nwith real health insurance reform that makes insurance more affordable. \nI support things such as buying insurance across State lines--similar \nto how we buy car insurance across State lines. I also wish to see us \nenact real medical liability reform that would lower the costs of \nhealth care in this country. All of these things would be good to make \nhealth care more affordable and accessible for more Americans as \nopposed to what we have today. But let's at least start this process by \nrejecting the regulations that are going to hurt the grandfathered-in \nstatus of a lot of these plans. If you take away grandfathered status \nfrom a lot of plans, a lot of small business owners are going to be \nhurt and a lot of people who work for small businesses are going to \nlose their health insurance. This is because the small businesses will \nnot be able to afford to comply with this health care bill and the \nregulations that are associated with it.\n  I urge support of this resolution of disapproval. I appreciate \nSenator Enzi for bringing this resolution of disapproval of these \nregulations forward. I think this resolution is something the Senate \nshould support and support in a bipartisan way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 8 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Enzi's \nresolution of disapproval and thank him for that. It seems every day a \nnew story comes out about the negative consequences of the health care \nreform law, and I cannot keep up with them. I know people involved in \nthe health care industry are having a very difficult time also.\n  Do you remember the campaign pledge that health care reform would \nimmediately reduce family's premiums by $2,500? Well, last week a slew, \na slew of new mandates on health insurers, including coverage of \npreventative services without any cost sharing, restrictions on annual \nlimits on coverage, and coverage of children up to age 26--I guess a \nchild 25 is a child--took effect.\n  Many of them, in fact, may be beneficial to some Americans, but they \nwill not come free. Health insurers have begun alerting their customers \nto the fact that these new mandates cost money, money that has to be \ncharged in additional premiums. I think most Americans understand you \ncannot get something for nothing.\n  But instead of admitting that their policies are causing health \ninsurers to raise their rates, the Obama administration has unleashed \nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to silence its \ncritics by intimidation.\n  In a letter to America's health insurance plans, the Secretary \nexplicitly threatens health insurers that do not toe the line on \nObamaCare with exclusion from the State health insurance exchanges, \nwhich start in 2014. ``There will be zero tolerance for this type of \nmisinformation and unjustified rate increases,'' she has warned. ``We \nwill also keep track of insurers with a record of unjustified rate \nincreases: those plans may be excluded from health care exchanges in \n2014.''\n  Well, let's be clear about what the Secretary, on behalf of the \nPresident, is saying. She is threatening to shut down private companies \nfor exercising their first amendment right to free speech, and she is \nkeeping a list. Some have called this gangster government in the press. \nAs a former newspaper man, I am shocked. I am stunned by my former \nGovernor's actions. First, it was the gag order on Humana Insurance for \ndaring to describe the consequences of slashing more than $100 billion \nfrom Medicare Advantage to the customers, now this.\n  This administration says it wants transparency. Well, transparency is \na two-way street. It does not mean muzzling dissenting opinions or \ninconvenient facts because they are not advantageous to the \nadministration. As the Wall Street Journal opinioned: ``They're more \nsubtle than this in Caracas, Venezuela.''\n  Not only are the actions of the Obama administration \nunconstitutional, they are also extremely hypocritical in light of \ntheir own highly misleading rhetoric. For example, the President and \nSecretary Sebelius have been touting the recent decision of health \ninsurer Blue Cross Blue Shield in North Carolina to issue rebates to \nits customers in the individual market as a supposed ObamaCare victory.\n  President Obama claimed this victory at a recent campaign stop in \nVirginia, saying that the insurance commissioners are newly empowered \nto look after consumers, that we are already seeing ObamaCare's new \nlevels of accountability pay off.\n  Well, aside from the fact that most State insurance commissioners \nhave had the ability to review rate increases for years, a fact that \nSecretary Sebelius, as a former Kansas insurance commissioner, knows \nall too well, they are leaving out another very important fact, the \nrest of the story.\n  What they are not telling you is, the reason why the insurer is \npaying out rebates is, because of ObamaCare, their plans in the \nindividual insurance market will cease to exist in 2014. This means the \nreserves they have stored to protect their solvency are no longer \nnecessary.\n  That is where the rebates are coming from, not some well of hidden \nprofits. The insurer is paying the rebates out of their reserves \nbecause the plans will no longer exist. This is hardly a victory for \nthe thousands of people enrolled in those plans. If that is not \nmisleading, I do not know what is.\n  What about the Secretary's taxpayer-financed mailer regarding \nMedicare Advantage that was recently sent to seniors all across the \ncountry? This mailer misleadingly claims that Medicare Advantage \nenrollees will not see any changes to their benefits under ObamaCare. \nThat is a claim that is demonstrably false.\n  Already we are seeing insurers such as Harvard Pilgrim drop their \nMedicare Advantage plans altogether as a result of these huge cuts. So \nactually thousands of seniors will see changes in their benefits. They \nwill not have any. I urge the President and the Secretary to reconsider \ntheir use of these tactics which only serve to further erode the \ngovernment's credibility with the American people and to insult their \nelected representatives.\n  In the United States of America, private citizens are not only \nallowed to disagree with the government, it is a cornerstone of our \ndemocracy. So I say to the Department of Health and Human Services and \nthe administration, stop the gag orders and the intimidation. To HHS, \ndo not tread on the first amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, while I am waiting for another speaker to \ncome, I will make some additional comments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, can I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 27 minutes on the Senator's side and \n21 minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I just wish to get a few things read into \nthe Record. I have a list of 54 organizations that are supporting my \nresolution. They include the Latino Coalition, the Chamber of Commerce, \nthe Coalition of Affordable Health Coverage, the Health Care Leadership \nCouncil, the National Federation of Independent Business, the National \nRestaurant Association, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCouncil, to name just a few of the 54.\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed letters of support from the \nChamber of Commerce, the National Association of Health Underwriters, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the National Retail Federation, the Small \nBusiness Entrepreneurship Council, and the Associated Builders and \nContractors, all of which are in support of this and I suspect will be \nkey voting this particular resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. ENZI. The Chamber of Commerce, for instance, says:\n\n       The administration released an extremely complex regulation \n     that makes it virtually impossible for plans to maintain \n     grandfathered status, instead subjecting them to many \n     expenses and burdensome new requirements. In our view, this \n     regulation violates Congressional intent, and does not live \n     up to the promises of proponents of the new law.\n\n  NFIB, a small part of their letter says:\n\n       If required to comply with the administration's interim \n     final rule, millions of small businesses will be forced out \n     of the plans they know and like--\n\n  Which means their employees lose the plans they know and like.\n  The Associated Builders and Contractors say:\n\n       The grandfathered rule demonstrates a fundamental failure \n     of the Federal Government to understand the needs of small \n     businesses. With the current unemployment rate of 17 percent, \n     the construction industry cannot endure another cost increase \n     at the hands of the Federal Government. It is unfortunate \n     that the Federal Government continues to fail to provide \n     employers and their employees with health care solutions that \n     are practical or affordable.\n\n  Earlier, there were some mainstays of health care that--I think there \nwas an aspersion I was getting rid of with my resolution. I want you to \nknow that if the resolution passes, businesses will still be prohibited \nfrom discriminating against someone with preexisting conditions, \nbusinesses will still be prohibited from imposing annual limits on \nbenefits, all plans will still be prohibited from imposing lifetime \nlimits on benefits, all plans will still have to cover kids under the \nage of 26 on their parents' plan, all plans will still be prohibited \nfrom canceling coverage because of a paperwork error.\n  All those things will exist when this resolution passes, and this \nresolution needs to pass. All those things that I mentioned, \npreexisting conditions, annual limits, lifetime limits, children under \nthe age of 26, and canceling coverage for paperwork errors, all those \ncost money. That is why the price is going up at the present time.\n  The price is going up at the present time. This was supposed to be \ncutting costs. Help does not arrive until 2014. But small businesses, \nparticularly small businesses, are going to be required to meet this \ngrandfathering rule now. They cannot afford the grandfathering rule \nnow. Another thing I am objecting to is watching television and seeing \nan old favorite of mine, Andy Griffith, getting paid, at taxpayer \nexpense, to tell us that this whole deal is excellent.\n  You saw the stack of regulations over there. They estimate there will \nbe 100 pages of regulation for each page of that bill. There are 2,700 \npages in the bill. That means there are going to be 270,000 pages of \nregulations. We do not legislate that way. We try and fill in those \nblanks. You do not even know what those blanks are going to hold yet, \nneither does small business.\n  They already know these are things that are going to drive up cost in \nthe beginning, with no cost-cutting opportunity, and then the \ngrandfathering rule kicking in right away, which means for 3 years, \nbefore they even know what some of those regulations are going to be, \nthey are going to have to constrain everything in their organization \nwithin 15 points, as is pointed out, and we can expect the first year's \nincreases to be even greater than the 15 points.\n  But they will try and stay with that grandfathered plan because it is \nwhat they can afford and it is what their employees like. So we are \ntrying to keep people in the insurance they like. It is an employee \nrequest. I also noticed one of the Senators mentioned the Marshall Plan \nthat was not liked when it was first passed; and the Civil Rights Act \nthat was not liked when it was first passed.\n  I would like to point out those were both very bipartisan acts that \nwere passed--bipartisan. It was not a partisan bill. You would have to \nnotice that a lot of these people have been mentioning this was all \npassed by one side of the aisle, and there was a lot of warning before \nthat if you do things in a hurry and you do it just partisan, that you \ndo not devote the time that is necessary or put it in a small enough \npackage that people can understand it.\n  There are vast parts of this that people did not get to read before \nthey passed it. It is particularly noted on the House side. That leads \nto the kinds of difficulties we have now. We also turn over to \nbureaucrats writing the rules, and this is one of the examples, and we \nhave a chance to overturn that at this point. They can go back and \nrewrite it again.\n  But, at this point, we can say: No, enough is enough. You cannot put \nall these things into place. You cannot kick people out of their \ninsurance and let's see what happens in 2014 when we have all the \nregulation. So I think we have put a lot onto businesses that does \nincrease cost. Because we do--even when this passes, we will still \nprohibit discriminating against someone with a preexisting condition, \nwe will still prohibit imposing annual limits on benefits, we will \nstill prohibit imposing lifetime limits on benefits. All plans will \nstill have to cover kids under the age of 26. Although, I have noticed \na whole bunch of the companies now are not going to write some of the \nplans that would do this, and they are getting out of the business. But \nall plans will still be prohibited from canceling coverage because of a \npaperwork error. Those drive up costs.\n  Relief is not in sight until 2014.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            List of 54 Organizations Supporting S.J.

Res. 39, a resolution of \n     disapproval that would repeal the onerous grandfathering \n     regulations promulgated pursuant to the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act.\n       The President and many other proponents of the new health \n     care law repeatedly promised, ``if you like the plan you \n     have, you can keep it,'' and the grandfathering provision was \n     meant to ensure this promise. The statute contained a few \n     short paragraphs specifying that a plan operating when the \n     bill was\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\n     enacted could continue to operate as before; new employees \n     and dependents of employees could also be added to the plan. \n     The provisions demonstrate Congress clearly intended to \n     preserve maximum flexibility for employer plans and those \n     currently in operation.\n       However, the Administration released an extremely complex \n     regulation that makes it virtually impossible for plans to \n     maintain grandfathered status, instead subjecting them to \n     many expensive and burdensome new requirements. Rather than \n     allowing plans to continue operating in the manner they are \n     accustomed to, the regulation specifies numerous ways by \n     which such plans would lose grandfathered status. Thus, many \n     existing plans would be forced to change in order to comply \n     with an array of new mandates. In our view, this regulation \n     violates Congressional intent, and does not live up to the \n     promises of proponents of the new law.\n       Due to the critical importance of this issue to the \n     business community, the Chamber strongly urges you to support \n     S.J. Res. 39. The Chamber may consider votes on, or in \n     relation to, this issue in our annual How They Voted \n     scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n     R.

Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Health Underwriters (NAHU), which represents more than \n     100,000 health insurance agents, brokers and employee benefit \n     specialists involved on a daily basis in the sale and service \n     of private health plans, I am writing to convey our support \n     for your resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 39) to overturn \n     the so-called grandfather rule in the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (PPACA).\n       As you know, throughout the legislative debate on health \n     system reform, President Obama and congressional leaders \n     repeatedly stated that ``if you like the coverage you have, \n     you can keep it.'' Unfortunately, the proposed interim final \n     rule (IFR) on grandfathering issued this past June follows a \n     rigid path in defining the requirements for ``keeping what \n     you have,'' which our professional benefit specialist members \n     conclude will have a negative impact on employers large and \n     small, their employees and their families. The complex and \n     inflexible requirements could ultimately undermine the \n     ability of employers to continue to provide existing health \n     coverage for their employees.\n       The current grandfather IFR has not provided adequate \n     guidance on various scenarios employers and consumers may \n     encounter and, as such, there are many questions about the \n     allowable changes that may be made to employer plans and the \n     risk of losing grandfathered status. Once grandfathered \n     status is lost, employers will be forced to follow a number \n     of expensive new insurance rules, which will increase costs \n     for employers and employees, threatening the coverage \n     Americans currently have.\n       The Departments of Treasury, Labor and Health and Human \n     Services own estimates indicate that the complex and \n     restrictive IFR regime would effectively make grandfathering \n     temporary: More than half of all employers, and two-thirds of \n     all small employers, will relinquish their grandfathered \n     health plans by the end of 2013.\n       Barring employers from changing insurance carriers or \n     increasing cost sharing percentages of any level, for \n     example, severely limits the ability of employers to maintain \n     their grandfathered status. Other requirements to maintain \n     grandfathered status, such as limits on the increases for \n     fixed-amount cost sharing, are simply out of touch with \n     the individual and small-group insurance markets since \n     most employers have little control over the plan designs \n     offered in the small-group and individual market.\n       In addition, the current grandfather rules do not afford \n     protections for individuals and employers who lose their \n     grandfathered status through no fault of their own. For \n     example, if an individual or employer's health insurance \n     carrier pulls out of a state marketplace, the only option the \n     consumer has is to buy a new non-grandfathered policy or \n     cease to be covered altogether. Unfortunately, our members \n     report that a number of carriers are vacating many health \n     insurance markets as a result of PPACA provisions, \n     particularly in the individual and limited benefit plan \n     markets, and that millions of their clients will be affected.\n       Our members also report that many large health insurance \n     carriers are reorganizing all of their policy offerings as a \n     means of streamlining administrative expenses. So while an \n     individual or employer may be offered identical benefits \n     through the carrier, their contractual dates may shift and \n     they may technically be sold a new policy offering. Such \n     administrative simplification moves may inadvertently cause \n     millions to relinquish their grandfathered status.\n       We are very concerned that a great number of individuals \n     and employers will be left with even less choice and \n     flexibility and will be faced with the difficult choice of \n     paying more to maintain grandfathered coverage, shopping for \n     a new (and more expensive) plan or possibly dropping it \n     entirely.\n       A workable and sustainable grandfathering protection \n     framework should be aimed at achieving a number of important \n     health reform objectives: (1) to promote stability during the \n     transition to full health care reform by ensuring that \n     Americans have a choice of keeping their current coverages; \n     (2) to allow individuals to better control their health care \n     costs; (3) to preserve affordable coverage options and limit \n     disruption of coverage for currently insured individuals; and \n     (4) to lessen the potential for regulatory uncertainty.\n       Unfortunately, the current grandfather rules fall short of \n     these objectives on a number of levels. As such, we very much \n     support your resolution of disapproval of the current \n     grandfather rules, and hope that Congress and the \n     Administration can work together toward a more sensible and \n     sustainable policy moving forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Janet Trautwein,\n     Executive Vice President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2010.\n     Hon. Michael Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Enzi: The National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM)--the nation's largest industrial trade \n     association--urges you to support S.J. RES. 39, a \n     ``resolution of disapproval'' to prevent implementation of \n     the Interim Final Rule defining grandfathered health plans \n     under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n       The grandfather rule, as currently drafted, does not meet \n     the standard on which the push for reform was predicated--\n     insure the uninsured and allow those with coverage to keep an \n     existing plan. The Department of Health and Human Services' \n     own analysis determined that up to 80 percent of existing \n     small plans will lose their grandfathered status. Employers \n     are proud to offer their employees health insurance, and \n     freezing this benefit limits employers' ability to provide \n     quality coverage.\n       Currently, 170 million people receive insurance from their \n     employers. Under the new law, the health plans covering these \n     employees were to have grandfathered status and were not to \n     be subjected to the broad insurance market reforms necessary \n     for newer plans. This exemption was intended to allow \n     employees to keep the coverage they currently have and with \n     which they are most comfortable. However, the Interim Final \n     Rule limits the ability of these plans to make routine \n     modifications that will control the rising health care costs \n     crippling many manufacturers.\n       The rule also removes grandfathered status from those who \n     are fully insured if they change issuers. This eliminates the \n     ability of many smaller businesses to negotiate with insurers \n     to obtain lower rates. Those that are fully insured should be \n     able to negotiate with competing issuers and maintain \n     grandfathered status if they change issuers. This would allow \n     for a competitive marketplace, keep costs down and create \n     parity for smaller businesses that, without a large pool of \n     insured to manage costs like most self-insured plans, use the \n     competition of an open market to lower costs. As a result, \n     the current rule places small businesses at a significant \n     disadvantage.\n       Ninety-seven percent of NAM members provide health \n     insurance to their employees. Manufacturers are proud to \n     provide health care to their employees and would like to \n     continue that benefit. The rule, as it stands, will decrease \n     competition and create a stagnant, uncompetitive and more \n     expensive insurance market.\n       The Senate should disapprove this rule because it will \n     unnecessarily disrupt the current employer-based system, \n     which provides coverage to millions of Americans. As \n     manufacturers face tremendous uncertainty in these \n     challenging economic times, Congress should not allow a \n     federal agency to issue regulations that harm manufacturers' \n     ability to create and retain jobs.\n       On behalf of manufacturers, we urge your support for S.J. \n     RES.39 and look forward to working with you on our shared \n     goals for a strong economy and job creation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Joe Trauger,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Human Resources Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 28, 2010.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the National Federation of \n     Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small \n     business advocacy organization, I am writing in support of \n     S.J. Res 39, the Enzi disapproval resolution regarding the \n     Interim Final Rule on grandfathered plans under the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The vote in \n     support of the motion to proceed to S.J. Res 39 will be \n     considered an NFIB Key Vote for the 111th Congress.\n       NFIB believes the Administration has overstepped its legal \n     authority under PPACA in writing regulations that go beyond \n     the legislative authority embedded in the statute. A strict \n     reading of Section 1251 in the Act clearly outlines what \n     defines a grandfathered plan. However, through its Interim \n     Final Rule the government inappropriately reinterprets the \n     intent of Congress by narrowing the scope of how plans \n     qualify to retain grandfathered status.\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\n       The Interim Final Rule appears to be based on an assumption \n     that coverage choices should be narrowed in the run up to \n     2014. Nothing in the statutory language of the PPACA supports \n     this assumption. In fact, interpreting the PPACA so that it \n     narrows the range of coverage choices is inconsistent with \n     the spirit of the Act, as well as the letter of the law.\n       If Congress is unable to overturn the Interim Final Rule, \n     NFIB remains deeply concerned that the new regulations will \n     most heavily impact small, rather than large businesses. As \n     written, the Interim Final Rule is so restrictive that the \n     rule provides small businesses with little to no flexibility \n     to keep their plan.\n       The precedent set forth by this Interim Final Rule is \n     especially detrimental for the men and women who currently \n     have coverage through small businesses. Millions of Americans \n     rely on small business plans for their health coverage, and \n     must continue to rely on those plans until at least 2014 when \n     new purchasing options become available. However, if the \n     Interim Final Rule is not overturned, the government's own \n     analysis confirms what many small businesses fear most--that \n     upwards of 80 percent of small employers could lose the plan \n     they have today by 2013.\n       NFIB strongly supports the Enzi resolution of disapproval. \n     As the 111th Congress comes to a close, Congress must restore \n     the true meaning of ``if you like what you have today, you \n     can keep it.'' If required to comply with the \n     Administration's Interim Final Rule, millions of small \n     businesses will be forced out of the plans they know and \n     like. Thank you for your hard work on behalf of small \n     business, and NFIB looks forward to working with you to \n     address this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Eckerly,\n     Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 27, 2010.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: I write to lend the support of the \n     National Retail Federation (NRF) to the resolution of \n     congressional disapproval (S.J. Res. 39) you have recently \n     introduced to block the ``grandfathered plan'' regulations. \n     We strongly support and endorse your effort and urge that the \n     resolution be promptly adopted.\n       We are also concerned that regulators have taken too narrow \n     a view of the grandfathered plan regulation. NRF's formal \n     comments (submitted on August 16, 2010) noted in part that: \n     ``[o]ur concern is that the [interim final regulation's] \n     rigid, trip-wire rules make it entirely too possible (if not \n     probable) that a plan that elects grandfathered plan status \n     will not be able to maintain that status for long. Many plans \n     may not even bother to elect grandfathered plan status.'' Our \n     letter recommended several specific steps to improve the \n     grandfathered plan regulation:\n       1. Allow employers to change insurance carriers without \n     losing grandfathered status provided that: The coverage is \n     actuarially equivalent or better, and that provider networks \n     are substantially equivalent; prohibiting a change in \n     carriers will needlessly inhibit competition bases on price \n     and quality of service.\n       2. Allow for improvements in prescription drug formularies \n     and provider networks without jeopardizing grandfathered plan \n     status. New drugs come onto the market with great regularity \n     and medical practice changes quickly. Formulary changes in \n     the interest of plan beneficiaries are appropriate and \n     necessary. Provider networks require regular maintenance to \n     allow for retirements, addition of new providers and to \n     maintain network quality. Reasonable changes that do not \n     compromise ongoing treatment should be allowed.\n       3. Provide greater flexibility to manage future medical \n     inflation. Changes in fixed dollar cost sharing should be \n     made on a year-to-year basis rather than be based on March \n     23, 2010 and percentage increases from that.\n       We strongly concur with your view that a formal resolution \n     of congressional disapproval is the appropriate next step \n     under existing law. We urge its prompt adoption. Again, NRF \n     commends you for introducing this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Steve Pfister,\n     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Small Business &\n\n\n                                     Entrepreneurship Council,\n\n                                   Oakton, VA, September 23, 2010.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n         Committee, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the Small Business & \n     Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council), I am writing to \n     applaud you for introducing a Resolution of Disapproval (S.J. \n     Res. 39) relating to the rule on ``grandfathered plans'' \n     issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS). The rule, as written, is in clear violation of \n     President Obama's promise that Americans would be able to \n     keep the health plans they currently have upon passage of the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). In \n     addition, we believe that HHS has taken creative license in \n     its interpretation of PPACA, bringing an ideological bent \n     that is not supported by the statutory language.\n       SBE Council strongly supports your Resolution. Without its \n     successful passage most small business owners and their \n     employees will lose the health coverage they currently enjoy.\n       Small business owners and the self-employed were promised \n     by President Obama and supporters of PPACA that they could \n     keep the plans they currently have under the legislation. \n     However, this promise has turned out to be false and small \n     business owners feel betrayed by what transpired during the \n     rule-making process, as well as what is occurring in the \n     insurance marketplace. In order to qualify for grandfathered \n     status, small business owners must stay with their current \n     carrier and not significantly alter their current health plan \n     or coverage. If their current carrier significantly raises \n     their premiums, small business owners cannot shop around for \n     more affordable plans or they will risk losing grandfathered \n     status. The alternative is to move to another carrier and \n     face more costly coverage mandated by the new health care \n     law. In sum, small business owners are rendered helpless by \n     this catch-22 rule.\n       Rather than helping small business owners and their \n     workforce keep their plans, it appears the rule has been \n     rigged to force most small businesses and their employees out \n     of grandfathered status. We are aware that HHS estimates, \n     worst case, 80 percent of small business owners will lose \n     their current health plans. SBE Council believes 80 percent \n     is the likely scenario, if not a conservative figure.\n       The consequence of the rule is obvious--more small business \n     owners will drop coverage. Hiring will remain weak and jobs \n     will be lost. This was not the promised outcome of PPACA.\n       Senator Enzi, SBE Council shares your desire to overturn \n     this unjust rule. We applaud your leadership, and will do \n     what it takes to see that S.J. Res. 39 advances into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Associated Builders\n\n\n                                        and Contractors, Inc.,\n\n                                Arlington, VA, September 28, 2010.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     United States Senate.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of Associated Builders and \n     Contractors (ABC), a national association with 77 chapters \n     representing 25,000 merit shop construction and construction-\n     related firms with 2 million employees, we are writing to \n     express our strong support for S.J. Res. 39, which would \n     overturn the recently issued rule relating to status as a \n     grandfathered health plan under the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (PPACA).\n       Throughout the health care reform debate, ABC advocated for \n     policies that reduce the cost of health care for employers \n     and their employees. ABC called on Congress to advance \n     commonsense proposals that would address the skyrocketing \n     costs of health insurance, especially for employer-sponsored \n     plans, and the rapidly rising number of uninsured Americans. \n     ABC believes true reform should provide greater choice and \n     affordability and allow private insurers to compete for \n     business.\n       Unfortunately, the new health care law will do nothing to \n     reduce the cost curve; instead it simply will enroll more \n     Americans into a broken and unsustainable health care system. \n     Specifically, the recently issued grandfather rule will \n     increase, rather than decrease, costs for small businesses.\n       On June 17, the Departments of Health and Human Services, \n     Labor and Treasury issued an interim final rule relating to a \n     plan's status as a ``grandfathered health plan'' under PPACA. \n     As part of the Small Business Coalition for Affordable \n     HealthCare, ABC and several other organizations filed \n     comments expressing concern that the grandfather rule is \n     overly restrictive and could make it even more likely that \n     small businesses will choose to drop their plans prior to \n     2014 as they are faced with unsustainable premium increases. \n     Instead of lowering the number of uninsured Americans, the \n     rule could actually increase the number of uninsured before \n     the health care law is fully enacted.\n       The coalition also pointed out that neither PPACA nor the \n     grandfather rule address the core problem facing small \n     businesses: the rising costs of health care. Instead, the \n     rule strips small employers of the ability to exercise \n     flexibility in adjusting to cost increases in order to \n     maintain their current plan.\n       The grandfather rule demonstrates a fundamental failure of \n     the federal government to understand the needs of small \n     businesses. With a current unemployment rate of 17 percent, \n     the construction industry cannot endure another cost increase \n     at the hands of the federal government. It is unfortunate \n     that the federal government continues to fail to provide \n     employers and their employees with health care solutions that \n     are practical or affordable.\n       Once again, ABC strongly supports S.J. Res. 39 and we \n     commend you for introducing a resolution that is intended to \n     reduce health care costs for a struggling sector of our \n     economy: small businesses. We look forward to working with \n     you in the future on commonsense health care initiatives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Brewster B. Bevis,\n                              Senior Director, Legislative Affairs\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have to say to my friend from Wyoming: Where did that come from--\n100 pages of regulations for every page that is in the bill? That is \ngoing to be 200,000 pages of regulations. Where did that come from? It \nsounds like it came from the health insurance industry to me. Boy, I \ntell you, that is quite a figure. Well, obviously, it is a bogus \nnumber, and I do not know where that figure came from. I would like to \nask my friend where that did come from.\n  But I say to my friend from Wyoming, the Senator just said there is \nno help--I wrote it down here as fast as I could--no help for small \nbusinesses until 2014.\n  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. In the Affordable Care Act, we \nattached--in the tax bill that Senator Baucus got through the Finance \nCommittee, small businesses, beginning this year, 2010, will receive a \ntax credit--a tax credit, not deduction, a tax credit--of up to 35 \npercent of the cost of an employee's health insurance.\n  So you have a small business, prior to this year, that did not get a \ntax credit, I say to my friend from Wyoming. I mean, the Republicans \nran this place for 8 years under George Bush--8 years. They had a \nRepublican President, Republican Senate, Republican House. They did not \ngive small businesses any tax breaks for health insurance. We did. It \nis in the bill, a 35-percent tax credit this year for small businesses. \nThat would cover 83.7 percent of all small businesses in the country. \nThat is quite a bit of help for small business.\n\n  I have heard from small businesses in my State that can get that tax \ncredit this year that they have never had before. A lot of these small \nbusinesses are small businesses that employ just a few people--10, 12. \nThey know their employees. They go to the same churches, schools. They \nare neighbors. I can't tell my colleagues how many small business \nowners in Iowa have told me: I feel so bad. Because of the increasing \ncosts of health insurance, whether they are increased copays or \ndeductibles, cutting out benefits, I have had to increase the cost of \nhealth insurance to my employees to the point that it is almost not \nworth it anymore because of high deductibles.\n  They feel badly about it because these are their friends, neighbors. \nThey are related a lot of times. I have had them come to me and say: \nFinally, this year I can get a tax credit, up to 35 percent.\n  Quite frankly, in my State, 90.8 percent of small businesses will get \nthe maximum 35 percent tax credit. Small businesses don't have to wait \nuntil 2014 to get help; they are getting that help right now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Iowa, if the Senator \nfrom Wyoming prevails in what he is seeking to do this morning, it is \nmy understanding that almost half the people in America who currently \nhave health insurance through their employers, people who are so-called \ngrandfathered in under this bill, would not get the new protections \nthat are coming in the law, protections that say that under their \nhealth insurance, they will not be subject to a lifetime limit. For \nexample, if someone gets into long-term cancer therapy that is going to \nbe very expensive over a long period and the insurance company decides \nhalfway through they will cut them off, we now protect people so that \nthey can continue to get the care they need. They can't be limited.\n  Isn't it also true that the effort of the Senator from Wyoming would \nprotect the right of the insurance companies to literally cancel one's \npolicy because of an error made in the application for the policy, to \nrescind the policy?\n  I might add, it is my understanding that this rescission is abused in \nmy State more than any other in the Nation. The rescission rate on \nhealth insurance in Illinois is three times the national average. We \nhave had over 5,000 people who have had their health insurance \ncanceled. When they went to the company and said: I am facing surgery, \nI am facing cancer therapy, and I need coverage and want to make sure I \nhave it, they ended up getting their policies canceled.\n  I ask the Senator, would the effort by the Senator from Wyoming take \naway these protections we are now building into the law to make sure \nhealth insurance is there when people need it the most?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have two things here. We have the \nPatients' Bill of Rights which just went into effect. That covers \neverybody. That covers all plans. That covers grandfathered plans. They \ncan't escape that. However, if a plan wanted to be grandfathered, we \nleft it up to the Department to write rules and regulations as to what \ngrandfathered means. For example, let's say the Senator from Illinois \nand I have a contract. We both have agreed to it. We say we are going \nto let that contract go into the future. After a certain date, you are \ngrandfathered in that contract.\n  What the Senator from Wyoming would say is that if you are the \ninsurance company and I am the individual covered, we will grandfather \nit, but you can change it any way you want. You can raise my copay. You \ncan raise my deductible. You can reduce the annual limit on claims you \nwill pay. You can eliminate benefits, such as the Senator just pointed \nout, for cancer or diabetes. And guess what. You would still be \nconsidered grandfathered. But I am stuck with that. That is what is so \nimportant here. That is what people have to understand about what the \nSenator from Wyoming is trying to do. He is saying that basically we \nwill grandfather it in, but the insurance companies can change it \nhowever they want, and you are stuck with it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So if the Senator from Wyoming prevails and I am one of \nthe grandfathered plans--in other words, I have my health insurance \nplan that I like through my employer--my health insurance company on my \ngrandfathered plan can literally cut me off when I need health \ninsurance the most, can literally put a limit on the amount they are \ngoing to pay on an annual basis?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can really take away my health insurance protection.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, hasn't he heard, as I have from people \nin my State, how vulnerable they are when you empower health insurance \ncompanies to bail out when you need them the most? If we voted with the \nSenator from Wyoming, we would empower the health insurance companies \nat the expense of vulnerable people who may face an accident or a \ndiagnosis tomorrow that changes their lives. Isn't that what this gets \ndown to in its most basic form? Do we want to give power to the people \nwho are insured or power to the health insurance companies? As I \nunderstand the Senator from Wyoming, he thinks the health insurance \ncompanies should have the power and we should not be providing \nprotection to the people who need it most.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is the way I see it. It just seems that we have \nrules and regulations. What the Department has said is that, OK, to be \na grandfathered plan, you have to fall under these items: You can only \nraise your copayment a certain amount. By the way, it is quite a bit. \nYou can raise your copayment either the greater of 5 bucks or medical \ninflation plus 15 percent. That is pretty good. It says you can change \ndifferent things but within certain limits. They can't, for example, \nraise your coinsurance charges--that is, if you have a percentage. For \nexample, if it is 20/80, they can't just raise that. It has to stay the \nsame percentage. They could raise the copayment if it is a dollar \namount.\n  That is why the Senator from Illinois is so right. If this resolution \npasses, all of the protections for consumers are wiped out.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. On whose time?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am about out of time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 17 minutes, and the \nSenator from Wyoming has 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield time if he will \nyield me time if I have a question.\n  Mr. ENZI. Certainly.\n  The Senator from Iowa is not answering the same question the Senator \nfrom Illinois is asking. I did say that when the resolution passes, \nthey would\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\nnot be able to discriminate on preexisting, they would not be able to \nimpose annual limits. They will not be imposing lifetime limits. They \nwill have to keep people until age 26, and they will not be able to \ncancel it for paperwork error. I think that is the question the Senator \nfrom Illinois was asking, not the copays and those things.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did respond that the bill of rights applies to all \nplans.\n  Mr. ENZI. All plans, even if the grandfathering clause is taken out?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely. I made that very clear. The bill of rights \nthat came into effect stays for everything. But what I am saying is \nthat the Senator is right, and I responded that way concerning the bill \nof rights. But what doesn't apply to grandfathered plans are preventive \nservices that are covered with no cost. That is not covered. The right \nto an appeal to a third party is not covered. Restrictions on annual \nlimits is not applied. They can put annual limits on coverage under \nthese grandfathered plans. Direct access to OB/GYNs without a referral \nis not part of the Patients' Bill of Rights. No higher cost sharing for \nout-of-network emergency services, no prior authorization requirement \nfor emergency care--none of that is in the bill of rights. So all of \nthat is wiped out by the resolution of the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Again, for emphasis, you have a contract. You work for an employer. \nThey have a plan. You are part of that plan. If you like that plan, you \ncan stay with it. My friend from Wyoming said: Only in Washington, DC, \ncould they say, if you like your plan, you can stay with it, and then \nthey change it. No. Only in the health insurance industry, perhaps in \nthe Republican philosophy, would you say that you can grandfather a \nplan, but you the consumer are stuck if the insurer wants to change it \nany way he wants to change it, with the exception of the bill of \nrights. They could raise your copayment, they could take away your \nright of access to an OB/GYN without referral, and all the other things \nI mentioned.\n  If your insurer dramatically raises your copayment, that is not what \nyou signed up for. That was not the plan you signed up for. If your \ninsurer dramatically raises your deductible, that is not what you \nsigned up for. If your insurer reduces the annual limit on claims they \nwill pay, that is not what you signed up for. If your insurer \neliminates covered benefits, such as cancer or diabetes, that is not \nwhat you signed up for.\n  We are saying: You have a plan here. You signed up for it. You like \nit. You can keep it.\n  But what if your insurer comes along and says: Guess what. We are not \ngoing to cover it if you get diabetes, and we are going to put an \nannual limit on claims we will pay, and we are going to raise your \ndeductible by a huge amount. Is that the plan you signed up for? No. So \nwhy should you be stuck with that? Why should that be a grandfathered \nplan?\n  A grandfathered plan means a plan that was in existence before April \nof this year that you like but which is not changed dramatically on you \nby your insurer. So if you have a grandfathered plan, you are fine. \nWhat the Department did is that they issued regulations to define what \nthat is. Quite frankly, I thought they were very lenient. For crying \nout loud, they can raise your copayment by the greater of $5 or medical \ninflation plus 15 percent. Fifteen percent of medical inflation sounds \nlike a lot to me. That is quite lenient.\n  Again, my friend had a lot of letters he included for the Record. I \nwould like to insert letters in opposition from the Small Business \nMajority, from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Here is a \nletter signed by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the \nAmerican Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, Families \nUSA, the National Partnership for Women and Families, National Women's \nLaw Center, SCIU, and U.S. PIRG. I also have letters from Health Care \nfor America Now, Service Employees International Union, the AARP, and \nTrust for America's Health. I ask unanimous consent to have these \nletters printed in the Record.\n  All are in opposition to the Enzi resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Small Business Majority,\n\n                                Sausalito, CA, September 28, 2010.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chair, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Senate Dirksen Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     Senate Russell Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: Small Business Majority strongly opposes \n     S.J. Res. 39--a resolution of disapproval that would prevent \n     implementation of the grandfathering regulations under the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This unnecessary \n     resolution would impede the orderly and responsible \n     implementation of comprehensive reform--which would deny \n     small businesses and their employees the protections reform \n     provides, and make it more difficult for them to access \n     affordable care.\n       The passage of healthcare reform was a huge victory for \n     small businesses, many of whom are being crushed under high \n     healthcare costs and were looking to reform to give them some \n     relief. However, there are small businesses that like their \n     existing plans and want to keep them. The legislation allows \n     them to do so. But these plans must continue to resemble \n     their current form and also must work in the context of \n     overall reform.\n       The regulations issued by Health and Human Services on June \n     15 strike the right balance. They require that the existing \n     plans don't increase costs more than 15% above medical \n     inflation and that they don't disturb reforms that will be \n     put in place in 2014--such as prohibiting insurance companies \n     from denying coverage due to preexisting conditions. We found \n     from extensive opinion polling that these requirements \n     address small business owners' biggest concerns: controlling \n     costs and the elimination of preexisting condition rules. \n     While we believe the regulations make sense, they aren't set \n     in stone; HHS is open to making additional changes based on \n     small business input.\n       Small Business Majority continues to support healthcare \n     reform. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our nation's \n     economy and shouldn't be denied the benefits reform provides, \n     which is why we urge you to vote against this \n     counterproductive resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John Arensmeyer,\n     Founder & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n[From Off the Charts, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Sept. 29, \n                                 2010]\n\n   Enzi Proposal Would Threaten Market Reforms in Affordable Care Act\n\n       The Senate is expected to vote today on a proposal from \n     Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY) to overturn federal regulations \n     related to some of the Affordable Care Act's key health \n     insurance market reforms that took effect last week.\n       The regulations define ``grandfathered plans.'' Here's why \n     this definition matters. Among other things, the new health \n     reform law would require health plans to cover preventive \n     care without cost-sharing, undergo reviews to see if their \n     premium rate increases are unreasonable, and offer enrollees \n     the choice of their primary care provider. But plans that \n     existed when the law was enacted on March 23, 2010--known as \n     ``grandfathered'' plans--aren't required to comply with these \n     reforms.\n       The regulations define how much a grandfathered plan can \n     change before it is considered a new plan that must abide by \n     these new reforms and consumer protections. As we explained \n     in a recent fact sheet, they strike a good balance for \n     consumers, allowing people to keep the plans they have while \n     ensuring that consumer protections kick in if an insurance \n     company reduces a plan's benefits or raises consumers' out-\n     of-pocket costs significantly.\n       Repealing the regulations, as Senator Enzi is proposing, \n     would confuse consumers, employers, and insurers about which \n     plans are grandfathered and which plans have to comply with \n     market reforms. As a result, it would threaten the \n     implementation of the immediate market reforms, thus making \n     the insurance market less stable and would likely leave many \n     consumers without access to critical protections the \n     Affordable Care Act provides.\n       In short, the Enzi proposal--which would require just 51 \n     votes to pass--would be a significant step backward.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 29, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations write to you to \n     express opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 39, Disapproval \n     of Grandfathered Health Plans, filed by Senator Mike Enzi. \n     The resolution would block key insurance reforms included in \n     the Affordable Care Act that protect consumers and ensure \n     high quality, affordable care.\n       Specifically, the resolution would eliminate an interim \n     final rule issued by the Departments of Health and Human \n     Services, Labor and Treasury in June that clarified important \n     consumer protections. Many provisions in the Affordable Care \n     Act apply to all plans, new and existing. However, some \n     provisions only apply to new plans. The rule outlines how \n     health insurance plans could maintain or lose their \n     ``grandfathered'' status.\n       The rule, issued by the Administration, strikes the right \n     balance between protecting consumers and providing stability \n     and flexibility for employers. Specifically, the rule\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\n     prohibits plans from significantly cutting or reducing \n     benefits, increasing copays by an excessive amount, \n     dramatically raising deductibles or decreasing employer \n     contributions that result in an increase in workers' share of \n     premiums. If plans significantly raise out-of-pocket costs \n     for consumers, they lose their ``grandfathered'' status and \n     would be considered a new plan, subject to further \n     requirements in the law. Senator Enzi's resolution would \n     completely eliminate the rule, making it impossible to \n     enforce important consumer protections against potential \n     insurance company abuses. If enacted, the resolution would \n     put consumers' rights in jeopardy.\n       We strongly urge you to stand up for American families and \n     vote ``no'' on SJ Resolution 39.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.\n       American Diabetes Association.\n       American Heart Association.\n       Families USA.\n       National Partnership for Women and Families.\n       National Women's Law Center.\n       SEIU.\n       U.S. PIRG.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       Health Care\n\n\n                                             for America NOW!,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Health Care for America Now, we \n     urge you to oppose the Joint Resolution of Disapproval of the \n     ``grandfathering rules'' filed by Senator Enzi. We understand \n     this could come up for a vote as early as Wednesday, \n     September 29. The Enzi resolution would nullify the interim \n     final rule defining grandfathered plans. In striking the \n     rule, Senator Enzi's resolution potentially allows any health \n     plan to be grandfathered--shielding plans indefinitely from \n     complying with important new consumer protections that \n     benefit millions of Americans.\n       Like the Affordable Care Act (ACA) itself, the interim \n     final rule issued by the Departments of HHS, Labor and \n     Treasury sought to strike a balance that allows consumers to \n     keep current plans they like, while also ensuring that plans \n     evolve to incorporate new consumer protections. To do this, \n     the rule laid out the circumstances under which a health plan \n     loses grandfathered status, and therefore must comply with \n     certain new consumer protections. Factors that result in a \n     plan losing grandfathered status include significant benefit \n     cuts, cost-sharing hikes, lower employer contributions, a new \n     or tightened annual limit, or switching insurance carriers.\n       The Enzi resolution wipes away the rules that define \n     grandfathered plans, potentially allowing any plan to assert \n     its permanent non-compliance with consumer protections. This \n     would invalidate many benefits of the ACA for people that \n     currently have insurance and indefinitely lock them into \n     plans that fail to meet basic consumer protections. Though \n     claiming to help small business, the resolution will plunge \n     many small business health plans into a maze of litigation. \n     This resolution is a transparent attempt to gut some of the \n     most important provisions of insurance reform.\n       Consumers lose under the Enzi resolution. Plans would not \n     have to cover preventive services at no cost. The right to \n     internal and external appeals could be stripped. A trip to \n     the emergency room could again require prior authorization \n     and result in enormous out-of-network costs. These \n     protections are so basic, popular and bipartisan that there \n     can be no explanation for this resolution other than \n     pandering to an insurance industry that lost the battle but \n     is still gunning to win the war against consumers on health \n     reform.\n       On September 23, people all around the country celebrated \n     the arrival of key consumer protections. Advocates hosted \n     hundreds of events nationwide, including 87 sponsored by \n     Health Care for America Now and the Main Street Alliance. \n     This spiteful resolution threatens to rip away those hard-won \n     consumer benefits. We urge Senators to vote no on the motion \n     to proceed and no on the resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ethan Rome,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Service Employees\n\n\n                                          International Union.\n\n       On behalf of the more than 2.2 million members of the \n     Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I urge your \n     boss to oppose S.J. Res. 39 filed by Senator Enzi. This \n     resolution of disapproval would strike the interim final rule \n     submitted by the Departments of Health and Human Services, \n     Labor and Treasury on the grandfathered health plans under \n     the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n       Many of the new protections under the ACA apply to all \n     health plans, both those in existence known as grandfathered \n     plans and new health plans or non-grandfathered plans. Those \n     provisions covering all health plans include a prohibition of \n     rescissions, a ban on annual lifetime coverage limits, \n     coverage of children until age 26, and an end to exclusion of \n     children based on pre-existing conditions. There are certain \n     provisions that do not apply to grandfathered plans, \n     including the requirement to provide preventive health \n     services with no cost sharing and the new internal appeals \n     and external review process. Senator Enzi's resolution seeks \n     to disapprove the interim final rule which states that health \n     plans would cease to be the same plan that was in effect on \n     March 23, 2010 and therefore no longer maintain grandfathered \n     status if they significantly cut benefits, raise deductibles \n     or co-pays or lower employer contributions.\n       This resolution would give insurance companies free reign \n     to change the structure of a health plan such as increasing \n     co-pays and deductibles and not be required to provide \n     stronger consumer protections/benefits enacted under health \n     care reform designed to increase access and affordability. In \n     short, S.J. Res 39 is a blatant attempt to erode the \n     protections provided to consumers under health care reform.\n       SEIU strongly urges you to oppose S.J. Res. 39.

Res. 39.\n\n       Washington.--AARP Legislative Director David Certner \n     released a statement in advance of today's expected vote on \n     S.J. Res. 39, a Senate resolution of disapproval that would \n     weaken the patient protections put in place under the health \n     care law. Certner's statement follows:\n       ``The rules created earlier this year strike a good balance \n     between preserving the rights of individuals to keep their \n     existing coverage, while also honoring the purpose of the \n     Affordable Care Act in providing for patient protections and \n     important insurance reforms that safeguard individuals from \n     practices that lead to denials of coverage or to \n     underinsurance in the event of serious illness or accident.\n       ``As I stated in AARP's letter regarding the Interim Final \n     Rule (IFR) to implement the grandfather status rules, `AARP \n     supports the general thrust of the IFR that plans not lose \n     their grandfather status for changes that are modest in \n     nature. This is consistent with the need to balance the \n     objectives in the ACA of preserving the right of individuals \n     to keep their existing coverage with the goal of ensuring \n     access to affordable essential coverage and improving the \n     quality of that coverage.' AARP agrees with the IFR's \n     determination of what would cause plans to lose their \n     grandfather status (e.g., cannot significantly cut or reduce \n     benefits, cannot significantly raise co-payment charges, \n     cannot significantly lower employer contributions) as \n     important consumer protections and consistent with the \n     statute.\n       ``As a result, AARP urges Senators to oppose this \n     resolution to ensure critical new protections and rules \n     remain in place so that the vast majority of Americans who \n     get their health insurance through employers will have clear \n     guidelines on how their plans comply with the new law.''\n       AARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan social welfare \n     organization with a membership that helps people 50+ have \n     independence, choice and control in ways that are beneficial \n     and affordable to them and society as a whole.

As a result of ACA, patients and \n     consumers who enroll in new health insurance plans will have \n     access to recommended preventive clinical services for little \n     to no cost. This represents a tremendous opportunity to \n     encourage Americans to seek out and receive recommended \n     preventive services, which will have a real impact on \n     improving health outcomes. Furthermore, guaranteed coverage \n     of preventive services is a critical component of \n     establishing a national culture of prevention and wellness.\n       While we hope that one day all Americans will be guaranteed \n     this access, a certain category of ``grandfathered'' health \n     plans are exempt from this requirement. As released\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\n     in June, the rule requires that health plans not make \n     significant changes to plan benefits, premiums, or cost-\n     sharing requirements should they wish to maintain their \n     ``grandfathered'' status.\n       Enactment of this resolution would block the Department of \n     Health and Human Services from implementing this rule and \n     effectively permit any existing health plan to avoid the \n     important affordability and benefit protections created under \n     health reform, including coverage of preventive health \n     services.\n       Once again, we urge you to vote against this resolution to \n     ensure that ``grandfathered'' status does not become a route \n     to curtailing the important prevention components of health \n     insurance reform. We hope you will stand on the side of \n     ensuring that patients have access to clinical preventive \n     services and other important insurance reforms contained \n     within ACA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jeffrey Levi,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my friend from Wyoming, this seems like \nold times--what we tried to stop for over a year, and now our \npredictions came true, beginning with they turned 2 pages of this \n2,733-page bill--2 pages--into 121 pages of regulation. Is that \ncorrect, I would ask my colleague from Wyoming?\n  Mr. ENZI. In one of the instances, that is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So in a 2,733-page bill, if we have 121 pages of \nregulation for every 2 pages, that is going to be pretty interesting, \nisn't it? And the fun has just begun. The fun has just begun.\n  If the Senator might recall, I ask my friend from Wyoming, President \nObama--quote after quote, time after time:\n\n       And if you do have health insurance, we'll make sure that \n     your insurance is more affordable and more secure.\n\n  We know that is not true from every estimate. It is neither \naffordable nor secure.\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health \n     care plan. This is not some government takeover. . . . I \n     don't want government bureaucrats meddling in your health \n     care. . . . That's what reform is about.\n\n  I quote from the President of the United States.\n  So now they have taken 2 pages of a 2,733-page bill, and that is 121 \npages of regulation.\n  Now, isn't it true, I would ask my colleague from Wyoming, who knows \nas much or more about this than anyone, that it will result in 50 \npercent of all employees being in plans ineligible for grandfathered \nstatus? Is that a correct statement?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is not only a correct statement, the estimate is a \nlittle low, according to the administration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. According to the administration.\n  Mr. ENZI. According to the administration, in small businesses, 80 \npercent of the people--unless this is passed--will lose the insurance \nthey have and like, and in all businesses 69 percent will. Those are \nnot my numbers; those are the administration's numbers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But isn't it also true that is the case for small \nbusiness and people and entrepreneurs all over America except the \nunions? Isn't that true? Isn't this a carve-out again, part of this \nsleaze that went into putting this bill together, part of the \n``Cornhusker kickback,'' the ``Louisiana purchase,'' the buying of \nPhRMA--all that went into this--the ``negotiations'' that were going to \ntake place on C-SPAN that the President said during the Presidential \ncampaign that went from one sweetheart deal cut to another. Part of one \nof those sweetheart deals was the unions are exempt; is that correct?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is correct. And so were the other parts that were done \nin order to buy the bill in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So what you are saying is that unless a health care \npolicy provided by an employer is absolutely unchanged totally for an \nunspecified period of time, then that health insurance policy can be \ndeclared invalid by the Department of Health and Human Services, and \nthey will have to go to a government-mandated health insurance policy \nor pay a fine. Is that a correct assessment?\n  Mr. ENZI. It is a correct assessment in most of the parts. They will \nhave to give up the insurance they have now, even if they like it, \nwhich the President did mention 47 times in public speeches. And there \nare some requirements on how much of a change there can be.\n  But I have been talking to small businessmen traveling across \nWyoming, talking to them and visiting them, because Congress thinks \n``profit'' is a bad word, and a lot in Congress think every business is \nsimple to run. But they have never been out there and scratched the \nsurface a little bit to see just how tough it is.\n  I have had businessman after businessman whom I have visited and ones \nwho have come to Washington because they have been so concerned who \nhave said: I am going to do everything I can to keep my plan just \nexactly the same because this regulation is so difficult to understand, \nand I am pretty busy anyway, so I don't think I dare make any changes.\n  That is not true. They could make a few changes, but if they do, they \nwill lose their status, and they will have to pay more.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So an employer, a small businessperson provides health \ninsurance for their employees. That employer sees health care costs go \nup,--as everybody knows, and that is every objective estimate--so that \nemployer says to its 10, 50, 60, whatever, employees: Look, we are \ngoing to have to increase your copay. We are going to have to increase \nyour copay because, simply, the costs are prohibitive, and we would \nlike to sit down, and I think you would probably agree to it given the \noverall situation across health care. And the employees agree with that \nand they change the copay, and then automatically they are finished. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, that is correct. That is correct. If they change the \ncopay, they are no longer grandfathered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So even though it is obvious that the cost of health care \nis going up, continues up dramatically--that is estimates of OMB, of \nliterally every objective observer; the curve has not been bent down--\nthat unless employers keep exactly, with very little wiggle room, \nbasically the same health insurance policy for their employees, then \nthey will then have to comply with a government-mandated health \ninsurance policy. Is that correct?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is correct. The Federal bureaucrats have figured out \nwhat the minimum amount of insurance is that you ought to have and \neverybody else in America ought to have, and even if you like what you \nhave, you are going to have to go to that if there are certain changes \nin your policy.\n  The small businessmen are worried about any changes. Because this \nthing is so complicated, they do not even know what the rest of the \nrules are going to be. They have talked about this tax credit, but a \nnumber of them have looked at the requirements on the tax credit and \nsaid: How in the heck do I ever comply with that? So they are a little \nworried about being able to get that too.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So I guess it was one of our colleagues and the President \nwho intimated: Well, the American people really don't pay attention. \nThe American people don't really--they are deceived by FOX News, et \ncetera.\n  The American people knew this was a bad deal then, and they know it \nis a bad deal now. The majority of the American people want it \nrepealed. And all of this is suspicions confirmed when you take 2 pages \nof legislation and turn it into 121 pages of regulation--a 2,733-page \nbill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, it will be dramatic. We have not begun to touch all of \nthe regulations that have to be written on this yet. We looked at the \nMedicare bill and how many pages of regulations came out of that, and \nit was 100 per page, which would be 270,000 pages on this one. That is \nwhere that number came from.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So here we are with an economy that the administration, \nthe President, and his crack economic team said that if you pass this \nstimulus bill, maximum unemployment will be 8 percent. What is the \nproblem with\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\ninvestment and hiring and economic growth in America today? The total \nuncertainty. We have just punted on the extension of the tax cuts or an \nObama tax increase. We have just punted on a number of issues, and the \nAmerican people now are going to have to--this small businessperson the \nNFIB represents is going to have to thumb through 121 pages of new \nregulations in order to understand. Big businesses and small businesses \nare going to say: What are the next 121 pages of regulations that are \ncoming down for 2 pages of the bill? I guess the title page probably \nwould not have regulations associated with it, but the other 2,732 \nwould.\n  Mr. ENZI. And the Senator from Arizona has not even mentioned the \n1099 problem that is supposed to help pay for part of this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, which our colleagues just voted down. They voted \ndown a resolution by the Senator from Nebraska that would allow them \nnot to have to report every single transaction of $600 or more. No \nwonder small and large businesses in America are reluctant to invest \nand hire with this kind of foolishness going on.\n  Mr. ENZI. Right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The CPAs come to me in Arizona and say: I can't advise my \nclients. I don't know what the tax structure will be.\n  So here we are with a new 121 pages of regulation which obviously \nwill affect 50, 60, 80 percent--let's say it only affects 50 percent of \nbusinesses in America--and we are going to vote down, probably, with \nthe big-government majority here, this effort to not have this \nregulation implemented.\n  All I can say to my colleague from Wyoming is, thank you for your \nleadership. Thank you for your thoughtful dissertation on this issue. \nAnd I guarantee you, maybe next January, we can take this up again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last June, President Obama promised on \nnational television that ``Government is not going to make you change \nplans under health reform.''\n  In his September 2009 address to Congress he told Americans, ``If you \nhave health insurance through your job, nothing in our plan requires \nyou to change what you have.''\n  Many Americans doubted this would be the case, and they have been \nproven right.\n  In the months after the health care law was passed, the \nadministration wrote the regulations for plans with grandfathered \nstatus. Grandfathered status was supposed to allow employers to \ncontinue offering current health plans, even if those plans don't meet \nall of the government's new cost-increasing mandates and requirements. \nAnd we were told it was intended to help protect Americans enrolled in \nthese plans from ``rate shock,'' or significant premium increases, as a \nresult of the new government mandates.\n  The consulting firm Mercer has bad news for people hoping to keep \nwhat they currently have. It released a new survey of employers on the \nimpact of the health care law. One-quarter of employers surveyed \nestimate that the law would raise premiums by at least 3 percent. That \nincrease is beyond this year's normal rise in costs due to medical \ninflation.\n  A majority of respondents--57 percent--said they will ask employees \nto pay a greater share of the cost of coverage in 2011, meaning higher \ndeductibles and copays.\n  As the Mercer study notes, ``The rules for maintaining grandfathered \nstatus were tougher than many employers expected. As they start to get \na clearer picture of projected costs for 2011, many are finding they \nneed more flexibility to get their cost increases down to a level they \ncan handle.''\n  Yet the administration's regulations expose employers and employees \nto extensive bureaucratic redtape just so they can keep their current \nplans.\n  In fact, the administration's own experts at the Department of Health \nand Human Services estimate that between 39 and 69 percent of \nbusinesses won't be able to keep the health plans they have now.\n  Small businesses will fare even worse. By 2013, up to 80 percent of \nsmall businesses could lose their grandfathered status. All of this \nmeans that few health plans will qualify for grandfathered status, so \nmany Americans will not get to keep what they have.\n  Employers that lose grandfathered status for their health plans will \nbe forced to comply with all of the new mandates included in the health \ncare law and all of the administration's regulations.\n  Subjecting employers' health plans to these mandates will either \nforce them to change their plans and increase their costs of insurance \nor pay a fine and dump their employees into the Federal Government's \nnew insurance exchange.\n  I do not support the health care law at all, but I believe Americans \nshould get to keep what they have, as promised, so I support the Enzi \nresolution of disapproval. The resolution would nullify these \nregulations and direct the administration to develop true \ngrandfathering protections that allow Americans to keep their current \ncoverage.\n  These latest developments are consistent with the pattern that has \nemerged ever since this bill passed and was signed into law--one of \nbroken promises. Americans never liked or wanted this bill, and we are \ncontinually reminded why they opposed it in the first place.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record, the following letter to Secretary Sebelius which discusses \nmy thoughts on the interim final rule, ``Rule'', regarding \ngrandfathered plans--75 Fed. Reg. 34538--as part of the Affordable Care \nAct. While I will vote against the motion to proceed on Senator Enzi's \njoint resolution of disapproval, S.J. Res. 39, I do have concerns that \nthe rule itself is overly restrictive. I look forward to working with \nthe administration and my fellow colleagues on continuing to develop \nguidance on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2010.\n     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Sebelius I write regarding the Interim Final \n     Rule (``Rule'') regarding grandfathered plans (75 Fed. Reg. \n     34538).\n       While I understand that the Rule seeks to balance consumer \n     protections while still allowing consumers to keep their \n     existing plans, I am concerned that as currently written, the \n     Rule is overly restrictive. In some places the Rule places \n     significant restraints on the ability of employers and health \n     plans to make adjustments to their existing plans that \n     contain costs while maintaining the overall benefit structure \n     and value for plan participants.\n       As a starting point for more flexibility, I urge you to \n     reconsider the provision that automatically revokes \n     grandfathered health plan status if an employer-sponsored \n     health plan changes insurance carriers. This provision, as \n     written, is overly restrictive and unfairly locks in \n     employers to a specific carrier. For instance, changing \n     carriers should not trigger a loss of grandfathered status if \n     the benefit coverage under a different insurer remains the \n     same. In fact, many new carriers have shown that they can \n     offer lower cost-sharing to employees due to a better rate.\n       I hope to work with you to refine and adjust this and other \n     aspects of the regulation as we further define grandfathered \n     plans to ensure appropriate stability in the marketplace. I \n     appreciate the opportunity to assist the Agencies in \n     continuing to develop guidance on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mark R. Warner,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the other side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 4, 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just listened to the Senator from \nArizona, who is my friend and whom I respect. I cannot remember how \nmany pages were in the McCain-Feingold bill. I voted for it. I believed \nin it. I did not count the pages. I thought he was on the right track \nto change campaign financing in America. It was a bipartisan bill, and \nI supported it.\n  Has that now become the measure in the Senate--we will count the \npages, and if it goes over 1,000 pages, we are not going to pass the \nbill? I hope not because this bill, the underlying bill on health care \nreform, to make it more affordable and more accountable, took on\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\none of the major industries in America, where the cost of health \ninsurance has gone up 10, 15, 20 percent a year.\n  We know the health insurance industry and the companies behind it are \nnot going to go down without a fight. They are going to hire the \nlawyers and the lobbyists--and they did--to fight the passage of the \nbill and to fight its implementation in court and everyplace you turn \nbecause what is at stake is their money, their profit. What is at stake \nis the way they do business, and they know it. So when this \nadministration writes the rules and regulations to make sure that when \nwe are challenged in court, this is going to stand up under the law, it \nis the reasonable thing to do, and I think even the Senator from \nArizona would acknowledge it.\n  Now, I know the Senator from Wyoming does not feel this way because \nhe told me personally this morning that he does not favor repeal of the \nbill. I do not know what the position of the Senator from Arizona is. \nBut I would say to those who want to repeal the health care bill that \nthe President signed into law, this is what they want to repeal. They \nwant to repeal the consumer protections which we have finally put into \nthe law which say the health insurance companies cannot cancel your \ncoverage when you need it the most. They cannot deny you coverage \nbecause of a preexisting condition. They cannot deny to children under \nthe age of 18 coverage under health insurance for a preexisting \ncondition. They cannot deny to you the right to keep your kids under \nyour health insurance policy, your family's policy, until they reach \nthe age of 26.\n  In that bill was also a new deduction for the cost of health \ninsurance for small businesses so they can afford to find health \ninsurance for the owners and the employees of the businesses. In this \nbill was closing the doughnut hole on the Medicare prescription Part D, \nsending a $250 check to the seniors who needed it this year and \nincreasing that amount over the year and still not adding to the \ndeficit overall with this bill. That is what they want to repeal.\n  Well, I am not going to stand before you and tell you that the bill \nwe voted for was a perfect law. The only perfect law I am aware of was \ncarved in stone tablets and carried down a mountain by Senator Moses. \nAll the other bills that have been passed are going to need some \nchanges over the years. But the change the Senator from Wyoming brings \nto the floor is a bad change--a bad change--because what he wants to do \nis empower the health insurance companies to increase the amount of \nmoney Americans pay for their coverage. That is it. Give them more \nprotection so they can raise costs.\n  The Senator from Wyoming said we should not be embarrassed to say \nthese companies are in business for a profit. I understand that. But \nthis underlying bill limits the profits of the company and says that 80 \npercent of the premiums they collect need to be spent on health care. \nThat leaves them 20 percent for their bonuses, for their salaries, \nwhatever they want. But we want to make sure people across America have \na fighting chance to have health insurance protection when they \nabsolutely need it the most.\n  I see my colleague on the floor, the Senator from South Dakota. He \nand I had an unexpected experience in the month of August. We were both \nin a hospital for surgery. Lucky for us, Senator Johnson and Senator \nDurbin--and also the Senators on the other side of the aisle--are \nprotected by the best health insurance in America. Shouldn't the people \nof this country have that same kind of peace of mind so that when they \nneed medical care, even expensive medical care, their health insurance \nis there to protect them?\n  All of the people standing on the floor railing against government-\nadministered health care are covered by government-administered health \ncare. Our health insurance plans in Congress are administered by the \nFederal Government, and not a single Senator on the other side of the \naisle has said: In principle, I am going to give up my health insurance \nto show you how much I hate government-administered health care. They \nhave not done it because the plans are too darn good. We want to give \nevery American the same peace of mind Members of Congress have.\n  We have to defeat the Enzi approach today. It empowers health \ninsurance companies at the expense of people who need health insurance \nwhen they face a diagnosis, a surgery, a cancer treatment that could \nliterally bankrupt their family unless they have health insurance \nprotection. I urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Enzi's effort on the \nSenate floor today.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, I don't know where all of these \nfigures come from, how many pages of regulations per page on the bill, \nand all that kind of stuff.\n  I have in front of me the Federal Register of Thursday, June 17, \n2010. What we are dealing with today are grandfathered plans, right? \nThe resolution offered by the Senator from Wyoming has to do with what \nis a grandfathered plan and the regulation of the grandfathered plan.\n  Well, I looked at the rules in the Register. It is one page and not \neven a half, about a page and one-third--well, not actually even a page \nand a third, a little over a page, a page and a third. I have it right \nhere. Page 34,568 and page 34,569: Maintenance of Grandfather Status. \nThat is what it is, and that takes into account all of the things to \nwhich the Senator from Wyoming referred.\n  It is a page and a quarter, right there. There is a bunch of other \nstuff in this regulation that comes through there, including accounting \ntables and all kinds of things, but the actually rule, regulation, is a \npage and a third. I don't know what all this other stuff is in here. It \nis probably make work for somebody, I don't know. But it is a page and \na third.\n  But getting to the crux of it, we provided in the health reform bill, \nwhich is now law, that if you had a plan you liked, you could keep it. \nIf that plan was in effect prior to April of this year, you can keep \nit. It is called grandfathering. Many of the things we provided for new \nplans don't apply to those grandfathered plans, things such as \npreventive services. As my colleagues know, all new plans now must \ncover certain preventive services without any copays or deductibles, \nthat type of thing. All new plans have a right to an external appeal to \na third party, if you want. There are restrictions on annual limits and \ncoverage in the individual market. There is direct access to OB/GYNs \nwithout a referral. You can't charge a higher cost sharing for out-of-\nservice emergency services. You don't need a prior authorization \nrequirement for emergency care. Those are just some of the elements \nthat apply to new plans that will not apply to a grandfathered plan.\n  So then you have to ask, well, what is a grandfathered plan? A \ngrandfathered plan is a plan that was in existence prior to April of \nthis year on which the insurer and the insured agreed, like a contract.\n  What if that grandfathered plan--what if that insurer then says: \nWell, we agreed on a certain coinsurance charge. It was 20 percent. But \nnow we are going to raise it to 40 percent. Well, that is not what you \nagreed to. That is not what you signed up for.\n  Let's say they want to raise deductibles. Let's say your deductible \nwas $1,000, and they say now they are going to raise your deductible to \n$2,500. That is not what you agreed to. That is not the plan you liked \nor you signed up for. Or let's say the plan wants to significantly \nincrease your premiums or they want to tighten down on your annual \nlimits. That is not what you signed up for.\n  So the rules and regulations say: Look, there are certain limits. You \ncan raise your copayment, but not more than $5 or 15 percentage points \nabove medical inflation. So there are certain restrictions put on what \nan insurer can do and still claim to have a grandfathered plan. That \nseems to me to make infinitely good sense because they leave the \nconsumer with nothing. They are at the whims of the insurance company. \nThat is what it was like before we passed the health care reform bill. \nThat is what my friends on this side of the aisle want to go back to: \nGiving the insurance companies the wherewithal to define everything and \ntell the consumer what it is that a consumer has to have. They call the \nshots.\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\n  Well, quite frankly, what this regulation does is it gives more \nempowerment to consumers. It says to an insurer: You can't just willy-\nnilly change your plans that you had prior to April and call it a \ngrandfathered plan. If you change it, if you make all of these big \nchanges, guess what. You are going to have to cover preventive services \nwithout copays and deductibles. If you do all of these big changes, \nwell, your insurer is going to have the right to appeal that. Quite \nfrankly, I think that has a lot to do with this. We said for any new \nplans, the insurer has the right to appeal to a third party--not the \ngrandfathered plans but the new plans. That is why a lot of the old \nplans don't want to become new plans. They don't want to give you that \nright of appeal.\n  There are restrictions on annual limits, which I mentioned before, in \nthe individual market.\n  So, again, if you want to have a grandfathered plan, fine, but you \ncan't just change it dramatically. I say again to my friend from \nWyoming, read it in full. It doesn't say any changes; it says any \nchanges based upon certain things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So I say to my friends, we should vote this down and move \nahead with health care reform and protect the consumers of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, when we talk about 121 pages, we are talking \nabout what the small businessman has to access. He has to go on the \nInternet and print out the pages. There are 121 pages. Yes, if he could \nget it in the format of the Federal Register, he would have 34 pages. \nBut you can't ignore everything but 1\\1/2\\ pages. You have to do the \nwhole thing.\n  Small business is upset about this. That is why I listed the 54 \ndifferent organizations that are opposing this bill. I have gotten, and \nI am sure everybody has gotten--even though I only brought this \nresolution up last week, there are hundreds of letters coming in with \nexamples of what this will do to them.\n  From Fort Lauderdale, FL: They received such a large increase of \npeople being grandfathered out of the plan, they will be forced to get \na new plan because they made their current plan so expensive. Now the \nnew plans have much higher deductibles, more out-of-pocket costs, and \nmore affordable plans only offer to pay 50 percent coinsurance. So the \noptions are limited.\n  The options are limited to all of the businesses. I have letter after \nletter that shows how it isn't just the business that has to absorb \nthese costs. The individuals who have the insurance who have been \npleased with their insurance are going to have to go out on the open \nmarket because the company is going to say it can't afford to do it \nanymore. They are trying to keep the insurance, but that has been the \nproblem for small businesses all along.\n  Our economy is already struggling. It doesn't need more job-killing, \ncost-increasing government mandates. We are hearing from small \nbusinesses across the country which are already being forced to swallow \nlarge premium increases that will prevent them from hiring more \nworkers. That is jobs. We need to create more jobs, not write \nregulations that lead to less jobs.\n  The bill was sold as letting people keep what they have, but the \ndevil is in the details. Do a little digging. It is clear. Americans \nwould not be able to keep what they have. The simple truth is, because \nthis new rule will drastically tie the hands of employers, few \nemployers are expected to be able to pursue grandfathered status.\n  The Enzi resolution is about protecting small business and the people \nwho work there. Anytime an individual doesn't like what they are \ngetting, they can go out on the open market and get something, but most \nof the help on getting that doesn't arrive until 2014.\n  Where is the cost cutting they were promised in the bill? Now we are \ngoing to add this regulation to it, and small businesses are telling me \nthey can't afford it. If this becomes the grandfathered thing, 80 \npercent of small businesses are going to have to change unless my \nresolution is passed. Sixty-nine percent of all businesses are going to \nchange unless my resolution is passed. People out there who like what \nthey have--listen to this. Help your small business and help get this \ngrandfathered thing passed.\n  As I mentioned, there are several organizations that are key voting \non this one because it is so critical to their members and the people \nwho work for them.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Farewell Address\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I love the Senate. It is not always a \nbeautiful thing, and surely it is not a picture of a well-oiled \nmachine, but years ago I found a home here. As my colleagues know, I \nfirst came to the Senate in 1973 as an aide to a young man who had won \na stunning and very improbable election against a respected incumbent. \nAt that campaign victory party 38 years ago--I can remember it as if it \nwas yesterday--I thought to myself I would never again believe that \nanything is impossible.\n  In the intervening 37 years I have seen a lot of campaigns. I never \nsaw one that was as big an upset as Joe\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\nBiden's. When I started working for Joe Biden that year, I told the \nDuPont Company--that is where I worked--I would take a 1-year leave of \nabsence. I stayed for 22 years.\n  I will soon be leaving the Senate. I am grateful beyond words to have \ngone through much of Joe Biden's Senate career as his chief of staff \nand observed his career firsthand. I can say if my Senate career had \nended then, if I had not been called on to serve as his successor, that \nexperience, helping to represent Delawareans and fighting for the \nvalues that Joe Biden and I shared, would have been more than \nfulfilling enough. I would have been happy.\n  I thank our leader, Harry Reid, who is most responsible for the most \nhistoric, productive Congress since FDR. I thank my committee chairs. \nThey have been great to me: Pat Leahy, John Kerry, Carl Levin, and Joe \nLieberman. I especially want to thank my senior Delaware colleague, \nSenator Carper, for whom I have the greatest respect and who has helped \nme tremendously during my last 2 years in all manner of issues. I know \nI am going to alienate some of my Senators, but he is without a doubt \nthe best senior Senator in the entire Senate.\n  After almost four decades, I think I finally got used to the \nunpredictable rhythms of the Senate. In the short time since I was \nsworn in last January, the Senate has seen heated debate over a basic \nprinciple under which this body functions--the filibuster. All Members \nare frustrated with the slower pace, and they are right to be \nfrustrated when good bills, important bills that promise to help \nmillions of Americans, are blocked for the wrong reasons.\n  But rule changes should be considered in the light of the fact, which \nwe all know, that the Senate is not the House of Representatives. It \nserves a very different constitutional purpose, and the existence of \nthe filibuster remains important to ensuring the balanced government \nthe Framers envisioned.\n  Indeed, the history of the Senate is that of a struggle between \ncompromise and intransigence. But this is the place where we protect \npolitical minorities. This is the place where we make sure the fast \ntrain of the majority doesn't overrun the minority. While I think there \nare changes, and good changes, that are being considered, I do think \nthe filibuster should remain at 60 votes because during the long \nstruggle in the Senate, certain traditions have been adhered to by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. Whenever anyone moves to change one \nof those traditions in a way that may diminish the comity under which \nthis body must function, I believe they should do it very carefully. I \nknow my colleagues will do that.\n  Regardless, I continue to have faith that out of the debates in the \nSenate, the fights we are having now, out of the frustrations of some \nof the intransigence of others, we will eventually find our way toward \nthe next great compromises we need to solve many of our problems, \ncompromises that will keep America great.\n  I am incredibly proud of the opportunity I have had to work on \nimportant issues during the brief service I have had in the Senate. I \nfeel especially privileged to have served in this historic Congress, \nwhen there were so many great challenges facing this country. I have \nbeen hanging out in this place since 1973. There has not been another \nCongress like the 111th, one where we have dealt with more issues. \nDuring my first month in office, more than 700,000 Americans lost their \njobs on the heels of the economic collapse in late 2008.\n  People are wondering why are people upset? How soon they forget. Less \nthan 2 years ago, 700,000 people lost their jobs in a month, and it was \nnot the first month and it was not the last month. Action by the \nFederal Government to stop further decline was critical--and we acted. \nI am proud of my vote on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. I \nbelieve the ARRA worked to arrest the financial free fall to jump-start \nthe economy--and if I had another hour and a half, I would show my \ncharts and graphs to demonstrate it.\n  All across Delaware I have seen the benefits of this law--the \ninvestments in infrastructure and education and new technologies for \nour future, and I met with the people whose jobs were saved, literally \nmet with the people whose jobs were saved or who found new employment \nthat flowed from these investments.\n  We succeeded in passing many other initiatives to foster growth and \nto bring much needed help to those who have been hit hardest by the \nrecession, which was my No. 1 job in the Senate. As Senator Carper \nknows, it is all about jobs, jobs, jobs. We actually did a great many \nthings that I firmly believe helped make us a stronger country.\n  As you know, as you grow older you realize that life is not about \nwhat you accomplish or about winning. It is about having tried, and I \nfeel good that I tried my very best.\n  I was so pleased to work with Senators Leahy and Grassley on the \nFraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, to chair oversight hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee on law enforcement efforts to pursue financial \nfraud associated with the financial crisis, and to sit with my friend, \nSenator Carl Levin, as he and the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations held hearings on financial fraud. I was honored to be a \npart, as were all of my colleagues, of two Supreme Court confirmation \nhearings for Justices Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n  I had the distinct honor, and it is a true honor, of serving on the \nForeign Relations Committee with Chairman John Kerry and ranked member \nDick Lugar, as well as on the Armed Services Committee with Chairman \nLevin and Senator John McCain.\n  I made two trips to Israel and the Middle East, three trips to \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, and four trips to Iraq in the last 18 months. \nI know a number of things: No. 1, we must build our civilian capability \nfor engaging in counterinsurgency, and in this Congress we passed \nlegislation to enhance civil-military unity of effort through joint \ntraining at Camp Atterbury.\n  Along with Senator Brownback, I cofounded the Senate Caucus on Global \nInternet Freedom to promote greater access to freedom of expression and \nfreedom of press online.\n  I also highlight the importance of U.S. public diplomacy efforts, \nespecially international broadcasting. As you know, I served on the \nboard for 13 years--there is nothing more important in our battle than \ninternational broadcasting and public diplomacy. I sought to raise the \nawareness of the limitations on press freedom in countries such as \nChina and Iran through the passage of resolutions and have coauthored \nlegislation funding the development of Internet censorship \ncircumvention technology in Iran--getting around the jamming that Iran \nis doing to deny its citizens the right to get information on the \nInternet.\n  I have also had the privilege of working to promote science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, education during my \ntime in the Senate. As a former engineer, I know firsthand the \nimportance of STEM education.\n  I spent much of my career in government service, and I decided early \nin my term to come to the Senate floor each week and recognize the \ncontribution made to this country by our Federal employees. I honored \n100 great Federal employees from this desk, sharing their stories and \naccomplishments with my colleagues and the American people, and I am \nvery pleased that Senator Warner from Virginia is going to be taking \nthat on when I leave. I could not have left it to a better person.\n  Last but not least, I have tried my hardest to be a voice for the \naverage investor and to work for financial accountability and stability \nso our economy can thrive. That is what it is about. We can't thrive if \nwe don't have credibility in the markets. I offered legislation with my \ngood friend, Senator Johnny Isakson, to curb abusive short selling. I \ngave a number of speeches on this floor, from this desk, calling for \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct a comprehensive \nreview of equity market structure and high-frequency trading and to \nadvance reforms that promote clear and transparent markets--not always \nclear and transparent to everybody listening. As I said from the floor \ndozens of times, it is critical that we preserve the credibility of our \nmarkets, one of our Nation's crown jewels, if our grandchildren are to \nlive in the most economically powerful country in the world.\n  Finally, I repeatedly highlighted from the Senate floor the \nimportance\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nof the problem of too big to fail in the financial reform debate, \nworking with my good friend, Senator Sherrod Brown, to offer the Brown-\nKaufman amendment. We made the good fight but, again, trying was better \nthan succeeding--not better but the alternative to succeeding, and I \nthank every Senator who voted for that amendment. I am proud of that. \nWhile our amendment was not agreed to, I will ever be proud of the \nopportunity to work with Senator Chris Dodd and participate in Senate \ndebate on financial reform.\n  I could not have achieved anything--and I genuinely mean anything--\nduring my term without the help and hard work of my excellent staff. I \nspoke early this week about the staff. They are vital to our work. I am \ngoing to tell you as someone who spent years delivering staff work and \nnow someone who has been a consumer, I am more impressed than ever with \nmy staff, and with Senate staffs and the job they do.\n  I want the American people to understand that one of the reasons I \nlove the Senate is because it is filled with intelligent, hard-working \npeople who are passionate about serving this country. This goes for \nMembers and staff alike. The Senate is a magnet for those who feel \ncalled to public service. It is the destiny for countless improbable \njourneys. Our constitutional Framers would have been relieved to see \nthis noble experiment working, to know that in the Senate today serve a \nfarmer from Big Sandy, a realtor from Cobb County, a mayor from \nLincoln, a former Army Ranger from Cranston, a social worker from \nBaltimore, and a doctor from Casper.\n  All of them are here for the same reason as the other Senators--\nbecause they love this country and their communities dearly and want to \ngive back. Their paths to public service may have been different in \ntheir first steps just like mine was, but they converged here and this \nis what continues to sustain my faith in the Senate.\n  Here this leg in my improbable journey comes to an end. Although I \nleave the Senate as a Member, I will not be leaving the Senate behind. \nI will continue to teach about the institution to my students and \nencourage them to pursue their own path to public service. I will \ncontinue to speak out on issues that I worked on here because that \nimportant work, as always, goes on.\n  I love the Senate, and I will always cherish the unlikely opportunity \nI had to serve Delaware as its Senator. With deep gratitude to those \nwho worked with me and stood by me through my journey--to my staff, to \nmy colleagues, to my wife Lynn, to our children, grandchildren--with \ngreat appreciation to former Governor Ruth Ann Minner and the people of \nDelaware for the responsibility they gave me, and with optimism and \nfaith in the future of the Senate and this great Nation, for the last \ntime, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     commending Senator Ted Kaufman\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for a variety of reasons, turnover in the \nSenate has been more rapid recently than at almost any other time in \nour history.\n  For some of us, the turnover has been the result of elections. For \nsome, it has been the result of the passing of Senate legends Ted \nKennedy and Robert Byrd, and as a result, as well, of filling Senate \nseats once held by our President, Vice President and the Secretaries of \nState and the Interior, while most of us--I think I saw a number of my \ncolleagues from the freshman class here earlier listening to my good \nfriend and colleague from Delaware--got here through the ballot box. We \nhave been blessed to serve with some extraordinary individuals who were \nappointed to serve in this body.\n  Perhaps no one stands out more in this regard than our colleague for \nthe past 21 months, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Ted Kaufman. But I \nthink most of us have come to know Senator Kaufman's service to this \nbody extends well beyond the 21 months he served as a Senator.\n  In fact, as we just heard from his comments, and he is oft to remind \nall of us freshmen, he actually has spent most of the last 20 years \nserving previously as a Senate staffer.\n  No matter how accomplished--I think we have former Governors, former \nState senators, folks who have been superintendent of school boards--no \nmatter what our background was before we got to the Senate, we all have \nhad a lot to learn about the peculiar institution rules, morays, and \nthe flow of this body.\n  I think I may speak for some of my colleagues in the class of 2008, \nTed Kaufman has been an extraordinarily generous resource. He has known \nthe rhythms of this institution, has been someone who has counseled us \nat times as our--at least I can speak personally--my head was about to \nexplode about some of the process, to kind of sometimes recognize the \nneed to tune out some of the ceaseless distraction, to recognize the \ngreat power of this institution and, as he has demonstrated by his own \nconduct, that sometimes the best path is to simply keep your head down \nand do hard work.\n  Senator Kaufman, in his speech, went through the litany of activities \nhe has participated in, in that short 21 months. I know we have other \nMembers. I wish to speak about two of them, briefly. One was the \nincredibly important role he played on financial reform and, secondly, \nthis, I think perhaps much underrecognized but incredibly important \nrole, a role he has been kind enough to leave to me, pass the torch to \nme, in terms of recognizing our Federal workforce.\n  Senator Kaufman did not serve on the Banking Committee. But in terms \nof nonmembers on the Banking Committee, there was nobody more active in \nfinancial reform, on a host of issues, than Ted Kaufman. We did not \nalways see eye to eye. But nobody approached issues with more \nthoughtfulness, more hard work, and more generosity of spirit, who \nrecognized we could have different opinions, but we both realized the \nfinancial system needed to be dramatically reformed.\n  But the area I particularly wish to call attention to is the fact \nthat it was Ted Kaufman, before virtually anybody else in this body, \nand for that matter beyond most of the commentators in the financial \nmarkets, who spotted and identified what could be the first sign of the \nnext potential financial crisis, the lack of transparency, particularly \naround high-frequency trading and some of the techniques and tactics \nused by firms to institute that tool.\n  As the Member who oftentimes had the privilege, respectively, of \nsitting in the chair on Monday afternoons, I got to be educated by Ted \nKaufman, as he mentioned earlier, as he went through an explanation of \nthe challenges this technique posed.\n  Because of his actions and working with Members across the aisle, he \nhas raised the attention of the SEC to this very important issue. \nAgain, this is an area I hope to pick up the baton on. Because the \nactions of May 6, in terms of the precipitous fall in the stock market, \ncould have been that first warning shot, in many ways perhaps due to \nsome of the techniques Ted Kaufman has simply said let's bring more \ntransparency to.\n  Senator Kaufman, as well, has done something that perhaps most of us \nin this institution and, for that matter, most of the 300 million \nAmericans do not often pay enough homage and respect to, literally, \nmillions of folks who work for the Federal Government.\n  As somebody who has committed his whole life to public service, and \nmost of that public service in serving the Federal Government, Senator \nKaufman decided, during his tenure, that each and every week he would \ncome down and recognize somebody who works in the Federal Government \nwho is a star. He has now recognized over 100 of these Federal \nemployees, and Senator Kaufman has again reminded all of us that while \nwe have challenges in terms of getting the Federal Government right, we \nstill have in the Federal workforce the best in the world. I, again, \nlook forward to the honor of picking up that baton.\n  Public service is never easy at any moment. But I cannot think of a \ntime in my 20 years around public service that its times are tougher \nthan now, with a great kind of disregard about many of us who serve. \nBut I can think of no better example of someone throughout his whole \nlife who exemplified the best of public service, serving the staff \nroll, serving as a Senator,\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\nconstantly calling us to our better angels, recognizing the great \ntraditions of this body.\n  So while we heard that Senator Kaufman for the last time yielded the \nfloor, at least it is my hope, and I believe the hope of many of my \ncolleagues, that you will still continue to frequent this institution, \nthat you will still continue to be an individual whom we can count on \nfor respect, for guidance, and recommendations.\n  I have to say that while you will be missed, this body will be \ngreatly diminished by your absence. I again wish to salute my \ncolleague, I wish to salute my friend, and I thank Senator Kaufman for \nhis distinguished service to not only the people of Delaware but to the \npeople of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before I speak about a very critical piece of \nlegislation, I wish to join the Senator from Virginia in recognizing \nour friend and colleague from Delaware who has done such an \nextraordinary job in the time he has been here. I wish to associate \nmyself with the comments of the Senator from Virginia.\n  There is no one who brings more intelligence, passion, commitment or \ngenerosity of heart than the Senator from Delaware, and the fact that \nhe has given his life to public service is something we all thank you \nfor. You will be greatly missed.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3706\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon and join with my friend from \nRhode Island as well, a cosponsor, to speak about a critical issue \naffecting millions of Americans around the country. That is the \nquestion of lack of jobs and the need to help those who, through no \nfault of their own, find themselves without a job, trying to hold \nthings together for their family, trying to keep moving, looking for \nwork at a time that is incredibly difficult for our country.\n  So I rise to speak and to offer S. 3706, the Americans Want to Work \nAct, and to ask that our body act on this today--now. Americans want to \nwork. That is a fact. That is a fact. People want to work. But this is \nthe worst recession in our lifetime, the worst since the Great \nDepression.\n  Millions of people are out of work through no fault of their own and \nthey need our help. Things are beginning to turn, but it is painfully \nslow, and too many families are caught in the middle. Nationally, we \nknow the unemployment rate stands at 9.6 percent, much higher in my \nhome State of Michigan. Of those, 42 percent who have been out of work \nhave been out of work for more than 27 weeks and many of them, too many \nof them, much longer.\n  The reality is, as much as people want to work, there are, frankly, \nnot enough jobs. When people say: Well why don't folks get out and get \na job, go out and get a minimum wage job, the reality is there are five \npeople are out of work for every one job that is available. That is a \nfact.\n  Now it is better than it was. At one time, it was six for one job \nopening. So we are creeping along. But the reality is we still have \nfive people out of work for every one job. It is not their fault that \nthey cannot find a job in this circumstance. We know there are about 3 \nmillion jobs available nationally, and there are more than 15 million \npeople who need a job. We cannot just walk away from them, from this \ncircumstance, caused by an economic tsunami between the crisis on Wall \nStreet, between our lack of focus over the last decade on fair trade \nlaws.\n  We have seen too many jobs being shipped overseas, which we tried to \naddress yesterday and could not get any of our Republican colleagues to \nsupport us on to be able to get past that. There are multiple things \nthat have happened but none of them caused by the people who have lost \ntheir jobs.\n  This is a moral issue as well as an economic issue. That is why I \nhave authored the Americans Want to Work Act. I wish to thank all the \ncosponsors. First, I wish to thank our majority leader, Senator Reid, \nwho has given us the opportunity today to make the case and who \nunderstands the incredible urgency of this issue, and to Senator \nSchumer as well, who has been a great partner in this effort in \ncombining an extension of unemployment benefits with his very \nsuccessful HIRE Act, to be able to give a one-two punch.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Brown of Ohio, Senators Casey, Dodd, \nLevin, Reed, Gillibrand, Lautenberg, and Senator Whitehouse. Our bill \ndoes two things to help people who have been out of work the longest. \nIt creates a new tier of unemployment insurance that extends benefits \nfor an additional 20 weeks, and it extends and expands Senator \nSchumer's HIRE Act tax credits to encourage companies to hire those \nworkers who have been looking for work the longest.\n  I realize this is the longest extension of unemployment benefits \never. I understand that. But this is also the worst recession in our \nlifetime, and we also need to understand that. I have received so many \nphone calls and letters from people all across my State who are trying \nso hard to get work. They are out every single day pounding the \npavement or checking the Internet. They are filling out applications. \nThey are sending out resumes. They are making phone calls, trying so \nhard to find a job so they can put food on the table for their family \nand, frankly, keep their head above water, try to keep their house \nabove water, to be able to have a roof over their head while they are \nlooking for work.\n  They want to work. They do not want to be getting unemployment \nbenefits. They do not want to be in this situation. They want the \ndignity of having a good-paying job so they can provide for themselves \nand their families.\n  I wish to share just one of the thousands of stories I received over \nthe last month. It comes from Janice in Sterling Heights, MI.\n\n       At the age of 54--\n\n  She writes--\n\n       I have already worked 35 years of my life. Back when I was \n     young, there was always talk of 30 and out. Never once did I \n     dream at my age that I would be unemployed for over a year. \n     That even though I apply for any job I am qualified for, I \n     never hear back. Now, all I have to look forward to is \n     working until the day I die, wondering where my health care \n     is going to come from, and how I am going to be able to \n     continue to pay my bills. I do not know how long I can hang \n     on until my current unemployment benefits run out. I have \n     nothing, nowhere to go, if evicted. I am so angry because I \n     was brought up that working hard all your life is what you \n     are supposed to do to have a home and a family and a \n     retirement.\n\n  That is exactly what we are talking about--people who do nothing but \nwork hard and play by the rules and are found in a situation they did \nnot create.\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       I am angry and disappointed in the government because they \n     are taking away benefits I have expected to be there after \n     working for 35 years and paying into this system.\n\n  There are millions of stories like Janice's, not only in Michigan but \nin every State. We have been working hard to create jobs, to get the \neconomy back on track. We have passed, according to Business Week, four \nmajor jobs bills, including the small business jobs bill passed a \ncouple of weeks ago and the President signed on Monday. That is \nexpected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. The reality is we are \nin a situation where the majority of our Republican colleagues voted no \non the small business jobs bill. Yesterday they blocked our ability to \nbring up a bill to close loopholes, to stop jobs being shipped \noverseas. We now stand asking that they not block again help for people \nwho can't find work because this economy is not moving fast enough.\n  I hope today my colleagues will join me in passing the Americans Want \nto Work Act. We should not walk away from so many Americans who are \nlooking for work and need our help. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsaying yes on something, yes to the millions of Americans who want to \nwork.\n  I will offer a unanimous consent request in a moment. I yield the \nfloor to my friend, the Senator from Rhode Island. Then I wish to \nreturn to make my unanimous consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan for her eloquent words that try to bring into this institution \nsome of the difficulties and anxiety and pain\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\nfamilies in our States particularly are feeling. Because while the \nnational unemployment rate is at an atrocious above 9 percent, in our \nStates it is considerably worse. In Rhode Island the unemployment rate \nhovers still around 12 percent. This has been a prolonged recession. \nFor many Rhode Islanders, they have been out of work for as long as \nunemployment insurance benefits allow. Now they are coming to the end \nof the 99-week period under which they are allowed to recover. The \nplain, unvarnished fact is that the jobs aren't there. In a different \neconomy, I might be less impatient with the argument that we have to \ncut off unemployment benefits on folks because, frankly, after a while \nthey get lazy. And if we don't cut off the benefits, then they will \nwait around, collecting their unemployment, goofing off and not going \nback to work. That is the argument I hear made against this all too \noften.\n  When one is in a State where the jobs simply are not there, where the \neconomy has not come close to recovering, then it is not logical, and \nit is heartless and wrong. There are now more than 65,000 Rhode \nIslanders out looking for work. By contrast, the economic recovery bill \ncreated 11,000 jobs in Rhode Island. It would be far worse were it not \nfor the action we took. But when we compare 11,000 families who now \nhave jobs and paychecks because of the Recovery Act to the 65,000 still \nwondering when is this economy coming back for me, clearly we have a \nlot of work to do. To extend unemployment benefits for those who have \nrun it through is the least we can do.\n  I remember visiting not too long ago Network Rhode Island, a job \nplacement agency in Pawtucket and speaking to a married couple, a \nmiddle-age married couple sitting side by side at one of the computer \nscreens looking for something. They come in to look every day. They \nhave filed hundreds of applications for jobs. They have been unable to \nfind anything because of the job market. They said: We are anxious. We \nare running out of our benefits. This was one of those occasions when \nthe Republicans had filibustered extending unemployment benefits, \nadding additional funding. I assured them that when we got back we \nwould be restoring those benefits, and we would be protecting them \nbecause we had that commitment and we had that determination. They \nsaid: No, you can't help us. We are in the 99ers. We have come to the \nend of the duration for which you are allowed to collect unemployment \nbenefits.\n  I felt helpless, that there was nothing we were doing for them. \nSenator Stabenow and I discussed this problem. She filed this wonderful \nlegislation, of which I was an immediate cosponsor. It addresses a \nproblem that at least in our States is very real.\n  Two of the Rhode Islanders who have written to us and contacted me \nabout this have let me use their images. Just so we are not always \ntalking about heartless, bloodless statistics on the floor, 12 percent, \n65,000, there are real people behind those statistics. There are real \nfamilies. There are those terrible late nights at the kitchen table \ntrying to figure out how you keep the mortgage, how you keep the health \ninsurance, what you cut, what you give up. Those are discussions that \nare being had by real families.\n  This is Michael Coppola. He lives in Smithfield. He was a truckdriver \nfor the same company from 2000 to 2007. He was laid off in October of \n2008 when his unit closed. This month Michael hits the current 99-week \nlimit for unemployment insurance benefits. He has had to give up health \ninsurance. He is trying to keep up with his mortgage payments so he \ndoesn't lose his house and add to the tide of foreclosures sweeping \nacross Rhode Island and the rest of the country. His wife is totally \ndisabled. As a result, she receives Social Security benefits and that \nis helping them keep the family together. But he wrote me to say:\n\n       Any extension of benefits for people like me who have \n     exhausted their benefits would help allow me to stay in my \n     house, pay my taxes, and [allow me] to regain my health \n     coverage.\n\n  Michael actually took this picture for us so we could have a picture \nhere to show on the floor and put a human face on this problem that is \nso often drowned in statistics.\n  Here is another Rhode Islander from Portsmouth. This is Nancy \nBabcock. Nancy is 59 years old. She lost her job about 24 months ago. \nShe had worked for 15 years steadily in the insurance industry. Next \nweek she hits her 99-week limit. She has been able to find a little bit \nof part-time work, but it has not been enough to pay her bills and keep \nher finances afloat. Rhode Island's WorkShare program has permitted her \nto supplement her unemployment insurance benefits with a small amount \nof part-time income. This is a woman who has worked essentially all her \nlife, who while on unemployment insurance has tried to find what work \nshe could find and was permitted and has continued to look for work. \nShe has a bachelor's degree. She has several industry certifications. \nShe has extensive background in sales and marketing. Despite the long \ndrought of unemployment she has had to live through, so many Rhode \nIslanders have had to live through, she is still out there every day \nlooking for work, hoping the economy will turn for her. She has been \ngoing through the classifieds, beating her feet against the pavement \ntrying to get to places where she might get an interview. She has been \nreaching out to friends, doing all the things that families do in this \ncircumstance, trying to reach out wherever she can, and still, after 99 \nweeks, to no avail.\n  I thank Senator Stabenow for her leadership. In a better world, this \nwould be an easy thing and the unanimous consent to allow us to go to \nthis bill and extend these unemployment insurance benefits would be \nuncontroversial. It should be clear to anybody that these people have \nlost their jobs and have been out of work for this lengthy period \nthrough no fault of their own. Michael was not fired for cause. Nancy \ndidn't lose her job because she did something wrong. The people who did \nsomething wrong were in Wall Street, with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, creating phony baloney securitization of home mortgages. \nMost of them got bailed out. The banks are back rolling, firing off the \nbig bonuses, reporting huge earnings, not loaning much money yet but \ntaking care of their folks, rolling in the paychecks and the bonus \nchecks. They are back on their feet again. But for the people who got \nclobbered by the tsunami of economic catastrophe that the Wall Street \nimplosion and the housing implosion set off, they are still being \nwashed around. Nobody has bailed them out.\n  Let's extend the unemployment insurance they have been contributing \nto, that they are a part of. Let's help our fellow Americans weather \nthis unique financial storm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. \nHe is correct. The folks at the top got bailed out, and middle-class \nfamilies are stuck on the hook. Five people looking for every one job. \nIt is critical that we act. I am hopeful that instead of hearing \nanother round of no, we will hear yes and that people will come \ntogether. There are millions of people out of work who have hit this \nwall. They are in every State. They are in red States, blue States, \npurple States. They are in every State. This should not be a partisan \nissue.\n  On behalf of millions, at least 2 to 3 million people who find \nthemselves in this particular situation, who are asking us to \nunderstand, who are asking us for help, asking us to give a lifeline to \nthem so they can care for their families and get back to work, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from S. \n3706, the Americans Want to Work Act; that the Senate then proceed to \nits immediate consideration; that the bill be read three times, passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statement \nrelating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I ask \nof my colleague from Michigan a couple of questions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. We have just been handed this. I wonder if my colleague \ncould let us know what the cost of this bill is and how it is paid for.\n  Ms. STABENOW. The bill is designated, as other unemployment \nextensions have been designated, as emergency spending, just as we \nwould do for\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\nany other catastrophe. If 15 million people out of work isn't an \neconomic disaster, I don't know what is. For the millions involved, \nthis is viewed as disaster assistance. We intend to move forward with a \nsense of urgency to put people back to work so in fact we will turn \nthis economy around.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Respectfully, without knowing how much it is going to \ncost and how we will pay for it, while we are all certainly sympathetic \nand want to work to make people go back to work--my home State of \nFlorida is certainly suffering with very high unemployment--we need to \nknow what it is going to cost and how we will pay for it so we don't \nput the debt on our children and grandchildren.\n  I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, the reality for us in America is that we \nwill never get out of debt. We will never get out of debt with more \nthan 15 million people out of work. We know it is substantially more \nthan 15 million. We know there are millions of others who have \nexhausted their benefits. When folks talk about the deficit and leaving \nthe deficit for our children, we will never get out of debt in this \ncountry until people get back to work, until they have good-paying \njobs. And in between time, we will not move this economy forward until \nwe are helping people to keep going in this recession.\n  We know from the economists that for every $1 we put into the kinds \nof benefits we are talking about in this bill, we are stimulating more \nthan $1.40 into the economy. So it more than pays for itself by the \neconomic activity, and it is viewed as one of the top two best ways to \nstimulate the economy in a recession: to put money in the pocket of \npeople who have to spend it because they do not have a job.\n  I deeply regret that one more time it is ``object'' and it is ``no'' \nunder the false argument that somehow we cannot afford to stimulate the \neconomy, to understand that this is about Americans who want us to \nunderstand what they are going through, and to give some temporary \nassistance that does stimulate the economy, while we are focusing on \nputting people back to work.\n  Unfortunately, this is the end of a week that demonstrates tremendous \nfrustration, after we were able to get the small business jobs bill \ndone, and then we hear ``no'' on efforts to stop jobs from going \noverseas, and ``no'' on helping the people caught because their jobs \nwent overseas. So I am deeply disappointed. We will continue to bring \nthe case of these millions of people to the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           NASA Authorization\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is a big day because in \nthe House, they are about to consider the NASA bill we passed by \nunanimous consent in the Senate back in the first week of August. It is \non what is called the consent calendar in the House which, in order for \nany of the six items on that consent calendar to be considered, they \nhave to pass with a two-thirds vote. They are generally items that are \nless controversial in nature. It is certainly my hope that is going to \nbe the case later this afternoon when the House takes up the NASA \nauthorization bill.\n  This is so important because the new fiscal year starts this Friday, \nOctober 1, and NASA is without direction. Even though the appropriation \nis going to be decided in our lameduck session starting in November--\nprobably by taking a whole bunch of appropriations bills and putting \nthem together into what is known as an Omnibus appropriations bill and \ntherefore the funding for NASA would be determined at that point. But \nthis bill, the authorization for NASA for funding, for appropriations, \nis the blueprint, the roadmap. Even though certain appropriations may \nnot be available until November or December, this gives direction to \nNASA to know what to do.\n  For example, in our bill--there is an additional shuttle that is \nready to fly beyond the two that are scheduled, one for November and \none for February. That hardware is ready to go, and there is still \nadditional equipment and supplies that we need to get to the space \nstation. So our proposal in the authorization bill is, which was agreed \nto by the Senate Appropriations Committee that appropriated very \nclosely to what the NASA authorization bill was in the Senate, it gives \nthe direction to NASA to go ahead and start the preparations for that \nthird flight of which all the hardware is already there. But they have \nto know that. They can't wait around until next January or February to \nstart that preparation; they have to start it now. These are some of \nthe critical issues.\n  It is also critical that, for example, at the Kennedy Space Center, \nthere are 1,100 jobs that are going to terminate tomorrow. This NASA \nauthorization bill lays out the program for the future so they can \nstart planning on some of those jobs that would be lost that may not be \nlost or recalled. That is why it is my fervent hope that we are going \nto get at least, if not more than, two-thirds of the House voting this \nafternoon to pass the NASA bill and then send it to the President for \nsignature next week.\n  Most of us have seen Ron Howard's dramatic film starring Tom Hanks \ncalled ``Apollo 13.'' Tom Hanks played the commander of that mission, \nwho was Jim Lovell. Remember, that was the mission, Apollo 13, where en \nroute to the Moon there was a major explosion onboard. We thought we \nhad basically three dead men because how were we going to bring them \nback. It is one of the greatest space successes coming out of failure \nbecause, real time, astronauts back in Houston and the engineers all \nover America--at the cape, at Houston, all in different NASA \nfacilities, the industries, the aerospace corporations--they all came \ntogether trying to figure out how we were going to get this crippled \nspacecraft back that had just lost its power, that had just lost its \nengines. Of course, that is one of the great success stories, that they \nbrought it back, and ``Apollo 13'' chronicles that enormous success.\n  Tom Hanks, who is playing Jim Lovell--in a part of the film, a person \nasks Jim:\n\n       Jim, people in my State are asking why we're continuing to \n     fund this space program, now that we've beaten the Soviets to \n     the Moon.\n\n  This is back in the late sixties and seventies because, remember, it \nwas President Kennedy who said: We are going to the Moon. And we landed \nwell before the Soviet Union did. They tried, but they never could make \nit. We landed in 1969.\n  That person said:\n\n       Jim, people in my State are asking why we're continuing to \n     fund this program, now that we've beaten the Soviets to the \n     Moon.\n\n  What does Jim Lovell say? He said:\n\n       Imagine if Christopher Columbus came back from the new \n     world--and no one ever returned in his footsteps.\n\n  If we had not had discoverers who were willing to discover the \nunknown, if they had not gone back to the new world, we would not be \nhere today. We would not have this wonderful country that has been \nbuilt.\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\n  I think it is a truth that a society which does not seek to expand \nand explore is not going to be a society that will foster freedom and \ncreativity, individuality, or progress.\n  Think about the birth of this Nation. We are, by nature as Americans, \nour character is that we are explorers, we are adventurers. We set out \nand explored this Nation, following the longings of our souls. And each \ngeneration born since has advanced constantly and consistently, such \nthat today we have to decide where do we go next.\n  This country always had a frontier. When John F. Kennedy announced \nthat we were going to the Moon, he had an administration that was \ncalled the New Frontier. We remember the development of this country. \nThe frontier developed westward. Where is that frontier now? That \nfrontier is upward. Then with the discoveries we are finding in \nscience, it is also inward. It is the discovery of matter. It is the \ndiscovery of the workings of the human body and how to keep it healthy. \nAnd it is the exploration upward of space.\n  What President Kennedy said was:\n\n       The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in \n     it or not.\n\n  He said:\n\n       It is one of the great adventures of all time--and no \n     nation which expects to be the leader among other nations can \n     expect to stay behind.\n\n  Since those prophetic words of President Kennedy back in the early \nsixties, when the Soviet Union had beat us into space with the first \nsatellite and then beat us into space with the first human to orbit, we \nsee what this Nation has done. Look at what we have received on Earth \nfrom the first 50 years of exploring space. We went to the Moon, and we \nhave gone beyond. We have gone out of the solar system with exploring \nsatellites, spacecraft. During this time, this space program has \nproduced thousands of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. And it \nhas helped make our Nation one of the most advanced and powerful in \nhistory. It has advanced the cause of science, and it has dramatically \nimproved the quality of life on the surface of the Earth.\n  Why do you think we have the GPS that can tell us, at a moment, the \npinpoint location of where we are? Why do you think we now take it for \ngranted to turn on our TVs and have instant, uninterrupted \ncommunication on the other side of the globe real time? Why do you \nthink we take it for granted that we turn it on if we hear of an \ninbound hurricane and that we can also monitor climate change?\n  We now, fortunately, have airbags in our automobiles. We have modern \nmedical miracles such as kidney machines and heart ultrasound equipment \nand LASIK surgery. Where do you think all these things came from? They \ncame from the spinoffs of the development of technology for the space \nprogram.\n  Look at a little watch such as this, which I have had for years. That \ncame out of the microminiaturization revolution. Where did that come \nfrom? Back when we were going to the Moon, we had to develop highly \nreliable systems that were small in volume and light in weight. That \nset off the microminiaturization revolution.\n  As a result of all these spinoffs, we have created new companies and \ntens of thousands--hundreds of thousands of jobs for skilled workers.\n  Back in the summer, working with the White House, we developed this \nbipartisan legislation to get NASA on what we think is off the wrong \ntrack and on the right track. As I said in my opening comments, the \nHouse is taking up the Senate bill in about an hour, hour-and-a-half.\n  What the President did was he declared Mars to be the ultimate goal. \nThe goal is not to go back to the Moon. We were there 40 years ago. The \ngoal is to get out of low-Earth orbit, get out of Earth's environment, \nand to explore the cosmos. The Senate bill provides the blueprint for \nNASA to lead the way for humans to explore beyond low-Earth orbit.\n  We recognize that more nations and more commercial operators can get \ninto space. Look at all the private services now that you can get from \na satellite: photographs of the ground, photographs of buildings--\nincredible--high-resolution photography. You can buy that from private \ncompanies.\n  The Presiding Officer used to be a major radio broadcaster off of a \nsatellite radio. Where do you think that comes from? That was developed \nwith technology that came out of the early days of the space program. \nThat has been perfected and is now a multibillion-dollar business that \nemploys Americans. Clearly, the Cold War shaped our space program to \nbegin with--we against our adversary, the Soviet Union, the two \nnuclear-tipped nations. Look now. We have built the International Space \nStation with the Russians and 14 other nations.\n  Now we have the space station there but the shutdown of the space \nshuttle coming in another year. The space station is being completed in \nits construction, but NASA was starved over the last decade, and we do \nnot have the new rocket ready. This legislation is going to reduce the \ntime we have to depend on Russia for access to space, even though they \nhave been a good partner, and their Soyuz spacecraft is a reliable way \nto get to and from the space station. It is going to shorten the time \nwe have to depend just on them to get to the International Space \nStation.\n  As a result of this new legislation, many of the space centers that \nwould receive huge layoffs--and as I said at the outset, there are \n1,100 pink slips that have been delivered and take effect tomorrow \nafternoon just at the Kennedy Space Center and 1,000 or so more are \ncoming at the Johnson Space Center and other space centers around. So \nwhat our legislation will do is it will push NASA's development of a \nnew heavy-lift rocket that will allow us to explore the cosmos, it will \npush it forward with a goal to fly by 2016, and it would make a \nsignificantly higher investment in commercial space ventures, \nspecifically by accelerating the development of commercial carriers to \ntake both cargo and crew to and from the International Space Station.\n  Previously, NASA was going to shut down the space station by 2015. \nThis is 2010, almost 2011. We are just completing the space station. \nAre we going to throw away, in 4 years, an investment of $100 billion? \nNo. What this bill does, upon the suggestion of the President--which I \nappreciate so much--it is going to keep the space station alive until \nthe year 2020.\n  Now we have the time to move forward and start to get out and explore \nthe cosmos. The bill develops the inspace technology that can help in \nthe servicing and reusing of equipment to lessen the need to launch \nfrom Earth for future trips. By that I mean we take this heavy-lift \nvehicle, we get components up into low-Earth orbit, and in the zero \ngravity of the orbit with the capability of on-orbit refueling, we can \nput spacecraft together up there and not have to expend the energy to \nget out of gravity when we go out to an asteroid or we go out \nultimately to Mars. It requires that this heavy-lift vehicle be \ndesigned to get us to other points beyond low-Earth orbit in a flexible \npath to Mars.\n  Rather than throw away the investments and capabilities that have \nalready been developed in this space shuttle, we direct NASA in this \nbill, to pursue an evolvable heavy-lift vehicle, one you can build from \nthe existing technology but you can improve that hardware.\n  At the same time, we insist that it be affordable. Designing and \nbuilding within a budget is obviously the new challenge for NASA. NASA, \ntoo long in the past, has blown through budgets. It is a different day. \nIt is a different discipline. That discipline is going to be needed at \nNASA.\n  Our objectives are now beyond just getting to and being in space. We \nmust now answer some questions. Can we harness new sources of energy in \nspace for use there and for use here on Earth? Can we sustain human \nlife on distant journeys? Present technology would take us 10 months. A \ncrewmate of mine is working on a plasma rocket that will take us to \nMars in 39 days. But the fact is, once we are there, we have to be on \nthe surface of Mars for a year. Why? Because of the alignment of the \nplanets, to get Mars back closest to Earth for the return trip. Can we \nsustain that human life? Can we develop the technology for those \njourneys? What about all the cosmic radiation from the Sun--nuclear \nexplosions. You can't fry your astronauts with radiation on the way to \nMars. Can we establish permanent outposts beyond Earth?\n  Our vision is, we are going to explore asteroids, possibly go back to \nthe\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\nMoon, and then to the surface of Mars, as this country, as the leader, \nand the rest of humanity journey toward the ultimate destiny in the \nstars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask consent to speak in morning business for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             THE FILIBUSTER\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we are only a few weeks away now from the \nNovember elections. Therefore, this is a time for reflection. For me, \nit is a time to recognize I am nearly through my first 2 years as a \nSenator. I must say it is an incredible privilege to come and be part \nof this debate among these 100 colleagues, representing our 50 States.\n  It is also time to ponder whether that debate works as well as it \nmight. The Senate is famed as the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld, but I have seen too little deliberation and too much \ndysfunction. At this time, as we prepare to return back home to our \ncitizens, to talk to our folks back home about the upcoming elections \nand the ideas they have, it is also time to think about when we come \nback, after these elections, after a new Congress comes in next \nJanuary, how can we make this Senate work better as a deliberative \nbody.\n  My perspective is affected not just by the time I spent here since \nJanuary 2009 but by the perspective of first coming here in 1976 as an \nintern for Senator Hatfield. So I thought I would compare the use of \nwhat is commonly termed the ``filibuster'' between the 1975-76 session \nand our last complete session, the 2007-2008 session. We had in that \n2007-2008 session the use of the filibuster on amendments 30 times. But \nif I turn the clock back to 1975-1976, 35 years ago, the number was \nzero. There were zero filibusters. Then, on motions to proceed, there \nwere 3 in 1975-1976; there were 49 in 2007-2008.\n  You get the picture. Not only is there a huge increase in the use of \nthe filibuster to block final votes but also a huge increase to stop \nvotes on amendments and a phenomenal increase to stop getting to a bill \nat all. Again, it was only used 3 times 35 years ago but 49 times in \nthe 110th Congress.\n  We cannot have a democracy that works if we can't debate and vote on \nbills. I have been pondering this. I have been pondering how first we \nneed to understand how these rules work. I used the term \n``filibuster,'' and indeed with that term everyone pictures ``Mr. Smith \nGoes to Washington.'' He stops a vote by continuing to speak, hour \nafter hour. But that is not actually how the rules work in the Senate. \nThe responsibility to block a vote, if you will, is not by those who \nobject to the regular order, who object to a vote of 51, but it is on \nthe majority to summon a supermajority.\n  So take that notion of a filibuster and continuous speaking and set \nthat aside because that is not the way it works in this body. The way \nit works is if a single Senator objects to the regular order of 51, \nthen the majority must obtain a supermajority of 60 to proceed. That is \nwhy you do not see folks holding the floor day and night to block a \nvote--because they do not have to. It is because the burden is on the \nmajority to get 60 votes to proceed.\n  This does a lot of damage. It does a lot of damage in terms of delay \nbecause when that single Senator says I object to the regular order of \n51 and demands 60, not only under the rules do they trigger a 60-vote \nrequirement but they also trigger a 1-week delay.\n  So you can imagine on a single bill, such an objection on a motion to \nproceed, an objection on one or two amendments, objection on final \npassage, and you now have a month wasted in this body without a final \nvote, with no terrific intervening debate because those who are \nobjecting do not need to stay on the floor and make their case. Not \nonly does this do a tremendous amount of damage to our responsibility \nas a Congress, as a legislative body, but it does a lot of damage to \nthe other branches of government because it means we cannot process the \nnominations for the judicial branch. So, many judgeships are sitting \nempty as a result.\n  It means we cannot proceed to the nominations of folks for the \nexecutive branch. So a President probably gets the Secretaries in \nplace, but often the second and third tier positions that develop the \npolicy and execute the work, implement the plans, those positions are \noften vacant. There is nothing in our Constitution that says the right \nto advise and consent and indeed the responsibility to advise and \nconsent gives this body the right to do damage to the other two \nbranches of government. Indeed, it is an abuse of our responsibility to \ndo so.\n  There are a number of things we should think about. I would like to \napplaud my colleagues who are putting forward so many ideas: Chuck \nSchumer, the chair of the Rules Committee, is holding hearings; Tom \nUdall, who is carrying our red rule book and studying it and thinking \nabout the ways we can change this body; Amy Klobuchar, who has \nrecognized for a long time that dysfunction is different than \ndeliberation; Michael Bennet from Colorado, and many others--my \ncolleague, Al Franken, who is presiding. So many in the freshman and \nsophomore classes recognize this body needs to change so we can do the \nwork we are expected to do by the American people.\n  So what are some of those ideas? One is to greatly reduce the use of \nthe supermajority, which I will call it, because it is a much more \naccurate description than the filibuster. Reduce the use of the \nfilibuster on nominations. Perhaps it should not be used on any \nnominations except perhaps to the Supreme Court. But find a line and a \nmethod to expedite nominations.\n  Second, reduce the use of the filibusters on motions other than final \nconsideration of a bill. There should not be a question about whether \nwe get to the point of debating a bill or whether we get to vote on \namendments because at each of those points, everyone would obtain or \nretain the final power to oppose or trigger a supermajority on the \nfinal vote.\n  Then, in regard to the ability to proceed to trigger a supermajority \non the final vote, put the responsibility squarely on the minority. It \nshould not be the majority's responsibility to get a supermajority. At \nleast those who are objecting should have to maintain a large number of \nSenators continuously on this floor day and night. If they believe so \nmuch that it is so wrong to proceed to a final vote, they should have \nthe courage and dedication to be here in a substantial number day and \nnight to make their point to the American people.\n  Let the American people respond to that demonstration of saying: Yes, \nwe are with you or, no, we are not, and let that final vote happen. We \nhave an issue about participation of the minority, and this is an \nextremely important point. I have heard many of my colleagues across \nthe aisle say: We are not guaranteed the opportunity to have \namendments. Well, that is a fair point. What if we were to have in this \nbody a fallback rule so that if the majority leader and the minority \nleader could not reach agreement on the number of amendments and the \ncontent of those amendments to be considered, that there would be a \nfallback position that both parties would get 5 amendments, or both \nparties would get 10 amendments, so that we could proceed back and \nforth--a Republican amendment, a Democratic amendment, a Republican \namendment, a Democratic amendment, a debate for an hour and a vote, \ndebate for another hour and another vote, therefore, having to respond \nand take positions on the issues of the day rather than seeing this \nChamber, without action, paralyzed.\n  These are the types of ideas that we need to wrestle with. We who are \nprivileged to be here as delegates from our States have a \nresponsibility to our citizens not just in our State but all the \ncitizens of this Nation to make this Chamber the deliberative body that \nwas envisioned by the Framers of our Constitution.\n  That is why next January, when we come in to start the next session, \nthe 112th Congress, we need to have a major debate over our rules. We \nneed to recognize that under the Constitution it only takes 51 Members \nof this body to adopt new rules. But in that context we have to do \nhonor to the ability of the minority party, whichever party that is, to \nfully participate in the process.\n  This situation in which the House passes 300 bills that never see the \nlight\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\nof day, never see consideration in the Senate because we cannot get \nanything done on the floor of the Senate, must end. We have a \nresponsibility to restore this body to being the greatest deliberative \nbody on the planet.\n  I yield the floor, and I subject the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Management of Arlington National Cemetery\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I am here to talk just \nbriefly about an issue to which I think I have actually found the \nsolution, the one thing that I think we can all agree on, and maybe \neither before we leave or during the lameduck we can work together on \nsomething I think is troubling for everybody of both parties.\n  I rise to speak today about an extremely important issue that has \nbothered me as somebody who continues to serve in the military, and \nothers who have any affiliation with the military or care deeply as to \nhow our military servicemembers are treated after they give the \nultimate sacrifice; that is regarding the severe mismanagement of the \nArlington National Cemetery, which has resulted in the mishandling of \nremains of many of America's fallen heroes who have served our country \nand given their lives to keep our Nation safe and our citizens free.\n  I want to first take a moment to recognize the work of Senator \nMcCaskill, the chairwoman of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on contracting oversight on this \nissue. She and I have held a hearing on this matter. I have to tell \nyou, it was one of the more frustrating hearings I have ever \nparticipated in, to listen to some of the responses, the cavalier \nanswers and lack of dignity paid to the reason we are all here. Then to \nlearn that through investigation, the causes of the absurd \nmismanagement and oversight lapses at the cemetery. During that July \n29, 2010, hearing, we took the first step of getting to the bottom of \nwhat was going on and working to identify real solutions that will make \nsure this never happens again.\n  I am pleased to be on the Senate floor today to announce the \nintroduction of legislation, Mr. President, I hope you will jump on and \ncosponsor to address these issues and to remedy the problems at \nArlington National Cemetery, which I am proud to sponsor with Senator \nMcCaskill.\n  I am sure I do not have to remind everybody listening and watching \nand anyone who serves here after all the reports that continue to be in \nthe news about Arlington National Cemetery that has suffered from \nsevere dysfunctional mismanagement and lack of established policies and \nprocedures.\n  I was shocked. I remember during the hearing that they actually still \nkeep all of the information on little cue cards, on little index cards. \nI mean, I have something that is a piece of modern technology that we \ncan keep everything on in an instant, the way that we communicate \naround the world in an instant. My kids are using it; my grandkids are \nusing it. Yet here we are, in one of the most historic cemeteries in \nour country, honoring the people who have given their lives through \nservice, and we are on index cards. Not only that, we are burying them \nin the wrong grave.\n  Some graves do not even have bodies in them. I mean, come on. Give me \na break. This bill establishes strict and recurring congressional \nreporting requirements for the Secretary of the Army to provide \nprogress on correcting the management, operations, burial \ndiscrepancies, and contracting issues at the Arlington National \nCemetery. The act also requires the Comptroller General to report on \nthe management and contracts of Arlington National Cemetery and the \nfeasibility and advisability of transferring Arlington National \nCemetery to the Veterans' Administration.\n  The enactment of this act will also provide the appropriate \ncongressional oversight to make certain that those responsible for \nmanaging the cemetery are being held accountable and meeting the \nhighest standards when it comes to ensuring the proper burial of \nAmerica's fallen men and women.\n  We absolutely cannot let this happen again at Arlington National \nCemetery or any other cemetery. As I said earlier, as a 30-year member \nof the Army National Guard, I have tremendous respect for the men and \nwomen serving in our Armed Forces. I know you do, too, and every other \nperson in this Chamber does who has made the ultimate sacrifice, as \nwell as the families who provide the support to allow them to do their \njobs.\n  These systematic problems at the cemetery have tarnished the sacred \ntrust and are extremely troubling. Everyone entrusted with the solemn \nobligation has to ensure that the heroes buried at Arlington National \nCemetery receive the utmost dignity and respect this country can offer.\n  Our legislation will help restore that so servicemembers' families \nwill never, ever again have to endure such devastating emotional \nturmoil. I can't even imagine what it would be like to say: I am going \nto visit my loved one, and walk in the cemetery and learn the place you \nhave been going for years, your loved one isn't even there or is maybe \nover there. The cavalier attitude of the people controlling this \noperation makes me deeply troubled.\n  Our legislation will provide assurances to our military members and \ntheir families that corrective actions are expeditiously implemented \nand that management of the cemetery will be fixed and fixed soon.\n  I am hopeful my Senate colleagues will join me and Senator McCaskill \nin supporting this very important piece of legislation. I hope this is \none piece of legislation we can all agree on and get done and send a \npowerful message to the families and the service men and women who are \nserving that we are not going to let this happen any longer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Sending Jobs Overseas\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I wish to describe my disappointment \nat the vote yesterday, a vote on whether we were going to shut down the \ndrain in this tub of ours down which we are draining American jobs. We \nare trying to create jobs and put new jobs into the economy. Now what \nwe have discovered is that the drain is wide open. Even as we talk \nabout this, we have American jobs going overseas in search of cheap \nlabor. We actually give a tax break in our IRS Code for allowing \ncompanies to shut their American plant, get rid of their American \nworkers, and move jobs overseas. We tried very hard to change that. I \nhave tried that in the past on four occasions. Yesterday was the fifth \nvote to say, at least let's stand up for American jobs. Let's not give \na tax break to move American jobs outside of the country, especially at \na time when millions of Americans are out of work. Let's not do that.\n  The proposal was to shut down that unbelievable tax break. The vote \nwas, no, we can't do it. Apparently on the floor of the Senate there is \nplenty of support for Chinese jobs. I didn't notice anybody got up in \nthe morning to come to this Chamber to support Chinese jobs. It seems \nto me the hard work here is to support American jobs.\n  I see the two leaders. When they wish to seek the floor, I will \ncontinue my discussion.\n  I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Every member of the minority \nvoted against a bill that stands up for American jobs and shuts down \nthe tax break for moving jobs overseas. We did get 53 votes. In other \neras of the history of the Senate, that would be enough to pass \nlegislation. Here it is not because everything needs 60 votes.\n  Let me yield the floor with the understanding that when the leaders \nare completed with their work, I know they have some important work \ntrying to wrap up the business of the Senate, I want them to be able to \ndo that, and then I will be recognized when their activity transpires.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture \ntime be considered yielded back and the motion to proceed to H.R. 3081 \nbe agreed to; that the Senate then proceed to the consideration of H.R. \n3081; that the bill be considered under the following limitations; that \nthe only amendments in order be the following: Inouye substitute \namendment, which is at the desk, and that once the amendment has been \nreported by number, it be considered read and not subject to division; \nInouye title amendment; DeMint amendment regarding extending length of \ntime on the continuing resolution; Thune amendment regarding reducing \nspending levels; that this amendment not be subject to a division; that \ngeneral debate on the bill be limited to 2 hours equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Inouye and Cochran or their designees; that \ndebate on each amendment be limited to 30 minutes, equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of all \nthe time, the Senate proceed to vote with respect to the amendments to \nthe substitute in the order in which they were offered; that each of \nthe amendments to the substitute amendment be subject to an affirmative \n60-vote threshold and that if they achieve that threshold, then they be \nagreed to and a motion to reconsider be laid on the table; that if they \ndo not achieve that threshold, then they be withdrawn; that upon \ndisposition of the amendments, the substitute amendment, as amended, if \namended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and \nthe Senate then proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that upon \npassage, the title amendment which is at the desk be considered and \nagreed to; further that no Budget Act points of order be in order to \nthe substitute or the bill. Further, that if there are any sequenced \nvotes, then there be 2 minutes equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form prior to each vote and that after the first vote, the \nremaining votes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  I also want everyone to understand it is my understanding Senator \nLeMieux wants to offer an amendment by consent to this agreement I just \nread.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding he will offer \nthat later. We can proceed then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                         Sending Jobs Overseas\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this unanimous consent agreement means we \nare now on a timeline to finish passing a continuing resolution very \nsoon. I appreciate the work everyone has done. I do want to finish what \nI was saying.\n  It was a profound disappointment to me that after all of this time, \ngoing back 9 years and five votes, that we were not able to get \nsufficient votes in the Chamber, 60 votes to shut down a tax provision \nthat rewards people who actually move their jobs overseas from this \ncountry. I won't go through the presentations I made previously, but it \nis quite clear that we need, on behalf of the American people, to say: \nOur job is to stand up for jobs in this country. Our work is to help \npeople get back to work here and to support businesses which produce in \nthis country, which decide to rent the building and hire the employees \nand produce here. That is what we ought to stand for. Yet those who \nproduce here and stay here are at a disadvantage, because there is a \ntax break given to those companies that move overseas and hire foreign \nworkers and then sell back into this country. That was the debate \nyesterday and the vote. Regrettably, not one Member of the minority \nvoted with us. That is a profound disappointment. We will all get over \nthat. But the people who are unemployed will not, if these jobs keep \nmoving overseas. That is the point.\n\n\n                     New York Philharmonic in Cuba\n\n  I did want to come for another reason. I will do this quickly. A long \nwhile ago I was on the floor talking about something that I think \nshould happen, and it needs the approval of this government to make it \nhappen, the approval of a license to make it happen. That is for the \nNew York Philharmonic to be able to perform in Havana, Cuba. It would \nbe a wonderful thing. They had to cancel a previous appearance because \nthey couldn't get a license from their government to allow them to do \nit.\n  Let me describe with a couple charts what brings me to this point and \nthe reason I want to talk about it for a moment. This is in the middle \nof the Cold War with Russia. This is Leonard Bernstein and the New York \nPhilharmonic shown here performing in Moscow in 1959. It is the oldest \nsymphony orchestra in America, since 1842, one of the most renowned \ncultural ambassadors for this country. It has performed all around the \nworld in 59 countries on 5 continents. It performed many times in \nCommunist countries with the full blessing of the U.S. Government. At \nthe height of the Cold War the orchestra was enthusiastically received \nin Moscow. The audience applauded for 30 minutes following their \nperformance. Conductor Bernstein took the New York Philharmonic to \nMoscow. Think of it.\n  In addition to performing in Moscow, the New York Philharmonic has \nperformed elsewhere. They have performed in North Korea. I have seen \nthe DVD of that performance. It was quite extraordinary, February of \n2008 in the capital of North Korea, the first ever concert by a U.S. \norchestra within the boundaries of that secretive state. We know that \nthere is a lot wrong with North Korea, but the conductor and the \npresident of the Philharmonic told me and a group of Senators that the \nState Department encouraged the visit of this orchestra, assisted with \narrangements. The concert In Pyongyang was broadcast live on State \nradio and television. They played music by George Gershwin in North \nKorea's capital, even played the Star-Spangled Banner. I saw the video. \nThe audience continued to applaud long after the orchestra had \ncompleted its music and left the stage.\n  This is a photograph of Hanoi, Vietnam in 2009.\n  The New York Philharmonic orchestra performed there, in Hanoi, \nVietnam. The demand for tickets was so great they simulcast the concert \nlive out on the streets of Hanoi.\n  The only country in the world in which the Philharmonic, at this \npoint, is not able to perform in is Cuba. They had to cancel a previous \nvisit to Cuba in October 2009. It was planned. But it was cancelled \nbecause they could not get a license from our government to travel to \nCuba.\n  The U.S. government allows anyone, including an orchestra, to travel \nto North Korea, to Iran, to any other country in the world; but you \nhave to have a license to travel to Cuba. Why is that the case? Because \nthe Castro brothers have stuck their fingers in America's eye for a \nlong time. We have an embargo against the country of Cuba, and we \ndecided we were going to take care of the Castro brothers in Cuba by \npunishing the American people and restricting their right to travel to \nCuba, unbelievably, in my judgment. We say to the American people: We \nare going to fix you. We will restrict the rights of the American \npeople to travel to Cuba. So they have.\n  Senator Enzi and I have a bill with a large number of cosponsors in \nthe Senate that would lift that travel restriction.\n  The reason I brought this issue to the floor of the Senate today is, \nI feel it is time to get a positive answer from this government--the \nTreasury Department and the State Department--to give a license to the \nNew York Philharmonic to make this trip and perform in Havana, Cuba. \nThey should not have to keep cancelling their plans because of U.S. \ngovernment restrictions.\n  Some say: Well, what is the difference? What matter does it make if \nthey are not able to travel? Do you know what? If you watch the DVD of \nthe New York Philharmonic performing in North Korea in 2008, and then \ntake a look at the clips and the pictures of them in Moscow in 1959, \nand then ask yourself whether it makes a difference for us to be able \nto send, in a cultural exchange, this wonderful, unbelievably world-\nclass orchestra to perform in these countries. I think it makes a \ndifference.\n  We are in a circumstance at the moment where if you do not have a \nlicense to travel to Cuba, violators, U.S. citizens, can be fined up to \n$50,000 by their government. It does not make any sense to me. That \nneeds to change. Criminal penalties could be $250,000 and\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\n10 years in prison for violating the travel ban. We need to change all \nthat.\n  In the meantime, I believe this government needs to provide a \nlicense, and they can do it under existing circumstances without \nchanging the policy at all. They need to provide that license to allow \nthe New York Philharmonic to be able to perform in Havana, Cuba. I am \ntalking to the Treasury Secretary and the Secretary of State and asking \nfor their cooperation. This is not something that is difficult. This \ncan be allowed under existing rules. Members of the New York \nPhilharmonic, and those who work with them and those who sponsor them, \nwho would participate fully in the youth programs in Havana, Cuba, can \nbe, in my judgment, approved with a license from the Treasury \nDepartment. I hope Secretary Geithner understands that and will take \nappropriate action. I know the Secretary of State wishes to see this \nhappen. I believe the Treasury Secretary would as well. I hope within \ndays they will make it happen.\n  I intend to work next week with all of those principals to see if at \nlast, at long last, we might be able to resolve this issue. This makes \nno sense to me, to decide that the way we are going to conduct \ndiplomacy is to prevent our Philharmonic Orchestra from playing in \nHavana, Cuba, given the fact they have played in the capital of North \nKorea, in Russia, in Vietnam, and more.\n  Mr. President, I was going to talk a little about energy and my \nprofound disappointment that we are going to end this session without \nhaving done something in energy, and how some of us are trying very \nhard between now and the lameduck session to at least get what is \ncalled a renewable electricity standard or at least perhaps get that \nplus the Electric Vehicle Deployment Act moving so we can advance our \ncountry's energy interests. I will find another time to talk about that \nissue.\n  I do want to finally say, in addition, before this Congress adjourns \nsine die at the end of the year, there must--there must--be a solution \nto two things. One is the Cobell settlement, because American Indians \ndeserve that settlement. It has been negotiated, is done, is ready. \nThis is an abuse of 120 and 150 years. It must be corrected, and that \nsettlement needs to be done. No. 2, what is called the Carcieri fix \nneeds to be resolved.\n  My colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, well \nunderstands this. Every Indian tribe that was recognized after 1934 has \nevery parcel of land they took into trust since that time now in legal \nquestion. The Congress cannot possibly leave this session without \naddressing that issue. The issue arises from a court decision that in \nmy judgment was wrong, but it places in jeopardy a wide range of \nfacilities on Indian reservations with respect to the status of their \nproperty ownership and their lease. I hope and I know Senator Inouye \nshares my feelings that we must, before the end of this year, address \nboth of these issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish the Record to show that I concur \nfully with my colleague and that I will do my absolute best to see that \nhis views are carried out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7703-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7703-S7715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed is agreed to and the clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3081) making appropriations for the Department \n     of State, foreign operations, and related programs for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today is September 29, which means that \nfiscal year 2010 will come to an end tomorrow at midnight. We should \nall keep that in mind because in order to avoid a government shutdown, \nthe Senate must act now to send this essential legislation to the House \nof Representatives.\n  I do not believe any of my colleagues wish the Government of the \nUnited States to be shut down on Friday, so I am hopeful we can avoid \nunnecessary amendments and work in a bipartisan fashion to pass this CR \nand send it to the House.\n  This is a clean continuing resolution that includes only those \nexceptions that are critical to allow the government to carry out its \nresponsibilities. I would note that according to the CBO scoring of \nthis bill, this resolution will fund the government through December 3, \n2010, at a rate that is approximately $8.2 billion below fiscal year \n2010 enacted levels.\n  Vice Chairman Cochran and I have done our best to ensure that this CR \nincludes only the bare minimum of what is necessary to continue \ngovernment operations until Members on both sides of the aisle are able \nto work out their differences and complete action on this year's \nappropriations bills.\n  In addition, the CR extends the temporary assistance for the Needy \nFamilies block grant program, which provides necessities such as food \nand clothing for those hardest hit by the struggling economy. This \nresolution also extends the current GSE loan limits, to prevent a \ndisruption of the home mortgage market. Finally, this measure will fund \ncurrent military operations for the next 2 months, ensuring that our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines will have what they need to \ncarry out their missions.\n  While I know there are many additional matters which the \nadministration and other Members of the Senate wish to have included, \nwe have been unable to reach a bipartisan agreement to do so. But I can \nassure my colleagues that everything essential to continue government \nservices has been included.\n  Time is short, and we have before us a clean CR that has the bare \nminimum of exceptions necessary to avoid disruptions to government \nservices that is approximately $8.2 billion below fiscal year 2010 \nlevels, and that has the approval of both the majority and minority \nleaders.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to support this CR and to send it to the \nHouse as quickly as possible.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nexpended during the quorum call be equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes. My \nunderstanding is that Senator Thune is coming to the floor in a moment \nto offer an amendment to the continuing resolution that would reduce \nspending in the continuing resolution by 5 percent on discretionary \nitems that are nondefense oriented.\n  I want to say that I just came from a meeting with Chairman Bernanke \ntalking about our debt situation. I know we have a Deficit Reduction \nCommission right now that is working on that and will have a report due \non December 1. But I think everyone in this body understands it is a \nhuge issue for our country and that right now the markets have allowed \nus to have lower interest rates because we are considered to be a safe \nhaven. But the fact is, at some point in time we all understand this is \ngoing to disconnect and, in fact, we will pay higher interest rates \nbecause of our lack of ability to control our spending.\n  I think a great first step for us to be able to walk into--hopefully, \nsomething constructed by the Deficit Reduction Commission and, if not, \nby our own actions this next year, where we know the No. 1 issue that \nthreatens our economic security in this country--and\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\nby virtue of threatening our economic security, it threatens our \nnational security--is the huge amount of spending that is taking place. \nI think we have all seen throughout the country what I would say is a \nvery centered and deep concern about the amount of money we spend here \nin Washington.\n  I want to say, anybody who thought last year's appropriations bills \nwere far higher than they should have been should support the Thune \namendment. The fact is, what we are actually doing by virtue of the CR \nthat has been offered is we are actually continuing spending at 25 \npercent of our gross domestic product, which is a full 5 percentage \npoints above our historic 50-year average of 20.3 percent.\n  I think the Thune amendment is an appropriate first step. I think all \nof us in this body know that over the course of the next couple years \nwe are going to have to take Draconian steps to rein in spending, which \nhas been out of control. We are operating this year without even a \nbudget.\n  I do not cast blame. I just want to focus on solutions. The very best \nway we can start walking toward a solution that ensures continued \neconomic security in this country is to support the Thune amendment.\n  I am here to talk for a few minutes. I know the Senator from Arizona \nhas just stepped on the floor. I think the Thune amendment is \nthoughtful. I hope all of us on both sides of the aisle will consider \nit thoughtful, and that we will get behind it.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, obviously we are 1 day away from the end \nof the fiscal year. We have before us a continuing resolution, better \nknown as a CR. It totals over $1.1 trillion to fund the operations of \nthe Federal Government through December 3, after the elections.\n  In addition to continuing appropriations, this measure also includes \nnumerous authorizing provisions from the fiscal year 2011 Defense \nauthorization bill. We shouldn't have to selectively tack important, \ndefense-related provisions on to appropriations bills in order to meet \nthe pressing needs of the Armed Forces.\n  The majority has decided to wait until the very last minute to bring \nthis stopgap measure to the floor with the hope that Members will \nsimply vote yes so that we can all go home and focus on the upcoming \nelections. I will not be voting yes. I will be voting no. If we pass \nthis resolution, we can be assured that we will be considering yet \nanother massive omnibus spending bill in December. The simple fact that \nwe are considering this continuing resolution is evidence of the \nmajority's inability to lead effectively and do the people's business.\n  As I said, we are 1 day from the end of the fiscal year. This body \nhas not considered a single one of the annual appropriations bills on \nthe floor. We have a $13.5 trillion debt and a deficit of nearly $1.4 \ntrillion. Yet we have not debated a single spending bill or considered \nany amendments that would cut costs or get our debt under control.\n  Furthermore, the majority decided they just didn't feel like doing a \nbudget this year, so we didn't do a budget this year.\n  On top of all of this, the majorities in both Houses have decided \nthere will be no debate, no vote on extending the tax cuts that are due \nto expire at the end of this year. On Monday of this week, the New York \nTimes published an editorial called ``Profiles in Timidity.'' The \neditorial stated, in part:\n\n       We are starting to wonder whether Congressional Democrats \n     lack the courage of their convictions, or simply lack \n     convictions.\n       Last week, Senate Democrats did not even bother to schedule \n     a debate, let alone a vote, on the expiring Bush tax cuts. \n     This week, House Democrats appeared poised to follow suit.\n\n  The New York Times goes on to say:\n\n       This particular failure to act was not about Republican \n     obstructionism . . . This was about Democrats failing to \n     seize an opportunity to do the right thing and at the same \n     time draw a sharp distinction between themselves and the \n     Republicans.\n\n  Those are not my words; those are the words of the New York Times.\n  Anyone who converses with people in the business community around \nthis country, whether it be small businesspeople or whether it be the \nlargest, all of them will say the same thing: We have no certainty \nabout what the financial future will hold, whether we will see tax \nincreases or whether we will see tax cuts. What about the estate tax? \nWhat about all of these other ``tax cuts'' that will or will not be \nextended?\n  So rather than act one way or the other, we have now punted the ball \ndown the field until after the election. At least we should have taken \nit up and debated and voted. I will stand by my vote to extend all the \ntax cuts because I don't believe we should increase anybody's taxes in \ntough economic times. But instead we will punt, go home, campaign, and \nthen sometimes be curious why the approval rating of Congress is \nsomewhere in the teens.\n  We have no business at the eleventh hour considering a continuing \nresolution so we can pack up and go home. We should stay here, in \nsession, and consider each and every appropriations bill in regular \norder and give Members ample opportunity to offer amendments. Following \nthat, we should debate the Defense authorization bill and consider all \namendments by Members, not just those the majority deems necessary to \nplease their base.\n  When the authorization bill was proposed to be brought up on the \nfloor of the Senate, on this side, we said: Let's have 10 amendments on \neither side--10 amendments on each side--and we will move forward with \nregular debate and votes. The majority leader didn't want that to \nhappen. The majority leader only wanted to consider don't ask, don't \ntell, secret holds, and the DREAM Act, and then take the bill off the \nfloor and wait until--guess what--after the elections. That is not how \nthis body should operate. We should consider all amendments. We would \nagree to time agreements. And if there are tough votes to be taken, \nthat is why we are sent here--to take tough votes.\n  We should debate and vote on whether to extend the tax cuts, as I \nsaid. Each day this issue is left unresolved, millions of American \ntaxpayers and small business owners are left without the ability to \nproperly budget for the next year.\n  At a townhall meeting, a guy stands up and says: I am a CPA. I make a \nliving advising people how they should adjust their estates and their \nexpenses and their investments based on, at least in part, what kinds \nof tax liabilities they will be facing. I can't do my job because we \ndon't know.\n  The environment of uncertainty is holding back investment and job \ncreation in this country, and at least the people of this country \nshould have the right to know what their taxes are going to be next \nyear. That won't be the case.\n  Let me return for a minute to the continuing resolution and the very \nserious concerns I have about one of its provisions. According to the \nAppropriations Committee and press reports, section 146 of this bill \nwould authorize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to continue buying and \nguaranteeing mortgages up to $730,000 in expensive housing markets \nthrough September of next year. Under current law, that amount was \nscheduled to drop to $625,000 at the end of this year. One would think \nthat by now we would all be sensitive to the disastrous fiscal \nimplications of Fannie's and Freddie's performance and find ways to \nrein them in rather than maintain or expand their operations. Fannie \nand Freddie are synonymous with mismanagement and waste and have become \nthe face of too big to fail.\n  Congress had the responsibility to ensure that Fannie and Freddie \nwere properly supervised and adequately regulated. Congress failed, and \nthe devastation caused by that failure continues to reverberate across \nthe Nation every day.\n  A recent editorial in the Dallas Morning News said:\n\n       They--Fannie and Freddie--had long ago evolved from the \n     modest backer of loans that met high underwriting standards \n     into full-scale casino players in high-risk mortgages. By \n     purchasing or backing the loans of mortgage companies and \n     banks, Fannie and Freddie made it possible for lenders to \n     create more money for new loans to new homeowners.\n       But Fannie and Freddie also conveniently benefited from \n     their hybrid status: They could make loans at advantageous \n     rates and run to Washington at the first sign of trouble. As \n     a major political donor, they seldom\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\n     heard the word ``no'' anywhere inside the Beltway.\n\n  That is right. They seldom heard the word ``no'' anywhere inside the \nbeltway. Some suggest that because of their deep pockets and generous \ncampaign contributions, Congress routinely overlooked the growing \nproblems at Fannie and Freddie and allowed them to continue operating \nin the most obscene, corrupt fashion.\n  So where are we now? To date, the American taxpayer has spent $160 \nbillion to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and experts estimate \nthose costs could rise to over $1 trillion. Isn't it time we phase them \nout of being a government-supported enterprise? So why in the world \nwould we provide these failing institutions with authority to continue \nto buy these high-dollar mortgages? It makes no sense.\n  My colleagues might recall that in May I offered an amendment to the \nfinancial regulatory reform bill to address the serious problems \nsurrounding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The amendment was designed to \nend the taxpayer-backed conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nby putting in place an orderly transition period and eventually require \nthem to operate without government subsidies on a level playing field \nwith their private sector competitors. Unfortunately, but not \nsurprisingly, that amendment failed.\n  The time has come to end Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's taxpayer-backed \nfree ride and require them to operate on a level playing field. Fannie \nand Freddie continue to post loss after loss and are failing right in \nfront of our eyes. For Congress to yet again allow them to continue \nbusiness as usual is the height of irresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, a cursory review of the record will \nindicate that the Appropriations Committee has 12 subcommittees. Eleven \nof these subcommittees have reported their bills to the full committee, \nand they have all passed. They are on the desk, ready to go. But \nsomething has happened in the interim.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep in mind that the bulk of them--by that, I \nmean nine of the subcommittee bills--were passed by the middle of July. \nThat is a long time ago. We have had hearings with not one or two \nwitnesses but hundreds of witnesses. We have discussed and debated all \nof the items in the measure, and we present that to the floor and we \ntry to schedule them, but there are holds and threats of filibuster and \nsuch. Therefore, I want the Senate to know that the Appropriations \nCommittee has done its utmost to make certain that these measures are \npassed in the regular order.\n  One subcommittee has not been able to conclude its resolution because \na new budget agreement just came in--a budget amendment which the \ncommittee has to consider, and therefore they have to look it over. We \nare not just cursorily rubberstamping every budget amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4674\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. President, I have a substitute amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4674.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion for a \nquorum call.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I will. I did not see the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout where we are. There is no question the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee has finished his bills, and they have not come \nup. But the quality of the work doesn't meet with the depth of the \nproblem we have today, No. 1; No. 2, it doesn't address the concerns of \nthe American public.\n  So we are going to have a continuing resolution that we are going to \npass through this body tonight, probably by a vote of about 80 to 20 or \n75 to 25. But the signal we are sending is based on our tin ear. We are \ngoing to continue spending at the same rate we have been spending. We \nare borrowing $4.2 billion a day under this continuing resolution. The \ngovernment now is twice as big, in terms of expenditures, not including \nthe war, as it was in 1999. We are not addressing what the American \npeople want us to address; that is, that we ought to start living \nwithin our means.\n  I will not offer an amendment to the bill. There are several \namendments. My colleague from South Dakota offered one that will bring \nus back to 2008 levels, but that is not enough. The fact is, we have to \nengage the American public in what is rightfully a cogent criticism of \nthe Congress; that is, that we are allowing wasteful Washington \nspending to go on, not by intent--and I am not questioning anybody's \nmotives--but the fact is, we have not done our job in terms of \noversight.\n  We heard Senator McCain talk about the tax cuts and raising taxes \nduring a very soft economic time. The vast majority of the Americans \ndon't want us to do that. I don't know why we are not discussing it, \nand I don't know why we are leaving town before we send that signal, \nbut that is way above my pay grade.\n  What I will tell you is, I can take any group of Americans and sit \ndown and go through this with them and show them, without question, \n$350 billion worth of waste every year in the Federal Government. The \namendment of my colleague from South Dakota is cutting less than $50 \nbillion from what we are going to spend--in fact, we did it in 2008, \nother than for homeland security, defense, and veterans. So even though \nI love what my colleague is doing, it doesn't go nearly far enough \ncompared to what the real need is for us.\n  There are two real needs. One, if we are going to finance the debt we \nhave today, we have to send a message and signal to the world that we \nare interested in getting our house back in order, that we are \ninterested in becoming efficient, and interested in becoming austere \nwith our taxpayers' money. The second message we need to send is to \nthose who have capital in this country; that they, in fact, can have \nconfidence that we are going to right this ship, and we will start \nseeing them deploy some of those assets to create the very jobs we so \ndesperately want for the American people who do not have them today.\n  I have been here long enough to know what is going to happen. But \nwhat I wish to do is register my dissatisfaction that we are not \naddressing the real problems in front of our country today. Instead, we \nare ducking out on tough decisions so we can go home--and I am up for \nreelection as well--and get to the voters. My question is a much more \npowerful message than going to the voters; it is us making hard choices \nthat the American people want us to make.\n  This week, the 2010 fiscal year is coming to a close. On October 1, \n2010, it will become the new budget year. Here is what we failed to do \nas a body--our fault just as much as yours. We didn't pass a budget. We \ndidn't set priorities. We didn't decide where to spend and where to \nsave. We didn't pay for new spending--$266 billion in the last 6 months \nin this Congress on new spending that we waived pay-go on and borrowed \nit against our children. We didn't pass any appropriations bills. We \ndidn't make any tough choices. We didn't conduct any significant \noversight on the waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government or \nthe duplication in the Federal Government. We didn't eliminate any \nduplicative or ineffective programs--not one. We didn't do our job. No \nwonder America is disgusted with us.\n  What did we do? We increased the debt limit to more than $14 \ntrillion. We added more than $1.4 trillion to the deficit and charged \nit to our grandchildren. We ignored the Constitution and expanded \nWashington's reach into our private lives, shrinking freedom\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\nand growing government. We put ourselves first and the country second. \nDespite promises from us that government programs can solve every \nchallenge, taxpayers are getting ripped off. We sent $1 trillion of \ntheir income to the Treasury this year just to watch it waste $350 \nbillion. At the same time, we created a lot of new programs, and some \npeople are very proud of them. I am very worried about them. But I give \nyou the credit that you went down the road you thought was right and \ndid it.\n  The real problem is, we are continuing the same old habits. The real \nissue is, until we truly understand the severity of the difficulty we \nare in and start acting like we understand it, this ship is going to \ncontinue to sink. We are not going to create the confidence in the \nAmerican public or the $2 trillion that is sitting on the sidelines \nright now if, in fact, they had a clear signal it would start flowing \ninto investment and capital that would create jobs.\n  Last December, my office spent 3 weeks just looking at duplicative \nprograms. When we passed the debt limit, we agreed with an amendment I \ninserted that the GAO would give us a list of those. They are starting \nthat work, and this February we will see the first large tranche of \nthat. It is going to take 3 years to compile that because the \ngovernment is so big.\n  We ought to have a little taste, and the American people ought to \nhave a little taste, of what we didn't get rid of and didn't fix. We \nhave 1,399 Federal programs that serve rural America; 337 of them are \nconsidered key. One thousand of them aren't considered key. They are \nnot considered substantive. That is before you even take the test of \nsaying whether they are authorized by the U.S. Constitution.\n  The Federal Government operates 70 programs costing tens of billions \nof dollars that provide domestic food assistance--70 different \nprograms--and many of them overlap or are inefficient. Most of them \ncannot demonstrate they are effective. That is according to a recent \nreview by the Government Accounting Office. We didn't fix it. We could \nhave saved taxpayers some of that money. There are 14 programs \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Education related to foreign \nexchanges and designed to increase opportunities for students to study \nabroad. Why do we have 14 programs? Why not have one good one that \nmeets the needs of Americans?\n  We fund 44 job training programs, administered by 9 Federal agencies \nacross the bureaucracy. The cost is $30 billion a year, and we don't \nknow what the overhead is because we have 44 programs instead of 2 or \n3. We didn't address any of that. There are 17 offender reentry \nprograms across 5 Federal agencies, costing $\\1/4\\ billion. There has \nbeen no oversight. In other words, we have not looked where the \nproblems are. We have not looked to say: How do we make this government \nmore efficient?\n  What we have done is to say we are going to raise taxes--or at least \nwe are not going to vote on raising taxes until after the election. No \nmatter whether you are middle income, lower income, or upper income, it \nmakes no sense for us to say we need more money here, when we will not \ndo the very simple job of eliminating the waste.\n  I don't question the motivation for job training programs; I think \nthey are necessary. I don't question the motivation for food programs; \nI think they are necessary. But 44 and 70 different programs, with 70 \nsets of bureaucracies and 44 sets of bureaucracies? Then we are going \nto tell Americans they should pay more tax, when we will not even do \nthe simple thing to save $100 million here or there. With a $30 billion \nprogram, if you save 10 percent, that is $3 billion. So all you have to \nsave is one-tenth of 1 percent or three-tenths of 1 percent. We will \nnot even do that.\n  I have a book full of duplicative programs. It is available to \nanybody who wants it. We ought to ask what kind of rating or grade \nwould the American people give us--Republicans and Democrats alike--in \nterms of running the government, funding the government, and working to \nmake the government efficient and effective. I don't think we have any \ngood defense. I think people's intentions around here are excellent, \nbut we never get around to the hard work of holding the bureaucracies \naccountable.\n  Senator Carper had a great hearing today on the Defense Department \nand the fact that the Defense Department is trying to get where they \ncan manage what they are doing by measuring it with a significant \nsystem, in terms of IT. It is just $6.9 billion over budget. Where is \nthe oversight on that procurement? What the GAO said is the following: \nThe management was ineffective at looking at those programs. The \nmanagement was ineffective in the testing of those programs during \ntheir development. The management was ineffective in terms of the \nprocurement of those programs. When I asked the heads of every branch \nin the military whether they agreed with that, they said, yes, they \nagreed they were ineffective.\n  We don't have anything in the appropriations bills to change that \neffectiveness. We didn't have anything in the Defense authorization \nbill to change that effectiveness. We are just going to let it go on, \nand next year it will be $7.9 billion or $8.9 billion over. So we are \nnot doing our job.\n  That is not to question my colleagues' motive; it is to raise the \nawareness that the jig is up. The American people know we are not doing \nour job. They want us to start doing our job--both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  We have several colleagues on the floor. Rather than take more time, \nI just note that I am consistent in terms of coming down here and \nworrying about our future. I have done so for 5\\1/2\\ years--much to the \nchagrin of a lot of my colleagues. I wish to leave you with one \nstatement.\n  Our children deserve to have the same opportunities in this country \nthat we have experienced. By us failing to do the very duties that are \ncalled upon us in a rational, straightforward basis, of doing oversight \nof the Federal Government and making the hard choices, we abandon our \noath, but, more importantly, we steal the heritage that was given to \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4676 to Amendment No. 4674\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 4676 and ask that it be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4676 to amendment No. 4674.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce spending other than national security spending by 5 \n                                percent)\n\n       Strike section 101 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 101. (a) Such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate \n     for operations as provided in the applicable appropriations \n     Acts for fiscal year 2010 and under the authority and \n     conditions provided in such Acts, for continuing projects or \n     activities (including the costs of direct loans and loan \n     guarantees) that are not otherwise specifically provided for \n     in this Act, that were conducted in fiscal year 2010, and for \n     which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made \n     available in the following appropriations Acts:\n       (1) Division A of the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act, 2010 (division A of Public Law 111-118).\n       (2) The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, \n     2010 (Public Law 111-83) and section 601 of the Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 111-212).\n       (3) The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, division E of the \n     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 111-117).\n       (4) Chapter 3 of title I of the Supplemental Appropriations \n     Act, 2010 (Public Law 111-212), except for appropriations \n     under the heading ``Operation and Maintenance'' relating to \n     Haiti following the earthquake of January 12, 2010, or the \n     Port of Guam: Provided, That the amount provided for the \n     Department of Defense pursuant to this paragraph shall not \n     exceed a rate for operations of $29,387,401,000: Provided \n     further, That the Secretary of Defense shall allocate such \n     amount to each appropriation account, budget activity, \n     activity group, and subactivity group, and to each program, \n     project, and activity within each appropriation account, in \n     the same proportions as such appropriations for fiscal year \n     2010.\n       (5) Section 102(c) of chapter 1 of title I of the \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 111-212) \n     that addresses guaranteed loans in the rural housing \n     insurance fund.\n       (6) The appropriation under the heading ``Department of \n     Commerce--United States\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\n     Patent and Trademark Office'' in the United States Patent and \n     Trademark Office Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 \n     (Public Law 111-224).\n       (b) Such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for \n     operations 5 percent less than the applicable appropriations \n     Acts for fiscal year 2010 and under the authority and \n     conditions provided in such Acts, for continuing projects or \n     activities (including the costs of direct loans and loan \n     guarantees) that are not otherwise specifically provided for \n     in this Act, that were conducted in fiscal year 2010, and for \n     which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made \n     available in the following appropriations Acts:\n       (1) The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \n     Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 \n     (Public Law 111-80).\n       (2) The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 111-85).\n       (3) The Department of the Interior, Environment, and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 (division A of \n     Public Law 111-88).\n       (4) The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2010 \n     (division A of Public Law 111-68).\n       (5) The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law \n     111-117), except for division E.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as you know, the budget-appropriations \nprocess has broken down. Neither the House nor the Senate passed a \nbudget resolution which provides a basic roadmap for our spending \ndecisions for the next fiscal year.\n  As a result of not having a budget, not a single appropriations bill \nhas been signed into law for the new fiscal year that starts tomorrow \nat midnight. The House has passed only 2 of its 12 appropriations \nbills. Unfortunately, this 17-percent batting average, 17-percent \nsuccess rate surpasses the Senate which has failed to pass any of the \n12 appropriations bills.\n  Because of this, we find ourselves considering a measure to provide \nstopgap funding through December 3 to provide more time for completion \nof our annual appropriations bills.\n  This delay and lack of floor debate on any of the annual \nappropriations bills has prevented us from having a much needed debate \non the size of government and the amount of money we should be \nspending.\n  Keep in mind, the overall growth in nondefense spending since 2008 \nhas amounted to roughly 21 percent at a time when inflation has \namounted to only 3.5 percent. This excludes any mention of the $814 \nbillion stimulus bill.\n  The continuing resolution before us today seeks to provide funding at \nthe same rate as fiscal year 2010. I will say that I am somewhat \npleased to see that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nnot attempted to add other funding measures to this measure. That is \ncommendable that we at least are going to do a continuing resolution \nthat is relatively speaking clean. It would be my preference to dial \nback the overall spending level to the fiscal year 2008 levels.\n  I have introduced legislation that will do just that, as have some of \nmy colleagues. Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma has a bill that will do \nthat. Some of my House colleagues have come up with a similar proposal \nthat will do that. I guess I would say to my colleague from Oklahoma \nwho just got up and spoke and mentioned this amendment probably does \nnot go far enough that I do not disagree. Frankly, I would like to see \nus go back to the 2008 levels.\n  What I am trying to do today is seek the support of my colleagues to \nat least take a measured step in reducing discretionary spending. My \namendment simply seeks to reduce by 5 percent accounts not related to \ndefense, homeland security, or veterans. This would not affect funding \nfor the START treaty or any of the other new provisions in this \ncontinuing resolution.\n  On an annualized rate, it would, however, save us about $22 billion \ncompared to the $1.25 trillion score that CBO has provided for the \nproposed continuing resolution before us today.\n  While this is a modest number and it is not going to solve our debt \nproblems overnight, it is a necessary first step to reduce spending. \nSince nondefense discretionary spending has grown over 21 percent in \nthe last 2 years--again, at a time when inflation was only 3.5 \npercent--I think the least we can do is support this reasonable \nreduction until we return after the election to decide what the \nremaining funding level should be for the fiscal year 2011 spending \nbills.\n  To put things into context as my colleague from Oklahoma, who just \nfinished speaking, has done, we are looking at a $13.4 trillion debt. \nOur deficit for 2010 is estimated to be $1.3 trillion. About 40 cents \nout of every dollar that is spent in Washington, DC, by the Federal \nGovernment now is borrowed.\n  If we look at the last 34 years, there have only been four times--4 \nyears--where all the appropriations bills have been passed on schedule.\n  If we actually did go to a freeze at 2008 spending levels and index \nit for inflation, it would save $450 billion over 10 years. That makes \na lot of sense.\n  As I said, that is legislation I introduced earlier. At a minimum, \nwhat we ought to be able to do is say to the American people, at a time \nwhen many of their family budgets are shrinking, at a time when they \nare trying to make ends meet, that we get it. In Washington, DC, we \nunderstand: You want our Federal Government to do with a little bit \nless.\n  What I am proposing is a 5-percent haircut; that is all, 5 percent. \nThat is the least we can do for the American people at a time when, as \nI said, we are running these $1.3 trillion deficits and have future \ngenerations of Americans faced with a massive amount of debt that will \nbe on their backs for generations to come.\n  I hope today we can find the political will in the Senate to take \nwhat I think is a very modest, a very measured approach to reduce \nspending in this continuing resolution by 5 percent. When we come back \nin December, we can have a full-blown debate about what the size of \ngovernment should be, which we should be having now and should have \nbeen having throughout the course of these last few months when these \nappropriations bills should have been debated and should have passed a \nbudget.\n  That being said, we do not have a budget. We have not passed \nappropriations bills. We are where we are. The least we can do, in \nfairness to the American people, the taxpayers of this country, is send \na clear message to them that we are going to do a modest amount, at \nleast a 5-percent reduction over last year's level in this continuing \nresolution and try in a very small way to get some of the overspending \nthat is occurring in Washington, DC, under control.\n  Mr. President, 21 percent over the past 2 years at a time when the \ninflation rate was 3.5 percent, meaning that we are spending at the \nFederal level five to six times the rate of inflation, what the rate of \nprice increases are across this country for most Americans. That is not \nfair to the American taxpayers. I hope my colleagues will support this \namendment.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is here. I believe he wants to speak \nas well to this issue and to this amendment. I yield as much time to \nhim as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nyielding. I stand here in support of the Thune amendment and thank him \nfor his leadership on this good first step.\n  To me, it is pure common sense. I agree with everything he has said \nin terms of we have overspent. It is time to draw a line in the sand, \nlead by example, and show the American people that they are doing \nwithout, and we can do without.\n  We are only talking about 5 percent. It is $22 billion. I remember--\nit seems like 10 years ago I got here. I remember being in the \nMassachusetts Legislature, and we were throwing around millions. Here \nthey throw around trillions like it is nothing. I know it is only $22 \nbillion we can save, which is still real money where I come from, and \nso over $300 billion potentially over a 10-year period.\n  It is time. It is time to start leading by example. It is time to \nshow we can also make some cuts. Quite frankly, I do not think they \nwill hurt. We need to send a signal to our constituents and to the rest \nof the world that we are trying to finally get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  I just met with representatives from Great Britain. They are doing \nacross the board a 25-percent cut. They recognize they do not want to \nbe in a similar financial predicament as other countries in that part \nof the world. They are sending a very powerful bipartisan message to \nthe people in that country\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\nthat they have to get their fiscal house in order. We need to start \nsending that very same powerful fiscal message to do the same thing.\n  I remember when I got here back in the beginning of January, the \nnational debt was about $11.95 trillion. As Senator Thune just pointed \nout, it is almost $13.3 trillion or $13.4 trillion right now. That is \nless than 7 months. Our deficit is over $1 trillion.\n  At what point do we eliminate the inefficiencies and duplications \nthroughout our Federal Government, as Senator Coburn has identified \ncuts in many wasteful programs? I agree with him. We have to start \nsomewhere. Can we not do just one thing--just one, that is it--to show \nthe American people that, yes, we get it, we feel your pain, we get it. \nIt is time. They are sending a very powerful message. They sent it in \nJanuary and they are sending it again that they are tired of \noverspending, they are tired of deficit spending, they are tired of \novertaxing. We have to get our fiscal house in order.\n  I thank Senator Thune for his leadership and Senator Coburn for \ntaking the time to find all these duplicate programs.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before the Senator from Massachusetts \nyields the floor, will he yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Yes.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he is hearing from \nhis constituents back in his State the same message I hear from my \nconstituents in South Dakota; that is, we are experiencing economic \ndifficulties. In this economic downturn, many people lost jobs, many \nhad a loss of income, many family budgets are being squeezed.\n  Does not the Senator from Massachusetts hear the same thing from his \nconstituents I hear from South Dakotans; that is, we want the Federal \nGovernment to lead by example, and rather than growing at four, five, \nsix times the rate of inflation, actually take some steps to get its \nspending under control in the same fashion, the same way we are having \nto do it?\n  That is what I hear from people in South Dakota. They are tired. They \nthink the Federal Government is growing too fast, has gotten too big. \nThey think it is a runaway train, especially when it is running $1.3 \ntrillion annual deficits.\n  I think 5 percent on this particular continuing resolution, this \nfunding bill is a modest amount that at least most of my constituents \nwould think is reasonable.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he thinks his constituents \nbelieve this Federal Government could live with 5 percent less at a \ntime when they are living with a lot less in many circumstances?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nhis question. I commend his constituents on having the foresight to \ninstruct him and let him know they are hurting. The people in my State \nare hurting also. They are absolutely concerned about the disconnect \nbetween Washington and the State I represent.\n  What I notice not only in Massachusetts but my travels throughout the \ncountry is that they believe the people in Washington go around saying: \nYou are great, you are great, everything is wonderful, there is no \nrecession in Washington. All the restaurants are full. The housing \nmarket is great. Everything is great around here. But outside that, \nthey say: He doesn't get it; she doesn't get it; we are going to make a \nstatement pretty darn soon.\n  They are absolutely looking for fiscal leadership. Listen, there is \nabsolutely a role for government. Government needs to know when to get \nout of the way also. It needs to know when to get out of the way and \nlet free enterprise and the free market take shape and let us get the \neconomy going through something besides government-created jobs.\n  I thank the Senator for his question. I agree wholeheartedly, yes, \nthere is a great concern that we are overspending, we are overtaxing, \nwe are overregulating, and we need to make sure this gesture, this 5 \npercent--I do not want to throw billions around like it is not money, \nbut compared to the trillions we are all used to dealing with here, it \nis not big money. But I tell you what, it is a very good start. It \nsends a very powerful message to the people in Massachusetts and \nthroughout the rest of this country and the world that a group of \nSenators have finally gotten together and have sent a message to the \nrest of the administration and to the folks that we are going to start \nto do one thing--just one thing: to start to get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might just say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, again, I appreciate his willingness to come down here \nand express his support for this amendment. The Senator from South \nCarolina is here. I expect he will speak too. He has an amendment he \nwould like to offer as well.\n  Most Americans believe government spends too much, especially at a \ntime when their budgets, as I said, have been shrinking.\n  This is the kind of amendment that ought to attract broad bipartisan \nsupport. We are going to fund the government with this continuing \nresolution until December 3 because, again, we have not passed any \nappropriations bills or a budget--which, by the way is a discussion, \nperhaps, for another day but one that I think needs to be joined, a \ndebate that needs to be joined, and that is, what are we going to do to \nfix this broken-down budget process that year after year puts us in a \nposition where, at the very end of the fiscal year, we have to pass a \ncontinuing resolution because we have not gotten our work done? That is \nan incredibly strange way to run a $3.5 trillion enterprise like the \nFederal Government.\n  I think the American people deserve better. They need a budget \nprocess that has some teeth in it, that is binding, that makes sense, \nwhere there is an appropriate role for oversight, as the Senator from \nOklahoma pointed out--all the agencies where there is duplication and \nredundancy where we can find savings. We don't do a lot of that around \nhere because we have a budget process that has broken down.\n  I have a bill to reform the budget process which, again, I hope is \nsomething we can undertake. It is not going to happen now because we \nare going to wrap things up here this week, it seems. I would be happy \nto stay around and talk about budget reform, but I think a lot of my \ncolleagues have other things and other places they want to go.\n  In the meantime, let's at least do something here that will rein in \nFederal spending and send a very important message and signal to the \nAmerican people, who have been hurting: The Federal Government here in \nWashington doesn't live in a bubble, we actually get it, we are \nlistening to the voices of the American people, and we can find a mere \n5 percent in our Federal budget, this massive Federal budget, and \ndemonstrate we are willing to tighten our belt a little bit, consistent \nwith what is happening to the American people and the experience they \nare having in this economic downturn.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I do not know how much time I \nhave left, but I reserve the remainder of my time on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed all of his time on \nthe amendment.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I commend Senator Thune for, again, a very \nsmall request of the Senate to continue to fund the government at a 5-\npercent reduction. It is hardly a radical idea--except in Washington. I \nhope my colleagues will support that.\n  I would like to talk about another amendment for a minute, but first \nI think we need to address what I think has been the most irresponsible \nCongress I have seen in my time here.\n  Over the last 4 years, the majority has almost doubled the national \ndebt of all previous Presidents in 4 years. We are on that track to do \nit. This year, things are so bad that we didn't even bother to do a \nbudget. We are not going to show the American people what we plan to \nspend, what things are costing.\n  We are trying to get out of town today without passing funding bills \nto keep the government operating. We have to do a little makeshift \ncontinuing resolution. But we are getting out of town without \naddressing the fact that we are getting ready to stick the American \npeople with one of the largest tax increases in history. By not doing \nanything, we are voting with our feet to raise taxes on everyone from\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\nthe lowest income to the largest corporation, to tax dividends at a \nhigher level, to tax death at a higher level. We are just leaving town.\n  In the meantime, as people are getting ready to leave town, there are \n20 or 30 bills that folks here would like to pass in secret, by \nunanimous consent, without a vote, without any debate. Some of them \nhave some pretty big price tags. And they are squealing like someone is \ndoing them wrong if we ask for a day or two to read these bills, to see \nwhat they cost, to see what they would do to our country.\n  There is a sense of entitlement here that we have to pass their bill; \nit is some kind of emergency. But their bills have been hanging around \nhere for months. One of them I just saw was from December of 2009. They \nare not emergencies, but we have to pass them but we are not going to \ndo the business of the American people. We are not going to carry out \nour constitutional responsibility to set a budget, to appropriate money \nfor the operation of our government, but we want to get our bills \npassed and we want to go home.\n  What we are doing is we are going to pass a continuing resolution \ntonight to fund the government until December. But the only reason to \nfund it until December is so we have to come back after the election in \na lameduck Congress and pass another spending bill to keep our \ngovernment going until the new Congress comes in. I think the only \nreason to do that is so Senators who are not coming back can come here \nand pass an omnibus spending bill with thousands of earmarks that \npeople have come to expect, so they can take home the bacon to their \nStates one last time.\n  There is no reason for us to have a continuing resolution that ends \nin December. We are going to have to come back and use the threat of a \ngovernment shutdown to force through a bigger spending bill. We should \nnot do that in the chaos after the election.\n  My amendment would take the exact same continuing resolution that \neveryone is going to agree on tonight and have it expire on February 4, \nafter we have sworn in a new Congress, after the dust has settled. Then \nwe can make a good decision with people who maybe represent the voices \nof the American people a little better because they have just come in \noff of the campaign trail. Instead of passing something in the chaos of \nNovember and December, let's do something that is more responsible and \nmore focused.\n  My amendment is the exact same as the amendment tonight. The only \nthing it does is it strikes December 3, 2010, and inserts February 4, \n2011, so it does not end, there is no emergency, there is no crisis, \nand there is no threat of a government shutdown. We come back in \nNovember and hopefully stop the tax increases and then go home and \nstart over with the new Congress, with folks who are representing the \nvoices of the American people.\n  My hope is that my colleagues will support this amendment. There is \nno reason not to support it unless you want to come back here in \nNovember and increase spending, pass an omnibus and pass all of these \nporkbarrel earmarks to take home one last time.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. I understand we \nwill have a vote on it later this evening, and I will reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4677 to Amendment No. 4674\n\n  Mr. President, I understand I need to offer the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \nSenator's amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMINT] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4677 to amendment No. 4674: Section 106(3) \n     of the bill is amended by striking ``December 3, 2010'' \n     and inserting ``February 4, 2011''.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you. I didn't think it would be too painful to read \nthat whole thing at this time. This is one I can guarantee I read.\n  Do I need to ask for a recorded vote at this time?\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if I may again repeat, in June of this \nyear, 9 of the 11 subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee passed \ntheir bills in the full committee and reported to the desk. They are \nall at the desk. But somebody held it up, and I can assure you none of \nus held it up.\n  I rise to speak against the amendment just submitted by Senator \nDeMint, which would extend the CR from the current expiration date of \nDecember 3 to February 4 of next year.\n  I am certain most of my colleagues are aware that the government \nfrequently operates under a short-term continuing resolution, not \nbecause they like to do it but because it takes time. It is not the \nmost efficient way to operate. I agree with that. But it is frequently \nnecessary as we resolve the differences over spending levels.\n  While our agencies decry living under the CR--and I have said many \ntimes that this is not the way to run our government--I believe these \nagencies have learned to operate in the short term, and I emphasize the \ntwo words ``short term.'' This CR was crafted with a very narrow focus \nin the expectation that it would only last 2 months. It was agreed upon \nby both leaders, the majority and minority leaders.\n  The minimal authorization extensions were included in a bipartisan \nattempt to keep this bill as clean as possible. Many requested \nanomalies were excluded because it was clear the CR would expire on \nDecember 3. Hopefully, the Congress will have concluded its work by \nthat date. If not, a new CR will be required, and I can assure my \ncolleagues that it will be significantly longer than this bill, with \nmany more anomalies to cover exceptions that must be continued if this \nCR is extended.\n  A short-term CR is not efficient, as I have said before, but it is \nmanageable. However, each week we go beyond that period, we further \ndamage the ability of the government to function effectively. For \nexample, contract awards can be delayed a month or two but not for 4 \nmonths.\n  The Appropriations Committee has worked very hard. We have held many \nhearings, heard from hundreds of witnesses--not just the administration \nbut opposition witnesses--and in a truly bipartisan fashion come to an \nagreement on the CR we have before us. A large part of that effort was \nbased on the good-faith assumption that once we agreed on an end date--\nin this case, December 3--Members and staff would use that date to \nproperly identify programs that needed adjustments in order to function \nas they were intended.\n  If we accept this amendment and arbitrarily change the end date to \nFebruary 4 of next year, we will ensure that the exact opposite will \nhappen: The Government will not function as it should. Let me offer a \nfew specific examples.\n  As chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, I know there are programs \nessential to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that would be disrupted \nif the Senate were to arbitrarily change the end date of the CR. To say \nthat our troops deserve better is an understatement of the highest \norder. As a specific example, the Defense Subcommittee carefully \nreviewed the plans of the Department of Defense and the Department of \nState for the authorities under the Pakistan counterinsurgency fund. \nThis authority allows the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of \nthe Secretary of State, to provide funding for initiatives to reduce \nthe terrorist presence in Pakistan. The subcommittee concluded that a \n2-month delay would have minimal negative impact. However, stretching \nbeyond 2 months could seriously erode our counterinsurgency efforts in \nPakistan.\n  As my colleagues know, new starts are prohibited under CRs, so a CR \nthrough February 4 would restrict the DOD from proceeding with any new \nmilitary construction projects during the first third of the fiscal \nyear. Losing 4 months of the year before DOD can begin to implement its \n2011 construction program puts the timely execution of the entire \nprogram at risk. Fifty percent of the requested funding is anticipated \nto be awarded by the end of February 2011.\n  A longer term CR would result in untimely delays for implementing \ncertain farm bill programs, as requested by the Office of Management \nand Budget. The delay would present shortfalls in funding for food and \ndrug safety approval programs at the Food Safety and Inspection Service \nand the Food and Drug Administration due to a shortfall in the budget \nauthority.\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\n  A longer term CR would result in untimely delays for implementing \ncertain farm bill programs, as requested by OMB. The delay would \npresent shortfalls in funding for food and drug safety and approval \nprograms at the Food Safety and Inspection Service and Food and Drug \nAdministration due to a shortfall in new budget authority. In addition, \nif the child nutrition reauthorization is not approved, a further \ndelayed CR will result in reduced food services for children.\n  As another example, the administration sought to extend a highway \nprovision of interest to Maine and Vermont but since it does not expire \nuntil December 17, it was not necessary to include in this CR. But if \nthe CR does not expire until February, that provision is needed.\n  A final example. The delays that would result from this amendment \nwould stall the implementation of all planned new law enforcement \ninitiatives at the Justice Department, including $366 million in new \nnational security spending intended to improve the FBI's cyber \nsecurity, WMD and counterterrorism capabilities and to assist in the \nlitigation of intelligence and terrorism cases.\n  This CR was negotiated in good faith, it has bipartisan support, and \nit ensures the government will continue to operate in good order until \nDecember 3. This amendment violates all three of those tenets. \nArbitrarily changing the end date violates our good faith, is highly \npartisan, and ensures that the government will not function as it \nshould.\n  For all of these reasons I urge my colleagues to vote ``no''.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Franken pertaining to the introduction of S. 3888 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum and ask that the time be divided equally between both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, in a moment I will request unanimous \nconsent to address an issue important to the people of Florida having \nto do with the EPA and a mandate set to go into effect next month. The \ntiming of this effort is critical. That is why I take the extraordinary \nmeasure of bringing it to the Senate floor today. I wish to make it \nclear that this effort is bipartisan. I am joined by the senior Senator \nfrom my State, Mr. Nelson, in this request. If we don't act, something \nis going to happen to Florida that will have a grave impact upon our \neconomy. Although this is a Florida-specific issue now, it will have an \nimpact on other States and set a precedent as time goes by.\n  Let me describe my amendment. Then I will talk about the issue. The \namendment would prohibit the EPA from using any of the funds in the \ncontinuing resolution to implement or enforce the water standard rules \nthat it is working on for Florida. Due to a consent decree between a \ngroup in the EPA which is part of a lawsuit, the rule setting water \nquality standards for inland waters in Florida is set to be finalized \non October 15. It singles out Florida and only Florida for these new \nwater standards. However, how this rule is promulgated will serve as a \ntemplate for how rules are promulgated against other States. For \nexample, EPA is already looking into an effort to promulgate these \nstandards for the Chesapeake Bay area.\n  We are not against clean water. In fact, Florida has been working on \nclean water issues for some time and has made remarkable progress. \nHowever, this proposal is going to have a dramatic impact on the State \nof Florida without peer-reviewed science as the basis of this rule.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an Article from \nthe Jacksonville Business Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Business Journal, Sept. 24, 2010]\n\n                Jacksonville Sewer Charges Could Double\n\n       JEA CEO Jim Dickenson said the utility's sewer rates could \n     nearly double by 2014 if new federal regulations require JEA \n     to spend $1.3 billion to remove more nitrogen from its sewage \n     plant discharges.\n       Companies and hospitals--including Anheuser-Busch InBev, \n     Southeast Atlantic Beverage Co., St. Vincent's Medical Center \n     and Mayo Clinic Florida--are expected to be hit the hardest \n     if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency toughens its \n     pollution standards in 2012. The new rules, which will also \n     make new development projects costlier, make Florida less \n     competitive with its less regulated Southeast competitors, \n     said Keyna Corey, spokeswoman for Associated Industries of \n     Florida, a business lobbying group with about 8,000 members.\n       ``We're not against keeping the water clean,'' she said. \n     ``I can't recruit a company to a dirty state, but we are \n     going to lose jobs because Florida is the only one doing \n     it.''\n       The EPA's nutrient-criteria mandate is expected to deal an \n     annual $1.1 billion blow to the state's agriculture industry, \n     costing about 14,500 jobs, Corey said. The new rules are \n     expected to cost the pulp and paper industry more than $169 \n     million annually. The EPA's push for more stringent water \n     pollution rules came after environmental groups, including \n     the St. Johns Riverkeeper and the Sierra Club, sued the \n     agency in 2008, alleging the agency wasn't enforcing the \n     federal Clean Water Act strongly enough in Florida. Under \n     the settlement, tougher criteria will come in mid-October \n     regarding nutrient levels in the state's rivers, streams, \n     springs and lakes.\n       Nitrogen is the main type of nutrient the EPA wants to \n     reduce in water bodies, because in high concentrations, it \n     can create algae blooms, which can cause fish kills, a \n     localized die-off of the fish population. The St. Johns River \n     was plagued by algae blooms and fish kills this summer.\n       Dickenson is worried that the $400 million the utility has \n     already spent to reduce nutrient discharges won't satisfy the \n     EPA when it applies the new criteria to the state's \n     estuaries, canals and coastal waters in 2012. If these past \n     projects--aimed at meeting the federal total maximum daily \n     limits rule--don't meet EPA's new mandate, JEA would have to \n     spend $1.3 billion or more to meet the higher standards, \n     since the majority of its wastewater discharges are in the \n     coastal region. The utility has 44 sewage plants.\n       To pay for the required upgrades, sewer rates would nearly \n     double, causing the average residential sewer rate to \n     increase annually to about $1,400, Dickenson said. The \n     average sewer rate for commercial and industrial JEA \n     customers isn't known, but the rates are expected to be \n     affected similarly.\n       If the EPA mandate ``would actually help the environment, \n     there would be no objection,'' said Paul Steinbrecher, JEA's \n     director of environmental services, permitting and \n     assessments.\n       He said JEA's past work to accommodate the TMDL limits \n     brings nutrient levels to the natural level and he is unsure \n     how levels could be further reduced under the new criteria.\n       The amount of nitrogen discharged annually by the average \n     JEA residential user has decreased from 13 pounds in 1975 to \n     about 2.2 pounds, Dickenson said.\n       ``If we'd known the EPA would change the rules midstream, \n     we'd have done our TMDL projects differently,'' Dickenson \n     said.\n       The EPA projects the annual cost of meeting the new \n     criteria to be $130 million for all utilities in Florida. \n     Darryll Joyner, chief of the Florida Department of \n     Environmental Protection's bureau of assessment and \n     restoration support, said that's not nearly enough. He \n     projected the actual cost at between $5 billion and $8 \n     billion. The EPA was not available for comment.\n       Joyner said JEA's $1.3 billion estimate on how much it \n     would have to pay to meet the criteria is correct. He is \n     optimistic that the DEP will be able to make the case to the \n     EPA that improvement gained through meeting the less-\n     stringent TMDL requirements will satisfy the new criteria.\n       Steinbrecher said he hopes Joyner is right, but the EPA's \n     decision to allow it to enter a ``legal no-man's-land law'' \n     doesn't instill him with confidence.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. This rule is going to deal a $1.1 billion blow to the \nState's agricultural industry. A joint study by the Florida Department \nof Agriculture and Consumer Services in the University of Florida \nprojects that it could cost in total up to $1.6 billion a year and \neliminate 14,500 jobs. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates it\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nto cost more than between $5 and $8 billion. Water utilities in Florida \nhave estimated that sewer rates would increase by $62 per month or more \nthan $700 per year.\n  This article from the Jacksonville Business Journal talks about sewer \ncharges doubling in Jacksonville because of the water standard that has \nnot been peer reviewed and does not have the scientific basis it \nshould.\n  Today, because I was coming to offer this unanimous consent proposal, \nthe EPA has issued a 30-day stay of execution on the implementation of \nthis rule. It was supposed to be October 15. Now it will be November \n14. Conveniently, that is the day before we are likely to come back in \nNovember and bring Congress back into session. So we will be unable to \ncontinue this during our recess. This will most likely go into effect \nand do damage to Florida.\n  This is a bipartisan effort. In fact, on the House side, members of \nour delegation, some 20 of the 25--I believe it is 21, actually--have \ncome together to support not letting this rule go into effect. Senator \nNelson and I make this request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the LeMieux-Nelson amendment be \nconsidered and agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cardin, chairman of \nthe subcommittee that has jurisdiction over this measure, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. If I may, that is unfortunate. It is unfortunate because \nthis is a bipartisan agreement. This damage is going to be done to \nFlorida, a State that is suffering from the worst unemployment that \nanyone can remember, nearly 12 percent, and the worst economy that \nanyone can remember. Now these ill-conceived rules that don't have a \npeer-reviewed scientific basis will go into effect and impact our \neconomy to the tune of billions of dollars, hurting our workforce and \ndoubling people's sewer rates at a time when they least can afford it. \nIt is unfortunate we have an objection when we have both Senators from \nFlorida, Democratic and Republican, supporting this; when we have the \nvast majority of the Florida delegation in the House asking for this \nmeasure to be stated. It is not saying it would not go into effect. It \nis asking for more time so there would not be a rush to judgment and it \nwould not be brought into effect in a hurried manner.\n  It is unfortunate we have an objection when we have such bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am concerned about the problem in \nFlorida. I am well aware there may be some consternation. But I must \nonce again remind the Senate that we are now considering the continuing \nresolution as a result of a bipartisan agreement reached by the \nmajority leader and the minority leader. That agreement calls for a \nclean CR. There are many amendments that my colleagues would like to \nsubmit, but we have had to say, reluctantly, no. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Thune \namendment. There are a number of reasons the Thune amendment is a bad \nidea. A 5-percent cut across the board may seem reasonable, small, and \nnot a big cut. But it is a devastating cut when Members understand the \nspecific programmatic impact. A 5-percent cut against non-national \nsecurity accounts would be about $20 billion below the current fiscal \nyear spending level. This cut would be in addition to the current CR \nlevel which is $18 billion below the Sessions amendments offered \nearlier this year.\n  I remind my colleagues that we have a $5 billion problem outside of \nall this cutting in terms of addressing the Pell grants shortfall. I \nbelieve the vast majority of my colleagues are in favor of the Pell \ngrants. I can assure them that the Pell grant problem is not going to \nmagically cure itself.\n  Members may try and hide from taking responsibility for the \ndevastating impacts of a generic across-the-board cut of this \nmagnitude, but I am standing before my colleagues now and putting \neveryone in this Chamber on notice for what the actual impact of \npassing this amendment will be.\n  For starters, let me discuss America's security outside of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and outside of the department that \nhandles the southwest border. Cutting funding by 5 percent would mean a \nloss of $1.5 billion for the Department of Justice. It is not part of \nHomeland Security and not part of the Defense Department. The FBI's \nuniform crime report that was just released tells us that violent crime \nis down 5.3 percent, a decrease for the third year in a row, and a \ntotal 9 percent drop since 2006. Now is not the time to cut resources \nfor Federal, State, and local law enforcement partners. We depend on \nFederal law enforcement to protect Americans from terrorism and violent \ncrime and uphold the rule of law.\n  Cutting Federal law enforcement by 5 percent across the board would \nmean 1,650 fewer FBI agents to combat terrorist threats, 420 fewer DEA \nagents to reduce the flow of drugs across the U.S.-Mexican border, and \nover 2,000 fewer Federal correctional officers to safeguard our \nprisons.\n  In addition to the cuts to the Department of Justice, this amendment \nwould reduce funding for the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism \nand Financial Intelligence and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network by \n$8.8 billion. Cuts of this magnitude would cripple the Treasury \nDepartment's unique efforts to keep our country safe.\n  Specifically, the Office of Foreign Assets Control would be forced to \ncut staff who enforce the Iran and North Korea sanctions programs and \nsanctions efforts aimed at al-Qaida and its affiliates, terrorist \ngroups in Afghanistan, international drug traffickers, and other \nnational security threats.\n  The Treasury Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis would \nbe forced to cut staff who work to locate hidden funding sources of \nterrorist networks. Finally, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \nwould significantly reduce overseas staff who work with foreign \ngovernment counterparts in support of law enforcement efforts, \ninvestigations that protect Americans.\n  In terms of our consumers and our small business owners, cutting the \nbudget of the CFTC and the SEC by 5 percent would erode their ability \nto conduct necessary oversight of the futures and securities markets, \nrespectively, at a time when such scrutiny is paramount. Such a move is \nsimply irresponsible, given the Wall Street scandals that led to the \nfinancial meltdown and economic strife plaguing so many American \nhouseholds.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle objected to funding any \nanomalies that would have allowed these agencies to increase staffing \nduring the pendency of the continuing resolution to implement the Dodd-\nFrank requirements. To insist on a further cut in light of these new \nrequirements is not responsible. For the CFTC, a rollback would \ndiminish aggressive efforts in the past 18 months to enhance previously \ndecimated staffing levels which would not have been adequate to keep \npace with the growing markets the agency oversees.\n  The SEC would suffer similar erosion of critical seasoned \nprofessionals. During the past 2 years, efforts have been made to \nrestore staffing shortages. This amendment will force these staff to be \nfurloughed, which would undermine the significant strides to become a \nmore aggressive and vigilant protector of American investors.\n  Funding for the Small Business Administration would be cut at a \ncritical point in the Nation's economic recovery, severely diminishing \nthe agency's ability to implement the Small Business Jobs and Credit \nAct recently signed into law. Such a cut would hamper the ability of \nthe Small Business Administration to provide counseling services to \nsmall businesses at a time when they need it most.\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\n  Cuts to Small Business Development Centers, microloan technical \nassistance, SCORE, and the Women's Business Centers would be a blow to \nSBA's ability to assist citizens trying to start, sustain, or grow \ntheir small businesses.\n  In terms of public safety, the FAA faces challenges in maintaining an \nadequate workforce of trained air traffic controllers. Funding the FAA \nat 5 percent below the fiscal year 2010 level would force it to absorb \nalmost $500 million in cost-of-living and inflation expenses. Since 75 \npercent of the FAA's operation budget is payroll, the FAA would need to \nimplement a hiring freeze, thereby reducing its air traffic controller \nand inspector workforces, increasing flight delays, and curbing air \ntravel at many airports.\n  When it comes to NASA, this amendment would require $936 million less \nin funding. I have heard from many Members concerned about job losses \nat NASA facilities in their States. I can assure you, the level of \nfunding that will result from this amendment will only expedite these \nlosses.\n  Specifically, this random across-the-board cut will jeopardize \nscientific discovery as well as the development of a new heavy-lift \nlaunch vehicle and space capsule, costing thousands of high-tech, high-\nskill jobs in States such as Alabama, Florida, Texas, and Colorado. The \nUnited States would abandon the high ground of space to Russia, China, \nand Europe, sacrificing our leadership.\n  In terms of environmental funding, this amendment would require a \n$174 million cut to EPA's Clean Water and Drinking Water State \nRevolving Funds. That means 58 fewer sewer and water projects in our \ncommunities to ensure clean and safe water.\n  It would also require a $302 million cut to the basic operating \naccounts at the National Park Service, the Forest Service, the Fish & \nWildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. That means \napproximately 2,000 fewer Park Rangers, Forest Rangers, refuge \nmanagers, and BLM managers.\n  The 5-percent cut proposed in this amendment would require the \nNational Park Service to furlough virtually all of the seasonal \nemployees that would result in the closing of many National Park \nfacilities. Further, it would cut energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy programs by over $145 million, stopping in its tracks evolving \nR on solar energy and electric vehicles. That is what we have been \ntalking about here: alternative energy sources. It would cut the \nnuclear energy R program by $51 million, hampering the nuclear \nrenaissance, and simultaneously it would hamper the cleanup of our \nnuclear weapon and civilian nuclear sites by cutting $366 million from \nthose programs. This action calls into question our ability to \nundertake new weapon and civilian nuclear activities if we cannot deal \nwith the back end of the programs.\n  In terms of our senior citizens, the most vulnerable in our society, \nthis amendment requires a cut of $40 million to senior nutrition \nservices at the Administration on Aging, which translates into a \nreduction of 13 million senior meals.\n  It also requires a cut of $922 million from the fiscal year 2010 \noperating level for the Social Security Administration. This would \nforce the Social Security Administration to furlough employees and \nseverely increase the waiting times for everyone with a disability \nclaim, retirement claim, or disability appeal.\n  In the last 3 years, the number of disability claims SSA has received \nhas increased 30 percent, the number of disability hearings has \nincreased 20 percent, and the number of retirement claims has increased \n13 percent. By the end of the year, this cut would leave 900,000 more \nAmericans waiting on a determination of their disability claim, almost \ndoubling the current backlog, and 150,000 more waiting on an appeal of \ntheir disability case. This would also drastically limit program \nintegrity efforts that save $7 for every $1 spent.\n  Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance, which helps the Nation's \nmost vulnerable individuals and families find and maintain safe and \naffordable housing in the private market, would be cut by $816 million, \nwhich would put as many as 85,000 of our country's low-income families, \nelderly, and disabled at risk of losing their housing.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record a more \ncomprehensive list of programs that will be severely impacted by this \namendment. There are too many important programs being impacted by this \namendment and not enough time to discuss them all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  List of Programs Impacted by the Thune Amendment and Level of Impact\n\n       The Thune amendment would require:\n       A $148 million cut to the clinical health services provided \n     by the Indian Health Service. For some of our most vulnerable \n     citizens, that means at least 1,000 fewer inpatient \n     admissions; approximately 200 fewer direct outpatient visits; \n     and 200 fewer doctors and nurses that are required to staff \n     the 4 new health care facilities scheduled to open next year.\n       A $169 million cut to the Forest Service and Interior \n     Department wildland fire accounts. That could mean as many as \n     2,560 fewer firefighters next year.\n       A $22 million cut to the Interior Department's Outer \n     Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing and inspection \n     programs. That means a halt to many ongoing reform efforts, \n     increasing the likelihood of environmental disasters like the \n     BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and delaying the timeline for \n     resumption of drilling in Gulf of Mexico deep water.\n       A $38 million cut to the Smithsonian Institution. That \n     means rolling closures of museums on the Mall and stopping \n     construction of the African American Museum of History and \n     Culture.\n       The Thune amendment would cut $1.16 billion in \n     discretionary spending for agricultural programs which will \n     result in cuts to nutrition programs, food safety, rural \n     housing, conservation, drug inspection, and farm service \n     programs among others.\n       Specifically, cuts to the Food Safety program would reduce \n     current levels for meat and poultry inspections, and cuts to \n     FDA would reduce current levels for drug and food safety \n     inspections (including imports) and drug approvals.\n       Both the Bush and Obama administrations have pushed the \n     goal to double funding for science programs over 10 years--\n     this amendment would put that initiative in reverse by \n     cutting over $300 million from DOE's Office of Science \n     program. This will severely impact the United States ability \n     to compete internationally.\n       The nuclear non-proliferation program would lose $139 \n     million. This would be lunacy in the face of bi-partisan \n     acknowledgement of the threat posed to the United States by \n     unsecured nuclear material in the world.\n       The Naval Reactors program, which must design a new reactor \n     core for the new Ohio class submarine and refuel its test \n     reactor, would be cut by $61 million.\n       Finally, the Corps would be cut by $270 million and the \n     Bureau of Reclamation by $56 million. As we struggle to \n     maintain and build our infrastructure in this country these \n     cuts would have significant implications to on-going \n     projects.\n       Internationally, the Thune amendment will require a cut of \n     $388 million for global health programs to combat HIV/AIDS, \n     malaria, Swine Flu, and many other deadly diseases that claim \n     millions of lives annually.\n       The amendment will require an additional cut of $87 million \n     beyond the $165 million supplemental funding not counted as \n     part of the CR for aid for refugees. This translates into \n     millions of lives lost.\n       The amendment will require a cut of $42 million for \n     international disaster relief. This cut along with the \n     reduction of $460 million that was included in the FY 10 \n     Supplemental that is not counted in the CR would severely \n     limit our ability to aid victims of earthquakes, floods, \n     hurricanes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters.\n       $16.5 million reduction to U.S. Capitol Police would result \n     in the loss of approximately 90 officers. Capitol Police are \n     already dealing with a $10 million shortfall going into FY11. \n     This would further decrease their mission of protecting the \n     Capitol Complex.\n       The GAO would be reduced by $28 million, which would be \n     devastating to GAO's operations, staff, and ability to \n     provide timely service to the Congress. To absorb a reduction \n     of this magnitude in a labor intensive budget would require a \n     reduction of almost 200 employees.\n       A cut of $18 million to the Mine Safety and Health \n     Administration. The tragic loss of 29 lives at the Upper Big \n     Branch mine and other mine accidents this year were tragic \n     reminders of what can happen when workplaces are not safe. \n     This funding level will prevent MSHA from adequately \n     enforcing the law which protects mineworkers.\n       This amendment would reduce funding for lifesaving \n     medications by $43 million, including the $25 million \n     recently allocated to 11 States to get 2,100 people off the \n     waiting lists in Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, \n     Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, South \n     Dakota and Utah. The drugs cost an average of $12,000 a year \n     a person, meaning that this cut would eliminate access to \n     care for over 3,500 people.\n       This amendment would reduce funding for health professions \n     training by $35.5 million.\n       A reduction of five percent below the FY 2010 funding level \n     would cut approximately $163 million that is necessary for \n     States to administer unemployment benefits. Under\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\n     current economic conditions, an estimated 14 million \n     unemployed individuals will be served in FY 2011, an increase \n     of approximately 60 percent, or 5.2 million individuals, \n     since 2008. The proposed cut in funding would result in long \n     wait times for claimants, increased erroneous payments, and \n     continued neglect of aging infrastructure.\n       A reduction of 5 percent below the FY 2010 funding level \n     for NIH would result in a cut of $1.6 billion. This reduction \n     is roughly equivalent to the total cost of all FY 2010 NIH \n     funded research on asthma, Parkinson's disease, lung cancer, \n     ovarian cancer, childhood leukemia, infant mortality, \n     lymphoma, multiple sclerosis and sickle cell disease \n     combined.\n       A cut of $30 million for purchasing the medications and \n     supplies needed in case of a bioterrorism attack or a \n     pandemic illness.\n       This cut would prevent the implementation of all planned \n     new law enforcement initiatives at DOJ, including $366 \n     million in new national security spending intended to improve \n     the FBI's cyber security, WMD and counterterrorism \n     capabilities and to assist in the litigation of intelligence \n     and terrorism cases; $153 million in new funding intended to \n     strengthen DEA and ATF investigative activity focused on the \n     activities of Mexican drug cartels; $97 million intended to \n     increase the number of FBI agents and US Attorneys working \n     corporate, mortgage and government fraud cases.\n       For the U.S. Marshals Service, $1.3 million would be cut \n     from its construction resources bringing to a complete halt \n     the Marshals' courthouse security improvement program, which \n     funds the installation of security equipment in Federal \n     courthouses and the construction of secure space for holding \n     and processing Federal prisoners in courthouse facilities. \n     Currently, less than a third of Federal courthouses meet \n     established security standards; this percentage will further \n     decrease if the Marshals do not continue to make necessary \n     upgrades and improvements.\n       Without these funds, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) would have \n     to reduce staff by over 2,000, leaving prison staffing at \n     less than 89 percent of the level identified by BOP as \n     necessary to ensure prison security.\n       Grants to state and local law enforcement and community \n     safety groups would be decimated by nearly $200 million. We \n     would be taking resources from law enforcement to fight \n     violent crime, drug trafficking, terrorism and child \n     predators. This cut would slash funding for the State \n     Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). We need to make \n     sure police have every tool available to fight violent crime \n     and drug trafficking, and keep our families and communities \n     safe.\n       Further, NIST is responsible for creating standards that \n     keep consumers safe and test new technology to advance \n     America innovation. Cutting NIST's research funding by 5 \n     percent would end the multi-year effort to double funding for \n     investments in scientific research through the agency. \n     Hardest hit would be American manufacturers who would lose \n     over $10 million in competitive grants that are designed to \n     send new technology out to the workplace, improving \n     efficiency and making American business more globally \n     competitive.\n       This amendment would also put communities at risk for \n     pipeline explosions. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials \n     Administration (PHMSA) ensures the safety of the interstate \n     pipeline system and monitors State oversight of intrastate \n     pipelines. In the wake of the San Bruno, California, pipeline \n     explosion that killed 8 people and destroyed more than 50 \n     homes, it is not the time to be cutting funding for pipeline \n     safety. Rather, Congress needs to ensure PHMSA is adequately \n     staffed to ensure companies are maintaining their pipelines \n     to prevent senseless tragedies such as San Bruno from \n     reoccurring. This reduction would do the opposite, curtailing \n     safety oversight of the nation's 2.5 million miles of \n     pipeline.\n       An across the board cut would impact NOAA and the National \n     Weather Service which is standing watch over our communities \n     to keep us safe. NOAA has made improvements to better warn \n     American's about dangerous tornadoes, hurricanes, and other \n     storms, but a spending cut would send NOAA's forecasting \n     capabilities backwards and eliminate 40 forecasting jobs. \n     Further, a 5 percent cut would harm NOAA weather satellite \n     program resulting in gaps in weather data, forcing the United \n     States to rely on foreign countries to supply weather data, \n     or worse, leaving Americas completely blind to severe weather \n     events.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. In closing, I would like to note that the CR that is \nbeing considered by the Senate this afternoon is at a rate that is $18 \nbillion below the Sessions amendment. The amendment being proposed by \nthe Senator from South Dakota proposes a rate that is an additional $23 \nbillion below the Sessions amendment.\n  To ask our agencies to continue to operate for the next 2 months at a \nrate that is $41 billion below the Sessions amendment will be \ndevastating and is simply unacceptable. Under this scenario, every \nsingle program gets cut.\n  I believe what I have provided my colleagues is a thorough analysis \nof exactly what you are cutting. Make no mistake, a vote for this \namendment is a vote for cutting these programs. It is that simple. I, \nfor one, do not believe this is the way Congress should be doing \nbusiness, and I will oppose this amendment. I encourage my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the time on our \nside is controlled by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can I ask, Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the majority, there is 40 minutes \nremaining for general debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could have the chairman's consent to speak for 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for that time.\n  One of the first amendments we will consider is a 5-percent across-\nthe-board cut. There is some surface appeal to this because it is \nalmost like taking money and not leaving any fingerprints because you \ndo not have to pick the different agencies that are going to be reduced \nin spending. You just say generically cut 5 percent and call us back \nwhen it is all over. It sounds like an easy assignment, but it \noverlooks the obvious.\n  Senator Inouye, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is \nalready preparing for next year's spending by reducing the spending \nlevel suggested by the President of the United States--if I am not \nmistaken, some $16 billion below President Obama's budget request.\n  So the Senator, as chairman of this important committee, is acting in \ngood faith to bring down spending. It is my understanding this \ncontinuing resolution, at least for the next few months, cuts even more \ndeeply in terms of the money that will be allowed.\n  So if there is some argument being made on the Senate floor that we \nare not sensitive to the deficit needs of America and we have not \nalready accepted responsibility to cut spending, they are ignoring \nSenator Inouye's leadership on the Senate Appropriations Committee and \nthe fact that this bipartisan compromise cuts even more deeply.\n  Now comes the Senator from South Dakota who says: Well, let's cut \nsome more. Let's cut 5 percent across the board. Then you take a look \nat the various programs, and you say to the Senator from South Dakota: \nWell, let's get down to specifics. Do you think we should cut 5 percent \nof the spending at the National Institutes of Health where they are \nengaged in medical research to find cures for the diseases which are \nafflicting and threatening people across America? Well, I bet he would \nsay: No, we don't want to cut there. Yet when you do an across-the-\nboard cut and you are not specific, unfortunately, you run the risk of \ncutting a critical program like that.\n  Would you go to northern California and say to the people living \nthere: Now is the time to cut the inspections of natural gas pipelines \nin the United States of America, after the terrible tragedy which \noccurred there just a few weeks ago, claiming innocent lives? No. Would \nyou argue that now is the time to take away inspections for oil rigs \nacross America? I think we are trying to move to the point where we \nresume drilling but with some confidence that we have inspected all \nthese rigs and they are safe and we can move forward. Senator Thune is \nsaying, Well, let's cut across the board. That is going to take money \naway from that timely inspection which we want to get completed so we \ncan put people back to work in that region of the country and around \nthe United States.\n\n  How about the Centers for Disease Control? Do we take money out of \nthe Centers for Disease Control at this moment in history? I think not. \nThey are doing important work to try to protect us against the next \ninfluenza epidemic and whatever else might challenge us. Do we want to \ntake money away from food safety and inspection? How many of us read \nnewspaper stories on a daily basis about innocent people who ate \nspinach or peppers or peanut butter and ended up with salmonella or E. \ncoli, in the hospital, and their health compromised for months, if not \nyears?\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\nSo do we want to reduce the inspections on food? How about the \ninspections on imported food? Does the Senator from South Dakota \nbelieve we should cut back on inspecting the food coming into our \nmarkets, being served on the tables of families across America? I think \nnot.\n  Does he want to cut back on the COPS Program at a time when States \nand local cities are running out of money and laying off policemen? Do \nwe want to cut back on the Federal funds we are sending so that there \nare cops on the beat to keep our neighborhoods safe?\n  Does he want to cut back on education? Does he believe that now is \nthe time, when we are seeing layoffs of teachers, even though we have \nmade some efforts here to try to reduce that? Does he want to cut more \nmoney from education when school districts across America are \nsuffering? That is what he is proposing.\n  If he were standing here with the only proposals or cuts that the \nCongress is considering, we might say, Well, we have to face up to it, \nbut he comes late to the party. The chairman of this committee has \nalready taken this through the exercise of bringing down the spending \nfor next year that starts on October 1, and this continuing resolution \ncuts even more deeply.\n  I am going to urge my colleagues to vote against this 5-percent \nacross-the-board cut. The Senator from South Dakota has exempted a few \nagencies, but there are a lot that he hasn't. As a consequence, we are \nin a position where many of these agencies and the critical programs \nthat are important for the health and safety of Americans are literally \nat risk because of this amendment.\n  Let's do this in a sensible, honest way. Let's not send a general \nletter. Let's use the appropriations process to bring down spending. \nThe Congress cannot and should not abdicate its responsibility to \nreview individual programs and make individual spending recommendations \nbased on that review. The desire to hold spending in check should be \nbased on congressional oversight of specific programs. We shouldn't \ntake a meat ax, across-the-board, call-me-when-you-are-done approach. \nWe should not yield our power to the President. We have our own special \nresponsibility here on Capitol Hill.\n  Senator Coburn has been a strong proponent of oversight of spending. \nI support that oversight. He has come to this floor and advocated for \nthe committees to look closely at spending and authorizations for \nscores of Federal programs. I think they should; I agree with him. This \nis exactly what the Appropriations Committee did last year in crafting \nbipartisan bills that garnered vast majorities of congressional \nsupport. The continuing resolution before us continues those levels for \na short time at last year's spending levels while we work at crafting a \nresponsible spending bill for the remainder of this fiscal year. I am \ncommitted as a member of that committee, working with Chairman Inouye, \nto meeting that challenge to reduce our deficit, but I am just as \ncommitted to doing it in an appropriate, responsible, and effective \nway. This amendment that is being offered for a 5-percent, across-the-\nboard cut is not such an amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose that amendment. I urge them to support \nthe passage of this continuing resolution so that the important \nbusiness of our Federal Government and keeping American families safe \nand healthy can continue and not be interrupted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee has described in detail the severe consequences for domestic \nprograms and personnel of the amendment offered by Senator Thune. I \nwant to mention three examples of what the Thune amendment would do to \ncritical international programs that mean the difference between life \nand death for the world's poorest people.\n\n  It would cut $388 million for global health programs to combat HIV/\nAIDS, malaria, Swine Flu, and many other deadly diseases that claim \nmillions of lives annually.\n  It would cut $87 million for aid for refugees, the world's most \nvulnerable people.\n  Funding for refugees will already be well below the amount provided \nin fiscal year 2010 because an additional $165 million was included in \nthe fiscal year 2010 Supplemental that is not counted in the CR, so the \nactual cut for refugee aid including this amendment would be $252 \nmillion below the fiscal year 2010 total level. This translates into \nmillions of lives lost.\n  It would cut $42 million for international disaster relief. Funding \nfor this account will already be reduced by $460 million that was \nincluded in the fiscal year 2010 supplemental that is not counted in \nthe CR.\n  The total amount under this amendment for disaster relief would \ntherefore be $502 million below the fiscal year 2010 total level. This \nwould severely limit our ability to aid victims of earthquakes, floods, \nhurricanes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters.\n  These are not theoretical examples. They are real. This amendment is \nnot just about dollars and cents. It is about human lives. It is a \nmoral issue. A 5-percent cut may not sound like a lot. The sponsor of \nthe amendment says it is only 5 percent. What he does not say is that \nthe consequences of this amendment would be devastating for millions of \npeople around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask that the time be divided equally \nbetween both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of H.R. 3081, as amended, the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of H. Con. Res. 321 and the Senate then proceed to vote \non adoption of the concurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. All time has been yielded back, Senator Inouye and Senator \nCochran so advise me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Thune amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 245 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Goodwin\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Murkowski\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4677\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the DeMint amendment.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, my amendment only makes one change to the \nunderlying continuing resolution. It changes the date from January 3 to \nFebruary 4. There is no reason we should fund the government only to \nthe lameduck. We need to wait until we have a new Congress and the dust \nsettles after the election. We don't need to be passing another \ncontinuing resolution or an omnibus spending bill with the pressure of \na government shutdown before Christmas. So the amendment is just a \ncouple of lines that change the date. Everything else in the continuing \nresolution is the same. Let's push the operation of the government all \nthe way through January to a new Congress.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee worked in a \nbipartisan fashion on this bill. It was crafted with a very narrow \nfocus and the expectation that it will last only 2 months. As we all \nknow, the short-term CR is not efficient, but it is manageable. For the \nmany reasons I enumerated earlier, we know that if we accept this \namendment, the government will not be able to function as it should. I \nurge that we vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on January 8 of this year, I requested \nthe Government Accountability Office to conduct followup tests of our \nNation's airport security screening procedures. Investigators attempted \nto smuggle bomb-making materials past security checkpoints in a number \nof airports around the country. This is something the GAO has done for \nCongress on several occasions since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  It is an important reality check for Congress to find out exactly how \neffective or ineffective the Transportation Security Administration's \nscreening procedures are. TSA has spent a lot of time and money trying \nto prevent future terrorist attacks, and we are, no doubt, safer in \nmany ways than we were before 9/11. However, it is important to cut \nthrough the talking points and the press releases. We need to test the \nsystem in real time with real people carrying potentially destructive \nmaterials once in a while to find out how vulnerable we still are.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration, which is now responsible for \nkeeping airline passengers safe, does not want you to know the results \nof these tests. In fact, the administration classified almost every \nword of the GAO report as ``secret.'' These sorts of classification \ndecisions ought to be made only when the information is actually \nsensitive for national security reasons. The power to classify \ninformation should not be used merely to hide information that might be \nembarrassing to the administration.\n  I understand that certain details of how GAO investigators did what \nthey did should not be made public. No one wants to give the terrorists \na roadmap of how to attack us again. I do not want to do that, and the \nGAO investigators do not want that to happen.\n  That is why I asked them to draft a report that did not include those \nsorts of details so that a declassified version could be released to \nthe public. The problem, however, is that the Obama administration \nclassified the report anyway.\n  The key data that should be public are the results. Did the GAO \ninvestigators succeed in penetrating our airport security checkpoints? \nIf so, how many times? How many times did they fail? The public has a \nright to know those bottom-line results.\n  Those results are not going to help terrorists figure out how to \nbetter attack us, and they certainly are not going to give them any \nmore motivation to try than they already have.\n  Keeping the results secret will accomplish one thing, however. It \nwill ensure that the public has no idea how effective our airport \nscreening strategy actually is, and it seems that is the way the Obama \nadministration likes it.\n  Therefore, I am asking the TSA Administrator to personally come to \nour secure facilities here in the Senate and explain his decision. \nSeveral of my colleagues joined me in asking the GAO to do this work, \nincluding the chairs and the ranking members of the Homeland Security \nCommittee in both the House and the Senate. I invite them to join us \nand help resolve this situation.\n  We need to work together to make sure that the entire Congress and \nthe public are aware of the results of this important work while \nmaintaining the security of information that truly needs to remain \nsecure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 442, H.R. 5481, \na bill to give subpoena power to the National Commission on the BP \nDeepwater Horizon Oilspill and Offshore Drilling; that the bill be read \na third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject if the Senator would kindly amend her request to include a \nsubstitute amendment with a Barrasso proposal to establish a National \nCommission on Outer Continental Shelf Oilspill prevention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so amend her request?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I think we should have as many eyes \nlooking into this issue as possible, and as a member of the Energy \nCommittee I supported the Barrasso amendment. But the issue before us \ntoday right now is that we already have a bipartisan commission \nappointed by the President. The commission is up and running.\n  The President's commission will issue its report in January, and the \nPresident's commission needs subpoena power to do its job right now. \nThis was the largest environmental disaster in our country's history. \nIt is important we get to the bottom of it.\n  I am disappointed that, once again, we are hearing our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle who are objecting to giving the President's \ncommission subpoena power.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. The BP oilspill was an unprecedented disaster--lives \nwere lost, and the gulf region will suffer the environmental and \neconomic consequences for years to come. We cannot turn back the clock \nand stop what happened. But we can prevent future disasters by finding \nout exactly what went wrong. We need to investigate this spill, and we \nneed to make sure it never happens again.\n  That is why the President appointed a commission to investigate. But \nwithout subpoena power the commission cannot do the job they were \nappointed to do.\n  Already, we have seen reports that some witnesses are stonewalling \nthe commission. Former Senator Graham and former President Nixon's EPA \nAdministrator, William Reilly, who are cochairing the President's \ncommission, told the press yesterday that investigators have \n``encountered resistance to full responses to their questions.'' That \nis unacceptable. We cannot let BP and Transocean cover up the truth. \nThe American people deserve answers.\n  This is the fourth time I have asked for unanimous consent on the \nSenate floor to pass a bill giving the BP Oilspill Commission subpoena \npower. Unfortunately, as we saw, this is the fourth time the \nRepublicans in the Senate have objected.\n  This should be noncontroversial. In the House of Representatives, 169 \nRepublicans voted in favor of this bill in June. It is outrageous that \nthis simple bill is being obstructed here in the Senate. A thorough \ninvestigation is needed, and it is needed now.\n  Commission cochairman William Reilly, who used to sit on the board of \nConocoPhillips, even said yesterday that it is ``unjustifiable'' for \nCongress\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nto not provide the commission with all of the tools they need to \nresolve this disaster. I could not agree more. I am totally \ndisappointed in what we have heard from the other side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a brief \nquestion? I know my colleague is waiting to speak.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to make the point--and then ask a question--this \nis probably a fitting description near the end of at least this portion \nof this session of the almost total lack of cooperation that exists in \nthis Chamber. The House of Representatives passed this almost \nunanimously. On commissions that are important--the Three Mile Island \nCommission, the Commission on 9/11, the Financial Crisis Commission--\nthey were all given subpoena power. Why? Because you need that if you \nare going to force and compel people to produce the records.\n  I was on the Energy Committee, and we heard the three parties that \nwere out there drilling in that well site: BP, Transocean, and \nHalliburton. They were all involved. All of them were pointing at each \nother. The only way this commission can function is with subpoena \npower. What on Earth can they be thinking of to block subpoena power \nfor this commission four successive times?\n  I would ask the Senator--first of all, I thank the Senator for doing \nthis. Second, it is unthinkable to me that we see continued blockage. \nIt represents a complete lack of cooperation. They did not do that in \nthe House of Representatives. The minority was very interested in \nseeing that this works. Here the minority seems very interested in \nseeing that the commission cannot work.\n  I would ask, is this not the fourth occasion on the floor of the \nSenate that the Senator has made this request, and on four successive \noccasions the minority has objected, in some cases for other--they have \na new excuse each time--but isn't this the case that four times the \nSenator has asked for this consent and four times it has been denied?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely. I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota \npointing this out, and also pointing out what has been a bipartisan \nhistory in the past when we have dealt with these kinds of disasters \nand tragedies in the country, that this used to be a bipartisan effort, \nand how sad and disappointing that now it has come down to partisanship \nrather than working together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been working very hard over the \nlast several months to extend the critical sales tax deduction for \nfamilies and small businesses in my home State of Washington and in a \nnumber of other States in this country. I know how important this is to \nmiddle-class families in my State, and I have heard from so many of \nthem about how important it is that this deduction be extended.\n  But every time we brought forward a bill that would help these \nfamilies, Republicans have banded together to block it. They would \nstand here on the floor and say they objected to the way we paid for \nthis deduction or they did not like some of the other tax cut \nextensions we included in the bill. They gave different reasons each \ntime, but they refused to come to the table with real solutions for \nthis serious issue facing middle-class families.\n  I have been urging Senate Republicans to change their minds, and \nfinally, on Monday night, Senate Republicans came forward with a \nproposal. Their bill came at the 11th hour, and it stripped away all of \nthe other tax credits that would have helped families, clean energy \ncompanies, and small businesses.\n  Senator Baucus was here and he objected to it because he wanted to \nfocus on a tax cut extension bill we had been working on for many \nmonths that already had the support of a majority of the Senate. But \nextending the sales tax deduction is too important for families in my \nhome State of Washington to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\n  So over the last several days, I have talked to a number of my \ncolleagues about this. I made sure they understood that this issue is \nabout more than the political back-and-forth in DC; it is about real \npeople in my home State of Washington. It is about removing a bias in \nthe Tax Code that is fundamentally unfair to our families. It is about \nputting more money into their pockets at a time when they can use all \nthe help they can get.\n  So I am here to say that after many conversations with my colleagues \non the Democratic side, they have agreed to set aside their objections \nand allow the sales tax deduction extension to pass this evening \nbecause, frankly, this issue shouldn't be controversial, and the \nlivelihoods of middle-class families shouldn't be used as a political \nfootball in election year games.\n  So in just a minute I will ask unanimous consent to pass a bill that \npulls the sales tax exemption out of the legislation we had it in \nbefore, which will allow it to stand alone tonight. It is what \nRepublicans offered us on Monday night, with one small compromise. It \nis very close to the version the Republicans offered. I can't imagine \nthey are going to object to it this evening, but rather than a \npermanent extension that I and many others would prefer, what I will \noffer is to extend the sales tax exemption alone for 1 year, which will \noffer greater stability and confidence for middle-class families in \nthese tough times. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I \nbelieve it can and ought to pass tonight.\n  I was proud to work with my colleagues to put politics aside and \nadvance this proposal that will help people and solve problems. It is \nvery narrowly drafted for just the State sales tax deduction. I know it \nis important to my State and to many, and I hope the Republicans will \nallow this to go forward tonight.\n  So I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 3617, that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, and the text of S. 35, as amended, with the amendment at the \ndesk, be inserted, and that the amendment be agreed to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object if the Senator from Washington would substitute the language \nwhich is at the desk which extends all the things she has talked about \nthis evening, as well as provides a 2-year extension for the physician \nfee issue which is expiring on November 30, but does it with spending \nreductions as opposed to tax increases. That amendment is at the desk, \nand if the Senator from Washington would substitute that language for \nher amendment, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object to the modification offered by \nthe Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request by \nthe Senator from Washington?\n  Mr. THUNE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, while the Senator from South Dakota is \nhere, I wish to make sure he understood what I offered tonight. It is \nwhat the Republicans offered to us on Monday night, which is the simple \nextension of just the sales tax deduction, which I know affects his \nState as well as mine, for 1 year. So I want him to understand that is \nall I have asked to do tonight, to just extend the sales tax deduction \nwhich I know is important to his State and to mine, and I would again \nask the Senator from South Dakota if he would allow us to move forward \nwith just that deduction this evening.\n  Mr. President, I would again ask the Senator from South Dakota if we \ncould just extend not the rest of the package but just the sales tax \ndeduction, as your side offered to us on Monday night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to the Senator from Washington through the \nChair that I would be happy to take a look at this and run it by my \ncolleagues. Obviously, this is not something I think everybody--there \nisn't\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\nanybody here right now--has had an opportunity to look at. We have \ntried repeatedly to get some cooperation on an extenders package that \nincludes a number of important tax provisions that have expired \nalready, as well as some that are set to expire, and to do that through \noffsets that reduce spending as opposed to raising taxes, particularly \nat a time when the economy is in recession.\n  So as much as I would agree with the Senator from Washington that \nthis is an important issue that needs to be addressed--and it is \nimportant to my State--I would have to object until we have an \nopportunity to look at the amendment that the Senator from Washington \nput forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I just have to say I am really confused \nby this because what we have offered is simply what the Republicans \nagreed to--offered Monday night, and I have come back to offer it \nagain. It is perplexing to me on an issue that is so important to my \nState, and to several other States, that we can't now, a few days \nlater, do this. So I am not sure we are not just having games about \nthis. It is extremely important to people in my State, and I am deeply \ndisconcerted that the Republicans have not agreed to allow us to just \npass the State sales tax deduction for 1 year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Because the extension could delay the collection of fees charged for renewal of such documents, enacting this provision could\n  reduce offsetting receipts over the next year or two. Some of those receipts may be spent without further appropriation, however, to cover collection\n  costs. CBO estimates that the net effect on direct spending from enacting this provision would be insignificant.\nTitle X of the legislation would establish new criminal and civil penalties. CBO estimates that any new revenues resulting from those penalties or\n  related direct spending (of criminal penalties from the Crime Victims Fund) would be less than $500,000 a year.\nOther provisions of H.R. 3619 would direct the USCG to donate certain real and personal property to local governments or other nonfederal entities. CBO\n  expects that, under current law, nearly all of that property would either be retained by the USCG or eventually given to other federal or nonfederal\n  entities; therefore, donating those assets under the legislation would result in no significant loss of offsetting receipts.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, Americans seem to be losing more and more \ncontrol over their lives due to government intrusion. The government \nhas decided what kinds of cars we can drive, what kinds of light bulbs \nwe can purchase and what kind of health insurance we must carry. But \nnow the government is going even further by reaching into the family \nunit.\n  I rise today to speak about an issue of great importance to families \nacross America--the rights that parents have over their families and \nthe ever encroaching role of the international community in American \nlife--specifically through a treaty, the United Nations Convention on \nthe Rights of the Child.\n  While the Convention on the Rights of the Child has many noble goals, \nI have significant concerns about the effects a treaty like this would \nhave on parental rights in America. This week we looked at the Rights \nof the Child treaty again when it was referenced in the preamble of a \ndifferent treaty--one on the international role in child support \nconcerns, the Hague Treaty on International Recovery of Child Support \nand Other Forms of Family Maintenance.\n  So today, I am offering an amendment to the resolution of \nratification for the Child Support Recovery Treaty that reinstates that \nthe United States has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the \nRights of the Child. My amendment states that ``The United States is \nnot a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and \nunderstands that a mention of the Convention in the preamble of this \nTreaty does not create any obligations and does not affect or enhance \nthe status of the Convention as a matter of United States or \ninternational law.''\n  Last year, I introduced a joint resolution proposing an amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution concerning the rights of parents and their \nfamilies, which would protect the liberty of parents to direct the \nupbringing and education of their children in the face of government \nintrusion.\n  Earlier this year, 30 Senators, including myself, introduced a \nresolution to oppose the ratification of the United Nations Convention \non the Rights of the Child. My resolution focuses on the fact that the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child is incompatible with the \nConstitution of the United States and threatens U.S. principles of \nsovereignty and self-governance. It would place the U.S. under \ninternational legal standards in multiple areas of domestic policy that \nwould have far-reaching effects on the way we educate and raise our \nchildren.\n  The Federal Government, or any source of international law, should \nnot be mandating guidelines or setting standards for raising children. \nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child would create international \nstandards for parents that could be enforced through U.S. courts at the \nexpense of the Constitution; courts could inappropriately use \nreferences to the Convention as legal precedent.\n  Parents are best equipped to decide how their children are raised and \neducated, not the government, and certainly not a board of bureaucrats \nheadquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.\n  The fight for protecting parental rights goes on. The DeMint \namendment to the Child Support Recovery Treaty is intended to ensure \nthat despite the reference in the preamble, the Convention on the \nRights of the Child has no place in the U.S. legal system.\n  As our Nation encounters new challenges, I believe the answers must \ninclude more freedom for Americans, not more government control--and \ncertainly not more international control. Congress must work to protect \nand strengthen the freedom of American families who are the backbone of \nour strength as a nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for a division vote on the resolution \nof ratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Understandings.\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Treaty with Australia Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation is \n     subject to the following understandings,\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\n     which shall be included in the instrument of ratification:\n       (1) Meaning of the phrase ``identified in.''\n       It is the understanding of the United States that the \n     phrase ``identified in'' in the Treaty shall be interpreted \n     as meaning ``identified pursuant to.''\n       (2) Cooperative programs with exempt and non-exempt defense \n     articles.\n       It is the understanding of the United States that if a \n     cooperative program is mutually determined, consistent with \n     Section 2(2)(e) of the Implementing Arrangement, to be within \n     the Scope of the Treaty pursuant to Article 3(1)(b) of the \n     Treaty despite involving Defense Articles that are exempt \n     from the Scope of the Treaty pursuant to Article 3(2) of the \n     Treaty, the exempt Defense Articles shall remain exempt from \n     the Scope of the Treaty and the Treaty shall apply only to \n     non-exempt Defense Articles required for the program.\n       (3) Investigations and reports of alleged violations.\n       It is the understanding of the United States that the words \n     ``as appropriate'' in Section 10(3)(f) of the Implementing \n     Arrangement do not detract in any way from the obligation in \n     Article 13(3) of the Treaty, that ``Each Party shall promptly \n     investigate all suspected violations and reports of \n     alleged violations of the procedures established pursuant \n     to this Treaty, and shall promptly inform the other Party \n     of the results of such investigations.''\n       (4) Exempt defense articles. It is the understanding of the \n     United States that if one Party to the Treaty exempts a type \n     of Defense Articles from the scope of the Treaty pursuant to \n     Article 3(2) of the Treaty, then Defense Articles of that \n     type will be treated as exempt by both Parties to the Treaty.\n       (5) Intermediate consignees. It is the understanding of the \n     United States that any intermediate consignee of an Export \n     from the United States under the Treaty must be a member of \n     the Approved Community or otherwise approved by the United \n     States Government.\n       (6) Scope of treaty exemption. The United States interprets \n     the Treaty not to exempt any person or entity from any United \n     States statutory and regulatory requirements, including any \n     requirements of licensing or authorization, other than those \n     included in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, as \n     modified or amended. Accordingly, the United States \n     interprets the term ``license or other written \n     authorization'' in Article 2 and the term ``licenses or other \n     authorizations'' in Article 6(1), as these terms apply to the \n     United States, and the term ``prior written authorization by \n     the United States Government'' in Article 7, to refer only to \n     such licenses, licensing requirements, and other \n     authorizations as are required or issued by the United States \n     pursuant to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, as \n     modified or amended; and the United States interprets the \n     reference to ``the applicable licensing requirements and the \n     implementing regulations of the United States Arms Export \n     Control Act'' in Article 13(1) to refer only to the \n     applicable licensing requirements under the International \n     Traffic in Arms Regulations, as modified or amended.\n\n       Section 4. Declarations.\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Treaty with Australia Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation is \n     subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) Self-execution. This Treaty is not self-executing in \n     the United States, notwithstanding the statement in the \n     preamble to the contrary.\n       (2) Private rights. This Treaty does not confer private \n     rights enforceable in United States courts.\n       (3) Intellectual property rights. No liability will be \n     incurred by or attributed to the United States Government in \n     connection with any possible infringement of privately owned \n     patent or proprietary rights, either domestic or foreign, by \n     reason of the United States Government's permitting Exports \n     or Transfers or its approval of Re-exports or Re-transfers \n     under the Treaty.\n\n       Section 5. Definitions.\n       As used in this resolution:\n       (1) The terms ``Treaty with Australia Concerning Defense \n     Trade Cooperation'' and ``Treaty'' mean the Treaty between \n     the Government of the United States of America and the \n     Government of Australia Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation, \n     done at Sydney, September 5, 2007.\n       (2) The terms ``Implementing Arrangement Pursuant to the \n     Treaty'' and ``Implementing Arrangement'' mean the \n     Implementing Arrangement Pursuant to the Treaty between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the Government \n     of Australia Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation, which was \n     signed in Washington on March 14, 2008.\n       (3) The terms ``Defense Articles,'' ``Export,'' ``Re-\n     export,'' ``Re-transfer,'' ``Transfer,'' ``Approved \n     Community,'' ``United States Community,'' ``Australian \n     Community,'' and ``Scope'' have the meanings given to them in \n     Article 1 of the Treaty.\n       (4) The terms ``Management Board'' and ``Management Plan'' \n     have the meanings given to them in Section 1 of the \n     Implementing Arrangement.\n       (5) The terms ``person'' and ``foreign person'' have the \n     meaning given to them by section 38(g)(9) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(g)(9)). The term ``U.S. person'' \n     has the meaning given to it by part 120.15 of title 22, Code \n     of Federal Regulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7724-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATIONS DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am in support of the nomination of \nMr. David Buckley to be the next inspector general of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, CIA.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted \nunanimously to recommend Mr. Buckley's nomination. So there is \noverwhelming, bipartisan support for Mr. Buckley.\n  It is also important that the Senate act on this nomination before \nthe upcoming recess. The position of the CIA inspector general has \nremained vacant since the retirement of John Helgerson in March 2009.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee has seen firsthand the importance \nof the CIA inspector general. Many of the reports and audits from this \noffice remain classified, but have had a major impact on our \ncommittee's understanding of CIA programs and at times have led \ndirectly to major changes in those programs.\n  Other reports have been made public, like the 2004 Special Review \ninto the CIA detention and interrogation program. The report raised \nmajor questions about the program's legality and compliance and allowed \nthe public to see some of what went wrong with the CIA program.\n  The inspector general of the CIA plays a crucial role. The CIA is an \nagency that is charged with operating in secret in locations around the \nworld, conducting covert actions and collecting intelligence. It \nshields its activities from the public, but it needs oversight. The \nIG's Office has been conducting independent reviews of Agency offices \nand programs, recommended measures of accountability where \nappropriated, and performed detailed audits of CIA expenditures and \nfinancial statements.\n  In April 2010, Vice Chairman Bond and I wrote a letter to President \nObama, pointing out the importance of the CIA IG position and the need \nto nominate and confirm a strong, independent auditor and investigator.\n  I am pleased that he nominated Mr. Buckley. His confirmation hearing \nwas held on September 21, where Senators reviewed his record, his views \non the position to which he has been nominated, and his plans if \nconfirmed. Mr. Buckley was straightforward with our committee and very \nclear about his belief in a strong and independent IG.\n  Mr. Buckley has had more than 30 years of experience in government \nservice that should provide him with an excellent background for the \nchallenges he will face when confirmed.\n  Mr. Buckley enlisted with the Air Force in 1976, specializing in \ninvestigations. He continued service with the Air Force Office of \nSpecial Investigations as a civilian in 1984, working for 3 years \nbefore moving to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nunder then Chairman Sam Nunn.\n  Senator Nunn offered the following endorsement for Mr. Buckley when \nhe wrote to the committee recently:\n\n       I found David to be a consummate professional of the \n     highest integrity, and he enjoyed a great reputation on both \n     sides of the aisle. He has excellent judgment and an \n     abundance of common sense.\n\n  Following 8 years on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, including time as chief investigator, Mr. Buckley \nworked as a special assistant to the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Defense, at the General Accounting Office, and at the \nTreasury Department for 7 years, most of it as assistant inspector \ngeneral for investigations.\n  Mr. Buckley then served from 2005 to 2007 as the minority staff \ndirector of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. As \nsuch he had a purview of the entire intelligence community, including \nthe CIA, and developed an understanding from the congressional point of \nview of the important relationships the intelligence committees have \nwith the CIA inspector general.\n  Finally, Mr. Buckley has worked as a senior manager at Deloitte \nConsulting since 2007, consulting in the national security arena. In \nshort, David Buckley has spent 34 years in a career focused on \nconducting oversight, much of it in the defense and intelligence areas.\n  I believe his background makes him an excellent candidate and I look \nforward to working with Mr. Buckley in his new position.\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7729-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         NOMINATIONS DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act of 2010, which we have passed back to the House, with \namendments. Hopefully, they will pass it later this evening, and it \nwill be the first time we have gotten this authorization passed and the \nwork that we have been doing for the last 4 years on reforming the \nCoast Guard's Deepwater Acquisition Program from the mistakes made in \nthe past and setting on a new course will actually become law.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the Coast Guard is a vital agency for \nus in the Pacific Northwest, everything from maritime safety to \nprotecting our environment to our fisheries and the important missions \nthey carry out. Obviously, making sure the Coast Guard has the tools it \nneeds to get the job done is very important.\n  I thank Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, and Hutchison for their hard \nwork and for Members on both sides of the aisle for working on this \nlegislation.\n  I said it has important acquisition reforms, and I wish to mention a \nfew of those because the Deepwater program, with its acquisitions, ran \ninto many problems.\n  First and foremost, the Coast Guard will return to its appropriate \ncompetitive procurement practices. This legislation ends what was an \nindustry self-certification process, and it codifies the very rigorous \nprocess that the Coast Guard should have with the Major System \nAcquisition Manual. It establishes the right leadership and oversight \nfor that and, an important aspect, I think, of all procurements related \nto acquisitions of this size, analyses of alternatives conducted by an \nindependent third party.\n  This legislation also has other important safeguards for oilspill \nprevention and for fishing vessel safety, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, because one of the provisions in this legislation is to require \na tug escort of double-hulled tanks in Prince William Sound, something \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senators from Alaska, Mr. Begich and Ms. \nMurkowski, asked be included in the bill.\n  This is important legislation, as we can see from the gulf incident \nand from incidents before. We obviously have to have large vessels \nescorted in and out of sensitive areas. I appreciate the leadership of \nthe Senators from Alaska on this legislation.\n  It also adds new protections to the Olympic Coast National Marine \nSanctuary off the State of Washington, making sure it is protected from \nvessels that pose an oilspill threat.\n  It also extends the important oilspill response assets through \nWashington's very vulnerable Strait of Juan de Fuca making sure that \nit, too, is more protected and has more resources to deal with \nincidents in the case of oilspills.\n  Finally, there is a new requirement for fishing vessel safety \ndesigned to protect the life and welfare of those fishermen who risk \ntheir lives to bring seafood to our tables. It requires that large \nfishing vessels get a safety certification from independent third \nparties, and it mandates that smaller fishing vessels meet the same \nCoast Guard safety standards as recreation vessels.\n  This is important because we know our fishing vessels take great risk \nin providing catch to us in the product they bring to market. But it is \nimportant we do so in a safe and responsible fashion. Having this type \nof independent safety requirements will be much needed.\n  It allows the Alaska-Washington pollock fleet to replace their boats \nto help meet the new safety standards. As the President knows, the \nfishing fleets for Washington and Alaska are large operations. The \npollock fishery alone is over a billion-dollar industry. Making sure \nthese vessels operate in a safe manner is critical for our industries \nto continue to succeed.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his input and for my colleagues on \nthe Coast Guard Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee and the \ncommittee at large for their help in getting this legislation passed.\n  As I said, it has been nearly 4 years in the making to get this \nimportant legislation through Congress. It comes at a time when we \ncontinue to want the Coast Guard to have the best resources to meet the \nmissions and requirements of their job but to do their acquisition in a \nresponsible way, to right the wrongs that has been in the Coast Guard \nacquisition process at the beginning of the Deepwater program, to make \nsure there is oversight and third-party evaluation of that, and to make \nsure, as I said, that this bill establishes new laws on oilspill \nprevention and on fishing vessel safety so we\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\ncan continue to operate in these pristine waters in a safe and \neffective manner.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nAlaska, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7731-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the 111th Congress will be recorded as one \nof the country's most historic. It will be rightfully remembered for \nthe landmark legislation we passed to help our economy recover from \nrecession and to help Americans afford to recover from health problems \nand for the passion that characterized the debates over many of these \nlaws. But it will also be remembered for the replacement of remarkable \nSenators, under remarkable circumstances, by dedicated and devoted \nappointees.\n  Two years ago, for the first time in half a century, the men elected \nPresident and the Vice President of the United States were sitting U.S. \nSenators. One year before the last time that happened, in 1959, Robert \nC. Byrd was sworn in for the first of his record nine consecutive full \nterms in this body.\n  In the 111th Congress, three pairs of the biggest shoes in American \nhistory needed to be filled, three public servants were chosen to sit \nin the seats vacated by the President, the Vice President, and the \nlongest serving Member of Congress. That has never happened before and \nwill probably never happen again.\n  Though Senators Edward Kaufman, Roland Burris, and Carte Goodwin were \nselected and not elected, none was content to be merely a footnote of \nhistory or the answer to a congressional trivia question. Each made the \nmost of his time in the service of his State.\n  Before he became the junior Senator from Delaware, Ted Kaufman was an \nengineer, a university professor, and Vice President Biden's right-hand \nman in this body for two decades. He spent nearly all his political \ncareer behind the scenes but impressed everyone in his State and in the \nSenate every time he stood up on the Senate floor or spoke out in a \ncommittee hearing.\n  Rarely has an appointed Senator serving such a short term made such \nan impact. Senator Kaufman wrote legislation to make sure no Wall \nStreet bank is too big to fail and made it easier for Federal \nprosecutors to root out financial fraud. His ideas on how to crack down \non health care fraud are now the law of the land.\n  He served less than one Congress, but he was no rookie. His knowledge \nof parliamentary procedure is vast, and he was a great legislative \npartner to me personally over the last 2 years.\n  But among the most remarkable things Senator Kaufman did in his time \nhere were the 100 tributes he gave on the Senate floor honoring Federal \nemployees of all stripes: military engineers, intelligence analysts, \nnuclear scientists, Medicare benefits administrators, advocates for the \nhomeless and the sick, and so on everyone from administrative \nsecretaries to assistant Cabinet Secretaries.\n  Senator Kaufman knows that the 2 million selfless public servants who \nchoose to spend their careers in the Federal Government often make \npersonal and financial sacrifices to work in relative anonymity and \nrarely receive recognition. He knows they often bear an undeserved \nreputation as part of a vast bureaucracy. But Senator Kaufman, a great \nformer Federal employee himself, has both the character and class to \npublicly honor them for their good, hard, and honest work. He should be \nrecognized for the same.\n  Roland Burris came to the Senate under difficult circumstances, but \nhe impressed our caucus by rising above the controversy and \nconcentrating on doing his job for the people of Illinois. He had \nalready built an impressive record in that State, becoming the first \nAfrican American to ever hold statewide office in Illinois and spending \nmore than three successful decades in the public and private sectors.\n  During his time here, Senator Burris stood up for many progressive \ncauses, including advocating for better civil rights education and \nwriting legislation in support of our servicemembers overseas. He also \npresided over the Senate Chamber far more than anyone else during the \n111th Congress, soaking in every minute of it along the way.\n  Senator Goodwin succeeded the irreplaceable Senator Byrd with \nhumility and honor. He was here only briefly, and he didn't waste any \ntime before delivering for West Virginians. In his first day as a U.S. \nSenator, he cast our caucus crucial 60th vote to break a filibuster and \nextend unemployment insurance for the millions of Americans who had \nlost their jobs and exhausted their benefits while looking for new \nones. In the aftermath of this year's Big Branch Mine disaster that \nkilled 29 West Virginians, Senator Goodwin fought for comprehensive \nmine safety reforms.\n  In his young career, Senator Goodwin has worked as a lawyer, as the \ngeneral counsel to the Governor of West Virginia, the chairman of his \nState's School Building Authority, and the Independent Commission on \nJudicial Reform. He will soon be a 36-year-old former Senator, and my \ncolleagues and I eagerly anticipate following the bright career he has \nahead of him.\n  Senators Edward Kaufman, Roland Burris, and Carte Goodwin represented \ntheir respective States with distinction. They will forever hold a \nspecial place in American history for the good work they did in the \nshort time they were U.S. Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7731-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7731-S7732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, although September is coming to a close, we \nare right in the middle of Hispanic Heritage Month. Every fall we \nrecognize how the invaluable contributions America's 47 million \nLatinos--Americans with roots in dozens of nations--strengthen our own \nNation, and the way their rich cultures enrich our country.\n  It is a special time every year. But this Hispanic Heritage Month is \neven more exciting than most. This year we are also celebrating the \nbicentennials of four great nations' independence: Argentina, Chile, \nColombia and Mexico. More than 200 million people in these great \ncountries are commemorating 200 years of freedom, liberty and \nopportunity, and the United States of America celebrates alongside our \nglobal neighbors.\n  It is no secret, though, that the past year's challenges have tested \nour communities and our resolve closer to home. It has been tougher on \nNevada than any other State, and tougher on Hispanics than any other \ngroup.\n  But in the year that has passed between last Hispanic Heritage Month \nand this one, we have achieved so much:\n  We affirmed the promise that affording to live a healthy life in \nAmerica is the right of every citizen--not just a privilege for the \nwealthy few.\n  We cleaned up Wall Street so this kind of recession can never happen \nagain, and ended the era of big-bank bailouts. That law also brings \ntransparency to the remittance industry, which saves customers and \ntheir families millions of dollars.\n  We cracked down on mortgage fraud, including funding Spanish-language \nads to stop scammers from preying on Latino homebuyers. I directed my \nstaff\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\nto help Hispanic families in danger of foreclosure, and my office has \nheld a number of housing workshops to help Latino homeowners avoid \nmortgage scams and stay out of foreclosure.\n  Important credit card reforms went into effect this summer that \nprotect consumers from crippling late fees, protect college students \nfrom predatory lenders, and protect families from having to pay a fee \nto simply pay a bill.\n  And just a week before last year's Hispanic Heritage Month started, \nSonia Sotomayor heard her first case as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  We're going to make this year even better. Hispanic Heritage Month is \nas much about the past as it is about the future. It is as much about \nhonoring tradition as it is securing a legacy of honor for the next \ngeneration.\n  I will continue fighting for tough, fair and practical immigration \nreforms, including giving the children of immigrants the opportunity to \nserve America--the only nation they have ever called home--and to earn \nan education and contribute to our society.\n  I believe that everyone who grows up as an American and wants a \nquality American education should have the chance to pursue it. And I \nknow our economy will not recover if we don't give everyone the \nopportunity to repair it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7732-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JOHN W. KLUGE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on Tuesday, September 7, 2010, John Kluge \npassed away at a family home in Charlottesville, VA. He was 95.\n  Mr. Kluge was a successful businessman who parlayed the money he \nearned from a Fritos franchise into a multibillion-dollar \ncommunications company, Metromedia. This conglomerate grew to include 7 \ntelevision stations, 14 radio stations, outdoor advertising, the Harlem \nGlobetrotters, the Ice Capades, radio paging and mobile telephones.\n  Mr. Kluge was born on September 21, 1914, in Chemnitz, Germany. His \nfather died in World War I. After his mother remarried, John was \nbrought to America in 1922 by his German-American stepfather to live in \nDetroit. He began work at the age of 10, working for his stepfather's \nfamily contracting business. At the age of 14, he left home to live in \nthe house of a schoolteacher, driving by his desire to have an \neducation.\n  He worked hard to learn and speak well the English language and get \nthe grades he needed in high school to win a scholarship to college. He \nfirst attended Detroit City College, which was later renamed Wayne \nState University, and transferred to Columbia University when he was \noffered a full scholarship and living expenses. He graduated from \nColumbia in 1937 and went to work for a small paper company in Detroit. \nWithin 3 years he went from shipping clerk to vice president and part \nowner.\n  After serving in Army intelligence in World War II, he turned to \nbroadcasting and, with a partner, created the radio station WGAY in \nSilver Spring, MD, in 1946. In the 1950s he acquired radio stations in \nSt. Louis, Dallas, Fort Worth, Buffalo, Tulsa, Nashville, Pittsburgh \nand Orlando, FL. Meanwhile, he invested in real estate and expanded the \nNew England Fritos Corporation, which he founded in 1947 to distribute \nFritos and Cheetos in the Northeast, adding Fleischmann's yeast, Blue \nBonnet margarine and Wrigley's chewing gum to his distribution network.\n  In 1951 he formed a food brokerage company, expanding it in 1956 in a \npartnership with David Finkelstein, and augmented his fortune selling \nthe products of companies like General Foods and Coca-Cola to \nsupermarket chains.\n  Mr. Kluge served on the boards of numerous companies, including \nOccidental Petroleum, Orion Pictures, Conair and the Waldorf-Astoria \nCorporation, as well as many charitable groups, including United \nCerebral Palsy.\n  His philanthropy was prodigious. The beneficiaries of his gifts \nincluded Columbia University and the University of Virginia.\n  Mr. Kluge also contributed to the restoration of Ellis Island and in \n2000 gave $73 million to the Library of Congress, which established the \nKluge Prize for the Study of Humanities.\n  In his business endeavors, Mr. Kluge savored the chance to move into \nnew areas of high technology and often took Wall Street by surprise \nwith some of his commercial decisions. He never lost his zest for \ndeveloping new businesses or his taste for complex financial deals. Mr. \nKluge once said, ``I love the work because it taxes your mind.''\n  At the time of his death, Mr. Kluge was deeply involved in a new \nbiological cancer treatment that has a positive effect on multiple \norgan cancers, with no side effects. He also was engaged in a new \ntreatment for diabetes.\n  He is survived by his wife Maria, sons John, Jr. and Joseph, a \ndaughter Samantha, a grandson Jack, and stepchildren Jeannette Brophy, \nPeter Townsend, and Diane Zeier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7732-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7732-S7733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when the earthquake on Wall Street sent \nshockwaves throughout the country, Nevada got hit the worst. The \neconomic collapse took down our housing and job markets along with it.\n  When so many Nevadans lost their jobs, they lost much more than just \na place to go to work in the morning. They lost their incomes, their \nsavings and their retirement security. Many lost their gas money and \ntheir grocery money. Some lost their children's tuition payments. They \nhave lost a measure of dignity. All of this through no fault of their \nown.\n  But even after losing so much, they haven't lost hope. Now they wake \nup every morning and look for new work, a new way to support their \nfamilies.\n  It hasn't been easy. Jobs are harder to come by today than at any \nother time in recent memory. The Labor Department reports there is only \none open job in America for every five Americans desperate to fill it. \nAs a result, nearly half of the unemployed in this country have been \nout of work for 6 months or longer.\n  One of those people is Scott Headrick of Las Vegas. Scott's been out \nof work for more than two years. He wrote me recently because he's \nangry how some on the other side are trying for political reasons to \nstigmatize and demonize the unemployed.\n  He has good reason to be upset. One of the top Republicans in the \nSenate called unemployment assistance a ``disincentive for them to seek \nnew work.'' Another senior Republican Senator said these Americans--\npeople who want nothing more than to find a new job--``don't want to go \nlook for work.'' And a third senior Republican Senator argued, ``We \nshould not be giving cash to people who basically are just going to \nblow it on drugs.'' That's a direct quote. Others have made the absurd \nallegation that you can make more money on unemployment than through a \nhonest day's work.\n  These comments are not only offensive; they're also dead wrong. And \nthat's why Scott was so upset. He wrote me the following:\n  ``I've been unemployed since July 2008 and have not been able to \nobtain a position at a supermarket packing groceries. I've been \nreligiously seeking, searching and applying for work without any luck. \nI have since left my family in Las Vegas, a wife and five children, to \nlook for work in other states and again, without any luck.''\n  While people like Scott seek, search and apply for work, they rely on \nunemployment insurance to get by. No one gets rich off of unemployment \nchecks. They merely provide a fraction of one's old income to help keep \nfood on the table this week, and keep a roof over a head this month, \nand keep the heat on this winter.\n  Unemployment insurance doesn't only help the out-of-work make ends \nmeet--it can also help our economy recover. Respected economist Mark \nZandi calculated that every time a dollar goes out in an unemployment \ncheck, $1.61 comes back into the economy. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that number could actually be as high as two \ndollars, meaning we double our investment.\n  It is easy to see why. When you are desperate, you don't keep that \ncheck under your mattress. You turn around\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\nand spend the money. You immediately pay your bills and go to the store \nand keep up with your mortgage payments.\n  You spend it on the basics and the bare necessities while you look \nfor work. The money goes right back into the economy, which strengthens \nit, fuels growth and ultimately lets businesses create the very jobs \nthe unemployed have been looking for, for so long.\n  But those benefits don't last forever. They expire. And in a crisis \nlike today's, expiring benefits are leaving too many out in the cold. \nThe Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation said \nthat 22,000 Nevadans have exhausted both their state and federal \nbenefits. Nationwide, that number reaches well into the millions.\n  I am proud to cosponsor Senator Stabenow's bill to help the hardest \nhit among us: out-of-work Americans who have exhausted their \nunemployment insurance. It is called the Americans Want to Work Act, \nand it is called that for a very good reason.\n  Contrary to the other side's reckless and heartless spin, the people \nwe are trying to help want to find work. They're trying to find work. \nAnd they would much rather get a paycheck than an unemployment check.\n  These are people who have tried and tried to find work, who scour job \nlistings, who send out resumes, who fill out applications, who go to \ninterviews--but who haven't had any luck for weeks and months and, in \nsome cases, years.\n  The Americans Want to Work Act recognizes that we can do more to help \nthose who lost their jobs through no fault of their own.\n  First, it extends unemployment benefits for an additional 20 weeks--\nthe longest extension ever to match the most painful crisis we've seen \nin generations.\n  Second, it takes the powerful and successful incentives we're giving \nbusinesses to hire and makes them even better. We passed a bill this \nyear--the HIRE Act--that says to businesses: If you hire unemployed \nworkers, we will give you a tax cut--you don't have to pay the Social \nSecurity payroll tax this year. These incentives are already working; \nbusinesses are starting to hire because of it. Senator Stabenow's bill \nwill extend that tax credit through next year, too.\n  It will also double the tax credit we're giving businesses for \nkeeping those previously long-term unemployed workers on the payroll \nfor at least one year. The HIRE Act gave businesses a $1,000 tax credit \nfor each such new hire. Senator Stabenow's bill will raise that tax \ncredit to $2,000 for workers who have exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Nevadans and millions of Americans want to \nwork. Like Scott Headrick, they seek, search and apply, but time and \nagain they hear nothing but ``no'' in return. What a shame it is that \nthey are hearing the same answer from Republicans in the Senate when we \npropose sound legislation like this to give them a hand when they're \nhurting the most.\n  Americans need jobs. Nevadans need jobs. And it is our job to help \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7733-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I offer my condolences to Catherine Stevens \nand to the entire family of Senator Ted Stevens and to the families of \nthose who also lost their lives in that tragic August 9 accident.\n  I knew Ted for many years and will always remember his devotion to \nthe U.S. Senate and, of course, to the State of Alaska. Ted tirelessly \ncommitted himself to help transform Alaska into a modern State. Even if \nhe had not become the longest serving Republican Senator in history, \nwith a career spanning over 38 years, ``Uncle Ted'' would still have \nbecome an Alaskan legend. He was beloved throughout the State. And his \nlove for his State was well known, from the largest cities to the \nsmallest towns.\n  Ted devoted his whole life to public service. Before he was elected \nto Congress, Ted went through pilot training in Douglas, AZ, and earned \nhis Army Air Corps wings in May 1944. For his service in World War II, \nhe received the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n  Incidentally, Ted often told me of his appreciation for the time he \nspent training in Arizona, my home State. He often spoke, too, of the \ntown of Wickenburg, AZ, where his wife is from.\n  During his time in the Senate, Ted became a master of Senate \nprocedure. Republicans would often ask him to sit in the Presiding \nOfficer's chair during an important vote because we knew he would \nhandle all of the procedural details and intricacies perfectly.\n  Not only was he a good legislator, he was a tough legislator. Ted was \nnot shy about inviting comparisons with the Incredible Hulk. When he \ndebated an issue that meant a lot to him, he would wear his Incredible \nHulk necktie. Indeed, that necktie saw many a political battle.\n  As much as I admired Ted for his tough side, I will most fondly \nrecall his gentle spirit and his compassion for the people he was so \nproud to represent. His soft side and kind nature were so apparent I \nsometimes wondered how much of his feistier side was for effect.\n  It was an honor to have known him and a privilege to have served \nalongside him here in the Senate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nthe memory of a dedicated public servant and leader, Senator Ted \nStevens. After a lifetime of unprecedented service to his State and \nNation, Senator Stevens passed away in Alaska on August 9, 2010, at the \nage of 86. His death was a loss to the U.S. Senate, the State of \nAlaska, and the Nation.\n  A decorated World War II pilot who survived a deadly 1978 plane \ncrash, Senator Stevens was the longest-serving Republican Senator in \nthe Nation's history and Alaska's most beloved political figure. Known \nas a giant in the Senate and affectionately referred to as ``Uncle \nTed'' by his constituents, Stevens helped usher Alaska into statehood \nin 1959 and was instrumental in its economic growth. He was first and \nforemost a devoted advocate of Alaska and its people.\n  Born in Indianapolis, IN, Senator Stevens attended Oregon State \nUniversity before serving as an Air Force pilot in World War II. He \nwent on to graduate from the University of California Los Angeles--\nUCLA--with a bachelor of arts degree in political science, and from \nHarvard University with a juris doctor degree in law. After a \nsuccessful career as a member of the Alaska House of Representatives, \nStevens was appointed to the U.S. Senate, making him the third Senator \nin the State's history.\n  Senator Stevens is greatly admired for what he did during his four \ndecades of service in the U.S. Senate. I had the pleasure of seeing the \nSenator in action on many occasions and particularly admired his deep \ncommitment to working across the aisle to get things done. Senator \nStevens was one of the Senate's most effective Members, both as a \nvaluable ally and worthy opponent. Stevens' colleagues, both \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, greatly enjoyed working with him and \nrespected his views. We can all learn from the example he set.\n  I ask that the U.S. Senate join me in commemorating Senator Ted \nStevens' lifelong dedication to the service of our country and to the \nState of Alaska. He was a courageous advocate for his State, and a dear \nfriend who will be greatly missed by all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7733-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7733-S7735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, today I want to recognize and thank the \nHelmets to Hardhats program for its important work on behalf of our \nNation's veterans.\n  In these tough economic times, unemployment among recent veterans is \na growing concern. Recent statistics indicate that the jobless rate \namong Iraq and Afghanistan veterans tracks a full five points higher \nthan the rate for the Nation as a whole. It is clear that we must take \nserious steps to address this issue.\n  The Helmets to Hardhats program has helped tens of thousands of \nveterans find work in the construction industry by evaluating recently \nseparated servicemembers to identify their strengths and experience and \nmatch them with employers within the construction industry. The long-\nterm partnerships that result benefit veterans, construction firms, and \nthe Nation as a whole.\n  In times of crisis, it is our best and bravest that step forward in \ndefense of our Nation. We owe our servicemembers a debt of gratitude \nfor their sacrifice that we can never fully repay. The least that a \ngrateful nation can do is to give them assistance in finding good jobs \nwhen they return from service.\n  Though the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs do excellent \nwork with their transition programs, organizations like Helmets to \nHardhats serve as the ``boots on the ground'' forces needed to help our \nveterans realize the American dream. I thank all of those involved in \nthis important organization for their work across the country, and look \nforward to partnering with them to help veterans in North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7735-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7735-S7736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC RECOVERY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday we were again thwarted in our \nattempts to take another important step in supporting our Nation's \neconomic recovery.\n  in 2009, we passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which \nprovided a much needed jump-start to get our economy going again, save \nand create jobs, and make critical investments in our infrastructure.\n  In March of this year, we passed the HIRE Act, which has been \nproviding businesses with tax incentives to hire out-of-work Americans.\n  Just Monday, President Obama signed the Small Business Jobs Act into \nlaw, which will provide support and relief to small businesses and lay \nthe groundwork to help these businesses create up to 500,000 jobs.\n  Yesterday, Republicans blocked consideration of the Creating American \nJobs and Ending Offshoring Act, which would have supported our Nation's \nmanufacturing sector by encouraging American companies to bring jobs \nback to America. Even though we have been witnessing a growth in \nprivate sector jobs, we are still struggling to prevent the loss of \ngood jobs.\n  The Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act would provide a \ntax break to companies that bring jobs back to the United States, in \nthe form of relief from the employer share of the Social Security \npayroll tax.\n  Additionally, this legislation would discourage firms from \neliminating American jobs and moving facilities offshore by prohibiting \nfirms from taking any deduction, loss, or credit for amounts paid to \nreduce operations in the United States and start or expand similar \noperations overseas.\n  It would also end the Federal tax subsidy--known as deferral that \nrewards firms that move their production overseas by allowing them to \ndefer paying tax on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries until \nthat income is brought back to the United States.\n  The Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act would encourage \nAmerican companies to get back in the business of hiring American \nworkers. Nonfinancial companies in the United States are reportedly \nsitting on $1.8 trillion of capital. With these reserves, it should not \nbe prohibitive to bring new American workers on the payroll. This \nlegislation would ensure that these companies are using their resources \nto create new American jobs instead of sending those jobs overseas.\n  I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nfailed to join with us to support this commonsense legislation, which \nwould provide desperately needed jobs to out-of-work Americans and \nsupport America's manufacturing sector. Instead, they have voted to \npreserve tax breaks that reward companies who ship jobs overseas.\n  I am also disappointed that we have failed to extend the TANF \nEmergency Contingency Fund, which is set to expire on Thursday. I \njoined with a number of my colleagues to introduce and press for \nlegislation to extend the fund for 3 months.\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\n  The TANF Emergency Contingency Fund has been used to support the \nsuccessful Jobs Now program in Rhode Island, which has provided local \nbusinesses with subsidies to hire workers from struggling families. In \naddition to providing jobs to out-of-work Americans, this program is a \nwin for businesses that could not otherwise bring new workers on board. \nWithout this fund, these businesses will be hard-pressed to keep these \nnew employees on the payroll. Unfortunately, in outcome that has become \nall too common, this extension was subject to an objection from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will recognize \nwhat is at stake and join us in the effort to give American workers and \nbusinesses the help they need. I remain committed to pressing for \ninnovative and commonsense efforts that will bolster the economy, \ncreate jobs, and help the middle class.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7736-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EDUCATION JOBS AND MEDICAID FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I read an article from the October 2010 \nedition of the Defense Technology International this morning that \ndiscussed military and other technology advances. Entitled ``Big Guns: \nChina muscles up artillery punch,'' this article details China's \nefforts in the development of artillery and rocket systems and the \nassociated doctrine they have created. Specifically, it addresses \nChinese efforts in research and development in areas such as computer-\nbased fire control, digital communication, and command capabilities, \nuse of sophisticated radars and jammers, and the development of ramjet \npowered and stealth coated artillery shells, to name a few key areas. \nThough not necessarily new items of research and development for the \nUnited States, China's efforts in these areas tells me one thing: China \nis pursuing modernization and development initiatives that, based on \nour recent history of research and development specific to artillery \nand rockets, may be superior if they are not at least equal to our \nefforts\n  Now let me shift same gears to another potential peer country: Russia \nand its fifth-generation fighter development. In the same context as \nChina's efforts in artillery and rocket capability, Russia is pursuing \nthe deployment of a fifth-generation fighter, known as the PAK FA \nadvanced tactical frontline fighter. Russia has publicly stated that \nthis aircraft is the peer to the F-22. This aircraft, together with \nupgraded fourth-generation fighters, will define Russian Air Force \npotential for the next several decades and will challenge our aviation \nefforts without question. And don't think that China isn't developing \ntheir own fifth-generation aircraft; they are. It is called the JA-12 \nit is also going to go head to head with our F-22.\n  The point to this is not a comparison of capabilities or numbers but \na public reinforcement of an assessment I have maintained for a long \ntime. We, the United States of America, are not taking our future \nnational security seriously, because we are failing to focus on \nmaintaining the edge that we have had for the last several decades.\n  So where is the United States in terms of future military hardware \nnecessary to maintain that edge? Did you know that the oldest combat \nvehicle in the Army inventory is the M109A6 Paladin howitzer and we are \non the sixth version of this vehicle which is built around a \nrefurbished chassis circa 1963? The Army's answer to artillery \nmodernization has been the Crusader, which was supposed to replace the \nPaladin, the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon as part of FCS, the Non-Line-of-\nSight Launch System, another FCS related system, and now the Paladin \nIntegrated Management, or PIM program, which is a modification of the \nPaladin to a Bradley chassis. All but the PIM program have been \ncancelled in the last 8 years or so, and the PIM program has been \ndelayed in production.\n  Current Army fleets of armored personnel carriers, tanks, wheeled \nvehicles, and helicopters were developed and procured 30 to 60 years \nago. DOD and the President's answer to that: cancel FCS, with no viable \nreplacement options, and continue to ``upgrade'' current fleets of \nBradleys an Abrams tanks until the next-generation ground combat \nvehicle can be figured out.\n  Our strategic bomber fleet of B-52s, B-1s and B-2s vary in age from \n10 to 30 years. The SECDEF has publicly stated in the press and in \nCongress that 2020 will be the first time we see a new bomber, which \nmeans that current airframes will have to remain in service until at \nleast 2040.\n  One of our two fifth-generation aircraft, the F-22, the peer to the \nRussian's PAK FA and Chinese JA-12, has had the production line \ncancelled with only 187 aircraft built out of a requested 750, pulling \nus in a ``high risk'' state for air dominance. The other fifth-\ngeneration aircraft, the F-35, will not be ready until at least 2015, \nhas suffered significant cost and timing problems, and will be 250 \naircraft less than the requested 1,240.\n  Our Ohio class Trident submarines, the ones that deliver ballistic \nmissiles from the sea, are an average of 20 years old. Replacement \nbuilds don't start till 2019 and won't be finished until 2028. As well, \nthe administration remains opaque about plans for replacement of the \n30-year-old air-launched cruise missile which is a critical component \nof our nuclear and long-range conventional strike capability. This is \nthe same for our Minuteman ICBM, which is decades old as well.\n  I am convinced well beyond any reasonable doubt that we are heading \ndown a slippery slope due to a shortsighted and dangerous strategy from \nour current administration. The litany of programs cancelled, modified, \nor mismanaged over the last two budget periods is minf-boggling--FCS, \nF-22, F-35, NLOS-C and LS, PIM, missile defense, nuclear stockpile, \nsurface and submarine ships, strategic bombers--the list is \noverwhelming.\n  I, for one, will not let this happen. I will continue to voice my \nconcerns over this issue. I will continue to fight for a flat \nexpenditure of at least 4 percent of GDP spent on defense to ensure \nthat this country continues to have the best military in the world. I \nwill continue to press the administration to do more for the future of \nour national security.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \n``Big Guns'' to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Defense Technology International, Oct. 2010]\n\n               Big Guns--China Muscles Up Artillary Punch\n\n                      (By Richard D. Fisher, Jr.)\n\n       The International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military \n     Balance 2010 report places China third in the number of \n     artillery systems it fields, after Russia and North Korea. \n     But China doubtless exceeds both in resource commitment and \n     breadth of artillery investments. Credited with an estimated \n     17,700-plus towed, self-propelled and rocket systems, the \n     People's Liberation Army (PLA) has at least 56 artillery \n     systems in use, development or available for export. The U.S. \n     Army and Marine Corps, by contrast, have 8,187-plus artillery \n     pieces of roughly 10 types.\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\n       China has had a mixed record of using artillery for \n     military and political-military goals. Its successes as when \n     it routed Indian forces in 1962 with the high-altitude use of \n     artillery and mortars, have been offset by incidents \n     provoking third-party responses or leading to regional \n     standoffs. Examples include the shelling of islands \n     controlled by Taiwan in 1955-58, resulting in U.S. \n     intervention and a stalemate over the Taiwan Strait. In July, \n     a unit based in the Nanjing military region fired missiles \n     from 300-mm. PHL-03 multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) into the \n     Yellow Sea to show China's anger at U.S. naval exercises with \n     South Korea. The exercises, a result of China-backed North \n     Korea's sinking of the South Korean frigate Cheonon in March, \n     went ahead anyway.\n       China evolution as an artillery power stems from Soviet and \n     Russian influences dating to the Korean War Soviet artillery \n     and training improved PLA artillery operations during the war \n     and led to the formation of the first formal artillery \n     command. Soviet aid continued through the 1950s, and by the \n     time of the Sin-Soviet split of the 1960s, China was \n     producing copies or modified versions of Soviet pieces.\n       The PLA makes extensive use of Soviet-origin 152-, 130- and \n     122-mm. calibers, though Western calibers such as the 155- \n     and 105-mm. are seeing greater use. China purchased the \n     Russian 9A52 Smerch 300-mm. MRL in the 1990s, and the PLA \n     produced a near facsimile in the A-100/PHL-03 MRL. The 155-\n     mm. PLZ-05 self-propelled artillery system that emerged in \n     2005 bears an uncanny resemblance to the Russian 2519 MSTA.\n       In the 1990s, PLA artillery was affected by reforms in \n     strategy (its closest concept to doctrine) and organization. \n     Toward the end of the decade, the PLA was immersed in \n     strategy goals of ``informatization'' and ``mechanization.'' \n     The former included the broad application of improving \n     information technologies, which for artillery included new \n     computer-based fire controls and ever-improving digital \n     communication and command linkages. PLA artillery units \n     increasingly include flrefinding counter-battery radar such \n     as the 50-km.-range (31-mi.) SLC-2 and Type 704, and use \n     sophisticated electronic warfare systems such as the Russian \n     SPR-2 radio fuse jammer, a possible Chinese facsimile and \n     possibly a recently revealed artillery radar jammer. \n     Artillery recon vehicles and recon troops feature advanced \n     optronic and digital communication capabilities. In addition, \n     PLA artillery units have sophisticated meteorological \n     capabilities and use muzzle velocity radar to improve \n     accuracy.\n       Mechanization put renewed emphasis on developing tracked \n     and wheeled self-propelled tubed artillery, with rocket \n     artillery largely truck-mounted. This trend was emphasized in \n     late 2004 when Chinese Communist Party and PLA leader Hu \n     Jintao enunciated the PLAs new ``historic missions,'' a \n     euphemism for invasions, which call on the PLA to defend \n     state interests abroad. It is likely that new medium-weight \n     artillery systems based on airmobile armored personnel \n     carriers will follow for these strategic missions.\n       Organic PLA artillery units have decreased in size, \n     following the pattern of general large-scale troop \n     reductions. When combined with ``informatization'' advances, \n     this will permit many infantry and armored divisions to be \n     reformed into mechanized brigades. However, in a counter-\n     trend that emphasizes their continued importance, the PLA \n     maintains five independent artillery divisions and 20 \n     independent brigades. Of these, two divisions and six \n     brigades are stationed in the Shenyang and Beijing military \n     regions, for potential Korean contingencies. Three divisions \n     and eight brigades are in the Nanjing Guangzhou and Jinan \n     military regions, for Taiwan contingencies.\n       Among artillery systems, mortars include a 60-mm. hand-held \n     system used by infantry and special forces. The new Type 93 \n     60-mm. fixed mortar weighs 22.4 kg. (49.2 lb.) and fires 20 \n     rounds/min. to 5.5 km. There are also fixed W91 and W87 81-\n     mm. mortars that fire to 8 km. and 5.6 km., respectively. The \n     PLA has largely copied Russia's Vasilyek 81-mm. automatic \n     mortar, called the W99 or SM-4, which comes in a towed \n     version or mounted in a Hummer-like vehicle. It fires four \n     rounds in 2 sec. out to 6.2 km. The W86 120-mm. towed mortar \n     weighs 206 kg. and fires 20 rounds/min. to 4.7 km.\n       In 2001, the PLA revealed the PLL-05 mobile mortar based on \n     the Russian 120-mm. 2S23 NONA-SVK that it purchased in the \n     1990s, but mounted on a WZ-551 6 X 6 armored personnel \n     carrier (APC). It fires a rocket-assisted round 13.5 km. In \n     2007, the PLA revealed a laser-guided 120-mm. mortar round, \n     though it is not clear if it is in service.\n       Towed and self-propelled tubed systems dominate artillery \n     units. The largest number of towed guns are likely the 122-\n     mm. versions. These include the Type-96, based on the Russian \n     D-30, with a 360-deg. traversing base, and the simpler Type-\n     83. Their rocket-assisted rounds have a 27-km. range. The \n     Type-59 130-mm. towed gun fires a rocket-assisted round 44 \n     km. Of heavy towed artillery, the 152-mm. Type-66, a copy of \n     the Russian D-20, is most numerous and fires rocket-assisted \n     rounds 28 km. In 1999, the PLA revealed the 155-mm. PLL01/WA \n     021 towed artillery system, based on the Austrian Noricum GH \n     N-45, which fires a rocket-assisted round 50 km. The PLL01 \n     and the Type-66 fire 155- and 152-mm. versions of the Russian \n     Krasnopol laser-guided shell.\n       Self-propelled tubed artillery includes the PLL02, which \n     places the Type-86 100-mm. gun on a WZ-551 APC. In 2009, the \n     PLA revealed the new Type-07 122-mm. tracked artillery \n     system, which features hull and electronic improvements over \n     the previous Type-89 Tracked 122-mm. system. In 2009, \n     photographs appeared on the Internet of the SH-3, a truck-\n     mounted 122-mm. artillery system with digital control systems \n     in a hatch over the cab.\n       Heavy self-propelled systems include the 155-mm. PLZ-05, \n     which has a version of the PLL01 gun, and appeared in 2005. \n     It is replacing the 152-mm. Type-83, which entered service in \n     1983. The PLZ-05 also fires the Krasnopol laser-guided \n     projectile and a rocket-assisted round 50 km., and is capable \n     of flat-trajectory antitank fire. Unconfirmed reports state \n     the PLZ-05 has an automatic gun-loading system and weighs 35 \n     tons.\n       PLA investments in rocket artillery are impressive. A five-\n     wheel all-terrain vehicle has been modified to carry a 107-\n     mm. MRL for experimental mechanized special forces units. The \n     tracked Type-89 and more recent Type-90 truck-mounted 122-mm. \n     MRL feature self-contained 40-round rocket reloaders. In \n     addition, the Smerch-derived 12-round PHL-03, which \n     reportedly fires a 150-km.-range missile, is entering \n     increasing numbers of artillery units. The latest AR1A export \n     variant features a modular U.S. MLR system-style 5-round \n     rocket carrier, which speeds reloading. In 2009, Norinco \n     revealed an as yet unidentified truck carrier for this 5-\n     round rocket box, similar to Lockheed Martin's High-Mobility \n     Artillery Rocket System.\n       The PLA is also investing in larger MRL systems. The 400-\n     mm. WS-2D reportedly has a range of 400 km., and one payload \n     features three ``killer unmanned aerial vehicles,'' according \n     to a Chinese report. An earlier 200-km.-range version, the \n     WS-3, uses navigation satellite guidance to achieve a \n     remarkable 50-meter (164-ft.) circular error probable. The WS \n     family complements the 150-km.-range P-12 and 250-km. B-611M \n     maneuverable navsat-guided short-range ballistic missiles \n     (SRBMs), which could supplement or replace the PLA's two \n     brigades of 300-600-km. DF-11A SRBMs.\n       New artillery systems are entering amphibious and airborne \n     units for possible missions abroad. PLA marine and army \n     amphibious units are receiving the Type-07B tracked 122-mm. \n     amphibious artillery system, which places the gun from the \n     Type-07 on a larger hull. Airborne units are equipped with a \n     version of the Type-96 122-mm. gun, but a new tracked \n     airmobile APC may feature a mortar or gun system. The ZBD-09 \n     122-mm. gun system could eventually feature in airmobile army \n     units. Future artillery systems may feature electromagnetic \n     launch, an area of extensive research. The PLA is also \n     interested in ramjet-powered and stealth-coated artillery \n     shells.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7737-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7737-S7738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in just over 100 days, Sudan will face a \ndefining moment. The choices its leaders make can lead to a peaceful \ntwo-state solution. Or, as many fear, they could result in a return to \nchaos and war in a place too often synonymous with both.\n  Responding to this urgency, the Obama administration has recently \nlaunched a heightened campaign of diplomatic engagement with both North \nand South Sudan to help the parties to find their way through this \nprocess. I traveled to Sudan in April 2009 and I have met with Sudanese \nfrom all parts of the country since that time, including Salva Kiir, \nthe leader of Southern Sudan, last week. Today, joined by Senators \nBrownback, Durbin, Wicker and Feingold, I am introducing legislation \nknown as the Sudan Peace and Stability Act. Congress must not be silent \nat this critical time.\n  On January 9, 2011, the people of Southern Sudan and the adjoining \nterritory of Abyei are scheduled to hold referenda on secession. \nRealistically, Sudan's choice is no longer between unity and \nseparation--southerners have apparently made that decision. Every \nreliable source indicates that they will vote for separation, dividing \nAfrica's largest country and taking with them some eighty percent of \nknown Sudanese oil reserves. The Secretary of State has called a vote \nfor separation inevitable. No, the choice before the peoples of Sudan \nis that between a future of peaceful coexistence or a return to the \ncountry's bloody past.\n  The Sudanese, both North and South, set out on this path when they \nsigned the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The CPA brought to a \nclose a war that had raged for two decades and claimed millions of \nlives. And it offered Southern Sudan the promise of a choice in 2011 \nbetween continuing unity and separation from the Sudanese government in \nKhartoum.\n  The landmark agreement ended the war, but it intentionally postponed \nthe\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\ntough decisions about the modalities and meaning of 2011. In theory, \nthe six intervening years were intended to solidify connections between \nformer enemies. But not enough was done to build those ties, and the \ndeath of South Sudan's most forceful voice for unity, Dr. John Garang, \nfurther diminished unity's prospects. For champions of separation, the \ntime period meant a deferral of their dream of independence that has \nnow come due. But this intervening period has also served one crucial \npurpose: It has demonstrated that North and South can live side by side \nin peace.\n  With January fast approaching and progress scant on the mechanisms \nfor division, the two sides are almost out of time to craft a peaceful \ntransition. To fulfill the full promise of the landmark 2005 peace \nagreement, they must negotiate terms of separation and prepare for a \nfuture in which they remain fundamentally connected.\n  Southern Sudan possesses most of the known petroleum reserves, but \nthe pipelines to market for that oil run through the north. An \nestimated million and a half southerners displaced by the war live in \nKhartoum and may well remain there, and northerners will live in the \nSouth. Every dry season, herders from the north's Arab Misseriya tribes \ncross into what will likely become the country of Southern Sudan and \nthen return. The Nile will continue to flow northward, irrespective of \nborders and politics. Boundaries must simultaneously be demarcated and \naccommodating. And the parties need to finalize the details fast enough \nto ensure that violence cannot fill the vacuum.\n  The last war between North and South lasted for decades and claimed \nmillions of lives. And, earlier this year, then Director of National \nIntelligence Dennis Blair told Congress that, over the next five years, \nSouthern Sudan is the place where ``a new mass killing or genocide is \nmost likely to occur.''\n  America acted as one of the architects of the CPA in 2005, and has a \nmoral obligation as well as a strategic interest in helping the parties \nto see it through. The Sudanese must make the decisions, but we--and \nothers--can help them navigate this process. Failure to act now--\nwhether by high level diplomatic engagement, scenario planning for a \nvariety of potential outcomes, and pre-positioning humanitarian \nsupplies in the region--may contribute to a larger crisis later.\n  While we try to prevent the next potential wave of genocide, we \ncannot ignore the fact that Darfur's tragedy remains unresolved. Even \nas America asks how it can help Southern Sudan prepare for the likely \nburdens of statehood, it must also consider the Sudan that remains and \nDarfur's need for peace, stability, and justice. Attention to Darfur \nmust not be a casualty of our necessary fixation on the North-South \ncrisis.\n  The goals of the legislation are:\n  1. To spell out clearly the objectives of U.S. policy and the \nbilateral and multilateral tools available to pursue them;\n  2. To emphasize the need for all parties to commit to see the CPA \nthrough the January referenda and beyond;\n  3. To underscore the importance of Darfur and to provide policy \nguidance on both the peace process and the humanitarian situation;\n  4. To lay the legal groundwork, spur the humanitarian planning, and \nshape the policy framework in the likelihood of secession; and\n  5. To strengthen both capacity building and accountability.\n  Our bill offers a number of specific prescriptions, including the \ndesignation of a senior official to work with the Special Envoy to \nSudan by heading up the U.S. team in the Darfur peace process, much as \nAmbassador Princeton Lyman is currently doing in Juba in the South. The \nlegislation also seeks to strengthen multilateral efforts to build \ncapacity in the South and aid implementation of the CPA.\n  In approaching Sudan we are rightly concentrating for the moment on \nthe things that the parties must do between now and January 9, 2011, \nfrom registering voters for the referenda to coming to terms on major \nissues such as citizenship, oil, debts, and the border territory of \nAbyei. But we must also look beyond January as well. Much has to be \ndone between January and July 2011, when, under the terms of the CPA, \nSouthern Sudan and Abyei are to become independent if that is the \noutcome of the referenda. But even more importantly, we have to think \nbeyond that milestone, to what independence will mean for a new and \nfragile country in the south and a significantly changed country in the \nnorth, including for Darfur.\n  The United States helped to bring about the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement. We have led the world in providing humanitarian assistance \nand in supporting the peacekeeping mission in Darfur. While the \nSudanese must own their future, the United States can help the parties \nfind a path forward to peace and stability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7738-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7738-S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EPA OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today \nto speak about the importance of oversight.\n  As you may recall, on April 22, 2010, EPA's new lead-based paint, the \nlead, renovation, repair and painting rule, went into effect. At that \ntime, offices on the Hill were inundated with intense public outcry \nfrom constituents--from homeowners to contractors to landlords to \nplumbers--all trying to get more information about a rule that, in most \ncases, they had just learned about. People were confused about the \nimplications of the rule.\n  This rule affects anyone who owns or lives in a home built before \n1978 and looking to do a renovation. Specifically, the rule requires \nthat renovations in these homes that disturb more than six square feet \nmust be supervised by a certified renovator and conducted by a \ncertified renovation firm. In order to become certified, contractors \nmust submit an application--with a fee--to EPA, and complete a training \ncourse for instruction on lead-safe work practices. Those who violate \nthe rule could face a fine of $37,500 a day.\n  In my role as ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, prior to implementation, I sent several letters to EPA \nexpressing concern with the rate of training. I wrote on two separate \noccasions warning EPA that it seemed badly unprepared to properly \nimplement the rule. In both cases, EPA said they were ready.\n  In a June 3, 2009 letter responding to my concerns, EPA wrote:\n\n       I agree that both EPA and the regulated community have a \n     great deal of preparation in front of us as we approach next \n     April's deadline. I am confident, however, that the ten \n     months between now and April 2010 will allow us to meet this \n     deadline....We are confident that all renovators subject to \n     the requirements of the rule will be able to find a provider \n     in advance of our deadline.\n\n  In a letter dated December 1, 2009, EPA wrote:\n\n       we are confident there will be enough training providers to \n     meet the demand. EPA does not plan to revise the April 2010 \n     effective date of the RRP rule....Currently, the capacity for \n     training is in excess of the demand as several training \n     courses have been cancelled for lack of attendance.\n\n  On implementation day, April 22, 2010, EPA had only accredited 204 \ntraining providers who had conducted just over 6,900 courses, training \nan estimated 160,000 people in the construction and remodeling \nindustries to use lead-safe work practices. That number fell far short \nof the total number of remodelers who would be working on pre-1978 \nhomes.\n  Let me say it again: on implementation day, EPA had only trained an \nestimated 160,000 people in the construction and remodeling industries \nto use lead-safe work practices.\n  I suspected that there wouldn't be enough contractors to even meet \nEPA's estimate of certifying 186,811 renovators by April 2010. So I \nsent a bipartisan letter to OMB requesting that they delay \nimplementation of the rule until there was enough time for more people \nto be certified. Additionally, I spoke to Cass Sunstein, Administrator \nof the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at OMB, and was \njoined by some of my Oklahoma contractors, who relayed the difficulties \nthey were facing. I appreciate Mr. Sunstein listening to the concerns \nof my Oklahoma constituents. He told us he recognized the economic \nimpact of the implementation of the rule and explored ways to provide a \n60-day delay, but, by April 23, we simply ran out of options.\n  The rule was in place, there were not enough renovators, and EPA \nargued that a delay in the rule would delay\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\nprotection for children and their families. But because the Federal \nGovernment failed to meet the demand for certified contractors, the \nFederal Government was already delaying the implementation of the rule.\n  I was proud that the Senate intervened to send a clear message to \nEPA. The Senate passed the Collins-Inhofe amendment, S. 4253, to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 4899, by a vote of 60 to 37.\n  This amendment prevented supplemental funds from being used to \nimplement the rule. The vote showed overwhelming bipartisan concern \nabout EPA's disastrous implementation of the lead-based paint rule.\n  Fortunately, EPA got the message. On June 18, 2010, EPA's enforcement \noffice issued a memorandum extending the lead rule deadline for \nrenovators to enroll in training classes to September 30, 2010. \nFurthermore, it has extended the deadline for contractors to complete \ntraining to December 31, 2010, and most importantly, the agency agreed \nto work to provide additional trainers in areas of need.\n  EPA's concerns about extending additional time for renovators to \nbecome certified never materialized; in fact, instead of people \ncontinuing to delay signing up for classes, people flocked to them. \nEPA's most recent training numbers show that as of September 23, 2010, \nEPA has accredited 364 training providers who have conducted more than \n21,400 courses, training an estimated 476,700 people in the \nconstruction and remodeling industries to use lead-safe work practices.\n  From just 160,000 people in April, to 476,700 people in September, \nmore time has meant greater ability to take classes and come into \ncompliance.\n  The delay has allowed another 160 training providers to be certified; \nan additional 14,500 courses to be held; and 316,700 people to receive \ntraining in lead safe work practices.\n  Unfortunately, we did not have one oversight hearing on this rule. \nThere were numerous opportunities prior to the rule going final, but \nthey were never taken. Nonetheless, I am pleased to have worked with \nSenators Collins, Alexander, Vitter, Coburn and others to highlight \nthis important issue and provide additional time for renovators to \nattend training classes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7739-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SAFETY ACT IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the House of Representatives passed \nthe Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act Improvements Act of 2010, which \npassed the Senate unanimously in May. I applaud the leadership of the \nHouse for taking up this legislation, which is of great importance to \nthe law enforcement community. Today's action brings to a successful \nconclusion the good work of Senators and Representatives who have \nhelped move this legislation through both Chambers and builds upon the \nbipartisan Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act that was enacted in \n2004.\n  I want to recognize the longstanding efforts and strong support of \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, and the National Association of Police Organizations, \nalong with many others in the broader law enforcement community. Their \nsupport and assistance contributed greatly to today's success. I also \nthank the Judiciary Committee's ranking member Senator Sessions, \nSenator Kyl, and Senator Conrad for their cosponsorship.\n  This legislation will assist qualified Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement officers in exercising their privileges related to the \ninterstate concealed carry of firearms under existing law more easily \nand efficiently. The legislation will give active-duty officers and \nqualified retired officers more flexibility in obtaining the necessary \ncredentials in several important ways and will overcome some of the \nchallenges that retired officers have faced in the past in obtaining \ncertification. The legislation will also remove some of the \nadministrative pressure on law enforcement agencies by allowing the \nrequired firearms qualification testing of retired officers to be done \nby a private firearms instructor who is certified to test active-duty \nofficers in his or her jurisdiction and at the officer's own expense. \nAnd it will give law enforcement agencies more certainty and authority \nwhen determining whether a retired officer suffers from mental health \nissues sufficient to disqualify that officer from certification under \nthe law.\n  I have great confidence in the men and women in law enforcement who \nput their own lives on the line to serve their fellow citizens every \nday. This confidence extends to these men and women whether they are on \nthe job or off duty. I trust in them and their proven ability to \nexercise the firearm privileges provided under the Law Enforcement \nOfficers Safety Act responsibly and with the same solemnity with which \nthey approach their official duties.\n  I have said many times that Congress's efforts to assist State and \nlocal law enforcement are a crucial part of our Federal policy and a \npolicy that pays dividends in our overall capability to protect the \ncitizens of the United States. State and local law enforcement officers \nare the first line of defense and support in America's communities, and \nfor that they deserve the recognition and continued support of \nCongress. We must also recognize the men and women who serve as law \nenforcement officers throughout the Federal Government, for whom this \nlegislation will also provide benefits. Federal officers play an \nindispensible role in the Federal system and in important partnerships \nwith State and local officials around the country. I am glad that the \nimprovements we have worked for over the last several years will \nfinally be enacted, and I look forward to hearing about the positive \nchanges that will come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7739-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7739-S7740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PERSECUTION OF THE BAHA'IS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to call the \nSenate's attention to members of the Baha'i faith who have and continue \nto suffer severe persecution by the Iranian Government.\n  Senators should be aware that seven prominent Iranian Baha'i leaders \nare currently in prison, facing sentences of up to 10 years, charged \nwith espionage, establishing an illegal administration, and promoting \npropaganda against the Islamic order. These spurious charges are only \nthe latest example of the mistreatment of the largest religious \nminority in Iran.\n  Ironically, the Baha'i faith originated in Iran during the 19th \ncentury, separating the Baha'is from their previous affiliation with \nIslam. The founder of the faith, known as The Bb, was then arrested, \nlocked in a dungeon, and executed, as were some 20,000 of his \nfollowers. These atrocities devastated a religion whose tenets include \nglobal unity, peace and diversity.\n  Persecution of the Baha'is in Iran continued into the next century, \nwith the Iranian Government's destruction of Baha'i literature in 1933, \nand in 1955 the demolition of the Baha'i national headquarters. Since \nthe establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, the \ngovernment has stepped up its active discrimination against the \nBaha'is. Children are prohibited or discouraged from receiving higher \neducation, Baha'is are unable to practice their faith in public, they \nare prevented from opening businesses or advancing their careers, and \nBaha'i cemeteries are destroyed. Baha'is are slandered by the Iranian \nmedia, often called worshippers of Satan.\n  The arrests of the seven Baha'I leaders are the latest official \nIranian abuse against members of this religious faith. These men and \nwomen led the ``Friends in Iran,'' a Baha'i group working to meet the \nneeds of the Baha'is in Iran. After their arrest, the group disbanded, \nreducing the much needed support to the Baha'is. The leaders were \nincarcerated in 2008, and were not brought before a judge for over 20 \nmonths.\n  The systematic abuses of the Baha'i by the Iranian Government are \nclear violations of provisions in the International Covenant on Civil \nand Political Rights, to which Iran is a signatory, on economic and \neducational opportunities, religious freedom, and due process. They are \nalso violations of Iran's own laws.\n  Prominent global leaders are speaking out in support of the Baha'is \nin Iran, including Secretary of State Clinton, her British counterpart \nWilliam Hague, and the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy \nBuzek. They\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\nhave each expressed concern and disapproval with Iran's mistreatment of \nBaha'is. They are joined by a long list of human rights groups, such as \nthe International Federation for Human rights, Human Rights Watch and \nthe Iranian League for the Defense of Human Rights. I want to add my \nvoice in condemning Iran's persecution of its Baha'i religious \nminority.\n  Our Nation stands for fundamental rights and freedoms. We are not \nperfect, and I have not hesitated to speak out when I felt we fell \nshort of our own values and principles. But I also believe we have an \nobligation to speak out when the fundamental rights of citizens of \nother nations are being denied. The Baha'is of Iran deserve our \nadmiration and support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7740-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ASSISTANCE FOR AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at a time when many Americans are \nincreasingly concerned with the situation in Afghanistan, I was \ninterested in an investigative report on U.S. aid for Afghanistan in \nthe August 2, 2010, issue of the Christian Science Monitor weekly \nmagazine. The report describes several aspects of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development's approach to development in that country, \nand I want to take a minute to clarify what may be a misconception \nabout the Congress's expectations.\n  The article describes USAID's focus on the ``burn rate''--that is, \nhow quickly aid funds are spent. With this as USAID's focus, the more \nmoney the President asks for, the more money Congress appropriates, the \nmore money USAID has available to spend, and the faster USAID says it \nneeds to spend it in order to satisfy Congress.\n  The article gives examples of the mistakes and problems that have \nresulted from trying to spend too much, too fast, in an environment \nwhere security threats severely limit the ability of USAID to monitor \nthe funds, where a large percentage of the population lives as though \nit were the 12th century, where corruption is pervasive, and where the \nKarzai Government is widely perceived as ineffective or worse. The \narticle describes big-dollar contracts with foreign companies that are \nnot familiar with Afghanistan, for projects that are hastily designed \nfrom the top down, are overly ambitious, and too often do not produce \ngood results.\n  This is one Senator who is not impressed by burn rates. I don't think \nthey are a good measure of anything, except possibly waste. When I hear \nthat the administration expects to increase the burn rate for USAID \nprograms and activities in Afghanistan from $250 million per month to \n$300 million per month, it rings alarm bells. I am interested in \nprojects that are worth the investment and that provide lasting \nimprovements in the lives of the Afghan people. More often, that means \nspending less, and spending it more slowly and more carefully.\n  What we are seeing in Afghanistan is reminiscent of Iraq, although in \nIraq the waste and shoddy results were on a far larger scale. The \nPentagon was asked to be a relief and reconstruction agency that it was \nnever meant to be. The empty buildings, electricity blackouts and \nunfinished projects are part of the costly legacy of that debacle.\n  But the increasing tendency in Afghanistan to measure progress by the \nrate at which money is spent is unwise. We have urged USAID to go \nslower, to focus on smaller, manageable, sustainable projects that are \nchosen with input from local communities. Local people, and local \ngovernments or national government ministries with a record of \ntransparency, accountability and good performance, should be involved \nat all stages, from design to implementation to oversight. It may take \nlonger, the projects may not be as grandiose, but the long term results \nare likely to be better.\n  In response, we are told USAID needs more money to support the \ncivilian surge and implement bigger projects quickly as part of the \n``clear, hold, build'' strategy. I understand the pressure USAID is \nunder, from the Pentagon, the White House, and the State Department, to \nspend more money faster. I suspect if it were up to USAID alone it \nwould spend less and get better results. And I am concerned that at the \nsame time USAID is being told to spend more, it is treated as a second-\nclass agency that sometimes has to fight just to be included in the \ndiscussions about the very strategy it is told to implement.\n  But I have seen, as the Christian Science Monitor describes, the \ndisappointing results of the big-spending, rushed approach. Costly new \nroads that are already deteriorating, poorly built irrigation canals \nthat have collapsed from landslides, hydro-electric projects that don't \nproduce electricity. United States officials in Kabul who have been in \nthe country only a few months and will be gone after a year, trying to \ndirect what happens on the ground hundreds of miles away. Perhaps the \nworst of it is that many Afghans have become angry and distrustful of \nthe United States because they know these projects were expensive and \nmismanaged, and promises were not kept. Just as bad is when USAID \ncontractors issue self-serving reports--describing projects which cost \ntoo much and produced too little--as success stories.\n  Of course, spending billions of dollars does produce successes. \nHundreds of thousands of Afghan girls are in school thanks to the \nUnited States. That alone is a major achievement. Agricultural \nproductivity is increasing, thanks to USAID programs, although opium \npoppy cultivation is also flourishing. Another success is the money we \nprovide to the National Solidarity Program, which works from the bottom \nup, with better oversight and less waste than the big contracts. It is \nsupporting economic development projects, often costing only a few tens \nof thousands of dollars, in thousands of Afghan towns and villages.\n  But these successes should not obscure the fact that planning, \nimplementation, and oversight of programs need to be better, both for \nAmerican taxpayers and for the Afghan people.\n  At a time when we face large budget deficits and money is scarce, I \ndoubt the wisdom of spending billions of dollars this way. That is one \nreason the Department of State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee has \nrecommended $1.3 billion less than the President requested for aid for \nAfghanistan for fiscal year 2011. Some argue that we should have cut \neven more.\n  We want to help the people of Afghanistan. They have suffered, and \ncontinue to suffer, every imaginable hardship. Combating poverty, \nempowering women whose political participation is essential to the \nfuture of that country, building more effective public institutions, \nand strengthening the rule of law in Afghanistan are in the long term \ninterests of the United States. We know that in a country torn by \nconflict and where corruption is rampant, some projects will fail no \nmatter how well designed they are. We understand that there is an \nunavoidable element of risk. But spending money fast is not the same as \ntaking risks to help people.\n  I urge the administration to review its current assumptions, look \ncritically at the results so far, take the time to understand the \nlessons learned, and reevaluate the amount of aid that Afghanistan can \neffectively absorb so progress is measured not by the rate at which \nmoney is spent, but by tangible improvements in the lives of the Afghan \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7740-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7740-S7741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   10TH ANNIVERSARY OF BONE BUILDERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, next month, RSVP programs in Vermont's \nRutland and Addison Counties will be celebrating the 10th anniversary \nof Bone Builders, a free exercise program that helps Vermonters combat \nand prevent osteoporosis. I congratulate all the participants and \nvolunteers who have contributed to the success of Bone Builders and for \nreaching this milestone.\n  As we mark the 6-month milepost of the Affordable Health Care Act and \nthe implementation of more and more of its benefits for Americans and \ntheir families, we all are increasingly attuned to the advantages of \nending the corrosive health cost spiral, and the roles to be played by \nindividual and organized preventive efforts like Bone Builders.\n  Bone Builders uses RSVP volunteers to lead weight training and \nbalance exercise classes aimed at preventing fractures caused by \nosteoporosis. Classes help participants increase their muscular \nstrength, balance, and overall bone density. Countless studies have\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\nshown that women who participate in exercise programs like Bone \nBuilders can gain bone density while nonparticipants will continue to \nlose bone density.\n  One particular story shared with me captures how important this \nprogram is to help keep Vermonters healthy. A few years ago during a \nparticularly rough winter, a Bone Builders participant was walking to \nher bird feeder and fell, injuring herself. Yards away from her house \nand her phone, she found the strength to drag herself back to her \nhouse. Later she told an RSVP volunteer that she would not have been \nable to get inside to call for help if she had not participated in Bone \nBuilders.\n  Medical experts estimate that there are 1.5 million fractures per \nyear in the United States due to osteoporosis, costing nearly $20 \nmillion in health care services and treatments. Doctors in Vermont, \nunderstanding how important strength training programs are for seniors \nin order to prevent osteoporosis, have started to refer patients to \nlocal classes and hand out Bone Builders brochures. Since the program \nhas been so successful and popular in Vermont, there are now more than \n100 classes offered across our State.\n  The program has helped countless Vermonters not only improve their \nhealth but make connections in their communities. Some participants \nhave recently lost spouses or have had health difficulties that may \nisolate them within their neighborhood and communities. The camaraderie \nand friendship that participants in Bone Builders find through classes \noften leads them to socialize outside of the program. In fact, the \nprogram has been so successful in Vermont that the Bone Builders model \nhas been replicated in several other States, including California, \nMaine, Florida and Minnesota.\n  I am proud of the Vermonters who have taken the initiative and \nchallenged themselves in these classes, and for the work of the \nvolunteers who spend their time inspiring others to improve their \nhealth. I look forward to celebrating the work of RSVP Bone Builders \nand many other such anniversaries in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7741-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR ROLAND BURRIS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Roland Burris of Illinois was sworn \ninto office less than 2 years ago. In that short time, he has debated \nand voted on some of the most important legislation the Senate has \nconsidered in 40 years. During his tenure, Senator Burris has helped \npass major reforms to end abuses by the credit card industry, to put a \ncop back on the beat on Wall Street, and to expand health care coverage \nto 32 million Americans while reducing the Federal deficit by $143 \nbillion. Senator Burris also voted to confirm the nomination of two \nU.S. Supreme Court Justices: Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n  Senator Burris serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which I \nchair. During his service on the committee, Senator Burris helped \nprovide oversight of the military as we draw down U.S. forces in Iraq \nand standup Afghan forces in Afghanistan. He has helped pass weapons \nacquisition reform legislation and two National Defense Authorization \nActs out of committee. He has helped confirm the nominations of \nNation's top civilian and military leaders.\n  Before coming to the Senate, Roland Burris had a distinguished career \nin Illinois politics, as Illinois comptroller and then as the Illinois \nattorney general.\n  As Senator Burris ends his time here in the Senate, I thank him for \nhis service to our Nation and wish him and his family the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7741-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR CARTE GOODWIN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Senator Carte \nP. Goodwin of West Virginia for his service. When he was sworn into \noffice in July, Senator Goodwin assumed the seat previously held by the \nChamber's longest serving and one of the most distinguished Senators in \nour history--Senator Robert C. Byrd, who passed away on June 28.\n  Before arriving in the Senate, Senator Goodwin already had an \nimpressive political career. As chief counsel to West Virginia Governor \nJoe Manchin, Carte Goodwin led the effort to reform mine safety rules \nin the wake of the Sago and Aracoma coal mine disasters that killed 14 \ncoal miners. He also served as the chairman of the West Virginia School \nBuilding Authority.\n  Senator Goodwin serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which \nI chair. As a committee member, Senator Goodwin has helped pass the \nNational Defense Authorization Act out of committee. He has also \ncontributed to hearings overseeing the status of conflicts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  As Senator Goodwin's time in the Senate draws to a close, I thank him \nfor his service to our country, and I wish him and his family the very \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7741-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD STEM CELL SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, next week, scientists, researchers, \nindustry leaders and advocates from around the world will gather in \nDetroit, MI, for the sixth annual World Stem Cell Summit. By bringing \ntogether experts in medicine, genetics, business, and economic \ndevelopment, the summit will give a boost to global efforts aimed at \nfinding cures for debilitating and deadly diseases, as well as bringing \nthe important economic benefits of bioscience. By choosing Detroit as \nthe site of this year's summit, the organizers have made a powerful \nstatement about Michigan's commitment to this vital area of scientific \nexploration.\n  In 2008, Michigan voters approved a referendum protecting the ability \nof Michigan researchers to engage in research involving stem cells. \nThis wise decision has already paid significant dividends. Researchers \nat the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State \nUniversity, and other Michigan institutions have made significant \nprogress even in that short time. UM has established a consortium to \naid the search for treatments and cures, and a UM researcher, Dr. Eva \nFeldman, last year obtained FDA approval for the first ever clinical \ntrials on a stem cell therapy for ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. \nResearchers at MSU are advancing work on stem cell treatments for \nParkinson's disease. At Wayne State, scientists are examining how stem \ncells can be made more useful for a wide variety of medical purposes. \nThese and other institutions across the State are working hard to save \nand improve lives, and I congratulate them for their efforts.\n  Michigan researchers will join others from across the country and \naround the world at next week's summit. They will examine not only the \nlatest scientific advances but important subjects such as how stem cell \nresearch can contribute to economic development efforts, another area \nin which Michigan has quickly become a leader.\n  I would like to welcome those who will travel to Detroit next week \nand thank them for the opportunity to show what Michigan has \naccomplished in the stem cell field. I wish them every success as they \nseek to protect the health and save the lives of the millions of people \ncoping with diseases that stem cell research might one day cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7741-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7741-S7742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMBATTING TERRORISTS' ACCESS TO FIREARMS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in May 2010, the Senate Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on how known or \nsuspected terrorists are taking advantage of lax Federal laws to \npurchase firearms. The committee discussed two legislative proposals, \nboth of which I have cosponsored, to address this weakness in current \nlaw: the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, \nS. 1317, and the PROTECT Act, S. 2820. S. 1317 would close the loophole \nin current law--known as the terror gap--that prevents the Federal \nGovernment from stopping the sale of firearms or explosives to a known \nor suspected terrorist--unless that individual falls under another \ndisqualifying category. S.2820 would lengthen the time--from the \ncurrent duration of 90 days to 10-years the FBI is required to keep gun \ntransfer records that involve a purchaser on the terrorist watch list. \nUnfortunately, despite broad support from the law enforcement \ncommunity, Congress has failed to pass these commonsense pieces of \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S7742]]\n\n  On September 22, 2010, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee held a hearing entitled ``Nine Years After 9/11: \nConfronting the Terrorist Threat to the Homeland.'' At this hearing, I \nquestioned FBI Director Robert Mueller about the FBI's efforts to \nprevent individuals on the terrorist watch list from acquiring firearms \nand explosives. In regard to S. 1317, I asked Director Mueller if he \nhad an opinion as to whether or not persons on the terrorist watch list \nshould be able to buy guns and explosives. I was pleased to hear \nDirector Mueller's response that ``all of us would want to keep weapons \nout of the hands of terrorists and/or persons on the terrorist watch \nlist.'' This response echoes the support given at a November 2009 \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing by Attorney General Eric Holder, the \nNation's top law enforcement official, for legislation to close the \nterror gap.\n  In regard to S. 2820, I asked Director Mueller whether he would like \nto be able to keep firearm transfer records for longer than 90 days for \npersons on the terrorist watch list. Again, I was glad to hear that \nDirector Mueller favors a longer period of record retention across the \nboard, including for those persons who are on the terrorist watch list. \nAccording to Director Mueller, ``retention of records gives us an \nability to go back, when we identify some person, and determine whether \nor not there's additional information we would have in those records \nthat would enable us to conduct a more efficient investigation.''\n  At this hearing, Director Mueller added his voice to the chorus of \nsupport from so many law enforcement professionals for legislative \nsolutions that address the deficiencies in current law. Closing the \nterror gap and increasing the duration of firearm record retention are \ntwo ways to give the law enforcement community the necessary tools to \nkeep guns and explosives out of the hands of known and suspected \nterrorists. Congress should listen to the brave men and women charged \nwith protecting the American public and, without further delay, pass \nthese commonsense solutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7742-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM CORLESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as Members of the Senate, we work every day \nwith public servants who fill an amazing variety of roles, and when one \nof those servants fills his or her role with exceptional skill and \ndedication, they deserve our praise. One such public servant, Jim \nCorless, the superintendent of Keweenaw National Historical Park in \nMichigan, is preparing to retire after nearly 30 years of Federal \nservice, the last 3 of which have come in helping build one of the most \nunique national parks in the Nation.\n  Jim Corless came to Michigan's Copper Country from Klondike Gold Rush \nNational Historical Park in Skagway, AK, making him that rare person \nwho moved south to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This was good \nfortune for those of us who care about preserving the history of \nMichigan's copper mining era because Jim's career had prepared him \nwell. As a trained historian, Jim had already helped bring alive the \ndrama of our Nation's founding, the frontier grit of the earliest Texas \nsettlers, the history of Ozark waterways in Arkansas, and the growth of \ntextile manufacturing in Massachusetts in parks from coast to coast.\n  Preserving the legacy of Michigan's copper mining industry has long \nbeen a priority for many of us Michiganians. The Keweenaw Peninsula \ncontained perhaps the world's richest and purest deposits of copper, \nand from native peoples 7,000 years ago to miners in the 19th and 20th \ncenturies, those deposits have had profound effects on human society \nacross our Nation and on the peninsula.\n  The park established in 1992 to preserve that history is like no \nother in the Nation. Unlike the vast majority of National Park Service \nfacilities, in which the government owns and controls the land and \nassociated assets of the park, Keweenaw National Historical Park is an \nunusual public-private cooperative venture. Private citizens, nonprofit \ngroups, and local governments own nearly all the park's historic \nassets, and they are managed cooperatively, with the Park Service \nproviding coordination, advice and funding.\n  That calls for a superintendent who is part historian, part manager, \nand part diplomat. Jim has skillfully served all three roles. He has \nworked closely with officials at the Environmental Protection Agency to \nsimultaneously preserve the industrial legacy of the copper mines while \nremediating the environmental impact of that legacy. And he has taken a \nleading, but always cooperative, role in bringing together the various \ncommunity interests who have a stake in the park and its growth. Just \none example of this work is his work to help create the Quincy Smelter \nSteering Committee to help preserve one of the park's most important \nhistoric resources.\n  Jim describes Keweenaw National Historical Park as a ``parknership,'' \nand that illustrates the thoughtful way in which he has approached his \njob over the last 3 years. All of us who care about Michigan's vital \nmining past are grateful for his exceptional service, and we all wish \nhim and his wife Mary Jane the very best as they embark on the next \nchapter of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7742-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7742-S7745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Master Sergeant Jared Van Aalst\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of MSG Jared Van Aalst, \na native of Laconia, NH. Jared was killed on August 4 while stationed \nin Kunduz Province, Afghanistan. He was serving on his sixth combat \ndeployment as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Jared exemplified the \nvery best in our military's long tradition of selfless service on \nbehalf of this great nation.\n  Master Sergeant Van Aalst enlisted in the U.S. Army on August 17, \n1995. After completing basic training, the signal systems specialist \ncourse and basic airborne school, he was assigned to the Headquarters \nCompany. He later completed the Ranger indoctrination program and \nsniper school, and continued to rise through the ranks as a sniper team \nleader and squad leader. Master Sergeant Van Aalst was promoted to \nsniper platoon sergeant, platoon sergeant, and finally served as the \nnoncommissioned officer in charge of Headquarters Company's 3rd \nBattalion Reconnaissance, Sniper and Technical Surveillance. He saw \ncombat in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Afghanistan.\n  An exceptional marksman and soldier, in 2005 Master Sergeant Van \nAalst defeated 147 of his brothers in arms to take first place at the \nservice-rifle individual championship in the U.S. Army Small Arms \nChampionships. He was later selected as a shooter and instructor for \nthe U.S. Marksmanship Unit at Fort Benning.\n  Master Sergeant Van Aalst's many awards include the Bronze Star \nMedal, two Meritorious Service Medals, two Joint Service Commendation \nMedals, three Army commendation Medals, seven Army Achievement Medals \nand five Good Conduct Medals, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with two \nbronze service stars, the Iraq Campaign Medal with two bronze service \nstars and the National Defense Service Medal with bronze service star. \nHe was posthumously awarded a second Bronze Star Medal and a third \nPurple Heart Medal, as well as the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. \nOur Nation can never adequately thank Jared for his willingness to make \nthe ultimate sacrifice in the defense of American liberties, nor can \nwords diminish the pain of losing this brave American. For his 15 years \nof service, he has earned our country's enduring gratitude and \nrecognition.\n  A Laconia native, Jared was a graduate of Plymouth Regional High \nSchool in Plymouth, NH, where he was the captain of the high school \nwrestling team and one of the best wrestlers in the entire state in his \nweight class. He is remembered for his incredible drive and \ndetermination to succeed.\n  Jared has been laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. He is \nsurvived by his wife Katie Van Aalst, their two daughters Kaylie and \nAva, and his parents Neville and Nancy Van Aalst. This brave New \nHampshire son will be dearly missed by all.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nof MSG Jared Van Aalst.\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\n                         Sergeant andrew Nicol\n\n  Mr. President, today it is also my sad duty to pay tribute to the \nservice and sacrifice of SGT Andrew Nicol, a native of Kensington, NH. \nAndrew, just 23 years old, was killed in action by an improvised \nexplosive device on August 8 in Kandahar, Afghanistan, while supporting \nOperation Enduring Freedom. He served as an Army Ranger and was a \nmember of the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, based at Fort \nBenning in Georgia.\n  Despite his young age, Sergeant Nicol served five tours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and was awarded many medals for his valor. These included \nthe Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense \nService Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Combat Star, Iraq \nCampaign Medal with Combat Star, and the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal. He was honored for heroic actions during a combat \nmission in October 2008 and was also awarded the Bronze Star Medal for \nValor for heroic actions in northern Iraq. His actions during these \nmissions saved the lives of fellow soldiers and led to the capture of \nnumerous enemy insurgents. Sergeant Nicol was posthumously awarded an \nadditional Bronze Star Medal, a Meritorious Service Medal and a Purple \nHeart. Unquestionably, he served his country with both honor and \ndistinction.\n  Andrew was a 2005 graduate of Exeter High School. He was captain of \nthe wrestling team there, and earned the respect and affection of his \npeers through his leadership and wonderful sense of humor. Andrew \nlooked for challenges, from racing in New Hampshire motocross \ncompetitions to serving as a volunteer firefighter and EMT. He was an \nindispensable member of his community.\n  Sergeant Nicol exemplified the best in New Hampshire's long tradition \nof service to this country. Our Nation can never adequately thank this \nyoung hero for his willingness to lay down his life in defense of the \nAmerican people and words cannot fill the void left by his death. I \nhope that Andrew's family can find solace in knowing that all Americans \nshare a deep appreciation for his service. Daniel Webster's words, \nfirst spoken during his eulogy for Presidents Adams and Jefferson in \n1826, are fitting: ``Although no sculptured marble should rise to their \nmemory, nor engraved stone bear record of their deeds, yet will their \nremembrance be as lasting as the land they honored.'' Sergeant Nicol \nhas earned our country's enduring gratitude and recognition.\n  Andrew has been laid to rest at the New Hampshire State Veterans \nCemetary in Boscawen. He is survived by his parents Roland and Patricia \nNicol of Kensington, NH, and older brother Roland who lives in Boston. \nThis young patriot will be dearly missed by all.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nof SGT Andrew Nicol.\n\n\n                       Staff Sergeant Kyle Warren\n\n  Mr. President, today with a heavy heart, I also wish to pay tribute \nto the life and service of Army SSG Kyle Warren, who was killed on July \n29 in Tsagay, Afghanistan, by an improvised explosive device. Warren, \nformerly of Manchester, NH, was on his second deployment to \nAfghanistan. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces \nGroup, Airborne, based at Fort Bragg, NC.\n  Staff Sergeant Warren joined the military in 2004, entering the Army \nas a Special Forces trainee. Following Basic and Special Forces \ntraining, he completed medical training at the John F. Kennedy Special \nWarfare Center and School. By 2007, Warren had earned a Green Beret and \nwent on to serve as a Special Forces medical sergeant during two tours \nof duty. His awards include the Bronze Star Medal, Army Achievement \nMedal, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan \nCampaign Medal, NATO Medal, Purple Heart, and Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal. Unquestionably, he served our Nation with distinction \nand honor.\n  A native of southern California, Kyle moved to New Hampshire in 2003 \nto be closer to his mother. While in Manchester, Kyle joined the local \nmen's rugby club and quickly made friends with his teammates. He is \nremembered for his wonderful sense of humor, remarkable physical \nstrength, and exceptional kindness.\n  SSG Kyle Warren exemplified the best in New Hampshire's long \ntradition of service to this country. Our Nation can never adequately \nthank him for his willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense \nof the American people and words cannot fill the void left by his \ndeath. He has earned our Nation's enduring gratitude and recognition.\n  SSG Kyle Warren is survived by his wife Sandra, whom he met while \nliving in New Hampshire, his mother and stepfather Lynn and Ed Linta, \nas well as his father and stepmother Del and Hill Warren. This patriot \nwill be dearly missed by all.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nof SSG Kyle Warren.\n\n\n                    Sergeant Marvin Ray Calhoun, Jr.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SGT Marvin \nRay Calhoun, Jr. of the U.S. Army and Elkhart, IN.\n  Sergeant Calhoun was assigned to the Army's Bravo Company, 5th \nBattalion, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. He \nlost his life on September 21, 2010, while serving bravely in support \nof Operation Enduring Freedom in Qalat, Afghanistan, where he was \nserving his second tour of duty. Sergeant Calhoun was 23 years old.\n  Marvin joined the Army soon after graduating from Elkhart Central \nHigh School in 2006. He played on his high school football team and was \ndescribed by his coach as one of the team's hardest working players.\n  Today, I join Marvin's family and friends in mourning his tragic \ndeath. He is survived by his wife Yamili Sanchez and their daughter \nYohani; his mother Shirin Reum; and his father Marvin Calhoun, Sr.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have \nconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world \nwill little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \nforget what they did here.''\n  As we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we take pride in \nthe example of this American hero. We will cherish the legacy of his \nservice and his life.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Sergeant Marvin Ray Calhoun, \nJr. in the Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.\n\n\n                   Private First Class Gebrah Noonan\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto mark the passing and honor the service of Army soldier, PFC Gebrah \nNoonan of Watertown, CT.\n  Private First Class Noonan died in Fallujah, Iraq, on September 24. \nHe was a member of the Headquarters Company of the Third Infantry \nDivision stationed out of Fort Stewart, GA. His company had deployed to \nIraq in July and Gebrah was eager for the opportunity to serve his \ncountry-something he had always wanted to do.\n  Gebrah Noonan graduated from Watertown High School in 2002, where he \nis fondly remembered by friends for having a larger than life \npersonality, a smile on his face and a joke to share. His humor and wit \nearned him the title of class clown his senior year. Gebrah loved life \nand was an avid Yankees fan, but even more so a Michael Jackson \nenthusiast. He even dressed up like Michael Jackson during School \nSpirit Days.\n  Private First Class Noonan was always outspoken about his love of \ncountry. He enlisted in the Army last October because he felt it was an \nopportunity to serve his country as well as an opportunity for self-\nimprovement. Private First Class Noonan's Army recruiter remembered him \nas a committed soldier who also brought his fun personality to \neverything he did. He truly had an infectious smile.\n  Private First Class Noonan leaves behind a family that has supported \nhim through every part of his young life. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith his parents William and Ling Noonan, as well as his brothers and \nsister. There are no words to express the debt of\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\ngratitude we owe to Gebrah and his family. PFC Gebrah Noonan's \nselflessness and sacrifice will not be forgotten by those of us who \nmourn his tragic loss.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, since last February, I have spoken at \ngreat length on what I viewed and continue to view as the key issue in \nfinancial reform that of too big to fail. As my colleagues know, I \nsponsored legislation with Senator Brown and others that would have \nplaced strict limits on the size and riskiness of megabanks, but that \ndid not pass. Instead, Congress placed its faith in regulators to set \nappropriate prudential standards for these institutions.\n  The issue of too big to fail has therefore not gone away with the \npassage of the landmark Dodd-Frank bill. It remains the most pressing \nissue for regulators and for all of us. As Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke \nstated recently in testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry \nCommission: ``If the crisis has a single lesson, it is that the too-\nbig-to-fail problem must be solved.''\n  Given that, financial regulations being developed nationally and \ninternationally will be judged by one critical standard: do they \naddress the core problem of too big to fail? This will be my last \nSenate speech on this issue, and I will be focusing on whether the \nrecent rules coming out of Basel, Switzerland and that will be \nconsidered in the upcoming G20 meeting in Seoul meet this standard.\n  The oversight body of the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision \nrecently came to agreement on a core pillar of the Basel III framework \nof bank capital and liquidity standards. The agreement comes \napproximately 2 years after the original onslaught of the financial \ncrisis and only a couple of months after the passage of a landmark \nfinancial reform bill in this Congress. This represents a rather quick \nturnaround for complex and oftentimes fractious international \nnegotiations on financial regulation.\n  The new Basel III agreement also effectively increases the amount of \ncommon equity that banks must hold as a percentage of their risk \nweighted assets from 2 percent to 7 percent. Importantly, this change \nnot only raises the international bar on the amount of capital that \nbanks hold, but also the quality of the capital that they hold that is, \nmore of their capital will need to be held in the form of common equity \nand retained earnings. In addition, this minimum risk-weighted capital \nratio would also be supplemented for the first time on an international \nlevel by a leverage limit of 3 percent, a ratio that reflects the \namount of capital that a bank holds relative to the size of its assets.\n  While I commend the committee on its efficiency and for producing a \nproposal that significantly strengthens existing international capital \nstandards, I see several problems and flaws with regard to both the \ndesign and implementation of these rules.\n  First, the standards are still too weak and will take way too long to \nbe implemented. Even with the greater focus on high-quality equity \ncapital, large U.S. bank holding companies are generally already well \nabove the Basel III standards, which they will not have to comply with \nuntil 2019. And while the introduction of a leverage ratio has been \nhailed as a major achievement, it is subject to a long test and \nimplementation period and is set at such a low level as to be mere \nwindow dressing. In fact, it would still permit financial institutions \nto leverage their balance sheets more than 33 times over their capital \nbase, which is well above the gross leverage level at Lehman before it \nwent into bankruptcy.\n  Second, given the weakness of the leverage ratio, it is even more \nincumbent on negotiators to go back to the drawing board on the flawed \nrisk-based standards of Basel II. In short, determinations on capital \nadequacy under the Basel rules will continue to be dependent on \narbitrary risk weights, the judgments of rating agencies and the banks' \nown internal models. Instead of correcting the fundamental flaws of \nBasel II, Basel III continues to walk on its Achilles heel.\n  The final financial reform bill partially addresses this problem by \nremoving all references to credit rating agency ratings in Federal \nregulations. But since the Basel regulatory capital rules depend \nheavily on credit rating agency determinations, U.S. regulators are \ncurrently struggling to find a viable alternative. This is no doubt a \ntough task given that the use of ratings is at least as pervasive in \nthe world of financial markets as it is in the world of financial \nregulations.\n  Third, the Basel Committee punts on a global liquidity standard. With \nall the focus on capital requirements, it is easy to forget that \nliquidity rules are at least as important, if not more so. After all, \nLehman Brothers was deemed adequately capitalized only days before a \nrun on the firm evaporated its liquidity. Other institutions that were \nreportedly adequately capitalized also had fatal or near-fatal \nexperiences due to liquidity runs.\n  The Basel Committee initially proposed a fairly robust liquidity \nproposal late last year. Under it, banks would be subject to a \nliquidity coverage ratio, LCR, requiring them to hold enough high grade \nliquid assets to cover potential cash needs over a 30-day period. They \nwould also be subject to a net stable funding ratio, NSFR, requiring \nthem to have sufficient sources of stable funding based upon the \noverall liquidity profile of their assets. Such a standard would help \nlimit overreliance on unstable wholesale financing sources, a cause of \nthe financial crisis that I will discuss in greater detail later in \nthis speech. Unfortunately, in the face of a vocal industry backlash, \nthe committee watered down the proposals in July and has further \nbacktracked on these standards in its most recent release. Both are \nalso subject to a long ``observation period.'' In fact, the actual \nstandards on the LCR and NSFR, which are likely to be much weaker than \nthe initial proposals, will not be introduced until 2015 and 2018, \nrespectively.\n  Instead of waiting on uncertain and delayed Basel rules, U.S. \nregulators can set their own liquidity rules and/or use new powers \ngranted by Dodd-Frank to place basic limits on the use of short-term \ndebt, including repos, by systemically significant financial \ninstitutions. In the years prior to the crisis, the repo market morphed \nfrom a means for money-center banks to use high-quality collateral like \nTreasurys to secure overnight liquidity to being a convenient way for \nbanks to finance the booming securitization machine. Unfortunately, the \nuse of repos and other forms of short-term borrowing to finance massive \ninventories of illiquid structured securities backed by dubious \ncollateral led to serious structural weaknesses at the heart of our \nfinancial system. Placing basic limits on this practice would add \ngreater stability to our financial system. Indeed, if financial \ninstitutions had to use more expensive longer term funding to finance \nrisky assets, we would likely see fewer risky and needlessly complex \nfinancial assets being created. As a recent study by the Bank of \nInternational Settlements shows, the effect of higher capital and \nliquidity requirements will likely strengthen financial stability \nwithout hindering economic growth.\n  Finally, the Basel Committee has yet to specifically address the \nproblem of too big to fail. Although the committee notes that \nsystemically significant banks should have ``loss absorbing capacity'' \nthat goes beyond these basic standards, it has yet to provide much in \nthe way of details of what this will entail. Ultimately, systemically \nimportant banks might need to hold some combination of the following: \nadditional capital; contingent capital that converts from debt to \nequity when overall capital levels drop below a minimum threshold; and \nso-called bail-in debt that would subject holders of the debt to an \nexpedited cram-down in cases where the institution was distressed. \nPresently, concepts such as contingent capital and bail-in debt, \nneither of which is a high-quality form of capital, raise more \nquestions than answers with regard to how expensive a form of capital \nthey would be and how they would work in practice. Indeed, the Basel \nCommittee itself continues to explore these issues as reflected by a \nrecent consultative document. And while the committee calls for a \n``well integrated approach'' on the supervision of systemically \nsignificant institutions, it seems more likely that the regulation of \nthese firms will differ depending on national jurisdictions.\n  Under the new financial reform law, the Federal Reserve must set \ncapital and other prudential standards that\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\nare more stringent for systemically risky institutions than they are \nfor other financial institutions. It can also set graduated capital \nrequirements that rise as banks and other financial institutions grow \nbigger and more complex. In addition, the Fed can set countercyclical \ncapital rules that require banks to build up capital buffers during a \nbubble. While the Basel agreement also calls for such countercyclical \nrules, national regulators will have great discretion on when and how \nto implement them.\n  But to truly address too big to fail, regulators will ultimately need \nto limit the size, complexity, and riskiness of megabanks. The final \nfinancial reform bill has a number of provisions that have the promise \nof doing this, if regulators avail themselves of them. For example, the \nfinal bill's inclusion of the Kanjorski provision will give regulators \nthe explicit authority to break up megabanks that pose a ``grave \nthreat'' to financial stability. In addition, the requirement that \nsystemically significant firms develop ``living wills'' allows \nregulators eventually to force an institution to shed assets if it \nfails to submit a credible resolution plan. Because resolution \nauthority does not work for global mega-banks sprawled across many \nborders, I believe it will be imperative for regulators to use these \npowers.\n  I hope we ultimately take heed of the lesson that Chairman Bernanke \nidentified. While the Basel III framework will be useful in setting \nminimum international standards, U.S. and other national regulators \nwill need to go far beyond it to address the problem of too big to \nfail. Of course, I would have preferred to have solved this problem by \ndrawing simple statutory lines, such as those put forward in the Brown-\nKaufman amendment. The Dodd-Frank bill instead takes a different tack, \nleaving critical decisions in the hands of the regulators. Its ultimate \nsuccess or failure will therefore depend on the actions and follow \nthrough of these regulators for many years to come.\n  As I have said before, Congress has an important role to play in \noverseeing the enormous regulatory process that will ensue following \nthe bill's enactment. The American people, for that matter, must stay \nfocused on these issues, if just to help ensure that Congress indeed \nwill fulfill its oversight duty and its duty to intervene if the \nregulators fail. Although I will be leaving the Senate in November, I \nwill be watching to see if the regulators have learned the lesson to \nwhich Chairman Bernanke refers and are willing to take the tough steps \nto solve the too big to fail problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7745-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7745-S7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, while a U.S. Senator I have traveled to \nthe Middle East three times, visiting Israel each time and the West \nBank twice. My travels through the region also included four visits to \nIraq, as well as visits to Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, \nand Kuwait. What I have seen in those trips gives me a certain amount \nof qualified optimism different than any I have had in my 37 years \nfollowing the Arab-Israeli peace process.\n  This morning, I shared my thoughts with the organization J Street, \nand I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Good morning. I am pleased to address you today about the \n     Middle East peace process, a topic J Street has done so much \n     on already. I often describe the Middle East as a roller \n     coaster, full of ups and downs and the occasional complete \n     loop. It might be an exciting ride, if only you had any idea \n     when it was going to end. In my experience things are most \n     dangerous in the Middle East when you are optimistic. We have \n     all learned the Middle East can break your heart.\n       Even with that in mind, after 37 years working in and \n     around Washington, I am optimistic about the prospects for a \n     Middle East peace process. I know the major obstacles to \n     peace and I will highlight two in particular that I believe \n     are most threatening, but first let me explain the reasons \n     this time feels different to me.\n       First is Iran. As one of my top priorities as a U.S. \n     Senator, I sought out updates on the Middle East from my very \n     first days in office. What I heard from senior administration \n     officials and other senators surprised me: when they traveled \n     to the region they found the Arab states--for the first time \n     in my experience--did not start with a diatribe about Israel, \n     but rather wanted to talk about Iran, and the destabilizing \n     effect an Iranian nuclear weapon would have on the whole \n     Middle East.\n       I went there myself and found it to be completely true. And \n     I think my most recent trip to Saudi Arabia provides a \n     wonderful illustration of this. In Riyadh, we spoke with \n     members of King Abdullah's consultative assembly, a group of \n     professionals appointed by the King to offer him advice. They \n     certainly wanted to talk about the peace process with us, but \n     at the same time a comment from the chair of their foreign \n     relations committee was typical. He said ``Iran wants to \n     destabilize the Gulf. We do not believe they have a peaceful \n     nuclear system, because otherwise, why would they be building \n     delivery vehicles.''\n       At higher levels in Saudi Arabia, the realization at last \n     that Iran, not Israel, is the greatest danger to stability in \n     the Middle East is even more pronounced. We met behind closed \n     doors with a member of the Saudi royal family and had a \n     lively back-and-forth about the peace process. But at the end \n     of our discussion, he turned to us and said, I paraphrase, \n     ``It's really all about Iran.''\n       It is not difficult to see why. Saudi Arabia has been the \n     unrivaled most important Muslim country in the Gulf for \n     nearly half a decade, the one that the other Muslim countries \n     look to for leadership. A nuclear Iran is a direct challenge \n     to Saudi existence in the Gulf, and the centuries of bad \n     feelings between their peoples ensure that it will not be a \n     friendly competition.\n       Saudi Arabia, as the leader of the Sunni world, sees an \n     aggressive Shia Iran as a threat to its most basic \n     principles, and fears its export of extremists around the \n     region and within its own borders. The Saudi monarchy has \n     already fought an extremist domestic insurgency in the last \n     decade, and it understands all too well the threat they pose.\n       Why does this make me optimistic for the peace process? \n     Well, for the first time a nation like Saudi Arabia has a \n     cold-hearted realpolitik motivation to support peace. The \n     looming threat of Iran has focused their mind so that they, \n     and other Arab nations, know they need to solve one security \n     issue and, in the words of a member of the Saudi consultative \n     assembly, ``take away Iran's best propaganda tool.''\n       The best evidence of this is the Gaza flotilla. In years \n     past, something like the flotilla incident would have \n     derailed the peace process down and possibly led to an \n     intifada, but this time, the direct talks started. The \n     relatively muted response to the end of the settlement \n     moratorium may very well be another example.\n       Second, I am optimistic because of the U.S. dream team \n     working to promote the peace process. President Obama is \n     unshakable in his commitment to this issue and is determined \n     to have progress. At the UN General Assembly last week, I \n     thought he laid out the stakes very well, when he said in \n     clear terms about the next year of the peace process that \n     ``this time we will not let terror, or turbulence, or \n     posturing, or petty politics stand in the way.'' If we do, he \n     said, ``when we come back here next year, we can have an \n     agreement that will lead to a new member of the United \n     Nations--an independent, sovereign state of Palestine, living \n     in peace with Israel.'' And he is right.\n       But it is not the first time he has made clear the United \n     States is done with the old games and will put all its \n     efforts into peace. It was made clear when he assembled a \n     crack team to work on this in the Middle East and in \n     Washington. The Vice President is truly an expert in the \n     region, and Israel has no better friend than him. And \n     Secretary Clinton deserves enormous credit for her work to \n     set the right tone. But I want to spend a few minutes talking \n     about the President's peace envoy himself, George Mitchell.\n       Senator Mitchell and I share something in common, we were \n     both appointed to replace our former bosses. Along with \n     Senator Kirk, we are the only three men in history to replace \n     a Senator for whom we served as chief of staff. But that is \n     not why I think he is the dream team's MVP.\n       My father was a secular Jew, and my mother was Irish \n     Catholic, so I have been deeply familiar with both conflicts \n     throughout my life. The Troubles in Northern Ireland were \n     every bit as intractable as the problems in the Middle East. \n     Just like Israel and Palestine, people said that ancient \n     grudges would ensure that there could never be a compromise \n     between a population that would only settle if Ireland was \n     all Catholic or all Protestant. But George Mitchell brokered \n     a peace, by understanding that both Catholics and Protestants \n     wanted an end to the violence so they could get on with their \n     future, and that, through perseverance, a solution could be \n     found that both thought tolerable.\n       Senator Mitchell has brought that same tireless approach to \n     the Middle East, and it has paid off with the first direct \n     talks in almost two years. At those talks, he is well-served \n     by his extensive background in the region, stretching back to \n     his time as a staffer in Washington. He is certainly no \n     neophyte to Arab-Israeli negotiations.\n       Even the history of the last two years that led to direct \n     talks is based on his experience. When he chaired a fact-\n     finding committee in 2001 to determine the best way to get \n     the peace process back on track in the middle of the \n     intifada, it produced what we call the Mitchell Report, \n     suggesting three phases of\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\n     action: the immediate end to violence, rebuilding confidence \n     in the Palestinian Authority by focusing on their ability to \n     prevent terrorism while the Israelis froze settlement \n     activity, and then the resumption of direct negotiations. It \n     took eight years to get this process moving, but look where \n     we are today.\n       Senator Mitchell has also had a long and storied career, \n     including bringing peace to Ireland. He did not take this job \n     to be one for two. You can bet that he is confident that an \n     answer is within reach, and within reach soon. He is not \n     preparing an eight-year plan.\n       My third reason for optimism is the Israeli and Palestinian \n     leadership, particularly Bibi and Abu Mazan. Much has been \n     made of Prime Minister Netanyahu's unwieldy coalition and the \n     multitude of small conservative parties which each have \n     vested interests that could sink a peace deal. But after \n     numerous meetings with him, I am convinced that he wants \n     peace.\n       I have no doubt that Bibi has wanted peace his whole life, \n     as so many do, because the security of his country and his \n     family depends on it. But, like with the Arab leaders, \n     current events have provided an added realpolitik impetus \n     right now. In my last trip, Defense Minister Ehud Barak \n     sketched out why achieving a solution based on two states, \n     living side-by-side in peace and security, is an existential \n     issue for the unique Jewish democracy that exists in Israel. \n     The alternative to lasting security through two states, he \n     said, is the complete annexation of the West Bank and Gaza. \n     The resulting state would either be non-Jewish, because of \n     the size of the Israeli Arab and Palestinian population, or \n     non-democratic, if Palestinians are disenfranchised. I \n     believe Abu Mazan also really wants peace. Like Bibi, though, \n     current conditions give him an unprecedented flexibility for \n     achieving it. The Arab states that have awoken to the danger \n     of Iran now give Abu Mazan, perhaps for the first time, a \n     true green light to come to a negotiated settlement with the \n     Israelis.\n       The Arab League in the past has acted as a break on \n     negotiations, but now its members appear more eager for a \n     conclusion to the long-running crisis. I am hopeful that when \n     they meet on October 4 to consider what to do about the end \n     of the settlement moratorium, amidst a great deal of angry \n     rhetoric will be a go-ahead for Abu Mazan to continue talks. \n     It is that important to both him and Arab leaders to achieve \n     peace, and time is of the essence.\n       So those are three good reasons for optimism, but now the \n     bad news: those that benefit from opposing peace will do \n     everything they can to try to destroy the process. We know \n     that both Hamas and Hezbollah will lose a major reason for \n     their existence, if not the only reason for their existence, \n     if peace is achieved. We should expect them to do everything \n     in their power to stoke violence and provoke a reaction they \n     can turn to their benefit.\n       After all, they do not need to defeat the peace process, \n     they only need to delay it long enough that Abu Mazan follows \n     through on his announced retirement or loses credibility, \n     leaving a leadership vacuum for Palestinians--and in all my \n     travels, briefings, meetings, and hearings not a single \n     person has been able to suggest a Palestinian leader who can \n     effectively replace him. Or they only need to delay the peace \n     process long enough that President Obama's dream team breaks \n     up. Or delay it long enough that more Arab states follow the \n     path of Syria and increasingly Lebanon and decide that the \n     benefit of kowtowing to Iran outweighs the cost of being in \n     their crosshairs.\n       As I said at the beginning, the Middle East will break your \n     heart. Whenever you are most optimistic things are most \n     dangerous. But the focus of Arab states on Iran as the true \n     threat, the United States peace process team, and the \n     leadership of Palestinians and Israelis are each new features \n     in this long story. Well aware of the pitfalls, I remain \n     optimistic. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7746-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAIWAN'S DOUBLE TEN DAY\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, on October 10, 2010, Taiwan--ROC--our good \nfriend and our partner in peace and economic development will celebrate \n``Double Ten Day,'' its national day. I call upon my colleagues in the \nU.S. Senate to stand with Taiwan and to celebrate this important \nholiday.\n  The people on Taiwan have a vibrant democracy which sustains one of \nthe region's most important and dynamic economies. Taiwan's economy has \nbecome an attractive base for international investment, and it has \nachieved economic growth of over 6 percent at a time when many world \neconomies are faltering. Taiwan's economic strength has enabled it to \nbecome a major international investor, promoting economic development \nthroughout the region. Clearly, Taiwan has much to offer on the world \nstage, and much to be proud of as they celebrate their Double Ten Day.\n  My good friend Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou deserves both \nrecognition and congratulations for his leadership in negotiating and \nsigning the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, ECFA, this summer \nwhich is helping to expand trade between Taiwan and mainland China, \nreducing regional tensions and encouraging regional prosperity\n  Taiwan has been a strong partner to the United States in our \ncollective work with the World Health Organization, WHO , and I feel \nstrongly that Taiwan should play a similarly valuable role in the work \nof global aviation safety and security initiated by International Civil \nAviation Organization, ICAO. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nurging that important international body to welcome the participation \nof Taiwan.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me today in standing to salute \nTaiwan, as a partner and friend on the world stage, on its Double Ten \nDay and to reaffirm our friendship, support, and continued progress \ntogether and for many years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7746-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO LES MEYER\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an \noutstanding education leader from my home State of Montana. Les Meyer, \nprincipal of Fairfield High School in Fairfield, MT, has been \nrecognized by the Montana Association of Secondary School Principals as \nthe Montana Principal of the Year for 2010.\n  Les has served in the Fairfield school system for over 13 years, \nbeginning as an English teacher in 1997 and since 2002 as the principal \nof Fairfield High School. Under his leadership the school has seen test \nscores and student achievement rise every year, while the dropout rate \nhas fallen to almost zero. Les has expanded professional development \nopportunities to help his teachers do an even better job of educating \nour children. He is well liked and admired by the staff and students \nalike.\n  When Les was recognized as the Montana Principal of the Year, he \nhumbly accepted the award and praised his teachers, staff, students, \nparents, and community members who have all contributed to the success \nof the young people in Fairfield schools. He noted how fortunate he is \nto be working in a community where folks take the education of their \nchildren seriously--a trait in communities across Montana both large \nand small.\n  There is nothing more important to Montanans than giving children the \nbest opportunities to succeed in life. Providing our young people with \na solid education is the best thing we can give them. The investments \nwe make in our education system today will provide our children with \nthe skills and knowledge to be successful in the 21st-century economy. \nMontana has some of the best teachers and principals in the country, \nand I look forward to working with Les and other education leaders \nacross the State to make sure that we continue to keep the promise of a \ngood education to our children.\n  Les also knows that life's lessons extend beyond the classroom. Since \n2004, in addition to being principal, Les has served as the football \ncoach for Fairfield High. Under his leadership, the team has advanced \nto four Class B State Championship games in the past 5 years. This \nseason the Eagles are off to a 4 to 0 start and are ranked No. 1 in the \nState. Les works to instill in the young men on his team the importance \nof teamwork, being role models and good citizens in the community, and \ngiving it their all both on the field and in the classroom. I wish \nCoach Meyer and the team the best of luck.\n  Les is in Washington, DC, this week along with other award winning \nprincipals from across the country who are being recognized for their \nachievements and are sharing their insights on how to make our \neducation system even better. I congratulate Les on being chosen as the \nMontana Principal of the Year, and I applaud all our teachers, \nprincipals, and school administrators across Big Sky Country and thank \nthem for their dedication to making our schools the best they can \nbe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7746-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7746-S7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                20TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOLY FAMILY HOSPITAL\n\nMr. BOND. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 20-year \nanniversary of the Holy Family Hospital in\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\nBethlehem, Palestine, which has long stood as an oasis of hope and \npeace in the Holy Land. This celebration also marks another significant \nmilestone for the Holy Family Hospital, the 50,000th baby delivered.\n  In 1990 the Order of Malta, responding to the critical need of \nmaternal care in the region, opened Holy Family Hospital. Since its \nopening, the hospital has become the premier maternity hospital and \nnewborn critical care center of the entire region which includes \nBethlehem, neighboring towns and villages, four United Nations refugee \ncamps, and Bedouin encampments in the Judean Desert.\n  The need for Holy Family Hospital has continued to grow over the \nyears, with an increase from 1,000 births annually to now over 3,000 \nand its outpatient clinics increased from 3,600 consultations a year, \nto over 22,000. The hospital built and maintains the only neonatal \nintensive care unit in the region. Thanks to their presence, the lives \nof 400 premature and low-birth-weight infants are saved every year. In \naddition, 90 midwives have been trained, which accounts for all the \nmidwives working in all of the hospitals in the entire West Bank.\n  Holy Family Hospital continues to offer the latest in medicine to the \nBethlehem area, including mammography, laparoscopic surgery, and Echo \nDoppler diagnosis not found anywhere else in the region. Additionally, \na program of continuing medical education has been instituted which has \nbrought renowned medical professionals to the hospital as visiting \nprofessors.\n  As well as providing critical health care, the hospital provides many \na livelihood. Mr. President, 150 hospital employees are provided steady \nwork and a fair wage, many of whom are the sole support of large \nextended families.\n  The top-notch care and much-needed jobs in an underserved area make \nthe hospital special, but what makes Holy Family truly shine is their \ncommitment to bringing peace to the families in the region. From \nfacilitating Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in the medical field to \ntheir care of pregnant mothers and babies regardless of race or \nreligion, Holy Family Hospital is a beacon of hope in the West Bank.\n  This 20th anniversary celebration and 50,000th baby delivered would \nnot be possible without the Holy Family staff and volunteers from \naround the world and for their dedication to the most vulnerable \nPalestinians.\n  Over the next 20 years, it is critical that the U.S. continue to \npartner with Holy Family so the hospital can carry forward their \ncritical vision for hope and peace.\n  Congratulations and thank you for not only saving the lives of \nthousands of babies, but touching the lives of countless more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7747-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO LOU RICE\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, For over 25 years, the \nEdison Welding Institute, EWI, has been a national leader in helping \nmanufacturers improve their products and productivity through advanced \nengineering. Based on the campus of the Ohio State University, EWI is a \nworld-class model of a public-private partnership that works with \nuniversities and entrepreneurs, and small businesses and large \ncorporations to strengthen Ohio's position as a national leader in \naerospace, automotive production, and emerging advanced clean energy \nmanufacturing.\n  Among its team of cutting-edge scientists and technicians, industry \nexperts and project managers is an employee whose voice and face has \nmade EWI among the most important assets of the great State of Ohio.\n  For the last 21 years, senior receptionist Willie Lou Rice has \nwelcomed more than 1.5 million visitors by phone and in person at EWI. \nNo one can walk through EWI without first being greeted by Lou not even \nVice President Al Gore or U.S. and State Senators or Members of \nCongress representing districts from across the Nation. She has greeted \nhigh-ranking officials from the U.S. Departments of Energy, Commerce, \nDefense, and Transportation who visit EWI to learn about its latest \nwork. Military personnel, corporate executives, university presidents, \nand dignitaries from all over the world have received Lou's greeting \nbefore meeting with EWI staff.\n  Her commitment to the mission of EWI also extends to the community. \nEach year Lou has welcomed 3rd graders from Columbus School For Girls \nand helps introduce them to the opportunities for women in welding \ntechnology. She regularly welcomes vocational school students and local \nscience teachers to inspire them about engineering and to show them \nthat Ohio has long been home to inventors and innovators behind the \nmask and torch, and the workers in a factory.\n  Lou has merged her role as frontline public relations ambassador for \nEWI with her love for her family, friends, and church. Willie Lou Rice \nwill retire from EWI on October 31, 2010, having served her State with \ndistinction and honored her community with a commitment to all. On \nbehalf of a grateful State, I congratulate her for all that she has \naccomplished and wish her well in her retirement. Her legacy is clearly \none of strength, loyalty, and integrity.

This recognition of high accomplishment was bestowed by \nU.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.\n  The Blue Ribbon Schools award, created in 1982, is considered the \nhighest honor an American school can obtain. Schools singled out for \nthis national honor reflect the goals of our Nation's education reforms \nfor high standards and accountability. Specifically, the Blue Ribbon \nSchools Program is designed to honor public and private schools that \nare either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate \ndramatic gains in student achievement.

GARVIN\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Lucy S. Garvin on the occasion of her retirement as \nchairman of the board and president of the United States Tennis \nAssociation, USTA.\n  Lucy's truly outstanding career in the world of tennis directly \nreflects her over 30-year commitment to advancing and improving the \ngame. She has impacted tennis as a competitor, instructor, referee, \nindustry representative, and an avid volunteer. As a recreational \nplayer, she won titles at all levels between 1976 and 1990, and in 33 \nyears as a certified referee, she has officiated at countless \ntournaments.\n  Leading with charm, determination, and humility, Lucy has worked to \nexpand the sport of tennis at every level around the country. On a \nlocal level, she has been a tireless advocate of tennis in South \nCarolina and in the Southern Region. A former president of the\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\nUSTA Southern Section and USTA South Carolina, she was inducted into \nthe USTA Southern Tennis Hall for Fame in 2005. Lucy has also been \nrecognized with the USTA Southern Section's Jacobs Bowl Award in 1999 \nand the South Carolina President's Award in 1998. The South Carolina \nTennis Association established the Lucy Garvin Volunteer of the Year \nAward in her honor, and she was inducted into the South Carolina Tennis \nHall of Fame in 1998.\n  Lucy was elected chairman of the board and president of the 730,000 \nmember USTA in January 2009. In doing so she became the first South \nCarolinian and only the third woman to hold the position in the \norganization's 129-year history. Prior to her appointment as esident, \nshe served one term as first vice president, two consecutive terms as \nvice president, and one term as a director at large. In addition to her \nresponsibilities as USTA chairman and president, Lucy is also the \nchairman of the U.S. Open, and represents the USTA on the Grand Slam \nCommittee. During her tenure as USTA president, tennis has grown to \nover 30 million recreational players.\n  On an international level, Lucy was elected to the board of directors \nof the International Tennis Federation, ITF, in 2009, serving as a vice \npresident. She currently serves as chair of the ITF Junior Competitions \nCommittee and a member of the ITF Development Committee. Because of her \ncareer of dedicated leadership and commitment to tennis, Lucy was \nelected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame Board of Directors in \n2008.\n  Beyond being respected for her numerous leadership positions, Lucy is \nequally admired for being a devoted volunteer. She has tirelessly \nadvocated for growing the game of tennis both by focusing on younger \nplayers and through outreach to traditionally underserved groups. As a \nresult of her commitment and volunteerism with the QuickStart program, \nwhich focuses on bringing children to the game of tennis, four recently \nconstructed QuickStart tennis courts were dedicated in Lucy's name.\n  Lucy's well deserved acknowledgments and recognitions highlight the \nimpact she has had on both the game of tennis and its worldwide \ncommunity. She is an invaluable asset to the tennis community, and as a \nleader has set an example for future USTA presidents to follow. She \ncontinues to live by her personal motto, ``Teamwork: One Team, One \nGoal: To Promote and Develop the Growth of Tennis.'' I am confident \nLucy will continue this mission.\n  I ask that the U.S. Senate join me in celebrating Lucy Garvin's \nlifelong dedication to both the game of tennis and to the State of \nSouth Carolina, and I wish Lucy the very best in her future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7748-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SHERYL MILLER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a public \nservant from my home State of South Dakota. Sheryl Miller is retiring \nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, after 33 \nyears of Federal service, including 32 with HUD and the last dozen \nyears as the field director of the South Dakota HUD office.\n  During her years at HUD, she has always displayed a steadfast \nawareness of the housing needs of South Dakotans and a commitment to \nshare and convey agency policies and information. When confronted with \ncongressional and public inquiries, she always handled issues in a \ntimely manner and networked well within the agency to provide complete \nand concise answers to questions. By all accounts, Sheryl always \ndisplayed a pleasant demeanor and was a true professional in her work \nethic and dedication to public service.\n  Sheryl has an extensive background working with HUD programs in \nsingle and multi-family housing, public housing and community planning \nand development. She has served in HUD positions in the Denver and San \nFrancisco regional offices. She has definitely satisfied the \ncredentials earned with her master degree in public administration from \nDrake University.\n  During her years of service, Sheryl has witnessed many changes in \npublic housing policies and priorities. Because of her dedicated work, \ncountless families in South Dakota have been helped immensely in \nobtaining or maintaining public housing. This has a dramatic impact on \nthe livelihood of the individual family, but also has a dramatic \npositive impact on the community and State. It is my hope that Sheryl \nleaves her HUD post knowing that she greatly impacted the lives of many \npeople and there can be fewer greater rewards in a public service \ncareer.\n  I wish Sheryl all the best in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7748-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE LOWELL\n\n Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of \nbaseball's great athletes. At the end of this baseball season, \nFloridian Mike Lowell will hang up his glove and bat and retire. From \nhitting a single his first time up at bat in the Major Leagues to being \nnamed Most Valuable Player of the 2007 World Series, Lowell has proven \nhis excellence and consistency on the field throughout his career.\n  Mike Lowell began his 13-year professional career with the New York \nYankees but soon returned to his home State to play for the Florida \nMarlins where he was an integral part of the 2003 Championship team. \nHaving grown up in Miami, he had the opportunity to play in front of \nfamily and friends. Later, he joined the Boston Red Sox, where he spent \nthe rest of his career.\n  His time as a baseball player did not transpire without obstacles. \nMonths into his first season with the Marlins, Lowell was diagnosed \nwith testicular cancer. He missed 2 months of the 1999 season while he \nunderwent treatment. But he survived and went on to have a tremendously \nsuccessful career.\n  Both on and off the field Mike Lowell has gained the respect of his \nfellow players. With his two World Series rings, four-time All-Star \nparticipation, Gold Glove, more than 220 home runs and nearly 1,000 \nRBIs, he is a player to be admired. He has also proven his leadership \nin the clubhouse by utilizing his bilingual background to bridge the \ngap between English-speaking and Spanish-speaking players.\n  Many young boys dream of growing up to play baseball in the Major \nLeagues. Mike Lowell achieved that dream and is an inspiration for \ntoday's youth to continue to reach for their goals. While his career as \na professional ballplayer will soon come to a close, Mike Lowell will \nalways be remembered as one of baseball's greatest. I wish him many \nyears of happiness with his wife Bertha and his two children, Alexis \nand Anthony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7748-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7748-S7749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF M.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nextraordinary life and service of Joseph Shawinsky, a teacher, a leader \nin our community, and personal hero of mine. Mr. Shawinsky was a true \nAmerican patriot, a valued leader and teacher in the Stamford community \nwho touched the lives of hundreds of students. Beloved for his \nenthusiasm and wit, his brilliant mind and big heart, Joseph Shawinsky \nwill be missed deeply.\n  I knew Joseph Shawinsky for many years and have long treasured the \nexample he set in his career of devoted service. As his student at \nBurdick Junior High School, Mr. Shawinsky made history come alive for \nme and my classmates and instilled in me a deep love of our country's \nstory. He also taught me about the importance of leadership, how much \ngood leaders could influence human history for the better. Mr. \nShawinsky was himself a touchstone of the greatest generation and his \nown great story will inspire me and others around the country for years \nto come.\n  During the Second World War, Joe. Shawinsky served our country with \ncourage and distinction as a Seabee in the 133rd Naval Construction \nBattalion. He was one of the first fighting Americans to go ashore \nduring the 1945 assault on Iwo Jima, a battle in which some of the \nfiercest fighting in the Second World War took place a battle that \nrevealed the uncommon courage of Joe Shawinsky and the Americans who \nserved alongside him.\n  For decades, Joseph Shawinsky illuminated the hearts and minds of his \nstudents, his colleagues, and everyone who knew him. We, his students, \nwere blessed with the opportunity to have learned from Joseph \nShawinsky, and I believe more broadly that our State and this nation \nare blessed to have people like him who truly enrich our schools, our \nchildren, and our future.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the entire Shawinsky family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7749-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL W. SHERMAN\n\nMr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to commend and \ncongratulate Michael W. Sherman upon his retirement as executive \ndirector of YMCA Camp Woodstock, located in Woodstock Valley, CT. Mike \nhas been humbly shaping the lives of countless children and young \nadults in Connecticut's ``Quiet Corner'' since 1987, and he will leave \nhis position after 24 years of service. He has dedicated his life to \nmaking Camp Woodstock a safe and fun place for our kids to learn how to \nrespect one another's differences, become leaders in their communities, \nand be good stewards of our environment.\n  A gifted storyteller, Mike is known for his boundless creativity and \nenthusiasm. As his friends will tell you, when Mike speaks, people \nlisten; and he has masterfully used this talent to inspire a very \nspecial culture at Camp Woodstock, embodied in its ``CHoRR'' values of \nCaring, Honesty, Respect, and Responsibility. A truly remarkable man, \nMike Sherman's contributions to the growth and success of Camp \nWoodstock, along with his unwavering commitment to helping young \npeople, are his enduring legacy.\n  During his tenure, Mike has helped transition Camp Woodstock to year-\nround programming, reaching out to community leaders throughout the \nState and deepening ties to the YMCA of Greater Hartford. Camp \nWoodstock now proudly hosts the Discovery Center, which brings together \nchildren from urban and suburban schools to learn tolerance and \ncelebrate diversity, and Moderate Voices for Progress, which teaches \nconflict resolution skills to young Israeli and Palestinian adults. \nMike has also taken a special interest in helping disadvantaged youth \nin Hartford, championing special youth outreach and conflict resolution \nretreats throughout the year. Over the years, he has led volunteers in \nraising nearly $1 million in financial aid so that less fortunate \nchildren throughout the State could experience the ``Woodstock \nspirit.''\n  Mike's most important contribution to Camp Woodstock has been his \nkeen ability to recognize and nurture the human capital that makes Camp \nWoodstock so unique. Mike embraced a long tradition of campers growing \nup to become counselors and expanded on that concept by developing the \nleader-in-training and counselor-in-training programs for young adults. \nAlso, under Mike's skillful leadership, Camp Woodstock has boosted its \nrecruitment of international staff and has forged special relationships \nwith YMCAs in Russia and the Dominican Republic.\n  Amid the tranquil pines of Woodstock and the calm shores of Black \nPond, that have remained unchanged for generations, Mike has overseen \nthe renovation and restoration of Camp Woodstock's facilities, \nincluding nearly all of the cabins, bathhouses, the Program Lodge, and \nthe transformation of a beloved old barn into a program space \ncontaining an arts and crafts center, theater, and state-of-the-art \nindoor climbing wall. Mike's leadership has enabled Camp Woodstock to \nexpand, as well, with the construction of a new climbing tower, the \nRoskin Lodge, for youth leadership training, the Lakeside Dining Hall, \nand, most recently, New Yurt City, a special living area for older \ncampers.\n  I am honored today to pay tribute to Mike Sherman and wish him and \nhis loving wife Susan all the best in their well-earned retirement. \nMike has made Camp Woodstock a far better place; and, although he may \nbe leaving as executive director, his lessons, like his stories, will \nlive on for years to come. It is with great pride that I recognize such \na distinguished leader, educator, and outstanding citizen for his \nservice to Connecticut and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7749-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TIMBERFEST 2010\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Lumberjacks from across the country travel to Sheridan \nto compete in the championship, where competitors battle it out with ax \nand chainsaw to see who is fastest at cutting wood.\n  I salute the entire community of Sheridan and Grant County as they \ncelebrate Timberfest 2010. I commend them for keeping the history and \nheritage of their community alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7749-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7749-S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ARKANSAS'S BUSINESS LEADERS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

The Arkansas \nBusiness Hall of Fame is designed to honor, preserve and perpetuate the \nnames and outstanding accomplishments of business leaders who have \nbrought lasting fame to Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\n  This year's Hall of Fame class represents the best of our State, and \nI am proud to see them receive this significant achievement.

Mr. President, today I honor Billy and Diann \nSimmons from my home State of Arkansas for their exemplary efforts to \nsupport foster children in our State. I am proud to recognize them as \nmy choice for this year's ``Angel in Adoption'' for Arkansas. They join \nadoption advocates from across the Nation who have received this \nprestigious recognition.\n  The Angels in Adoption program, sponsored by the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption Institute, provides Members of Congress the \nopportunity to honor those who have made an extraordinary contribution \non behalf of children in need of homes.\n  The Simmons are certainly worthy of this recognition. Diann Simmons \nbecame a therapeutic foster parent in 1997 and persuaded her soon-to-be \nspouse to join her in this noble endeavor prior to their marriage in \n1998. The Simmons' have now been therapeutic foster parents for 13 \nyears and have significant experience fostering children with difficult \nbehaviors.\n  Despite their experiences with children with challenging emotional \nand behavioral difficulties, they love children and maintain a sense of \nstrong family values. These values have resulted in the adoption of \nseven children, including two sibling groups of two. Their most recent \nadoption was finalized this year.\n  Because of their experience, flexibility, strong family values and \ntheir belief in the potential for every child, they have been \nsuccessful in changing the lives of numerous children. According to \nthose who know them best, the Simmons have developed a strong bond with \nevery child placed in their home. In fact, four of their adopted \nchildren were in their home as foster children prior to adoption.\n  Affectionately called ``Mama Diann'' and ``Daddy Billy,'' the \nSimmons' commitment, genuine concern and caring for their foster \nchildren has endeared them to many of these children's birth families, \nincluding families of their own adopted children.\n  I commend both Diann and Billy for their dedication and perseverance \nhelping children in need. They represent the best of Arkansas, and I \ncommend them for their work on behalf of Arkansas's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7750-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PHIL E. MATTHEWS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize Phil E. \nMatthews for his dedicated years of service at the Arkansas Hospital \nAssociation. His efforts on behalf of our State's hospitals are to be \ncommended, and I thank him for his efforts to maintain high-quality \nhospital care for the citizens of Arkansas.\n  Phil has been a part of the Arkansas Hospital Association, known as \nAHA, since 1969 and was named president in 2005. During his tenure, he \nhas worked hard to cultivate constructive relationships with State and \nFederal legislators in order to achieve great results for Arkansas. He \nhas reinforced the AHA as a trusted partner for Arkansas hospitals and \nother health care providers and entities from all across the State.\n  In recent years, the AHA has helped to pass laws on the State level \nthat will enhance the health of and health care services for Arkansans, \nincluding for the development of a statewide trauma care system, \nexpansion of health insurance coverage for more than 6,000 additional \nchildren through ARKids, and public health initiatives that will \nincrease seatbelt usage and decrease tobacco use in the State.\n  On the Federal level, it has been my pleasure to work closely with \nPhil and the AHA to develop and pass policies to expand health \ninsurance coverage to more than 400,000 Arkansans, grow the health care \nworkforce in Arkansas, modernize health care delivery and the use of \nhealth information technologies, and preserve the viability and \nvaluable role of Arkansas's community hospitals. Together, we have \nfought back on policies that might have had a negative impact or \nunintended consequence for Arkansas hospitals, providers, and patients, \nand we have worked to advance policies that are best for our great \nState.\n  I am extremely proud of Phil's and the AHA's efforts to help Arkansas \nhospitals provide quality care to their patients, provide charity care \nfor those in need, serve refugees of gulf coast hurricanes and other \nnatural disasters, and play an active role in improving health care \ncoverage and quality in Arkansas. I wish Phil all the very best in his \nretirement, and to Bo Ryall, who will serve as his successor as \npresident of the AHA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7750-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ARKANSAS'S TRAUMA CENTERS\n\n   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize Arkansas's \nnewly established trauma system, and I commend three facilities in the \nState for garnering the highest designations of trauma care.\n  The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock and \nthe Regional Medical Center in Memphis were selected to provide the \nhighest level of trauma care under the system, which is aimed at \ngetting patients specialized care in emergency situations. Jefferson \nRegional Medical Center in Pine Bluff was designated a Level 2 center, \nwhich can provide comprehensive clinical care.\n  The new system will connect hospitals, ambulance services and other \nemergency responders to act as a statewide triage, transporting trauma \npatients as quickly as possible to the facility best able to treat \ntheir specific injuries. Furthermore, it will help elevate Arkansas's \nstatus nationwide in terms of large-scale emergency management and \ndisaster preparedness capabilities.\n  Eighty-six hospitals in Arkansas could eventually become a part of \nthe new trauma system. Of those, 73 have already begun the process by \nfiling letters of intent to request designation as one of the four \nlevels of centers.\n  I commend all of Arkansas's health care providers for their dedicated \nefforts to save lives and keep Arkansans safe, healthy and strong. With \nthis new trauma system, Arkansas has achieved a new level of high \nquality care, and I am pleased to see our State attain this significant \ndesignation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7750-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRON COUNTY COURTHOUSE\n\n Mrs. McCaskill. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \nhonoring the 150th anniversary of the completion and opening of the \nIron County Courthouse in Ironton, MO.\n  Chosen as the county seat in 1857, Ironton is home to the only \ncourthouse in Iron County. Ironton businessmen David Carson and Hiram \nTong donated town lots to the county, which covered more than $10,000 \nof the $14,000 cost of the courthouse.\n  Architect Henry H. Wright received $25 for his proposed design of the \nbuilding. George S. Evans and William F. Mitchell earned the building \ncontract and used locally made red brick and white limestone from a \nnearby quarry. The original building measured 50 by 65 feet, with 6 \nrooms on the first floor and the courtroom on the second floor. The \ncommunity laid the cornerstone on July 4, 1858, and officially opened \nthe courthouse in October 1860.\n  The courthouse today serves as the home of several county offices and \nis a national registered historic site that still bears damage from the \nCivil War and the Battle of Pilot Knob in September 1864.\n  As the birthplace of Missouri's 4-H Program and a symbol of the \ncommitment of the residents of Iron County to justice and service to \nthe community, the Iron County Courthouse deserves commemoration on \nthis important day in its history.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in recognizing the 150th anniversary of \nthe Iron County Courthouse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7750-5", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7750-S7751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SHANNON MCDANIEL\n\n Mrs. MURRAY.

Through his leadership and extensive knowledge of irrigated \nagriculture, Mr. McDaniel has brought certainty to many farmers in the \nSouth Columbia Basin Irrigation District by closely and responsibly \nmanaging important water delivery infrastructure.\n  Mr. McDaniel has assisted me and my colleagues in Congress with the \ndrafting and passage of legislation important to Washington State \nfarmers.

Mr. President, our Nation's 27.5 million small \nbusinesses all have their own unique characteristics and touching \nstories. Today, I rise to recognize the contributions of one of those \nsmall businesses from my home State of Maine--Darling's Auto that not \nonly has provided exceptional service to greater Bangor but has also \ninvested its time and heart into the community itself.\n  Darling's Auto has been ingrained in Bangor since 1903, when it first \nbegan selling cars, trucks, and bicycles. Over a century later, through \nhard work and care for the customer, Darling's Auto has become one of \nMaine's largest auto dealership groups, with additional locations in \nBrewer, Ellsworth, and Augusta. For over 100 years, Darling's Auto has \nprovided Mainers with the vehicles they use every day to go to work, \nvisit their loved ones, and embark on new journeys. Over the years, \nDarling's has employed hundreds of Mainers and has earned a reputation \nof excellence and integrity throughout eastern and central Maine.\n  Darling's Auto's rich history of perseverance and innovation alone \nwould merit distinction. Yet, today, I honor Darling's Auto for an \nexemplary and magnanimous gesture that is truly inspirational. Maine is \namong the States with the highest percentage of military servicemembers \nper capita. When our servicemembers are deployed, the effects \nreverberate throughout families, businesses, and communities. \nFortunately, Mainers have a reputation for taking care of one another \nin difficult times, and Darling's Auto certainly has fit that mold.\n  One of Darling's Auto's valued employees, Susan Maiden, is the mother \nof PFC Andrew ``Andy'' Chic. Susan typifies Maine's famed work ethic \nand independent spirit, values which she instilled in her son. Andy \nvolunteered to join the National Guard and most recently was deployed \nto Afghanistan with Bravo Company, Third Battalion of the 172nd \nInfantry Division with the Maine National Guard. During his heroic \nservice in Afghanistan, Andy's company was ambushed by insurgents.\n  On May 22, 2010, Bravo Company was conducting convoy operations with \nPrivate First Class Chic in the ``gunner'' position in the lead vehicle \nof a convoy--a Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected--MRAP--vehicle. Private \nFirst Class Chic's MRAP sustained two direct hits from rocket-propelled \ngrenades, or RPGs, and other small arms weapons. While he was knocked \ndown when the first RPG hit, he resumed his gunner position and \nreturned fire against insurgents despite continuing RPG and small arms \nfire against his MRAP and the convoy. The vehicle was also carrying \nsatchels of mail and care packages from family members in Maine, which \nabsorbed some of the shrapnel and mitigated the injuries to Private \nFirst Class Chic and his fellow soldiers.\n  Following the barbaric attack, Andy was taken to Walter Reed Medical \nCenter to address his wounds and for rehabilitation. Knowing the \nconcern and anxiousness any mother would have in Susan's situation, \nDarling's Auto stood up and gave assistance to Susan. The company has \nprovided tremendous support to Susan during her time of need by giving \nher extra time off to see Andy and even purchasing an EZ Pass to help \nwith Susan's expenses when she would drive all the way to Washington, \nDC, to visit her son. In light of Darling's Auto's understanding and \nassistance, the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve will soon be \npresenting Darling's Auto with its ``Above and Beyond Award,'' honoring \nthose who help Guard members and Reservists, and their families, in \ntimes of need. Given the tremendous care and compassion extended for \nSusan and Andy's well-being, I can think of no business more deserving \nof this tremendous recognition than Darling's.\n  Darling's Auto has been a consistent presence in the Bangor community \nfor over a century, and the company has thrived over that time because \nit operates in a manner consistent with Maine values. Darling's has \ntreated its customers and employees with honesty, respect, and \ncompassion, building a legacy of trust. I am so often reminded of the \nempathy that Mainers demonstrate, and it always reaffirms my belief in \nthe exceptional nature of our State and our Nation. I am proud of the \nincredible example that Darling's Auto has set by its notable acts of \nkindness, and I wish the company another 100 years of success in all of \nits endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7751-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7751-S7752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING 3RD RECON ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. THUNE.

The award is named for a former chief of the National Guard \nBureau credited with ensuring readiness of Guard units to join regular \nforces on overseas missions.\n  The squadron was formed in 1946, when Joseph J. ``Joe'' Foss, a Medal \nof Honor winner and Marine Ace, was appointed to form a South Dakota \nAir National Guard squadron to help recruit and train flight crews. \nSince then, the unit has served as part of the Air Expeditionary Force, \nand actively supported Operation Noble Eagle, Operations Enduring \nFreedom, Iraqi Freedom, and the global war on terrorism.\n  In times of local crisis, the squadron has lent its men and women to \nrespond to blizzards, floods, fires, and tornados, remaining ``Proud, \nPrepared, and Professional'' in its committed service to state and \ncountry.\n  Today I give great thanks to the men and women of the 114th \n``Fightin' Lobos'' for being named the top fighter unit in the nation \nand for their outstanding service to the great State of South Dakota \nand the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7752-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNIVERSITY CORPORATION FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH\n\nMr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I congratulate the \nUniversity Corporation for Atmospheric Research--UCAR--on the 50th \nanniversary of its founding in Boulder, CO. As the world's premier \natmospheric science hub, UCAR has been on the cutting edge of research \nand innovation for half a century. They have made invaluable \ncontributions to our knowledge and understanding of the world's \natmosphere and weather and climate systems.\n  At its inception, UCAR was a consortium of 14 universities dedicated \nto the simple hypothesis that university atmospheric science could be \nmore effective through collaborative efforts. UCAR set about improving \nnational coordination, funding, and basic support for the then \nburgeoning field of atmospheric research.\n  Since then, with invaluable Federal support from the National Science \nFoundation, UCAR has grown to a consortium of 75 universities, \nincluding the University of Colorado, Colorado State University, and \nthe University of Denver. Similarly, the National Center for \nAtmospheric Research, NCAR, which is the research institute operated by \nUCAR, has grown from five full-time scientists to 220 Ph.D. researchers \ntoday.\n  UCAR established three main goals for itself in order to understand \nthe behavior of the atmosphere and related physical, biological and \nsocial systems. These goals remain at the heart of their efforts today.\n  First, NCAR was to be an intellectual center cultivating world-class \nbasic science in-house and through cooperative work with scientists \nfrom other institutions in the United States, Canada, and abroad.\n  Second, UCAR was to become a planning center where the world's \nleading atmospheric science experts could gather to discuss and \ndetermine the most promising strategies for understanding the major \nproblems of atmospheric science.\n  Lastly, UCAR would provide and operate the research facilities needed \nfor atmospheric science when those facilities were too large, \nexpensive, or complicated for a single university or research \ninstitution to manage by itself.\n  By meeting these goals every day, UCAR has made itself an undeniable \nglobal leader in climate science.\n  As you drive west on U.S. Highway 36 near Louisville, CO, you start \nto climb Davidson Mesa. Just as you crest the mesa, you come upon an \nextraordinary scene: the foothills of the Rocky Mountains stretched out \non the horizon before you with the city of Boulder below. Off to your \nleft, perched on a hilltop beneath the majestic Flatirons, is UCAR's \nMesa lab, housed in a pink sandstone, I.M. Pei-designed building. This \nsight never ceases to impress. That you are looking at the world's \nleading atmospheric research center is even more astounding.\n  I am proud to represent a State with such a talented and dedicated \norganization. They have helped make Colorado a leader in science and \ntechnology. They have been instrumental in educating the public on the \nscience of climate change and informing our response to it. And they \nare helping create and inspire the next generations of scientists and \nengineers to tackle the unanswered questions of their time.\n  Again, I offer my sincere congratulations to UCAR and look forward to \nthe next 50 years of discovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7752-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7752-S7753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4673.

Section 6 would authorize the Coast Guard to extend for one year certain expiring marine licenses, certificates of registry, and merchant mariner\n  documents. The authority to provide such extensions would apply through December 11, 2011. Because the extensions would delay the collection of fees\n  charged for renewal of such documents, enacting this provision could reduce offsetting receipts (an offset against direct spending) over the next year\n  or two. Some of those receipts may be spent without further appropriation, however, to cover collection expenses. CBO estimates that the net effect on\n  direct spending from enacting this provision would be less than $500,000 in each of fiscal years 2011 and 2012.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. Presdient, today the Senate will pass sensible \nlegislation with practical benefits for U.S. military veterans. The \nbill I have offered will add military veterans to the list of groups \neligible to receive excess property donations from the Federal \nGovernment. This bill is a bipartisan effort to recognize the \nsacrifices that members of our Armed Forces make every day for our \ncountry, and I am proud to be its author. While it is only a small \ntoken of appreciation, this legislation gives back to veterans groups \nby allowing them access to a large inventory of goods from which they \ncould not otherwise benefit. I appreciate the Senate acting swiftly to \nconsider this bill.\n  The FOR VETS Act enables military veterans to receive surplus goods \ndonations through the Federal Government's property distribution \nprogram. The types of goods donated through this program include \ncomputers, trucks, snowmobiles, home appliances and electronics. These \nitems will be of valuable use to our military veterans, and I am \npleased to sponsor legislation that gives them the right to claim \nuseful goods through this program. The FOR VETS Act is legislation for \nand about American veterans.\n  The Administrator of General Services oversees this ongoing property \nliquidation and distribution program, which currently donates property \nto medical institutions, providers of assistance to the homeless, \nuniversities, and child care facilities, among others. Given the \nsurplus of available goods, military veterans' groups are simply being \nadded into this pool of recipients for property that might otherwise go \nunused.\n  I thank the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee \nranking member, Senator Collins, for working with me on this bill. This \nwas a bipartisan effort, as legislation to support our veterans should \nalways be, and I look forward to its prompt consideration by the House, \nand to the President signing it into law.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 573\n\n       Whereas Somalia has been without a functioning central \n     government since 1991, resulting in lawlessness and an \n     increasingly desperate humanitarian situation;\n       Whereas, despite the return of the internationally \n     recognized Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to Mogadishu \n     and ongoing diplomatic efforts through the Djibouti Peace \n     Process, supported by the United Nations, there has been \n     little improvement in the governance or stability of southern \n     and central Somalia, and armed opposition groups continue to \n     exploit this situation;\n       Whereas the traditional mediation role played by Somali \n     elders has been eroded as the dynamics of conflict and the \n     proliferation of weapons make it difficult to influence \n     warring parties;\n       Whereas, since 2007, armed violence has resulted in the \n     deaths of at least 21,000 people in Somalia and the \n     displacement of nearly 2,000,000 people, including over \n     500,000 refugees in Kenya, Yemen, Ethiopia, Eritrea, \n     Djibouti, Tanzania, and Uganda;\n       Whereas the United Nations estimates that 3,200,000 people, \n     or 43 percent of the population of Somalia, are in need of \n     humanitarian assistance and livelihood support to survive;\n       Whereas the United Nations reports that almost 1,000,000 \n     displaced Somalis in need of aid cannot be reached by United \n     Nations refugee and food agencies because of growing \n     insecurity and the threat of kidnappings to staff;\n       Whereas local humanitarian organizations are trying to meet \n     the needs of the Somali people by restoring basic social \n     services in urban and rural communities, which places them on \n     the front lines of the conflict and make them vulnerable \n     targets for killings, kidnappings, or being accused of \n     working for foreign governments;\n       Whereas al Shabaab, which has been designated as a foreign \n     terrorist organization by the Department of State, and other \n     armed groups continue to wage war against the Transitional \n     Federal Government in Mogadishu and one another to gain \n     control over territory in Somalia;\n\n[[Page S7771]]\n\n       Whereas al Shabaab has claimed responsibility for many \n     bombings--including suicide attacks--in Mogadishu, as well as \n     in central and northern Somalia, typically targeting \n     officials of the Government of Somalia and perceived allies \n     of the TFG;\n       Whereas, according to Human Rights Watch, al Shabaab is \n     subjecting inhabitants of areas under its control in southern \n     Somalia to executions, cruel punishments, including \n     amputations and floggings, and repressive social control;\n       Whereas the human rights situation in Somalia has \n     dramatically worsened over the past several years with \n     increased numbers of killings, torture, kidnappings, and \n     rape;\n       Whereas the 2009 Department of State Country Terrorism \n     Report notes that ``Somalia's fragile transitional Federal \n     government, protracted state of violent instability, its \n     long, unguarded coastline, porous borders, and proximity to \n     the Arabian Peninsula, made the country an attractive \n     location for international terrorists seeking a transit or \n     launching point for operations in Somalia or elsewhere'';\n       Whereas the situation in southern and central Somalia, \n     particularly the activity of al Shabaab, poses direct threats \n     to the stability of Puntland and Somaliland regions, as well \n     as the stability of neighboring states and the wider region;\n       Whereas al Shabaab leaders have stated their intent to \n     provide recruits and support for al Qaeda in the Arabian \n     Peninsula in Yemen;\n       Whereas the Government of Eritrea has provided military and \n     financial support for armed opposition groups, including al \n     Shebaab, in part as a proxy front in its continuing tensions \n     with Ethiopia;\n       Whereas, according to the most recent report by the United \n     Nations Somalia Monitoring Group, arms, ammunitions, and \n     military or dual-use equipment continue to enter Somalia at a \n     fairly steady rate, in violation of the general and complete \n     arms embargo imposed in 1992;\n       Whereas, in July 2009, the Department of State confirmed \n     that, in addition to other support for the TFG, it had \n     provided cash to purchase weapons and ammunitions for the \n     TFG's efforts ``to repel the onslaught of extremist forces \n     which are intent on destroying the Djibouti peace process'';\n       Whereas, according to most recent report by the United \n     Nations Somalia Monitoring Group, ``[d]espite infusions of \n     foreign training and assistance, government security forces \n     remain ineffective, disorganized and corrupt -- a composite \n     of independent militias loyal to senior government officials \n     and military officers who profit from the business of war and \n     resist their integration under a single command'';\n       Whereas, on April 13, 2010, President Barack Obama issued \n     an executive order to sanction or freeze the assets of \n     militants who threaten, both directly and indirectly, the \n     stability of Somalia, as well as individuals involved in \n     piracy off Somalia's coast;\n       Whereas, in March 2009, at a hearing of the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Government Affairs of the Senate, \n     Andrew Liepman, Deputy Director of Intelligence at the \n     National Counterterrorism Center, noted that ``[s]ince 2006, \n     a number of U.S. citizens [have] traveled to Somalia, \n     possibly to train in extremist training camps'';\n       Whereas, in September 2009, at a hearing of the Committee \n     on Homeland Security and Government Affairs of the Senate, \n     the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Michael \n     Leiter testified that ``the potential for al-Qaeda operatives \n     in Somalia to commission Americans to return to the United \n     States and launch attacks against the Homeland remains of \n     significant concern'';\n       Whereas al Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the \n     bombings in Kampala, Uganda on July 11, 2010, which killed 76 \n     people, including one American, and wounded scores of other \n     people; and\n       Whereas the extraordinary and ongoing crisis in Somalia has \n     enormous humanitarian consequences and direct national \n     security implications for the United States and our allies in \n     the region: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the urgency of addressing the threats to \n     United States national security in Somalia and the conditions \n     that foster those threats;\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to stand with all the people \n     of Somalia who aspire to a future free of terrorism and \n     violence through advancing political reconciliation and \n     building legitimate and inclusive governance institutions;\n       (3) recognizes the difficult, but very important, work \n     being done by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) \n     to help secure parts of Mogadishu, and reaffirms its support \n     for the mission;\n       (4) calls on the Transitional Federal Government in \n     Somalia--\n       (A) to cease immediately any use of child soldiers;\n       (B) to ensure better accountability and transparency for \n     all received security assistance;\n       (C) to renew its commitment to political reconciliation; \n     and\n       (D) to take necessary steps toward becoming a more \n     legitimate and inclusive government in the eyes of the people \n     of Somalia;\n       (5) calls on all actors and governments in the region, \n     particularly the Government of Eritrea, to play a productive \n     role in helping to bring about peace and stability to \n     Somalia, including ceasing to provide any financial or \n     material support to al Shabaab and other armed opposition \n     groups in Somalia;\n       (6) welcomes efforts by the President to bring greater \n     focus and resources toward understanding and monitoring the \n     situation in Somalia;\n       (7) urges the President to develop a comprehensive strategy \n     to ensure that all United States humanitarian, diplomatic, \n     political, and counterterrorism programs in Somalia and the \n     wider Horn of Africa are coordinated and making progress \n     toward the long-term goal of establishing stability, respect \n     for human rights, and functional, inclusive governance in \n     Somalia;\n       (8) urges the President and Secretary of State, as part of \n     a comprehensive strategy--\n       (A) to provide greater support for a range of diplomatic \n     initiatives to engage clan leaders, business leaders, and \n     civil society leaders in Somalia and the Somali Diaspora in \n     political reconciliation and consensus-building;\n       (B) to ensure better oversight, monitoring, and \n     transparency of all United States security assistance \n     provided to the TFG;\n       (C) to increase and strengthen the United States diplomatic \n     team working on Somalia, including the appointment of a \n     senior envoy, and to ensure that these officials have the \n     necessary resources, access, and mandate;\n       (D) to pursue opportunities for periodic, temporary United \n     States Government travel to Somalia, consistent with any \n     security concerns;\n       (E) to expand and deepen our engagement with the regional \n     administration of Puntland and other regional administrations \n     in order to promote good governance, effective law \n     enforcement, respect for human rights, and stability in these \n     regions;\n       (F) to provide additional humanitarian, development, and \n     security assistance to the region of Somaliland, recognizing \n     the positive developments in that region with respect to \n     consolidating multi-party democracy, which was evident in the \n     recent election there;\n       (G) to outline punitive measures and incentives that can be \n     used with the Government of Eritrea to bring a halt to its \n     financial and material support for armed opposition groups in \n     Somalia, including steps to improve bilateral relations and \n     to push for a resolution of Eritrea's border dispute with \n     Ethiopia consistent with the arbitration decision of the \n     Ethiopia-Eritrea Border Commission;\n       (H) to explore, in consultation with the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, increased options for pressuring individuals, \n     governments, and other actors who undertake economic \n     activities that support al Shabaab and other armed opposition \n     groups in Somalia; and\n       (I) to develop, in consultation with the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development, \n     creative and flexible mechanisms for delivering basic \n     humanitarian and development assistance to the people of \n     Somalia while minimizing the risk of significant diversion to \n     armed opposition groups.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 667\n\n      Recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Coastal Organization\n\n       Whereas, in 2010, the Coastal States Organization (referred \n     to in this preamble as the ``CSO'') is celebrating its 40th \n     anniversary of representing the Governors of the 35 coastal \n     States, commonwealths, and territories of the United States \n     on issues relating to the sound management of coastal, ocean, \n     and Great Lakes resources;\n       Whereas the CSO was created in 1969 by a resolution, which \n     was endorsed unanimously, of the National Governors \n     Association;\n       Whereas, in January 1970, the first meeting of the CSO was \n     held in Savannah, Georgia;\n       Whereas, in October 2010, the CSO will celebrate its 40th \n     anniversary in Monterey, California;\n       Whereas the CSO has been empowered to contribute to the \n     development and operation of the national coastal zone \n     management program, which was established by the Coastal Zone \n     Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.);\n       Whereas the CSO is a nonpartisan organization comprised of \n     economically, environmentally, geographically, and socially \n     diverse States, territories, and commonwealths;\n       Whereas the CSO serves as a means for the Governors of the \n     member States, territories, and commonwealths to communicate \n     with Congress and the executive branch on coastal, ocean, and \n     Great Lakes policies, programs, and affairs; and\n       Whereas the member States, territories, and commonwealths \n     of the CSO have a responsibility to work with the Federal \n     Government to manage and conserve the public trust in coastal \n     and ocean ecosystems as well as the quality of life in \n     coastal communities for the benefit of current and future \n     generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 40th anniversary of the Coastal States \n     Organization; and\n       (2) supports the role of States, territories, and \n     commonwealths in the stewardship of coastal, ocean, and Great \n     Lakes resources.\n\n                              S. Res. 668\n\n  Expressing support for the designation of October 20, 2010, as the \n                      ``National Day on Writing''\n\n       Whereas people in the 21st century are writing \n     more than ever before for personal, professional, and civic \n     purposes;\n       Whereas the social nature of writing invites people of \n     every age, profession, and walk of life to create meaning \n     through composing;\n       Whereas more and more people in every occupation deem \n     writing as essential and influential in their work;\n       Whereas writers continue to learn how to write for \n     different purposes, audiences, and occasions throughout their \n     lifetimes;\n       Whereas developing digital technologies expand the \n     possibilities for composing in multiple media at a faster \n     pace than ever before;\n       Whereas young people are leading the way in developing new \n     forms of composing by using different forms of digital media;\n       Whereas effective communication contributes to building a \n     global economy and a global community;\n       Whereas the National Council of Teachers of English, in \n     conjunction with its many national and local partners, honors \n     and celebrates the importance of writing through the National \n     Day on Writing;\n       Whereas the National Day on Writing celebrates the \n     foundational place of writing in the personal, professional, \n     and civic lives of the people of the United States;\n       Whereas the National Day on Writing provides an opportunity \n     for individuals across the United States to share and exhibit \n     their written works through the National Gallery of Writing;\n       Whereas the National Day on Writing highlights the \n     importance of writing instruction and practice at every \n     educational level and in every subject area;\n       Whereas the National Day on Writing emphasizes the lifelong \n     process of learning to write and compose for different \n     audiences, purposes, and occasions;\n       Whereas the National Day on Writing honors the use of the \n     full range of media for composing, from traditional tools \n     like print, audio, and video, to Web 2.0 tools like blogs, \n     wikis, and podcasts; and\n       Whereas the National Day on Writing encourages all people \n     of the United States to write, as well as to enjoy and learn \n     from the writing of others: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of October 20, 2010, as the \n     ``National Day on Writing'';\n       (2) strongly affirms the purposes of the National Day on \n     Writing;\n       (3) encourages participation in the National Galley of \n     Writing, which serves as an exemplary living archive of the \n     centrality of writing in the lives of the people of the \n     United States; and\n       (4) encourages educational institutions, businesses, \n     community and civic associations, and other organizations to \n     promote awareness of the National Day on Writing and \n     celebrate the writing of the members those organizations \n     through individual submissions to the National Gallery of \n     Writing.\n\n                              S. Res. 669\n\n      Recognizing Filipino American History Month in October 2010\n\n       Whereas, the earliest documented Filipino presence in the \n     continental United States was on October 18, 1587, when the \n     first ``Luzones Indios'' set foot in Morro Bay, California, \n     on board the Manila-built galleon ship Nuestra Senora de \n     Esperanza;\n       Whereas, the Filipino American National Historical Society \n     recognizes the year of 1763 as the date of the first \n     permanent Filipino settlement in the United States in St. \n     Malo, Louisiana, which set in motion the focus on the story \n     of our Nation's past from a new perspective by concentrating \n     on the economic, cultural, social, and other notable \n     contributions that Filipino Americans have made in countless \n     ways toward the development of the history of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, the Filipino-American community is the second \n     largest Asian-American group in the United States, with a \n     population of approximately 3,100,000 people;\n       Whereas, Filipino-American servicemen and servicewomen have \n     a longstanding history serving in the Armed Services, from \n     the Civil War to the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, \n     including the 250,000 Filipinos who fought under the United \n     States flag during World War II to protect and defend this \n     country;\n       Whereas, 9 Filipino Americans have received the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award for valor in \n     action against an enemy force that can be bestowed upon an\n\n[[Page S7774]]\n\n     individual serving in the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas, Filipino Americans are an integral part of the \n     United States health care system as nurses, doctors, and \n     other medical professionals;\n       Whereas, Filipino Americans have contributed greatly to the \n     fine arts, music, dance, literature, education, business, \n     literature, journalism, sports, fashion, politics, \n     government, science, technology, and other fields in the \n     United States that enrich the landscape of the country;\n       Whereas, efforts should continue to promote the study of \n     Filipino-American history and culture, as mandated in the \n     mission statement of the Filipino American National \n     Historical Society, because the roles of Filipino Americans \n     and other people of color have been overlooked in the \n     writing, teaching, and learning of United States history;\n       Whereas, it is imperative for Filipino-American youth to \n     have positive role models to instill in them the importance \n     of education, complemented with the richness of their \n     ethnicity and the value of their legacy; and\n       Whereas, Filipino American History Month is celebrated \n     during the month of October 2010: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the celebration of Filipino American History \n     Month 2010 as a study of the advancement of Filipino \n     Americans, as a time of reflection and remembrance, and as a \n     time to renew efforts toward the research and examination of \n     history and culture in order to provide an opportunity for \n     all people in the United States to learn and appreciate more \n     about Filipino Americans and their historic contributions to \n     the Nation; and\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to observe \n     Filipino American History Month 2010 with appropriate \n     programs and activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 670\n\n    Designating the week beginning on Monday, November 8, 2010, as \n               ``National Veterans History Project Week''\n\n       Whereas 2010 marks the 10th anniversary of the \n     establishment of the Veterans History Project by Congress in \n     order to collect and preserve the wartime stories of veterans \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States;\n       Whereas Congress charged the American Folklife Center at \n     the Library of Congress to undertake the Veterans History \n     Project and to engage the public in the creation of a \n     collection of oral histories that would be a lasting tribute \n     to individual veterans;\n       Whereas the Veterans History Project relies on a corps of \n     volunteer interviewers, partner organizations, and an array \n     of civic minded institutions nationwide who interview \n     veterans according to the guidelines outlined by the project;\n       Whereas these oral histories have created an abundant \n     resource for scholars to gather first-hand accounts of \n     veterans' experience in World War I, World War II, the Korean \n     War, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and the \n     Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts;\n       Whereas there are 17,000,000 wartime veterans in the United \n     States whose stories can educate people of all ages about \n     important moments and events in the history of the United \n     States and the world and provide instructive narratives that \n     illuminate the meanings of ``service'', ``sacrifice'', \n     ``citizenship'', and ``democracy'';\n       Whereas more than 70,000 oral histories have already been \n     collected and more than 8,000 oral histories are fully \n     digitized and available through the website of the Library of \n     Congress;\n       Whereas the Veterans History Project will increase the \n     number of oral histories that can be collected and preserved \n     and increase the number of veterans it honors; and\n       Whereas ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' has been \n     recognized by Congress in previous years: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on Monday, November 8, \n     2010, as ``National Veterans History Project Week'';\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to interview \n     at least 1 veteran in their families or communities according \n     to guidelines provided by the Veterans History Project; and\n       (3) encourages national, State, and local organizations \n     along with Federal, State, city, and county governmental \n     institutions to participate in support of the effort to \n     document, preserve, and honor the service of veterans of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 671\n\n        Supporting the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week, 2010\n\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established to \n     commemorate the service of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a \n     special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration for 11 \n     years who was murdered in the line of duty in 1985 while \n     engaged in the battle against illicit drugs;\n       Whereas 2010 marks 25 years since the death of Special \n     Agent Camarena;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established by the \n     National Family Partnership to preserve the memory of Special \n     Agent Camarena and further the cause for which he gave his \n     life;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign has been nationally \n     recognized since 1988 and is now the oldest and largest drug \n     prevention program in the United States, reaching millions of \n     young people each year during Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration, established in \n     1973, aggressively targets organizations involved in the \n     growing, manufacturing, and distribution of controlled \n     substances and has been a steadfast partner in commemorating \n     Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Governors and attorneys general of the States, \n     the National Family Partnership, Parent Teacher Associations, \n     Boys and Girls Clubs of America, PRIDE Youth Programs, the \n     Drug Enforcement Administration, and more than 100 other \n     organizations throughout the United States annually celebrate \n     Red Ribbon Week during the period of October 23 through \n     October 31;\n       Whereas the objective of Red Ribbon Week is to promote the \n     creation of drug-free communities through drug prevention \n     efforts, education, parental involvement, and community-wide \n     support;\n       Whereas drug abuse is one of the major challenges that the \n     Nation faces in securing a safe and healthy future for \n     families in the United States;\n       Whereas drug abuse and alcohol abuse contribute to domestic \n     violence and sexual assault and place the lives of children \n     at risk;\n       Whereas, between 1997 and 2007, the percentages of \n     admissions to substance abuse treatment programs as a result \n     of the abuse of marijuana and methamphetamines rose \n     significantly;\n       Whereas drug dealers specifically target children by \n     marketing illicit drugs that mimic the appearance and names \n     of well-known brand-name candies and foods; and\n       Whereas parents, youth, schools, businesses, law \n     enforcement agencies, religious institutions, service \n     organizations, senior citizens, medical and military \n     personnel, sports teams, and individuals throughout the \n     United States will demonstrate their commitment to healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles by wearing and \n     displaying red ribbons during the week-long celebration of \n     Red Ribbon Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week, 2010;\n       (2) encourages children and teens to choose to live drug-\n     free lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to--\n       (A) promote the creation of drug-free communities; and\n       (B) participate in drug prevention activities to show \n     support for healthy, productive, and drug-free lifestyles.\n\n                              S. Res. 672\n\n   Designating October 9, 2010, as ``National Chess Day'' to enhance \n awareness and encourage students and adults to engage in a game known \n        to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills\n\n       Whereas it is estimated that chess is played by 39,000,000 \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas there are over 75,000 members of the United States \n     Chess Federation (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Federation''), and unknown numbers of additional people in \n     the United States who play the game without joining an \n     official organization;\n       Whereas approximately half of the members of the Federation \n     are scholastic members, and many of the scholastic members \n     join by the age of 10;\n       Whereas the Federation is very supportive of the scholastic \n     programs and sponsors a Certified Chess Coach program that \n     provides the coaches involved in the scholastic programs \n     training and ensures schools and students can have confidence \n     the program;\n       Whereas many studies have linked chess programs to the \n     improvement of student scores in reading and math, as well as \n     improved self-esteem, and the Federation offers a school \n     curriculum to educators to help incorporate chess into the \n     school curriculum;\n       Whereas chess is a powerful cognitive learning tool that \n     can be used to successfully enhance reading and math \n     concepts; and\n       Whereas chess engages students of all learning styles and \n     strengths and promotes problem-solving and higher-level \n     thinking skills: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 9, 2010, as ``National Chess Day''; \n     and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Chess Day'' with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7774-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7774-S7775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 4168, H.R. 4337, AND H.R. 847\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') that takes additional steps with \nrespect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of \nMarch 15, 1995.\n  In Executive Order 12957, the President found that the actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran threaten the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States. To deal with that \nthreat, the President in Executive Order 12957 declared a national \nemergency and imposed prohibitions on certain transactions with respect \nto the development of Iranian petroleum resources. To further respond \nto that threat, Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995, imposed \ncomprehensive trade and financial sanctions on Iran. Finally, Executive \nOrder 13059 of August 19, 1997, consolidated and clarified the previous \norders.\n  I have determined that the actions and policies of the Government of \nIran on or after its presidential election of June 12, 2009, including \nits violent response to peaceful demonstrations and its commission of \nserious human rights abuses, warrant the imposition of additional \nsanctions.\n  The prohibitions contained in the new order implement section 105(a) \nof the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act \nof 2010 (Public Law 111-195) (CISADA) concerning, inter alia, the \nimposition of sanctions pursuant to IEEPA with respect to each person \non the list referred to in section 105(b). I applaud the efforts of the \nCongress to demonstrate the strong and sustained commitment of the \nUnited States to advancing the universal rights of all Iranians, and to \nsanction those who have abused their rights. The order, however, goes \nbeyond the scope of section 105 of CISADA by imposing sanctions \npursuant to IEEPA on persons who meet a broader set of criteria than \nthose specified in section 105(b).\n  The order blocks the property and interests in property of persons \nlisted in the Annex to the order, who I have determined meet the first \nof the three criteria set forth below. The order also provides criteria \nfor designations of persons determined by the Secretary of the \nTreasury, in consultation with or at the recommendation of the \nSecretary of State:\n  To be an official of the Government of Iran or a person acting on \nbehalf of the Government of Iran (including members of paramilitary \norganizations) who is responsible for or complicit in, or responsible \nfor ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of \nserious human rights abuses against persons in Iran or Iranian citizens \nor residents, or the family members of the foregoing, on or after June \n12, 2009, regardless of whether such abuses occurred in Iran;\n  To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in \nsupport of, the activities described in section 1(a)(ii)(A) of the \norder or any person whose property and interests in property are \nblocked pursuant to the order; or\n  To be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act \nfor or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property \nand interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order. I have \ndelegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \npowers granted to the President by IEEPA and the relevant provisions of \nCISADA, as may be necessary to carry out the blocking-related purposes \nof the order and to take such actions, including the promulgation of \nrules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the \nPresident by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out section 104 of \nCISADA. I have delegated to the Secretary of State the functions and \nauthorities related to visa sanctions conferred upon the President by \nthe relevant provisions of CISADA. I have also delegated to the \nSecretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, \nthe function of submitting to the appropriate congressional committees \nreferred to in section 105(b) of CISADA the initial and updated lists \nof persons who are subject to visa sanctions and whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to the order. All executive \nagencies of the United States Government are directed to take all \nappropriate measures within\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\ntheir authority to carry out the provisions of the order.\n  The order, a copy of which is enclosed, became effective at 12:01 \na.m. eastern daylight time on September 29, 2010.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, September 28, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7782-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7782-S7783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 3839.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Alabama relative to claiming \n     sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States over certain powers; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States reads as follows: ``The powers not delegated to \n     the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it \n     to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to \n     the people''; and\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of \n     federal power as being that specifically granted by the \n     Constitution of the United States and no more; and\n       Whereas, Federalism is the constitutional division of \n     powers between the national and state governments and is \n     widely regarded as one of America's most valuable \n     contributions to political science; and\n       Whereas, James Madison, ``the Father of the Constitution,'' \n     said, ``The powers delegated to the federal government are \n     few and defined. Those which are to remain in the state \n     governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be \n     exercised principally on external objects, [such] as war, \n     peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce. The powers reserved \n     to the several states will extend to all the objects which, \n     in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, \n     liberties, and properties of the people.''; and\n       Whereas, Thomas Jefferson emphasized that the states are \n     not ``subordinate'' to the national government, but rather \n     the two are ``coordinate departments of one simple and \n     integral whole. The one is the domestic, the\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\n     other the foreign branch of the same government.''; and\n       Whereas, Alexander Hamilton expressed his hope that ``the \n     people will always take care to preserve the constitutional \n     equilibrium between the general and the state governments.'' \n     He believed that ``this balance between the national and \n     state governments forms a double security to the people. If \n     one [government] encroaches on their rights, they will find a \n     powerful protection in the other. Indeed, they will both be \n     prevented from overpassing their constitutional limits by \n     [the] certain rivalship which will ever subsist between \n     them.''; and\n       Whereas, the scope of power defined by the Tenth Amendment \n     means that the federal government was created by the states \n     specifically to be an agent of the states; and\n       Whereas, today, in 2009, the states are demonstrably \n     treated as agents of the federal government; and\n       Whereas, many federal laws are directly in violation of the \n     Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment assures that we, the people of \n     the United States of America and each sovereign state in the \n     Union of States, now have, and have always had, rights the \n     federal government may not usurp; and\n       Whereas, Article IV, Section 4, United States Constitution, \n     says in part, ``The United States shall guarantee to every \n     State in this Union a Republican Form of Government'', and \n     the Ninth Amendment states that ``The enumeration in the \n     Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to \n     deny or disparage others retained by the people''; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has ruled in New \n     York v. United States, 112 S. Ct. 2408 (1992), that Congress \n     may not simply commandeer the legislative and regulatory \n     processes of the states; and\n       Whereas, a number of proposals from previous \n     administrations and some now pending from the present \n     administration and from Congress may further violate the \n     Constitution of the United States: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of Alabama, both Houses thereof \n     concurring, That the State of Alabama hereby claims \n     sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated \n     and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of \n     the United States; be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution serves as notice and demand \n     to the federal government, as our agent, to cease and desist, \n     effective immediately, mandates that are beyond the scope of \n     these constitutionally delegated powers; be it further\n       Resolved,  That all compulsory federal legislation that \n     directs states to comply under threat of civil or criminal \n     penalties or sanctions or requires states to pass legislation \n     or lose federal funding be prohibited or repealed; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the Speaker of the House and the \n     President of the Senate of each state's legislature, and the \n     entire delegation of the Alabama members of the U.S. \n     Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7786-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs:\n       Report to accompany S. 3243, To require U.S. Customs and \n     Border Protection to administer polygraph examinations to all \n     applicants for law enforcement positions with U.S. Customs \n     and Border Protection, to require U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection to initiate all periodic background \n     reinvestigations of certain law enforcement personnel, and \n     for other purposes (Rept.

A bill to ensure that women seeking an abortion are fully \ninformed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that I \nbelieve does cross the political divide; and that issue is, protecting \nchildren from needless pain. Forty years ago, when Roe v. Wade became \nthe law of the land, it was believed that babies simply did not feel \npain. At that time, the medical community thought a baby's nervous \nsystem was not yet developed enough to have a sense of pain, so \nsurgeries were literally performed with no anesthesia. Parents were \ntold not to worry if it appeared their child was in pain.\n  We found out the medical community was wrong.\n  Twenty-five years ago, a doctor at Oxford University proved that \nnewborn babies do, in fact, feel pain. His groundbreaking research was \ninspired by his own recognition of the signs of pain.\n  Dr. Anand noticed preterm babies returning from operations with weak \npulses, with rapid heart rates, and other signs of stress that would \ntypically be associated with the feeling of pain.\n  As a result, he studied two groups of babies. One went through \nsurgery without anesthesia, as was the practice at that time. A second \ngroup was given anesthesia before the surgery took place.\n  The results were remarkable. Most of the babies who were given pain \nmedicine sailed through the procedures while the babies who were given \nno pain medicine suffered significant stress. This study opened the \neyes of the medical community, shifting both medical opinion and common \npractice.\n  Today, pain relief for infants is now the standard of care. If my \nchild needed surgery today, and a doctor told us it would be done \nwithout anesthesia, without pain medicine for the baby, we would walk \nstraight out of the door; and any parent would.\n  Performing surgery on an infant without pain medicine is unimaginable \ntoday, despite having been common practice, the accepted standard of \ncare 40 years ago. Medical research shattered a commonly held belief, \nand it changed medicine forever.\n  I stand before you today in recognition that medical research has \nagain advanced. Again, it should shatter a misguided assumption. You \nsee, doctors now perform surgery on unborn babies. They can go into the \nwomb and save a baby as young as 20 weeks old.\n  This has allowed researchers to study reactions to pain by these \nunborn babies. The eye-opening results simply cannot be denied. Much \nlike the original groundbreaking study of newborns,\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\nthe research involving unborn babies presented evidence that they feel \npain.\n  When pain medicine was administered during surgery involving unborn \nchildren, their blood flow, their heart rate remained normal. But \nwithout pain medicine, blood flow and heart rate were affected, as \nunborn babies endured the pain.\n  The medical evidence is so compelling it alone should inspire us to \nact. But we do not have to rely upon a doctor's research. All of my \ncolleagues have surely seen with their own eyes the breathtaking images \nfrom ultrasounds. Perhaps it was the picture of a child or a grandchild \nthat showed a face and fingers and toes. Some might have been lucky \nenough to be in the room for a checkup and actually listened to that \nheartbeat.\n  There is no denying that those fingers and toes--that face, that \nheartbeat--is about a baby, a tiny, little miracle that can feel pain. \nPretending there is some magical line that is crossed at the moment of \nbirth that allows a baby to feel pain is literally absurd. There is no \nsuch line. There is no difference in the pain a baby begins feeling \nabout halfway through pregnancy and the pain a newborn baby feels.\n  Just as the medical community now admits it was wrong to assert that \nnewborns feel no pain, we know it is wrong to say unborn children feel \nno pain. But while medical science has moved forward and taken this \nstep, our laws and our practices still rely on decades-old information \nand mistaken beliefs.\n  So it is time for us to acknowledge in law and in practice the \nrealities revealed by these advancements in medical science. We must be \nwilling to change our mindset based upon this evidence, and I would \nsuggest we have an obligation to do so.\n  Mothers have a right to know that their unborn babies feel pain. \nRespected doctors are on record saying that abortions in the second and \nthird trimester likely cause unborn babies ``intense pain.'' How can we \nclaim to be compassionate, yet look the other way in denial of this \npain? I would suggest we cannot. We can see these precious faces. We \ncan hear their hearts beat.\n  That is why the legislation I am introducing today is so critically \nimportant. The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act would merely require \nthose who perform abortions 20 weeks into a pregnancy or later to \ninform the mother that her unborn child feels pain. And the mother may \nrequest anesthesia for that child to lessen the pain if she does not \nchoose life.\n  Women should not be kept in the dark. They have the right to know \nwhat their unborn child will feel during an abortion. And those who \nprovide abortions should not dismiss the reality of the anguish. The \nUnborn Child Pain Awareness Act says: At the very least, let's provide \nmothers with the complete medical and scientific research we have at \nour disposal today. Let's simply provide the truth before they make a \nlife-changing decision. We cannot in good conscience know of this \nmedical reality and fail to share it with mothers who are contemplating \nthe most difficult and consequential decision of their entire lives.\n  Our country is awakening to the reality of the pain felt by unborn \nchildren but slowly, just as we were slow to accept that newborn \nbabies, yes, in fact, do feel pain so many years ago. Thankfully, our \nStates are leading the way when Congress has failed to act. Arkansas, \nGeorgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Utah have passed similar \nlegislation. Several other States include information about the pain an \nunborn child experiences in their counseling materials. In fact, in my \nhome State of Nebraska, we became the first State to ban abortions \nafter 20 weeks on the basis that an unborn child can, in fact, feel \npain.\n  Unborn children cannot tell us what they feel, but medical research \ncries out on their behalf. They deserve the same human compassion we \nshow newborns, 2-year-olds, and children of every age. They all feel \npain.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation. Thus far, 18 Senators have signed on, and I hope more will \nfollow. I would suggest that this legislation has little to do with \nwhether you call yourself pro-life or pro-choice. It is about basic \nhuman decency and concern for human suffering. I hope my colleagues \nwill review the medical research, look to their conscience, and follow \nwhat is right. I hope they join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 3870. A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to permit \ncertain livestock owners to plant a secondary crop for the use of the \nproducer as emergency feed; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \nenable livestock producers who have been affected by excessive \nprecipitation to have access to emergency feed stocks. The rain \nproducers faced last fall, coupled with the abnormal snowfall this \nwinter and the subsequent rain this spring and summer, has led to major \nflooding throughout South Dakota, particularly in the northeastern part \nof our State. Unfortunately, there are many areas in which land that \nwould normally be available for planting was not available because of \nthe wet conditions. As a result of the flooding earlier this year, many \nproducers claimed prevented planting coverage through their crop \ninsurance policies.\n  A side effect of the flooding was that many producers have faced a \nshortage of forage for their livestock. I have spoken with many \nproducers who would like to be able to plant a secondary crop on land \nthat has qualified for prevented planting coverage for the purposes of \nproviding emergency feed for their own livestock. As currently provided \nby the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, in States like South \nDakota, which are not permitted to plant two crops during a single \nyear, a producer loses 65 percent of their prevented planting \ncompensation if they plant a secondary crop and harvest or graze that \ncrop before the end of the crop year, which is interpreted as November \n1 by the Risk Management Agency, RMA. The actual production history, \nAPH, of the land is also reduced to 60 percent of the normal yield for \nthat year. Given the suffering producers in my State have experienced \nthis year because of flooding, it is necessary to provide them the \nflexibility they need to stay in business.\n  My legislation would permit producers to plant and harvest or graze a \nsecondary crop before November 1 for the purposes of ensuring \nsufficient feed for their livestock without penalty of a reduction in \nprevented planting coverage and benefits. In order to ensure \naccountability, my legislation would require producers to own \nlivestock, to have suffered from excessive precipitation which \nprohibited the first crop from being planted by the Risk Management \nAgency's final planting date for that crop, and the producer must use \nthe second crop only for feed for their own livestock. The producer \nwould not be permitted to sell the crop. Additionally, any revenue \ngenerated from the second planting would be taken into account when \ncalculating the producer's benefits from Federal disaster programs, \nlike the Supplemental Revenue, SURE, Assistance Program. Ultimately, \nthis legislation is very fiscally responsible as it would encourage a \nreduction in Federal dollars spent on disaster assistance.\n  Agriculture is a vital industry in South Dakota. Year after year, our \nproducers continue to provide the world with a cheap, safe, and \nabundant source of food, fuel, and fiber. In fact, according to the \nSouth Dakota Department of Agriculture, each year on average, one South \nDakota producer raises enough food to feed 144 people. Our farmers and \nranchers are absolutely essential to ensuring we can feed an ever-\ngrowing world population and to the continued growth of our State's \neconomy, and my legislation would help them through rough times when \nfactors outside of their control, like the weather, would otherwise \nforce them out of business.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 3871. A bill to amend chapter 13 of title 28, United States Code, \nto authorize the designation and assignment of retired justices of the \nSupreme Court to particular cases in which an active justice is \nrecused; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nensure that the Nation's highest court can serve its function as the \ncourt of last\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\nresort in our judicial system. The Supreme Court's effectiveness is \ncompromised when it does not have a full slate of nine justices sitting \nin a given case. When a Justice needs to recuse from a matter under the \nrules that govern judicial conflicts of interest, the Supreme Court may \nbe rendered ineffective, because there are no provisions in place to \nallow another to be designated to sit in his or her place. Given the \nCourt's recent rash of 5:4 rulings, the absence of one Justice could \nresult in a 4:4 decision. In that scenario, the Supreme Court cannot \nserve its function and the lower court decision stands. This was a very \nreal concern for Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He explained that \nsuch a stalemate on the Court where there were conflicting rulings in \nthe lower courts, ``would lay down `one rule in Athens, and another \nrule in Rome' with a vengeance.''\n  Under the existing statute, retired Justices may be designated to sit \non any court in the land except the one to which they were confirmed. \nThe bill I am introducing today will ensure that the Supreme Court can \ncontinue to serve its essential function. I hope that it will encourage \nJustices to recuse themselves when they have a financial conflict of \ninterest or their participation would create the appearance of \nimpropriety. In recent history, Justices have refused to recuse \nthemselves and one of their justifications has been that the Supreme \nCourt is unlike lower courts because no other judge can serve in their \nplace when Justices recuse.\n  When I met with Justice John Paul Stevens earlier in the year before \nhe announced his retirement, he suggested exploring legislation that \nwould allow retired U.S. Supreme Court Justices to sit by designation \non all of our federal courts. Currently, Justices Stevens, Sandra Day \nO'Connor and David Souter may sit by designation on any Federal court \nexcept the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court to which they were confirmed. \nThis defies common sense.\n  Recent news about conflicts of interest has raised serious questions \nin the minds of Americans about the impartiality of the judiciary. \nThese serious concerns only serve to undermine the public trust in our \nNation's courts. Allowing retired Justices to sit on the Supreme Court \nwould encourage sitting justices to recuse themselves when there is \neven an appearance of a conflict of interest regarding a case before \nthe Court. Such a designation would also help to avoid the potential of \n4:4 splits which concerned Chief Justice Rehnquist. I am confident the \nAmerican people want the Supreme Court to serve as the final word in \nour federal judicial system. I encourage my fellow Senators to consider \nthe legislation I am introducing today as a common-sense solution to \npreserve the role that the Supreme Court plays in our democracy.\n  Mr. President, I ask by unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objetion, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3871\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve billing disclosures to cellular telephone \nconsumers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, cell phones today are \nbecoming ubiquitous and more essential to our everyday lives. Americans \ntoday have 285 million wireless phones.\n  We use these phones in new and innovative ways. Consumers today \nincreasingly use their cell phones for much more than just talking. \nMobile broadband services now allow us to surf the Internet, search for \nnearby shops or restaurants, and watch videos right on our wireless \nhandsets.\n  Since we now use these devices in new ways, it can be more difficult \nfor consumers to realize they have exceeded their monthly subscriptions \nfor cell phone service. This can have dramatic consequences for \nconsumers.\n  Consider the case of a Navy ROTC midshipman who mistakenly left his \nsmartphone's roaming function turned on while he was abroad. His phone \ndownloaded e-mail messages, and he was sent a bill for almost $1,300. \nNews outlets have highlighted other cases from across the country, \nincluding cases where children on family subscription plans racked up \nthousands of dollars in extra charges. A 13 year-old's cell phone data \nusage led to a bill for almost $22,000. Another man was billed $18,000 \nfor a 6-week period when his son used a cell phone to connect a \ncomputer to the Internet. These stories we hear about in the media are \ncertainly not isolated cases, just the most egregious.\n  In fact, a recent Federal Communications Commission, FCC, survey \nfound that 30 million Americans, or 1 in 6 adult cell phone users, have \nexperienced cases of ``bill shock.'' Cell phone bill shock is when a \nconsumer's monthly bill increases when they have not changed their \nplan. In about one in four cases, the consumer's bill increased by more \nthan $100. According to a survey by Consumers Union, the publishers of \nConsumer Reports magazine, the median bill shock amount was $83.\n  Although consumers can already access their phone usage by requesting \nthis information from their cell phone provider, the FCC survey found \nthat almost 85 percent of American consumers who suffered bill shock \nwere not alerted that they were about to exceed their allowed voice \nminutes, text messages, or data downloads.\n  In many cases, a simple alert message would help consumers avoid bill \nshock. That is why today I am introducing the Cell Phone Bill Shock Act \nof 2010.\n  My legislation would require that cell phone companies do two things; \nfirst, that they notify cell phone customers when they have used 80 \npercent of their limit of voice minutes, text messages, or data usage. \nThis notification could be in the form of a text message or email, and \nshould be free of charge. Secondly, this legislation would require cell \nphone companies to obtain a customer's consent before charging for \nservices in excess of their limit of voice, text, or data usage. \nCustomers could give such consent by calling or sending a free text \nmessage or e-mail to their phone company.\n  In the European Union, wireless phone companies already provide \nsimilar notifications when wireless consumers are roaming and when they \nreach 80 percent of their monthly data roaming services.\n  Earlier this year, Congress approved legislation to help consumers \navoid bank overdraft fees from everyday debit card and ATM \ntransactions. Banks must now obtain their customer's permission before \nallowing debit card transactions which would incur overdraft fees. My \nlegislation extends that same concept to cell phone customers, who \nshould benefit from similar protections against ``bill shock.''\n  The texting and Internet capabilities that make today's cell phones \nmore useful than ever should be applied to help consumers avoid bill \nshock. Sending an automatic text notification to one's phone or an e-\nmail alert should not place a burden on cell phone companies. Passing \nmy commonsense legislation will help prevent consumer's from facing \n``bill shock'' problems in the future.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\n                                S. 3872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cell Phone Bill Shock Act of \n     2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A recent survey conducted by the Federal Communications \n     Commission found that 1 out of 6 consumers who subscribe to \n     commercial mobile service has experienced ``bill shock'', \n     which is the sudden increase in the monthly bill of a \n     subscriber even though the subscriber has not made changes to \n     their monthly service plan.\n       (2) Most consumers who experience bill shock do not receive \n     notification from their provider of commercial mobile service \n     when the consumer is about to exceed the monthly limit of \n     voice minutes, text message, or data megabytes.\n       (3) Most consumers who experience bill shock do not receive \n     notification from their provider of commercial mobile service \n     that their bill has suddenly increased.\n       (4) Prior to the enactment of this Act, a provider of \n     commercial mobile service was under no obligation to notify a \n     consumer of such services of a pending or sudden increase in \n     their bill for the use of such service.\n       (5) Section 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 332) requires that all commercial mobile service \n     provider charges, practices, classifications, and regulations \n     ``for or in connection with'' interstate communications \n     service be just and reasonable, and authorizes the Federal \n     Communications Commission to promulgate rules to implement \n     this requirement.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Orrin Hatch, in introducing legislation to renew an \nexisting Federal program to provide tax incentives for the installation \nof equipment to refuel cars and trucks with alternative fuels including \nbiodiesel, gasohol, electricity, compressed natural gas, propane, \nliquefied natural gas, and hydrogen.\n  The United States continues to import far more oil than we produce. \nUpwards of \\2/3\\ of the oil we use is imported from other countries, \nmany of whom do not have Americans' best interests at heart, or worse. \nSimilarly, \\2/3\\ of all of the oil used in the U.S. goes to power our \ncars, buses, and trucks. If the U.S. is going to reduce our dependence \non imported oil, it is going to have to adopt alternative \ntransportation technologies such as plug-in hybrid and all electric \nvehicles, fuel cells, and natural gas vehicles. Each of these \nalternative technologies has pluses and minuses in terms of their \ntechnical maturity, usefulness in different types of vehicles, cost, \nand the availability of refueling infrastructure to support them. This \nlegislation only addresses the need for refueling and recharging \ninfrastructure, but without a certainty that there will be places to \nrefuel and recharge their alternative fueled vehicles Americans are not \ngoing to buy them. No one wants to run out of fuel while looking for a \nplace to fill up.\n  This legislation extends an already existing tax credit, Sec. 30C of \nthe Tax Code, which is intended to help defray the cost of installing \nnew alternative refueling and recharging equipment. The current credit \nexpires in a matter of a few months at the end of calendar year 2010. \nGiven the critical need to cut our national appetite for imported oil, \nit is essential that Congress extend this tax credit. This legislation \nwould extend the existing credit for another 4 years, until the end of \n2014.\n  The legislation also makes several changes in the credit to make it \nmore practical. For example, this bill would make it clear that a \nfueling station could obtain a separate credit for each type of \nalternative fuel that it chooses to distribute. Right now, the credit \nis capped at $50,000 per location regardless of the number of fuels \nthat it may want to sell. The bill would also expand the base credit \nfrom $50,000 to $100,000 to bring it more in line with the actual cost \nof refueling and recharging equipment. Third, the bill would allow the \ncredit to cover additional upgrades to building wiring or natural gas \npiping or other improvements that are necessary for the installation of \nthe alternative fuel equipment, and expand the kinds of equipment that \nwould be covered to include on-site fuel generation. The bill would \nalso allow an option to obtain a smaller $10,000 credit for the \ninstallation of refueling devices, such as chargers for plug-in \nelectric cars or slow-fill natural gas compressors, in lieu of the \n$100,000 credit per location. Finally, the bill would allow multiple \nowners of buildings, such as a condominium or a co-op, to share the \ncredit.\n  Continued dependence on imported oil is an economic and national \nsecurity danger. Giving Americans options to use alternative fueled \nvehicles is one major way in which to dramatically reduce this danger. \nThis bill does not tell Americans which kind of car or truck to buy. It \ndoes not pick winners and losers from among already recognized \nalternative fuels. What it would do is make the availability of all \nalternative motor fuels more likely, and then the market will decide \nwhich technologies work best.\n  I urge other Senators to support this legislation and give Americans \na real chance to cut our oil imports.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 3876\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of State to identify \nindividuals responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei \nMagnitsky or for the conspiracy to defraud the Russian Federation of \ntaxes on corporate profits through fraudulent transactions and lawsuits \nagainst Hermitage, and to impose a visa ban and certain financial \nmeasures with respect to such individuals, until the Russian Federation \nhas thoroughly investigated the death of Sergei Magnitsky and brought \nthe Russian criminal justice system into compliance with international \nlegal standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Justice for \nSergei Magnitsky Act of 2010.\n  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nI first learned about Sergei Magnitsky at a hearing I held on Russia in \nJune 2009.\n  Sergei Magnitsky was a young Russian anti-corruption lawyer employed \nby a prominent American law firm in Moscow who blew the whistle on the \nlargest known tax rebate fraud in Russian history perpetrated by high \nlevel Russian officials. After discovering this complex and brazen \ncorruption scheme, Sergei Magnitsky dutifully testified to the \nauthorities detailing the conspiracy to defraud the Russian people of \napproximately $230 million and naming the names of those officials. \nShortly after his testimony, Sergei was arrested by subordinates of the \nvery law enforcement officers he had implicated in this crime. He was \nheld in detention for nearly a year without trial under torturous \nconditions and died in an isolation cell while prison doctors waited \noutside his door on November 16, 2009.\n  In April of this year I sent a letter to our Secretary of State \nurging a visa ban for Russian officials connected to the death of \nSergei Magnitsky. I also released a list of 60 senior officials from \nthe Russian Interior Ministry, Federal Security Service, Federal Tax \nService, Regional Courts, General Prosecutor's Office, and Federal \nPrison Service, along with detailed descriptions of their involvement \nin this matter. My bill reminds the Department of State that I have not \nforgotten and will not forget this issue. In fact, this bill goes a bit \nfurther adding an asset freeze provision to be applied against those \nimplicated in this tragic affair.\n  Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer with what should have been a promising \ncareer ahead of him died at age 37 leaving behind a mother, a wife, and \ntwo boys who never saw him or even heard his voice after his arrest. \nSince his death, no one has been held accountable and some of those \ninvolved even have been promoted. Also, there is strong evidence that \nthe criminal enterprise that stole the money from the Russian treasury \nand falsely imprisoned and tortured Magnitsky, continues to operate. In \nfact, the American founding partner of Magnitsky's firm fled Russia for \nhis safety in the months following his colleague's death after learning \nthat a similar fraud scheme was attempted by the same criminals.\n  This is a heartbreaking story, and let me be clear, my bill does not \neven attempt to deliver justice as that would be impossible since \nnothing can bring Sergei back. There are obvious limits to what we can \ndo as Americans, but we can deny the privilege of visiting our country \nand accessing our financial system. This bill sends a strong message to \nthose who are currently acting with impunity in Russia that there will \nbe consequences for corruption should you wish to travel and invest \nabroad. I hope others, especially in the EU, UK, and Canada will adopt \nsimilar sanctions.\n  This measure is also about the future and protecting our business \ninterests abroad by making it clear that, even if your home country \nallows you to trample the rule of law, we will not stand by and become \nan unwitting accomplice in your crimes.\n  Sadly, Sergei Magnitsky joins the ranks of a long list of Russian \nheroes who lost their lives because they stood up for principle and for \ntruth. These ranks include Natalia Estemirova, a brave human rights \nactivist shot in the head and chest and stuffed into the trunk of a \ncar, Anna Politkovskaya, an intrepid reporter shot while coming home \nwith an armful of groceries, and too many others.\n  Often in these killings there is a veil of plausible deniability, \ngunmen show up in the dark and slip away into the shadows, but Sergei, \nin inhuman conditions managed to document in 450 complaints exactly who \nbears responsibility for his false arrest and death. We must honor his \nheroic sacrifice and do all we can to learn from this tragedy that \nothers may not share his fate.\n  Few are made in the mold of Sergei Magnitsky--able to withstand \nbarbaric depravations and cruelty without breaking and certainly none \nof us would want to be put to such a test. For those corrupt officials \nwho abuse their office, Sergei's life stands as a rebuke to what is \nleft of their consciences. To those who suffer unjustly, Sergei's \nexperience can be a reminder to draw strength from and to know that \nthey are not completely alone in their struggle.\n  In closing, I wish to address those prominent Russian human rights \ndefenders who just a couple weeks ago appealed to our government and to \nEuropean leaders to adopt the sanctions I called for in my April letter \nto Secretary Clinton. You are the conscience of Russia and we have \nheard your plea. You are not alone, and while you and your fellow \ncitizens must do the heavy lifting at home, I assure you that ``human \nrights'' are not empty words for this body and for my government. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Sergei Magnitsky \n     Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States supports the people of the Russian \n     Federation in their efforts to realize their full economic \n     potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and the \n     rule of law.\n       (2) The Russian Federation--\n       (A) is a member of the United Nations, the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the International \n     Monetary Fund;\n       (B) has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other \n     Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the \n     International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \n     Rights, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption; \n     and\n       (C) is bound by the legal obligations set forth in the \n     European Convention on Human Rights.\n       (3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect \n     obligations and responsibilities through the adoption of \n     international agreements and treaties, which must be observed \n     in good faith in order to maintain the stability of the \n     international order. Human rights are an integral part of \n     international law, and lie at the foundation of the \n     international order. The protection of human rights, \n     therefore, particularly in the case of a country that has \n     incurred obligations to protect human rights under an \n     international agreement to which it is a party, is not left \n     exclusively to the internal affairs of that country.\n       (4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are \n     instrumental in the protection of human rights and in \n     achieving sustainable economic growth, which benefits both \n     the people of the Russian Federation and the international \n     community through the creation of open and transparent \n     markets.\n       (5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in \n     democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights \n     protections. This is the case when public officials are \n     allowed to abuse their authority with impunity for political \n     or financial gains in collusion with private entities.\n       (6) The President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry \n     Medvedev, has addressed corruption in many public speeches, \n     including stating in his 2009 address to Russia's Federal \n     Assembly, ``[Z]ero tolerance of corruption should become part \n     of our national culture. . . . In Russia we often say that \n     there are few cases in which corrupt officials are \n     prosecuted. . . . [S]imply incarcerating a few will not \n     resolve the problem. But incarcerated they must be.''. \n     President Medvedev went on to say, ``We shall overcome \n     underdevelopment and corruption because we are a strong and \n     free people, and deserve a normal life in a modern, \n     prosperous democratic society.''. Furthermore, President \n     Medvedev has acknowledged Russia's disregard for the rule of \n     law and used the term ``legal nihilism'' to describe a \n     criminal justice system that continues to imprison innocent \n     people.\n       (7) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his \n     repressive arrest and torture in custody by the same officers \n     of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation \n     that Mr. Magnitsky had implicated in the embezzlement of \n     funds from the Russian Treasury and the misappropriation of 3 \n     companies from his client, Hermitage, reflects how deeply the \n     protection of human rights is affected by corruption.\n       (8) The denial by all state bodies of the Russian \n     Federation of any justice or legal remedies to Mr. Magnitsky \n     during the nearly 12 full months he was kept without trial in \n     detention, and the impunity of state officials he testified \n     against for their involvement in corruption and the carrying \n     out of his repressive persecution since his death, shows the \n     politically motivated nature of the persecution of Mr. \n     Magnitsky.\n       (9) Mr. Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009, at the age of \n     37, in Matrosskaya Tishina Prison in Moscow, Russia, and is \n     survived by a mother, a wife, and 2 sons.\n       (10) There is extensive evidence that public officials from \n     the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation, the \n     Russian federal tax authorities, the Prosecutor General's \n     Office of the Russian Federation, and the Russian Federal \n     Security Service, as well as regional courts and the prison \n     system of the Russian Federation, have abused their powers \n     and positions to commit serious human rights violations, \n     embezzled funds from the Russian Treasury, and retaliated \n     against whistleblowers.\n       (11) While he was in detention, Sergei Magnitsky called \n     himself a hostage of officials who misappropriated companies \n     from his client, the Hermitage Fund, and embezzled funds from \n     the Russian Treasury. He said that his criminal prosecution, \n     arrest, and detention were organized as a retribution by \n     police officers who had the full knowledge of his innocence.\n       (12) The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow \n     for the Control of the Observance of Human Rights in Places \n     of Forced Detention, an organization empowered by Russian law \n     to independently monitor prison conditions, concluded, ``A \n     man who is kept in custody and is being detained is not \n     capable of using all the necessary means to protect either \n     his life or his health. This is a responsibility of a state \n     which holds him captive. Therefore, the case of Sergei \n     Magnitsky can be described as a breach of the right to life. \n     The members of the civic supervisory commission have reached \n     the conclusion that Magnitsky had been experiencing both \n     psychological and physical pressure in custody, and the \n     conditions in some of the wards of Butyrka can be justifiably \n     called torturous. The people responsible for this must be \n     punished.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Clinton: I am writing to request the \n     immediate cancelation of U.S. visas held by a number of \n     Russian officials and others who are involved in significant \n     corruption in that country and who are responsible for last \n     year's torture and death in prison of the Russian anti-\n     corruption lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who testified against \n     them. While there are many aspects of this case which are \n     impossible to pursue here in the United States, one step we \n     can take, however, is to deny the individuals involved in \n     this crime and their immediate family members the privilege \n     of visiting our country. The United States has a clear policy \n     of denying entry to individuals involved in corruption, and \n     it is imperative that the U.S. Department of State act \n     promptly on this matter.\n       By way of brief background, on June 23, 2009, the Helsinki \n     Commission heard testimony from the CEO of Hermitage Capital, \n     Bill Browder, about a major crime committed by senior \n     Interior Ministry officials in Russia, along with others in \n     the Russian government and private sector. The crime, which \n     involved a fraudulent $230 million tax refund paid to the \n     criminal group, was exposed by Hermitage's lawyer, Sergei \n     Magnitsky. Through Mr. Browder's testimony we heard about the \n     plight of Mr. Magnitsky, who, after discovering the crime, \n     chose to testify against the Interior Ministry officers who \n     had carried it out. One month after his testimony he was \n     arrested in front of his wife and two young children in his \n     Moscow home by a team of Interior Ministry troopers reporting \n     directly to the officers Mr. Magnitsky had accused.\n       Since our June hearing, this story has taken a tragic turn \n     for the worse. As highlighted in the 2009 State Department \n     Country Report of Human Rights in Russia, Sergei Magnitsky \n     was tortured in an attempt to force him to withdraw his \n     testimony and to incriminate himself and his client. His \n     detailed letters from prison attest to the inhuman conditions \n     in which he was kept for nearly a year without a trial. \n     During the course of his imprisonment he developed gallstones \n     and pancreatitis, but was denied any medical attention as he \n     continued to refuse to withdraw his testimony. On the night \n     of November 16, 2009, he died awaiting trial.\n       Sergei Magnitsky's family were denied an independent \n     autopsy by the Russian authorities, who claimed he died of \n     natural causes. Members of Moscow's independent Prison \n     Oversight Commission, a local watchdog group, described \n     Magnitsky's death as ``intentional'' and ``murder'' and \n     highlighted the role of government officials and prison \n     administrators in his torture. Since the death, a number of \n     prison officials have been fired, but no one has been \n     prosecuted for his torture or death, nor for participating in \n     the corruption he exposed.\n       While there is a limit to the direct action our government \n     can take in this case, we can take the concrete action to \n     ensure those public officials and others who share \n     responsibility for this crime should be denied entry visas to \n     the United States. As you know, the United States has the \n     policy of prohibiting individuals involved in corruption from \n     visiting our country, and the State Department is mandated by \n     the President to achieve this aim. Pursuant to Presidential \n     Proclamation 7750 (``To Suspend Entry as Immigrants or \n     Nonimmigrants of Persons Engaged in or Benefiting From \n     Corruption'' (12 January 2004)).\n       The colleagues of Sergei Magnitsky and his attorneys have \n     provided to the Helsinki Commission a list of those \n     individuals involved in the $230 million tax refund fraud and \n     the subsequent torture and death of Sergei Magnitsky. The \n     list includes senior officials from the Russian Interior \n     Ministry, Federal Security Service, Federal Tax Service, \n     Arbitration Courts, General Prosecutor Office, and Federal \n     Prison Service, along with detailed descriptions of their \n     involvement.\n       On this basis, I urge you to immediately cancel and \n     permanently withdraw the U.S. visa privileges of all those \n     involved in this crime, along with their dependents and \n     family members. Doing so will provide some measure of justice \n     for the late Mr. Magnitsky and his surviving family and will \n     send an important message to corrupt officials in Russia and \n     elsewhere that the U.S. is serious about combating foreign \n     corruption and the harm it does. It will also help to protect \n     U.S. companies operating in Russia who risk falling prey to \n     similar schemes in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Benjamin L. Cardin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 3884. A bill to require the use of electronic on-board recording \ndevices in motor carriers to improve compliance with hours of service \nregulations; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nlegislation with Senator Alexander of Tennessee that I believe will \nhave a dramatic impact on the safety of our Nation's highways and \ninterstates, called the Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act. \nThis bill will require the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, to implement regulations \nrequiring the use of electronic on-board recording devices, EOBRs, for \nmotor carriers in order to improve compliance with Hours-of-Service, \nHOS, regulations. Requiring the use of these technologies in motor \ncarriers will not only improve compliance with HOS regulations, but it \nwill also reduce the number of fatigued commercial motor vehicle \ndrivers on the road. This will have a profound impact on highway safety \nand reduce accidents and fatalities on our highways and interstates.\n  Hours-of-Service regulations place limits on when and how long \ncommercial motor vehicle drivers may drive. These regulations are based \non an exhaustive scientific review and are designed to ensure truck \ndrivers get the necessary rest to drive safely. In developing HOS rules \nthe FMCSA reviewed existing fatigue research and worked with \nnongovernmental organizations like the Transportation Research Board of \nthe National Academies and the National Institute for Occupational \nSafety. HOS regulations are designed to continue the downward trend in \ntruck driving fatalities and maintain motor carrier operational \nefficiencies.\n  Unfortunately, compliance with HOS regulations is often spotty due to \ninaccurate reporting by drivers as they are\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\nonly required to fill out a paper log, a tracking method that dates \nback to the 1930s. Inaccurate reporting may result from an honest \nmistake or an intentional error by a driver seeking to extend his work \nday. These inaccuracies can lead to too much time on the road leaving \nthe driver fatigued and placing other drivers at risk. After listening \nto the many interest groups and experts on this issue in meetings and \nCommerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearings, I have come to \nlearn that there is an available and affordable 21st century technology \nthat can ensure accurate logs, enhance compliance, and reduce the \nnumber of fatigued drivers on the road. They are being used today, and \nthey are producing results. I believe that widespread utilization of \nthese devices as soon as possible will significantly reduce further \nloss of life resulting from driver fatigue.\n  Our legislation will require motor carriers to install in their \ntrucks an electronic device that performs multiple tasks to ensure \ncompliance with HOS regulations. These devices must be engaged to the \ntruck engine control module and capable of identifying the driver \noperating the truck, recording a driver's duty status, and monitoring \nthe location and movement of the vehicle. Requiring electronic log \nbooks that are integrally connected to the vehicle engine as this bill \nrequires will dramatically increase the accuracy of information \nsubmitted for hours of service compliance. Our bill will also require \nthese recording devices to be tamper resistant and fully accessible by \nlaw enforcement personnel and federal safety regulators only for \npurposes of enforcement and compliance reviews.\n\n  While I understand that some drivers may be reluctant to transition \nto electronic logging devices, I strongly believe that the safety \nbenefits of the use of these devices far outweigh the costs. I don't \nwant to see more lives lost due to driver fatigue resulting from log \nbook manipulation. I also believe that with the rapid development of \nelectronic technology, especially in the wireless telecommunications \narea, we will see strong competition among EOBR manufacturers and \nreduced costs for these technologies. In addition, the price of these \nproducts should go down as the demand increases through regulatory \nrequirement to utilize this equipment.\n  In order to protect the privacy of the driver, an issue which I know \nis a major concern among truck drivers, this legislation would \nexplicitly provide privacy protections for use of information beyond \nenforcement and compliance monitoring. Ownership of data is protected \nfor the owner of the vehicle or the person entitled to possession of \nthe vehicle as the lessee.\n  Senator Alexander and I are not alone in calling for this technology \nto be more widely used by commercial vehicles. There are a number of \nSenators, including Senator Lautenberg, who have long been strong \nproponents of implementing the use of this technology. In addition, \nmultiple federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations have \nrecognized the benefits of this technology and called for its \nwidespread use.\n  For example, Mr. Francis France of the Commercial Vehicle Safety \nAlliance witness stated at the April 28, 2010, Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation hearing on Oversight of Motor \nCarrier Safety Efforts that:\n\n       All motor vehicles should be equipped with EOBRs to better \n     comply with Hours of Service laws . . . CVSA has been working \n     with a broad partnership to help provide guidance to achieve \n     uniform performance standards for EOBRs.\n\n  Similarly, the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, \nthe Honorable Deborah Hersman, stated at the same hearing that:\n\n       For the past 30 years, the NTSB has advocated the use of \n     onboard data recorders to increase Hours of Service \n     compliance . . . the NTSB recommended that they be required \n     on all commercial vehicles.\n\n  During the same hearing, Ms. Jacqueline S. Gillan, with the Advocates \nfor Highway and Auto Safety stated that:\n\n       We regard the mandatory, universal installation and use of \n     EOBRs as crucial to stopping the epidemic of hours of service \n     violations that produce fatigued, sleep-deprived commercial \n     drivers . . . at very high risk of serious injury and fatal \n     crashes.\n\n  I have also heard from Administrator Ferro of the FMCSA on her \nthoughts of how EOBRs would enhance compliance and improve highway \nsafety. The FMCSA recently implemented a rule to require that these \ndevices be mandated for truck drivers and trucking companies that have \nbeen found to be noncompliant with FMCSA rules. These rules will be \neffective in June 2012. It is my understanding that they are looking to \nexpand these requirements to include more motor carriers, and I support \nthose efforts as they reflect the qualities and intent of this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, in addition to the support from safety advocates and Federal \ntransportation safety officials, I have also heard from a number of \nArkansas trucking companies currently utilizing this technology. These \ncompanies have experienced reductions in driver fatigue, increases in \ncompliance, and reductions in insurance premiums. The executives of \nthese companies, which include J.B. Hunt and Maverick U.S.A. among \nothers, support the expanded use of these devices to increase \ncompliance, improve highway safety, and level the playing field among \nthe industry. I agree with their views on the importance of widespread \nutilization of this safety and compliance device.\n  The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act, if enacted, will \nrequire the Department of Transportation to issue regulations within 18 \nmonths from enactment to require commercial motor vehicles used in \ninterstate commerce to be equipped with electronic onboard recorders \nfor purposes of improving compliance with hours of service regulations. \nThe regulation will apply to commercial motor carriers, commercial \nmotor vehicles, and vehicle operators subject to both hours of service \nand record of duty status requirements three years after the date of \nenactment of this act. This population represents a vast majority of \ndrivers and carriers who operate trucks weighing 10,001 pounds or more \ninvolved in interstate commerce. It will cover one hundred percent of \nover-the-road, long-haul truck drivers.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the importance of \nthis technology in saving lives on our nation's highways and \ninterstates. I also ask for their support for this legislation and help \nin moving it to the President as quickly as possible. While I \nunderstand our time in the 111th Congress is quickly shrinking as the \nnumber of legislative days are limited, it is my hope that we move this \nlegislation through the Senate no later than the Surface Transportation \nReauthorization legislation that the Senate will take up in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3884\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide incentives for States and local \neducational agencies to implement comprehensive reforms and innovative \nstrategies that are designed to lead to significant improvement in \noutcomes for all students and significant reductions in achievement \ngaps among subgroups of students, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Race to \nthe Top Act of 2010. Congressman Jared Polis is introducing companion \nlegislation in the House today. The Race to the Top Act will authorize \nthe continuation of the highly successful Race to the Top, RTTT, \nprogram which was established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, and expand that program to school districts. RTTT calls for \ncompetitive grants from states and school districts that invest in bold \neducational reforms designed to bring about significant improvement in \nacademic outcomes for all students and significant reductions in \nachievement gaps. Our bill will authorize the act for 2011 and the \nsucceeding 5 years.\n  When No Child Left Behind, NCLB, was signed into law 9 years ago, we \nmade a national commitment to fix our educational system--a system in \nwhich low-income minority students were performing significantly below \ntheir higher-income peers. We made a commitment to bring an end to \nunacceptable achievement gaps and to ensure that each and every child--\nregardless of race, nationality or family income--could succeed in our \npublic schools and graduate with the skills necessary for success in \ncollege or the workforce. Despite the commitments we made, unacceptable \nachievement gaps persist in our country today. Still today our public \nschools are not preparing our students to succeed in college and the \nworkforce. Each year, 30 percent of American students fail to receive \ntheir high school diploma on time, and graduation rates are \nconsistently lower for minority students. One-third of our students who \ndo graduate from high school are not college ready, and in \ninternational standardized tests involving students from 30 nations, \n14-year-olds in the United States rank 25th in mathematics and 21st in \nscience. Improving public education and closing student achievement \ngaps remains one of the most important issues of our time. We have made \nsome progress, but until we have equal and excellent educational \nopportunities for all of our children, regardless of ethnicity or \nincome, we have not done our job. While, in many ways, NCLB moved us in \nthe right direction, it needs to be updated. I believe the time is long \noverdue for Congress to tackle reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which was the underlying law to NCLB, and \ncontinuing the Race to the Top program should be part of this debate.\n  The positive impact of RTTT, in a very short period of time, is \nevident and impressive. We have engaged states, school districts, \nunions, teachers, parents, and students in the mission of a better \neducation for all of our children. RTTT has without a doubt helped to \nfocus the country's attention on school reform.\n  The competition for RTTT money has already had a significant impact \non state and local educational policies across the nation. It has \nincentivized states to implement high, internationally benchmarked, \ncore standards and to create a positive climate for public charter \nschools. RTTT recognizes the essential role teachers play in education \nand has prompted states to get serious about teacher effectiveness, \ndistribution, evaluation, and accountability. And RTTT has prompted \nstates to improve policies aimed at turning around America's lowest \nperforming schools. In sum, RTTT has encouraged states to make real \nprogress towards closing the unacceptable achievement gaps that persist \nand to improve the state of public education for all students.\n\n  Under Race to the Tops: 46 States and DC developed statewide reform \nplans; 15 States changed laws to increase their ability to intervene in \ntheir lowest performing schools; 22 States enacted laws to improve \nteacher quality, including alternative certification, effectiveness and \nevaluation systems; 36 States and DC have adopted high college- and \ncareer-ready standards; 15 States have altered laws or policies to \ncreate or expand the number of charter schools.\n  RTTT is working. We know it is benefiting states that were successful \nin receiving funds but it is also working for states that did not \nreceive funds, simply because those states have already enacted changes \nthat will improve education. Many States remain committed to their new \neducational reforms regardless of their success in achieving RTTT \nfunding. Students in many States will be better off because of the \nimportant policy changes enacted as a result of RTTT. Rarely have we \nwitnessed so much change in educational policy in such a short period \nof time.\n  I know some officials in my home state, Connecticut, were \ndisappointed about not being selected as a RTTT winner. But I do \nbelieve the children in Connecticut were winners because we have \nstrengthened our state laws, policies, and curriculum to lift our \ncharter school caps, improve STEM education,\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\nand strengthen our teacher evaluation process. I commend the state and \nlocal leaders that collaborated in the process. If we continue the RTTT \nprogram, as our bill would do, more States, and now districts, will be \nwinners and we can continue this movement towards important educational \nreform.\n  RTTT has been an effective catalyst for educational reform and has \nencouraged all stakeholders in states to come together and work \ntogether to improve state agendas. It is essential that we keep the \nmomentum of the first two waves of Race to the Top moving forward. \nSince our goal is to make all schools high quality schools, the real \nwinner in the RTTT competition will be the students across America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objecion, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3885\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make improvements to the Fair Debt Collection \nPractices Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, we have big problems in the debt \ncollection industry that are long overdue in being addressed. Before I \neven begin, I wish to preface my remarks by saying when someone takes \nout a loan, they ought to pay it back. I have no intention of making it \neasier for people to skip out on legitimate debts. But we also cannot \nsit idly by as debt collectors prey on good people who have always \ntried to do the right thing.\n  In 1977, by my calculations 33 years ago, Congress passed the Fair \nDebt Collection Practices Act to protect consumers from abusive \npractices by debt collectors. But times have changed and that law needs \nupdating.\n  Congress did not foresee the abuses that would arise as the growing \ndebt collection industry found ways around the intent of the law to \nmake a profit on the backs of hard-working Americans. All around our \ncountry, there are numerous stories of people being taken advantage of \nby unscrupulous debt collectors. The debt collectors do not let the law \nor common decency stop them from doing whatever it takes for them to \nmake a buck.\n  Those abuses include nasty and harassing calls, including the use of \nracial slurs and going after innocent people for debts they do not owe. \nIn my State alone, and you can find similar stories from all over the \ncountry, consumers have been subjected to endless collection attempts \nover debts they do not recognize or debts they do not believe ever \nexisted, debts that have already been paid, debts owed by different \npeople, and debts that have been dramatically inflated.\n  Just this week, I met a man from Minnesota who was repeatedly \nharassed by debt collectors for a debt he did not owe. And in spite of \nthe evidence he provided, it did not stop until he got a lawyer. Debt \ncollectors have time and money on their side, and now some are even \nexploiting scarce law enforcement resources to go after unsuspecting \nMinnesotans. Debt collection firms are preying on people with good \nintentions. But without the time and money to figure out their rights \nand to fight back, this is basically a David and Goliath situation, but \nhere, usually Goliath is the one that wins.\n  For some people, this bad situation spirals into an even worse \nnightmare. The problems in the debt collection industry first came to \nmy attention in June, when my hometown newspaper, the Star Tribune, \nbegan a series on the subject about the story about the Minnesotans who \nhave landed in jail because debt collectors were pursuing them for a \ndebt.\n  One woman who told her story, a Minneapolis resident, spent a full \nday in jail over a $250 credit card debt. During that day she was \ntreated like a criminal, groped by an inmate, and offered drugs by \nanother, and slept in a room with a dozen other women, sharing a toilet \nwith no privacy.\n  Here is what she told the newspaper.\n\n       We hear every day about how there is no money for public \n     services. But it seems like the collectors have found a way \n     to get the police to do their work.\n\n  She is right. These rogue debt collectors are gaming the system and \nusing law enforcement resources for the sole purpose of corporate \nprofit. Then there is the story of a woman from Richfield, MN, a suburb \nsouth of Minneapolis, who was arrested one day recently because she had \ndefaulted on a credit card in 2006. A debt-buying company had bought up \nher old credit card debt and started sending collection notices. But \nshe ignored them because she had never heard of that company. The next \nthing you know, she was stopped on the road and arrested.\n  This harassment and abuse needs to be stopped. That is why Senator \nLeMieux and I are introducing the End Debt Collector Abuse Act, which \nwould forbid debt collectors from seeking the arrest of a consumer in \npursuit of payment. The court can initiate it, just not the debt \ncollector.\n  It would also require the debt collectors to provide consumers with, \nget this, basic information upfront such as an itemization of \nprinciple, fees, and interest that make up the debt, so that consumers \ncan recognize a debt, determine whether the collectors' claim is \naccurate, and exercise their rights.\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\n  This bill will also require the debt collectors provide the name of \nthe original creditor upfront so we can avoid cases such as that women \nfrom Richfield, who received collection notices from a company she had \nnever heard of and, quite reasonably, ignored them. It is just common \nsense to make sure that debt collectors provide this sort of basic \ninformation upfront so these misunderstandings do not happen.\n  In the case a consumer does identify an inaccuracy with a debt claim, \nsome debt collectors currently do little or nothing in terms of \ninvestigating whether the consumer's dispute is correct. For that \nreason, this bill would require the collectors conduct a thorough \ninvestigation when a consumer contacts them about a mistake. The \ncollector would then have to provide the consumer with specific \nevidence about the dispute.\n  Finally, the End Debt Collector Abuse Act would increase the \npenalties for violating consumer rights in order to crack down on the \nrogue debt collectors who have been blatantly and willfully ignoring \ncurrent Federal prohibitions against harassing calls and other abusive \npractices.\n  In this tough economy, Minnesotans are suffering enough right now and \nthey deserve to have the basic protections against abusive debt \ncollective practices. I urge my colleagues to join Senator LeMieux and \nme in supporting this bill so we can stop the abuse and harassment of \nhard-working Americans by rogue debt collection firms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na list of supports be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect students from inappropriate seclusion and \nphysical restraint, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Keeping All \nStudents Safe Act to create a safe environment for students and school \npersonnel by creating minimum standards around the use of seclusion and \nrestraint in schools. In December, I introduced a similar bill. But \ntoday, I come to the floor with my good friend and colleague Senator \nBurr, with a revised act that incorporates additional protections for \nstudents.\n  In 1998, the Hartford Courant ran an award-winning series of stories \nabout the use of seclusion and restraint in hospitals, residential \nfacilities, and group homes for individuals with psychiatric and \ndevelopmental disabilities. The Courant uncovered a hidden epidemic, \nconfirming 142 deaths occurring during or after the use of seclusion or \nrestraint.\n  One of those 142 cases was an 11-year-old boy from my home State of \nConnecticut. He was restrained face-down in a position that restricted \nhis air flow. He died as a result.\n  In response, I led the charge to establish Federal standards to \nprevent the misuse of these practices. I helped pass The Children's \nHealth Act of 2000, which included the Compassionate Care Act that I \noriginally drafted to put these standards in place in certain hospitals \nand residential facilities. We\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\nwanted to include schools in this legislation, but were unable to do \nso. Sadly, the need could not have been greater.\n  Over the past year, reports from the National Disability Rights \nNetwork, NDRN, the Alliance to Prevent Restraint, Aversive \nInterventions, and Seclusion, APRAIS, the Council of Parent Attorneys \nand Advocates, Inc., COPAA, and the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, have painted a picture disturbingly similar to the one the \nHartford Courant discovered more than a decade ago.\n  The statistics are chilling--hundreds of incidents of physical \ninjury, psychological trauma, even death--but the stories are even more \ndevastating.\n  The GAO found many examples of the inappropriate use of seclusion and \nrestraint in the report it released on May 19, 2009.\n  A 14 year-old boy was restrained face-down by a teacher because he \nwould not stay seated in class. The 230 lb. teacher sat on the 129 lb. \nboy, restricting his airflow and resulting in the boy's death.\n  A 4 year-old girl with cerebral palsy and autism was restrained in a \nwooden chair with leather straps for being ``uncooperative.''\n  In one school district, children with disabilities as young as six \nyears old were allegedly placed in strangleholds, restrained for \nextended periods of time, confined to dark rooms, and tethered to ropes \nand prevented from using the restroom until they urinated on \nthemselves.\n  To be clear, school personnel go to work every day with the goal of \neducating children, not harming them. I have the utmost respect and \nappreciation for the difficult job they do and want to make it clear \nthat my concern signifies no disrespect for their challenging jobs, or \nthe dangers they sometimes face.\n  However, these tragic stories reflect inadequate training and a lack \nof resources on the state and local levels to implement effective \ninterventions, such as school-wide positive behavioral interventions \nand supports. According to a report by COPPA, over 71 percent of the \n185 incidents they identified occurred in schools with no positive \nbehavioral interventions or supports. If school personnel are provided \nwith the necessary tools to prevent dangerous situations, the number of \nincidents requiring restraint and seclusion will decrease.\n  Just as students have a right to learn in a safe environment, \neducators have a right to work in a safe environment. They should be \nprovided with the proper training and support to prevent injury to \nthemselves and others.\n  In some states, parents have successfully advocated for laws that \nprovide these resources, as well as guidelines to ensure that they are \nused effectively.\n  But the patchwork of state laws and regulations is confusing and \nespecially troublesome for transient students.\n  According to the GAO study, 19 states have no law or regulations \nconcerning seclusion and restraint in schools. Some laws apply to only \ncertain schools or situations, and some apply to restraint but not \nseclusion. Only 19 states require parental notification, only 17 states \nrequire staff training, and only eight specifically prohibit restraints \nthat restrict air flow.\n  Therefore, Senator Burr and I will today introduce the Keeping All \nStudents Safe Act, a bill that will address these issues.\n  Our bill will establish clear minimum standards for the use of \nrestraint and seclusion in schools, closely based on the Children's \nHealth Act of 2000. It will also provide resources to assist with \npolicy implementation and provide school personnel with necessary \ntools, training, and support.\n  It will improve data collection, analysis, and identification of \neffective practices to prevent and reduce seclusion and restraint in \nschools, so we may better understand the scope of the problem and the \neffectiveness of our solutions.\n  Specifically, the legislation will prohibit the use of seclusion and \nrestraint in schools unless a student's behavior poses an immediate \ndanger of serious physical injury and less restrictive interventions \nwould be ineffective.\n  It will prohibit the use of mechanical, chemical, and physical \nrestraints that restrict air flow to the lungs.\n  This legislation will require adequate training and state \ncertification of school personnel imposing seclusion or restraint, \nimmediate parental notification when such an incident occurs, and a \ndebriefing session to prevent future incidents.\n  As a result of this act, the Department of Education will conduct, \nand provide to Congress, a national assessment that analyzes data on \nseclusion and restraint and determines effective practices in \npreventing and reducing the number of incidents. This assessment will \nprovide us with a more accurate picture of the extent of seclusion and \nrestraint in schools, and will help direct additional future efforts to \nensure that our children and those who educate them are safe.\n  The Keeping All Students Safe Act includes language that solidifies \nProtection and Advocacy agencies', P, abilities to serve the students \nwho are in need of protection. This legislation is meant to ensure that \nthese P are spending their time and resources protecting our \nNation's children in schools, and not in court about this already \nsettled issue.\n  Finally, this legislation will amend the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, as well as the Higher Education Act, to provide \nadditional planning for and training on the use of positive behavioral \ninterventions and supports.\n  I want to thank the many organizations representing individuals with \ndisabilities, students, teachers, and schools that all came to the \ntable with recommendations. Their time, energy, and input made this a \nmuch stronger and more effective bill, and I truly appreciate their \nhard work and support. I am especially thankful for Senator Burr's \ncommitment to this issue and his insights that have strengthened the \nbill. I am also grateful to Secretary Duncan for his leadership on this \nissue at the Department of Education. Finally, I want to thank my \ncolleague and good friend, Chairman George Miller in the House of \nRepresentatives. Earlier this year, he introduced companion legislation \nthat passed the House in March. Senator Burr and I look forward to \nworking with him to pass this into law.\n  Every child has a right to be safe in the place where he or she goes \nto learn and grow. Every educator deserves the training and support he \nor she needs to do his or her job safely and effectively. The Keeping \nAll Students Safe Act will help to prevent tragedies in our schools. I \nam proud to introduce it today, and I urge my colleagues to join me.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GOODWIN:\n  S. 3896. A bill to protect children against hazards associated with \nswallowing button cell batteries by requiring the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to promulgate a consumer product safety standard to \nrequire child-proof closures on remote controls and other consumer \nelectronic products that use such batteries, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. GOODWIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nAccess to Button Cell Batteries Act. This legislation will ensure that \nthe small batteries we find in everything from car keys to musical \ngreeting cards are properly secured, and kept out of the hands of our \nchildren.\n  There is no question that technological progress makes our everyday \nactivities a little easier. Such advancement has allowed for small \nbatteries to be powerful enough to run many of today's devices, \ncreating less bulky products.\n  Unfortunately, with advanced technology comes a new potential hazard. \nMany may not know the possible consequences when a child gets their \nhands on these tiny batteries.\n  Although many of these incidents are relatively harmless, should a \nchild find one of these small button batteries, the consequences can be \nmuch, much worse--even deadly. We have discovered that battery \ningestion has caused 13 deaths and numerous injuries, and from 1985 to \n2009, there was an almost 7-fold increase in the percentage of \ningestions with severe outcomes. This is unacceptable, and it is time \nfor action.\n  Lithium cell batteries, some the size of a penny, are a growing \nconcern. Beyond the choking risk to children, the real issue is what \nhappens when they\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nare swallowed. The batteries can cause internal burns, and lasting \ndamage can occur in just a couple of hours. These injuries can cause \ndeath or lifelong injuries including damaged vocal cords or torn \nintestinal tracts that require surgeries or feeding tubes.\n  The Access to Button Cell Batteries Act would require the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission to initiate a rule requiring that \ncompartments on small battery products be properly secured.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3896\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse under the Medicare, \nMedicaid, and CHIP programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today, I, along with Senators LeMieux, \nDeMint, and Inhofe, am introducing the FAST Act. At the same time, this \nsame bill is being introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Peter Roskam. Both of us were present at the White House \nsummit with the President.\n  What the FAST Act does is attack the $100 billion worth of waste and \nfraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP.\n  In the President's February 22, 2010 proposal for health reform, \nPresident Obama endorsed several Republican proposals designed to \ncombat waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. While some \nanti-fraud provisions were included in the health care overhaul that \npassed Congress, these Republican proposals were not fully included.\n  Today, along with Senators LeMieux, DeMint, and Inhofe, I am \nintroducing the ``Fighting Fraud and Abuse to Save Taxpayers' Dollars'' \nor ``FAST'' Act. An identical bill is also being introduced today in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives by Representative Peter Roskam, who \nalso attended the White House health summit. The FAST Act notionally \nrepresents the Republican solutions the President endorsed to combat \nwaste in Medicare and Medicaid as, as well as a bipartisan provision to \nreduce from by removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards.\n  The status quo in Medicaid and Medicare is unsustainable and \nunacceptable. American taxpayers lose $60 to $100 billion in waste, \nfraud, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid each year. Congress and the \nadministration must do a better job of working to staunch this flow of \ntaxpayer dollars that goes to crooks instead of providing care.\n  The current system was designed to be defrauded. And under the status \nquo today, organized crime affiliates and criminal gangs are bilking \nbillions of taxpayer dollars from Medicare each year because it is so \neasy to defraud the system. HHS' Inspector General told Congress \nrecently that a street gang in California has defrauded Medicare to the \ntune of $11 million by establishing a fake company and billing Medicare \nfor expensive items like wheel chairs and oxygen supplies. The American \npeople ought to be outraged and should not stand for this.\n  Imagine how we could improve Medicare's solvency if we could recoup \ntwo-thirds of the known fraud and abuse in the program each year. We \ncould save $400 billion over a decade, just by preventing fraud.\n  But the loss of taxpayer dollars due to waste and fraud under \nMedicare and Medicaid not only threatens the financial viability of \nprograms, they erode the public trust. American taxpayers should not be \nexpected to tolerate rampant waste, fraud, and abuse in publicly-funded \nhealth care programs.\n  The new Federal health overhaul that Congress passed earlier this \nyear dramatically expands Medicaid, significantly changes Medicare, \ncreates new regulations, and will send hundreds of billions of dollars \nto insurance companies. Without improvements to current anti-fraud \nefforts, taxpayers could be at risk to even more money.\n  Congress and the Administration must do a more effective job in \ncombating waste, fraud, and abuse in public health care programs and \nprotecting the American taxpayer dollars. This bill is not a magic \nbullet, but I believe it offers a common-sense step forward to reduce \nfraud, waste, and abuse in our Nation's largest two health care \nprograms. This bill gives increases data sharing, stiffens penalties, \nand pilots new ways of combating egregious fraud.\n  I sincerely hope politicians and bureaucrats can put the public \ninterest ahead of their own. Congress and the administration cannot \nafford to continue to tolerate such fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. I \nlook forward to working with any member of Congress who is serious \nabout reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in public health care programs.\n  Just think for a minute what would happen to Medicare solvency if, in \nfact, we could recoup two-thirds of the fraud and inappropriate \npayments that are ongoing. It is straightforward. Many of the ideas in \nthis were embraced by the President at our meeting.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will look at this and, in a bipartisan \nfashion, jump on board to fix a problem that is undermining one of our \npossible solutions to health care, which is that the Medicare trust \nfund is belly up.\n  There has been a lot of work done on this by Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate. It is my hope we will have their consent and \ncosponsorship for the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 3901. A bill to promote enforcement of immigration laws and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Strengthening \nOur Commitment to Legal Immigration and America's Security Act. Our \nimmigration system is broken and needs reform. We can make progress by \nstarting with the laws that already exist. My bill would enhance our \ncore immigration and enforcement laws for both legal and illegal \nimmigrants.\n  Much has been discussed this Congress on how to proceed on the very \ncomplex and, unfortunately at times, partisan issue of immigration \nreform. Some have introduced non-binding resolutions others have tried \nto attach\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\nimmigration-related measures to non-germane legislative vehicles. But, \nwe're never going to get anywhere with these political stunts which do \nlittle to get to the root the problem.\n  Throughout my service, I have spent considerable time with my \nconstituents and, quite frankly, have anguished with them on how to \nbest address the considerable strain the illegal alien population is \nhaving on Utahns. Among other things, I have taken the initiative to \nincrease immigration enforcement in Utah include bringing ICE Quick \nResponse teams to our state, creating an immigration court, and \nestablishing an ICE Field Office Director position to address Utah's \nimmigration concerns. I also brought the 287(g) cross-deputizing \nprogram and just recently the Secure Communities program to Utah.\n  There is no question that more needs to be done. That is something \neveryone will agree on. Just recently legislation was enacted to \nenhance border security. I was pleased that this was a bipartisan \neffort. Some argue that the bill is sufficient to secure our border, \nbut I disagree. There is much work to be done before the border is \nproperly sealed. I continue to work with and support my colleagues \nwhose states are located along the Southwest border. They know what \nresources we need to deploy to secure the border.\n  While Utah is not a border state, we still share the same concerns of \nour neighbors along the border. However, our problems result from a \nresidual effect of a porous border and a breakdown of our immigration \nenforcement system.\n  For years, I have been saying most immigration problems could be \nsolved if we would enforce the laws on the books. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent Administration continues to explore ways to exploit current law \nand score political points.\n  During the past several months, the Obama administration has been \nholding behind-the-scenes talks to determine whether the Department of \nHomeland Security can unilaterally grant legal status, on a mass basis, \nto illegal immigrants via deferred action and parole. If the \nAdministration is successful, it would be the equivalent of back-door \namnesty for millions. For this reason, my bill specifies that an alien \nmay only be paroled or granted deferred action on a case-by-case \nbasis--not en mass--the way these laws were intended to be used.\n  The 287(g) and Secure Communities programs continue to be valuable \ntools to our law enforcement officials in detaining and deporting \ncriminal aliens. For example, in Fiscal Year 2010, the 287(g) program \nwas responsible for detaining 29,295 criminal aliens. What I don't \nunderstand is why some cities would choose to not participate in these \neffective programs. That is why my proposed legislation would require \neligible states, counties, or cities to actively participate in the \nSecure Communities or 287(g) programs or forego compensation for \nincarceration expenses. Turning a blind eye to these law enforcement \nprograms poses a serious risk to the public and creates sanctuary \ncities.\n  When I meet with my constituents, one of their top concerns is how we \nfix our visa programs. Many are concerned, and with good cause, about \nhow some of these folks are getting into the country. Disturbingly, \nsome visa holders are active participants in organized crime. They come \nto this country and infiltrate our communities, wreaking havoc in our \nneighborhoods.\n  In an effort to address this problem, my bill would provide our State \nDepartment consular officers the necessary legal authority to deny \nmembers of known gangs from coming into our country. It's not \nacceptable to allow these thugs to slip through the cracks.\n  After 9/11, many areas of our immigration system came under scrutiny. \nOne of the top recommendations for reform to our system is to create an \nexit procedure for foreign visitors to the United States. Departure \ninformation is vital for determining whether foreign visitors are \ndeparting the U.S., maintaining their visa status, and evaluating \nfuture visa eligibility for these visitors. Not to mention, the ability \nto track departures goes to the heart of keeping America safe.\n  Without such exit procedures, however, the task of determining \nwhether an alien has overstayed their visa in the United States is \nnearly impossible. Since 2004, the Department of Homeland Security has \nbeen testing exit programs and departure controls at U.S. airports for \nvisa holders leaving the United States. As recently as July 2009, \nanother pilot program was concluded by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. To date, we still haven't seen any implementation of exit \nprocedures for our country's visitors, nor have we seen any final \nconclusions made by the Department. It has been over 6 years since the \nfirst pilot program concluded. It is time to act.\n  Thus, my bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ncreate a mandatory exit procedure for foreign visitors to the United \nStates. This should have been done years ago.\n  Additionally, the proposed legislation would eliminate the fraud-\nladen visa lottery, known as the Diversity Visa program. At present, \napplicants of the visa lottery program are open to being defrauded by \nso-called service providers who offer to assist them in obtaining \nDiversity Visa status. Unlike other immigrant visa categories, this is \none of the few visas that allows people to immigrate to the United \nStates without having any connection to the country. In other words, \nthe applicants may not have any family, employment, or even provide an \neconomic tie to the United States. And because of limited availability \nof verification, the program presents serious national security \nconcerns.\n  Let me be clear: if anyone is a proponent of a diverse nation, one \nthat enjoys the influence of many cultures, it is me. But what we have \nright now in the visa lottery program does not accomplish the intended \ngoal.\n  After careful consultation with State Department officials, I have \nbeen advised that the Diversity Visa program needs serious reform, and \nsome have even called for complete elimination of the program. In light \nof this guidance, I propose to sunset the Diversity Visa program, \nunless the State Department recommends to Congress how best to combat \nfraud and eliminate abuse currently in the program.\n  One of the most heated issues that is continually raised by my \nconstituents, and many across the country, is the impact that illegal \naliens are having upon our welfare programs. It came to my attention \nthat Los Angeles County, California, actually tracks this information. \nMuch to my amazement, L.A. County confirms that in 2009 alone, they \ndistributed over $2.4 billion in Federal-State welfare and food stamp \nprograms. Of that amount, $569 million was issued to households that \ninclude illegal aliens. Let me reiterate: the illegal alien population \nin L.A. County received over a half-billion dollars of welfare benefits \nin one year alone.\n  In order to have an honest discussion about the drain illegal aliens \nare having upon our welfare systems, we must be armed with state-\nspecific information to understand the extent of this problem.\n  Thus, my bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security and \nany other appropriate Federal agency, to submit an annual report to \nCongress outlining the total dollar amount of Federal welfare benefits \nreceived by households of illegal aliens for each state and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The annual report would also include the overall \ndollar amount each state spends on Federal welfare benefits.\n  Without having this information, we will continue to dismiss the \nserious economic ramifications to our country's prosperity. We cannot \nafford to perpetuate this problem any longer.\n  My legislation also includes a provision which revisits the legal \nimmigrant policy included in the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2009, P.L. 111-3. The CHIP Reauthorization law \noverturned language requiring a 5-year waiting period before legal \nimmigrants may be eligible for federal health coverage. The 5-year \nwaiting period was included in the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, P.L. 104-193. As my colleagues \nwill recall, the 1996 Welfare Reform Act required sponsors of legal \nimmigrants to be responsible for individuals' expenses during the first \n5 years of residency in our country. States had the option of offering \nlegal immigrants CHIP and Medicaid coverage with State only dollars. In \nother words, States could not\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nreceive Federal matching dollars for covering these legal immigrants.\n  The 2009 CHIP law overturned that policy. Today, States may still \ncover legal immigrant children and pregnant women who have been in the \nU.S. less than 5 years. However, the big difference is states now \nreceive Federal matching dollars for covering those individuals.\n  The provision in the bill I am introducing today would permit states \nto continue receiving federal matching dollars for covering legal \nimmigrant children and legal immigrant pregnant women but two \nconditions must be met. First, the state must demonstrate that it has \ncovered 90 percent of its U.S. citizen children and pregnant women \neligible for CHIP or Medicaid. These individuals' family income may not \nexceed 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Second, the State must \ndemonstrate that it is not supplanting state dollars which were being \nused to cover legal immigrants prior to passage of the 2009 CHIP \nreauthorization law with Federal dollars.\n  Another top concern I regularly hear about is identity theft--that of \nboth adults and children who have to spend a great amount of their time \nand money to clear their good names and restore their credit history.\n  In 2006, parents of Utah 2-year old Tyler Lybbert realized their \ndaughter's identity had been stolen by 38-year old Jose Tinoco. By the \ntime the Lybberts became aware of the fraud, Mr. Tinoco had already \ntaken out two loans and opened credit cards--saddling Tyler with over \n$15,000 in debt. Little Tyler was left holding the bag.\n  Fortunately, when Mr. Tinoco tried to obtain a loan from a local Utah \nbank, an employee spotted the discrepancy and alerted Tyler's parents. \nMr. Tinoco was caught, but the Lybberts were left with countless hours \nof work to correct the fraud perpetrated against their child.\n  This past weekend, the Utah press reported on another identity theft \ncase. A newly married radiology student at Weber State University has \nbeen battling to reclaim his identity for the last 15 years. When \nCameron Noble was 7 years old his Social Security number was stolen by \nMr. Jose Zavala of California--an over 60-year-old man.\n  Noble's parents thought they had corrected the error but when Cameron \nbegan working at the age of 16 he started receiving notices that his \nwages were being garnished to pay child support. The problem has \ncontinued to haunt him ever since--in the form of tax withholdings and \ncredit report confusion. He is now nearing the end of the process to \nobtain a new Social Security number.\n  It is not a secret that many in the illegal immigrant community \nperpetuate identity theft with stolen or fabricated Social Security \nnumbers, SSN. The identity theft they commit often affects the very \nyoung--who may not notice problems for years or decades until they are \nold enough to apply for their first job, car or school loan, or credit \ncard.\n  As in little Tyler Lybbert's case, why did it take a bank employee to \npick up on the theft? Because there is no formal system established to \nalert SSN holders when potential fraud or improper usage have occurred.\n  The federal agency that is best suited to track the use of mismatched \nSSN numbers is the Internal Revenue Service, IRS. That is why my bill \nrequires the IRS to send a notice to an employer that an inaccurate SSN \nhas been discovered for an employee. If the employer does not respond \nto the notice within 60-days to correct the inaccuracy, my legislation \nwill require the IRS to notify the SSN holder or to parents and \nguardians of a minor, that a discrepancy has been detected and to do \nthe following: if it is an actual mismatch to contact the IRS; if they \nsuspect fraudulent use, the SSN holder is provided with contact \ninformation for the FTC and various credit bureaus to report the \nproblem; and finally if no response is received by the SSN holder, the \nIRS would be required to refer the account number to appropriate \nFederal agencies for possible investigation.\n  Let me pause here to underscore a point. Currently, the original SSN \nholder never receives notice when a mismatch has occurred. Quite \nfrankly, I do not have the assurances that the IRS is requiring much of \nthe employer to correct or verify the submission. That is not \nacceptable. In this day and age, when at a click of a mouse, someone \ncan apply for credit cards, mortgages, or even car loans, there is no \nexcuse why SSN holders are left in the dark.\n  One can only imagine that if this simple notification step was taken \nin the case of little Tyler Lybbert or the Noble family that years of \nlaborious efforts and countless hours of notifying credit bureaus, \nbanks, and other authorities, could have been greatly reduced if not \navoided all together.\n  To make matters more confusing in this area of the law, the Supreme \nCourt has more or less tied the hands of prosecutors in going after \nthese thieves and those who are involved in so-called document mills. \nThe case of Flores-Figueroa v. United States undermined prosecutors' \nlongstanding practice of using the aggravated identity theft statute by \nrequiring them to also prove that a defendant knew that he or she was \nusing a real person's identity information, as opposed to counterfeit \ninformation not connected to an actual person.\n  To clarify the Criminal Code and provide our prosecutors with the \nlatitude they need to pursue these cases, my bill makes clear that \ndefendants who possess or otherwise use identity information not their \nown, without lawful authority, and in the commission of another felony \nis still punishable for aggravated identity fraud, regardless of the \ndefendants' ``knowledge'' of the victim.\n  Finally, my bill's identity theft would require the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the Chairman of the FTC, and the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity to conduct a study to determine the most feasible and cost-\neffective ways to protect the credit worthiness of individuals, \nespecially that of children.\n  Mexican Cartel drug violence has been placed front and center by the \nmedia and members of this body. Some of my fellow colleagues have \ncalled for more resources directed to this problem. As additional \nfederal law enforcement personnel and military units continue to be \ndeployed to the southwest border the focus has been on weapons, drug \ninterdiction and bulk cash smuggling. While I recognize the importance \nof these border enforcement activities, too little attention is being \npaid to outdoor marijuana cultivation by Mexican drug trafficking \norganizations.\n  Outdoor marijuana cultivation by Mexican drug trafficking \norganizations is causing increasing environmental damage, especially on \npublicly owned lands. From 2004-2009 more than 11 million marijuana \nplants have been eradicated from federal public lands. Outdoor \nmarijuana cultivation is the chief source of revenue for Mexican drug \ntrafficking organizations.\n  Growing marijuana in the U.S. saves traffickers the risk and expense \nof smuggling their product across the border and allows gangs to \nproduce their crops closer to local markets. Illegal alien workers are \nsmuggled in from Mexico to serve as laborers and provide security to \nthe grow plots. Mexican gang plots can often be distinguished from \nthose of domestic-based growers based on their plant volume and \nsecurity measures. Many of the plots are encircled with crude \nexplosives and are patrolled by armed illegal aliens providing security \nfor the crop.\n  In my home State of Utah, the Drug Enforcement Administration and \nlocal law enforcement have seized more than 110,000 marijuana plants \nthis year. Each plant can yield one pound of marijuana with a street \nvalue of $1,000. These remote plots were on federal land and nestled \nunder the cover in a national forest or hidden high in the rugged-yet-\nfertile tracts of federal land. All of the sites were far from the eyes \nof law enforcement, where growers can take the time needed to grow far \nmore potent marijuana. Growers of these fields have even created \nirrigation systems to disrupt or divert water sources. They even use \nillegal fertilizers that damage the environment and the local eco-\nsystem.\n  In one recent incident in Garfield County, Utah an illegal alien grow \nworker was armed with a shotgun and confronted six teenage girls who \ninadvertently hiked into the marijuana field. The worker brandished a \nshotgun and demanded to use their cell phone. Fortunately, the group of \ngirls were able to run away from this armed man\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\nand prevented what could have been a very tragic outcome. The girls \nwere quite traumatized and reported the incident to local police. The \nDrug Enforcement Administration and the local authorities apprehended \nthe man a short time later.\n  So far this year in Utah, as a result of joint investigative efforts \nbetween Federal, State and local law enforcement, 20 arrests have been \nmade in connection with the outdoor cultivation of marijuana on Federal \nlands. Out of the 20 arrests made, 19 were illegal aliens. This is not \na problem that is unique to Utah. Other States with substantial federal \nlands are also seeing a spike in marijuana cultivation by Mexican drug \ntrafficking organizations, including Colorado, California, Idaho, \nNevada, Oregon and Michigan.\n  It is for this reason why my legislation would provide tougher \npenalties for cultivating marijuana on federal lands and destroying the \nenvironment. Provisions of this legislation would also require the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy to formulate a comprehensive and \ncoordinated action plan to address marijuana cultivation on Federal \nlands. This plan will be a broad strategic approach to disrupt Mexican \ndrug trafficking organizations' central source of revenue and a key \nreason for organized alien smuggling.\n  The fight to control the border is no longer isolated to just the \nphysical boundary between the United States and Mexico. Securing the \nborder now means addressing Mexican cartels; prohibiting mass deferral \nor parole; streamlining the visa process; requiring participation in \nkey law enforcement programs; clamping down on identity theft; tracking \nthe amount of welfare benefits being diverted by illegal immigrant \nhouseholds; ensuring that dollars are being used to cover newly \neligible American children in CHIP and Medicaid; and keeping our great \nnational parks and Federal lands safe and free from drug traffickers, \ndrug cultivation, and environmental damage.\n  Let me conclude by saying this bill represents key issues that are \nimportant to my Utah constituents and Americans across the country. \nThey are common sense solutions to strengthen our commitment to legal \nimmigration and American's security. I urge my colleagues to put \npartisanship aside and support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3901\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce preterm labor and delivery and the risk of \npregnancy-related deaths and complications due to pregnancy, and to \nreduce infant mortality caused by prematurity; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to once again \npartner with my good friend and colleague Senator Dodd to introduce the \nPrematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver \nInfants Early Act, or the PREEMIE Act. This bipartisan bill \nreauthorizes and expands upon the 2006 PREEMIE Act to enhance research \ninto the causes and prevention of prematurity. The end result of this \nbill will hopefully be to find a solution to the serious problem of \npremature birth.\n  Premature birth is the leading killer of newborns and a major cause \nof lasting disabilities, and finding answers to this problem is one of \nthe most urgent challenges confronting medicine today. More than half a \nmillion babies are born prematurely in the United States each year, and \nin nearly half the cases the causes are unknown. In Tennessee 236 \nbabies are born preterm per week on average, and in 2007, 12,256 babies \nor 14.2 percent of all live births were premature.\n  The emotional toll a premature birth has on a family is significant. \nWhen an infant arrives prematurely before 37 weeks gestation, the \nfamily faces a stressful new world. Often, the parents see the baby \nonly momentarily before he or she is whisked away to the neonatal \nintensive care unit, NICU. Instead of taking home a healthy baby, \nparents spend hours in the hospital, talking to all kinds of \nspecialists who use clinical terms that they don't always understand. \nThe baby's medical equipment is frightening, and the busy, hectic \natmosphere in the NICU is stressful. Often the mother, who may have \nsuffered from her own serious medical complications, recovers and \nleaves the hospital before the baby does.\n  Many preterm infants face life-threatening complications. Families \nwith premature infants often refer to the NICU as a roller-coaster \nexperience. One day the baby appears to be doing well; the next, hope \nseems to be lost. Day-to-day life is completely disrupted. Parents \nspend hours in the NICU, away from their other children and work. The \naverage hospital stay in 2005 was nearly nine times as long for a \npreterm infant (13 days) compared to an infant born at term (1.5 days).\n  Families face financial stress as they struggle to pay the high NICU \ncosts, since the average first year medical costs were about 10 times \ngreater for preterm, $32,325, than for term infants, $3,325, in 2005. \nAdditionally, 4 out of the 10 most expensive hospital stays regardless \nof age are related to infant care: infant respiratory distress \nsyndrome, prematurity/low birthweight, cardiac/circulatory birth \ndefects, and lack of oxygen in infants.\n  Advances in neonatology are saving even the smallest and most fragile \nnewborns, but we need to prevent those births from happening too early \nin the first place. We now find ourselves facing enormous potential for \nprogress, and technological innovation has made sequencing of the \nentire human genome possible, which will hasten the pace of discovery \nand application of new knowledge. Hopefully, research moves ahead to \nunravel the mysteries of premature birth and to find the answers that \nwill save babies' lives. However, the private sector cannot accomplish \nthis goal alone, which is why we need dedicated federal resources to \nsupport such efforts.\n  If we invest the money now and conduct additional research \ninvestigating the root causes of prematurity, it will save the \nGovernment money over time, and parents will not have to fear for their \nnew child's life from the moment of birth. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to join me and support the PREEMIE Act--an investment in \ninfants' health.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very serious issue \nthat affects many Americans, and that is premature births. More than \nhalf a million babies will be born preterm this year and approximately \n28,000 babies will die before they turn 1 year old.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, there were more than 4,000 preterm \nbirths in 2007, representing approximately 11 percent of all live \nbirths in the State. Between 1997 and 2007, the rate of infants born \npreterm in Connecticut increased 3 percent.\n  The incidence of preterm birth represents a huge disconnect between \nour scientific knowledge and our capacity to meet basic and critical \nneeds in maternal-child health. According to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC, babies who died from preterm birth-related \ncauses accounted for more than 36 percent of infant deaths in 2006. For \nnewborns, prematurity is the leading cause of death.\n  Of the surviving preemies, approximately one-fourth will have serious \nhealth complications including hearing loss, cerebral palsy, \nintellectual disabilities, acute respiratory diseases, and other \nmaladies. These health problems not only affect the child, but also \nplace a financial and emotional burden on many families. According to \nthe Institute of Medicine, the annual societal costs associated with \npreterm birth were $26.2 billion in 2005 or $51,600 per infant born \npreterm. Nearly two-thirds of this cost was for medical care. More \nimportantly, the $26.2 billion estimate does not include the cost of \nmedical care beyond early childhood or caretaker costs such as lost \nwages.\n  In nearly half of all cases, physicians and scientists cannot \npinpoint a cause for preterm labor and delivery. However, research has \nshown that causes of preterm birth may include neighborhood \ncharacteristics, environmental exposures, biological factors, and \nmedical conditions. Many of these factors can occur in combination, \nparticularly for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and \nminority groups. Accordingly, there are significant disparities in the \nrates of preterm birth across these groups, with the highest rate of \npreterm births for non-Hispanic African Americans at 17.5 percent in \n2008, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. It is \nclear that a greater commitment to eliminating these inequalities is \nneeded. As the chairman of the U.S. Senate's Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions' Subcommittee on Children and Families, ensuring the \nhealth of America's children has been my life's work, making the \ncorrection of these inequalities an issue of great importance.\n  In 2006, my colleague Senator Alexander and I worked to pass the \nPrematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver \nInfants Early Act or PREEMIE Act, Public Law 109-450, which authorized \nfinding to enhance Federal research related to preterm labor and \ndelivery and increased public and provider education and support \nservices. Among the results of the PREEMIE Act were the 2008 Surgeon \nGeneral's Conference on Preterm Birth and expanded research activities \nat CDC. The most notable accomplishment to date is a 3 percent decline \nin the preterm birth rate from 2007 to 2008. But there is still much \nwork to be done. We must build on the progress recently achieved and \nuse both public and private efforts to accelerate this decrease in the \nrate of preterm birth.\n  For these reasons, I rise today to join my colleague from Tennessee \nto introduce the PREEMIE Act to reauthorize these vital activities. It \nis my hope that this legislation will complement many of the efforts \nbeing conducted by the private sector, such as the March of Dimes \ncampaign to raise public awareness and reduce the rate of preterm \nbirths. I urge my colleagues to join me in promoting a healthy start \nfor America's children by supporting this legislation.\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Brown of Ohio):\n  S. 3907. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to increase \naccess to health care for individuals with disabilities and increase \nawareness of the need for health care facilities and examination rooms \nto be accessible for individuals with disabilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as a co-chair of the Congressional Spina \nBifida Caucus, I rise today to introduce the Debbie Blanchard Access to \nHealth Care for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 2010 with my \ncolleague, Senator Sherrod Brown. This legislation provides an \nexcellent opportunity to address a critical disparity that exists in \nour Nation's health care system.\n  Individuals with disabilities can face a myriad of challenges in \naccessing the health care they need and deserve. Such was the case for \nDebbie Blanchard, a woman who lived with Spina Bifida for nearly 56 \nyears, and who passed away in August 2008 from cervical cancer. Due to \nthe challenges she faced in finding a physician whose office and \nexamination tables were accessible for individuals with disabilities, \nDebbie was not able to seek regular well-woman exams, including \ncervical cancer screenings. The barriers Debbie faced in physically \naccessing the regular preventive care she needed unfortunately \ncontributed to her cervical cancer going undetected until it was too \nlate. The lack of accessible care clearly contributed to her untimely \ndeath.\n  The Spina Bifida community is devastated by Debbie Blanchard's tragic \npassing, and we in the Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus wish to help \nensure that the challenges and barriers that contributed to her illness \nand death are eliminated. To that end, we have developed the Debbie \nBlanchard Access to Health Care for Individuals with Disabilities Act \nin an effort to help facilitate access to health care by individuals \nwith disabilities, including, but not limited to, those with Spina \nBifida, and help them to identify providers whose offices and \nexamination rooms are accessible for individuals with disabilities.\n  Before I discuss the details of this bill, I believe it is important \nto recognize the scope of the problem we are dealing with. According to \nthe U.S. Census, more than 54 million Americans, about one out of every \nfive, live with some level of disability. Approximately 34 million of \nthose are classified as having a severe disability. In Connecticut, \nmore than 540,000 individuals are living with some level of disability. \nOf those individuals, close to 22,000 have physical disabilities.\n  Studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nhave found that individuals with disabilities have difficulty in \naccessing routine and specialized health care. Numerous barriers exist \nfor these patients, including the inability to find a health care \nprovider who understands how to treat individuals with disabilities and \nis willing to have those individuals as patients. According to a survey \ncommissioned by the National Organization on Disability, 19 percent of \npersons with disabilities reported they needed medical care within the \nprevious year and did not get it. This is a number more than three \ntimes the percentage for those without disabilities.\n  Women with disabilities are particularly vulnerable. A study by the \nCenter for Research on Women with Disabilities showed that nearly one-\nthird of women with disabilities surveyed reported being denied \nservices at a physician's office solely because of their disability, \nand 56 percent described their physicians' offices and hospitals as \nill-prepared to accommodate their specific needs. Research by the \nNational Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research shows that \nwomen with disabilities are less likely to have Pap smears and \nmammograms and are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage of \nbreast cancer. These women are less likely to receive standard \ntreatments and more likely to have poor outcomes.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, PL 111-l48, includes \nan important component to establish standards for medical diagnostic \nequipment such as examination tables and chairs to improve access to \nhealth care for individuals with disabilities and I applaud Senator \nHarkin for his leadership on that provision. As such, the legislation I \npropose today seeks to complement existing programs and other pending \nproposals. The Debbie Blanchard Access to Health Care for Individuals \nwith Disabilities Act would empower individuals with disabilities with \nthe information and tools they need to identify accessible providers. \nIt would also increase awareness among health professionals of the need \nto provide an accessible environment. The bill provides for four key \nprograms to achieve these goals.\n  First, this bill authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services to provide formula-based grants to States to create \non-line directories of health care providers accessible to individuals \nwith disabilities. States would not be required to engage in this \nactivity, and the grants are strictly voluntary.\n  Second, it authorizes HHS to develop a pilot program to increase \nhealth care provider awareness of the need to provide accessible \nenvironments, examination rooms, and examination tables for individuals \nwith disabilities.\n  Third, it authorizes the HHS Office on Disability, with the help of \nnational organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to \ndevelop resources to support individuals with disabilities in their \nefforts to find accessible providers. Such resources include ``tips \ncards'' and questions to ask when calling a provider for the first time \nto make an appointment.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes HHS to create a National Advisory \nCommittee on Access to Health Care for Individuals with Disabilities to \nensure intra-agency coordination of efforts to improve access to care \nfor individuals with disabilities.\n  The Debbie Blanchard Access to Health Care for Individuals with \nDisabilities Act would be a significant step in ensuring health care \nequity for the more than 50 million Americans who live with a \ndisability. Debbie Blanchard's tragic passing should serve as a lesson \non the barriers that exist for individuals with disabilities in \naccessing basic quality health care. We should take action to ensure \nthat these barriers are eliminated to prevent Debbie's story from being \nrepeated. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 3908. A bill to ensure that private property, public safety, and \nhuman life are protected from flood hazards that directly result from \npost-fire watershed conditions that are created by wildfires on Federal \nland; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould assist several communities in northern Arizona, and any other \ncommunity in the United States, whose homes were damaged or destroyed \nin flash flood event caused by wildfires on federal lands. I am \nsaddened to report that the flood in Arizona which is the genesis of \nthis bill also killed a 12-year-old girl and caused an estimated $8 \nmillion in damage to the area's public infrastructure. While the flood \nitself occurred on July 20, 2010, the true account of this disaster \nactually began one month prior with a wildfire on the Coconino National \nForest. The human-caused ``Schultz Fire'' severely burned 15,000 acres \nof forest land along the steep terrain of the San Francisco Peaks \nleaving little ground vegetation to absorb and hold back rainwater. \nAfter the fire was contained, the U.S. Forest Service quickly \ndetermined that residents living near the base of the Peaks would face \na daily flooding threat from summer monsoon storms and publically urged \nthem to purchase flood insurance. Less than two weeks later, a monsoon \nstorm created a flash flood of rainwater, mud and wildfire debris that \nslammed into the homes below the Schultz burn area. Tragically, the \naffected homeowners who had purchased flood insurance as soon as they \nwere alerted to the danger of flooding were deemed ineligible for \ncoverage because Federal law mandates a 30-day waiting period before \nthe policy takes effect.\n  This August I had an opportunity to tour the Schultz Fire burn and \nflood areas and also met with several affected homeowners. Needless to \nsay they are deeply concerned that their homes remain threatened with \nevery severe storm that passes through. This rural unincorporated \ncommunity simply does not have the resources to cope\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\nwith a flood plain that didn't exist before the wildfire. While we were \nable to get a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers team to study and recommend \nsome interim and long-term flood mitigation measures, much work remains \nto be done including additional soil and hydrological data collection \nwhich would assist in the planning and design of more permanent flood \ncontrol projects.\n  This legislation would enable the FEMA Administrator to waive the 30-\nday waiting period for flood insurance for private property owners \naffected by wildfires. This bill would also clarify that the recently \ncreated FLAME Act Accounts, which were established by Congress to pay \nfor wildfire supersession, can also be used for burn area recovery, \nincluding post-fire watershed flood prevention. With respect to the \nSchultz Fire, the bill would enhance coordination between the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other \nFederal, State and local government agencies by establishing a Schultz \nFire Flood Area Task Force headed by the Administrator of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. This bill would also direct FEMA to \ncomplete a detailed study of the affected area to evaluate the \npotential of integrating various federal projects and programs into a \nlong-term flood protection system. Finally, this bill would require \nthat the Attorney General disclose any payments made under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act program that went to activist litigants who \nblocked the forest thinning project that many experts agree would have \nprevented the Schultz Fire from occurring.\n  The flood risk to this community will remain high for many years \nunless action is taken now. I strongly believe that because the Schultz \nFire occurred on Federal land, the Federal Government is obligated to \nprovide an appropriate level of disaster assistance, including Federal \nflood insurance, to these homeowners. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Burris, Mr. Reed, \n        Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mr. Begich, Mr. Levin, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 3914. A bill to amend title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to require the Secretary of Education to complete \npayments under such title to local educational agencies eligible for \npayments within 3 fiscal years; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I congratulate Child Care Resources of \nKing County for 20 years of service to the community. This organization \nis a leader in King County and occupies a critical role for children \nand families within the community. Through promoting equity for all \nchildren, establishing community stability, and helping children \nprepare for school, Child Care Resources of King County has impacted \nand helped shape the lives of many Washingtonians.\n  As a former preschool teacher, on the first day of class it was easy \nto identify which students had participated in high-quality child care \nbefore entering my classroom. We know that children who participate in \nhigh-quality care are better prepared for school and more likely to \nlead a successful life. Child Care Resources of King County has worked \ntirelessly for 20 years to ensure children in King County have access \nto high-quality care and enter school well prepared. Additionally, they \nwork to incorporate culturally relevant care that reflects a child's \nculture and language which builds positive self identity and improves \nschool readiness.\n  I believe strongly in the Child Care Resources of King County and \ntheir mission. Congratulations to them on a job well done and I wish \nthem twenty more years of continued success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3914\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TIMELY PAYMENTS.\n\n       Section 8010 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7710) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Timely Payments.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     shall pay a local educational agency the full amount that the \n     agency is eligible to receive under this title for a fiscal \n     year not later than September 30 of the second fiscal year \n     following the fiscal year for which such amount has been \n     appropriated if, not later than 1 calendar year following the \n     fiscal year in which such amount has been appropriated, such \n     local educational agency submits to the Secretary all the \n     data and information necessary for the Secretary to pay the \n     full amount that the agency is eligible to receive under this \n     title for such fiscal year.\n       ``(2) Payments with respect to fiscal years in which \n     insufficient funds are appropriated.--For a fiscal year in \n     which the amount appropriated under section 8014 is \n     insufficient to pay the full amount a local educational \n     agency is eligible to receive under this title, paragraph (1) \n     shall be applied by substituting `is available to pay the \n     agency' for `the agency is eligible to receive' each place it \n     appears.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 3916. A bill to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \nstudy and report on the impact on consumers of permitting an increase \nin the amount of ethanol blended with gasoline for use in gasoline-\npowered engines used in vehicles operated in interstate commerce, on \npublic streets and roads, or offroad, appliances such as lawn mowers \nand other nonvehicular devices, and marine engines, and to require the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration to study and report on \nany safety or reliability impact of such an increase on motor vehicle \nengines and fuel systems; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will protect our nation's consumers from adverse impacts that \ncould result from a potential government mandate to increase the \ncurrent percentage of ethanol which is blended with gasoline. \nSignificant questions and concerns exist as to the effects of \nincreasing the current blend percentage of ethanol into gasoline above \nits current level of 10 percentage for motor vehicles, equipment and \nengines. If the United States Government is going to require an \nincrease of the ethanol blend, I believe it is necessary to conduct \nextensive studies to ensure no Americans are injured or suffer any \neconomic damages as a result of that decision.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will require the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission to conduct a study of the potential impact \nconsumers may face by increasing the amount of ethanol blended with \ngasoline or other petroleum products used for internal combustion \nengines. This study would examine how the higher blend would impact \nconsumers in different regions of the country through interstate \ncommerce, whether the cost increase is associated with the higher blend \nrate and most importantly, whether a higher blend of gasoline and \nethanol poses danger to consumers' well being.\n  Additionally, my legislation would require the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration to conduct a study to determine whether \nthe use of ethanol-gasoline blends of more than 10 percent will have an \nadverse impact on tailpipe emissions, exhaust temperatures, catalytic \nconverters and motor engine performance.\n  I believe it is irresponsible for the United States Government to \nrequire an untested mandate, such an increase in the percentage of \nethanol mixed with gasoline, without all tests having been performed to \nguarantee there are no detrimental consequences on any American. It is \ncommon sense for all of the science to be revealed before such an \nimportant decision is made, and that is what my legislation will do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Risch, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Enzi, and \n        Mr. Barrasso):\n  S. 3919. A bill to remove the gray wolf from the list of threatened \nspecies or the list of endangered species published under the \nEndangered Species Act of 1973, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 3919, an act \nto remove Endangered Species Act, ESA,\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\nprotections for gray wolves. Delisting of this species is long overdue.\n  Gray wolves are listed as endangered under the ESA in the United \nStates, except in Minnesota where they are listed as threatened. The \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed ESA protection from these wolves \nin 2009, but subsequently reinstated protection under a court decision \nfollowing a lawsuit.\n  Legislative action is the only solution to stop the endless cycle of \nlitigation and return the sovereign ability of states to manage their \nwildlife. Gray wolves are the iconic species of the ESA. But we cannot \nlet the preconceived and inaccurate perceptions surrounding this animal \nprevent us from doing our due diligence in providing protections and \nsafeguards for other species including elk, deer, moose, and big horn \nsheep. With a population growth rate of 24 percent, gray wolf \noverpopulation is now doing significant damage to wildlife populations \nthroughout the West and Midwest.\n  Gray wolf predation is erasing decades of effort and hundreds of \nmillions invested in rebuilding healthy big game populations. Wolves do \nnot know or care where recovery plan lines are drawn. They will roam \nwherever necessary to find adequate food and habitat. Research \nindicates that wolf and ungulate populations are generally inversely \nproportional and cyclical over relatively long periods of time.\n  Ill-advised experimentation and anti-management philosophy continues \nto be pushed by extreme animal rights and anti-sportsmen special \ninterest groups. This war on the west threatens big game herds, \nproactive State wildlife management, use of renewable wildlife \nresources, and the western way of life. This bill, while viewed with \nsuspicion and opposed with philosophical arguments by some \nenvironmental organizations, ensures that delicate wildlife populations \nare restored to healthy levels.\n  When Congress passed the ESA, it envisioned legislation to make \ncertain that species would not become extinct. The key to success of \nthe new law was finding a way to conserve and protect species truly in \ndanger of becoming extinct. The gray wolf is not endangered as a \nspecies. There are thousands alive and well in North America. The ESA \nhas become a vehicle by which some organizations and individuals seek \nto halt all activities on our public lands which they happen to oppose. \nI would submit to you that such use of the ESA was not envisioned nor \nwould it have been condoned by a majority of those who originally \ncrafted the law.\n  Some groups want to use the gray wolf as a surrogate for other \nagendas. Others have used it to raise a lot of money from citizens of \nthis country truly concerned about the place of the wolf in our \nenvironment. Still others have used it for political purposes. What a \nshame that the laws of this great Nation can be subverted for purposes \nother than the reason the law was originally written.\n  The gray wolf has been protected by the ESA since 1973, the year the \nESA was passed. The single exception to that classification is in the \nState of Minnesota where they are classified as threatened. The \noriginal recovery plan for the gray wolf in the Northern Rockies was \nwritten in 1974. The main States involved are owned largely by the \nFederal Government. Thirty percent of Montana, 50 percent of Wyoming, \nand 64 percent of Idaho is federally owned. Access to and use of the \npublic lands and resources on them has a great deal to do with the \neconomy of these sparsely populated States. When the economy suffers, \nso do these communities and these people.\n  The working men and women of our States have no alternative but to \nrely on continued access to and the use of grass, water, timber, and \nminerals from public lands to support their families. Those working \npeople have mortgages to pay just like you and I; they have bills that \nare due each month; and they want to be able to feed and clothe their \nchildren just as you and I do.\n  We must recognize the legitimate concerns of the hundreds of honest, \nhardworking citizens who are being directly affected by the continued \nlisting of the gray wolf on the ESA. In my opinion, we have a \nresponsibility to protect their right to make an honest living and to \nlive the lifestyle they have chosen.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this attempt to resolve this \nimportant issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 3922. A bill to underscore the importance of international nuclear \nsafety cooperation for operating power reactors, encouraging the \nefforts of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, supporting progress in \nimproving nuclear safety, and enhancing the public availability of \nnuclear safety information; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Furthering \nInternational Nuclear Safety Act of 2010. This bipartisan legislation, \nwhich is cosponsored by Senators Carper and Voinovich, will enhance the \nimplementation of the Convention on Nuclear Safety by taking a more \nsystematic approach to improving civilian nuclear power safety.\n  The Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986 was the worst nuclear power \naccident in history and made clear the need for international nuclear \nsafety norms. According to a report commissioned by United Nations \nagencies, millions of people were exposed to high doses of radiation \nand approximately 350,000 people were displaced from their homes. On \ntop of this, the countries most directly impacted by the disaster were \nestimated to have suffered economic damages on the order of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, while thousands of square miles of agricultural \nand forest lands were removed from service.\n  In the aftermath of this accident, over 50 countries, led by the \nUnited States, worked together to develop the Convention on Nuclear \nSafety. This convention was formally established in 1994, and the \nUnited States joined in 1999. Through the cooperative nature of the \nconvention, which relies on peer-reviewed national reports and the \nsharing of best practices, countries that are party to the treaty have \nbeen able to improve their nuclear safety.\n  Although civilian nuclear power programs have become safer, we must \nnot be complacent. As history has shown, a nuclear accident in one \ncountry can have devastating effects across several countries. \nCurrently there are over 400 civilian nuclear power reactors operating \nin 29 countries around the world, and at least 56 more are under \nconstruction. Countries such as Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, \nIndonesia, Libya, Thailand, and Vietnam are interested in starting \ncivilian nuclear power programs. The construction of new nuclear power \nfacilities, along with an increasing number of countries readying to \nbuild nuclear power plants, should be accompanied by greater attention \nto nuclear safety.\n  Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \ncompleted a review of the Convention in which GAO obtained the views of \n40 parties to the Convention, while carefully protecting individual \nrespondent information. GAO found that the Convention has been very \nsuccessful in improving nuclear safety, but made recommendations to the \nUnited States Government that would enhance the Convention's \neffectiveness.\n  The bill I am introducing today will implement GAO's recommendations \nand additional steps to improve safety. This bill requires the United \nStates delegate to the Convention to take certain actions to enhance \ninternational nuclear safety. This includes the United States \nadvocating that parties to the Convention more systematically assess \ntheir own progress in improving nuclear safety through the broader use \nof performance metrics. Additionally, to increase access to information \nabout nuclear safety and implementation of the Convention, the delegate \nto the Convention will encourage parties to post their annual reports \nand answers to questions from other parties on the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency's, IAEA, public website. IAEA will be encouraged to offer \nadditional support, such as providing assistance as needed for the \nproduction of parties' national reports; support for Convention \nmeetings, including language translation services; and providing \nadditional technical support to improve civilian nuclear power program \nsafety. Further, the United States delegate will encourage all \ncountries that have or are considering establishing a civilian nuclear \npower program to join the Convention. Finally, this bill calls for the \nSecretary of State to lead the development\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\nof a United States Government strategic plan for international nuclear \nsafety cooperation for operating power reactors, and to report on the \nplan's implementation and the progress on implementing this bill.\n  International nuclear safety deserves our Nation's ongoing attention. \nAs we approach the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, we \nshould be mindful that the use and expansion of nuclear power needs to \nbe combined with supreme vigilance and concern for safety.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nimprove the energy efficiency of, and standards applicable to, certain \nappliances and equipment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources has worked diligently throughout this Congress to develop \nlegislation that would strengthen our nation's energy security. In July \nof last year, on a strong bipartisan vote, the Committee reported the \nAmerican Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, ACELA, and this past May, \nagain with bipartisan votes, the Committee reported several amendments \nthat would enhance ACELA. I know that other committees also have \nreported energy legislation, with the expectation that all of this work \nwould be combined into a single bill that the full Senate could \nconsider.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has, so far, not been able to find a \ncombination of these energy policy proposals that it can move. This \nsituation is particularly unfortunate because many of the provisions \ncaught in this energy policy grid-lock have no known opposition.\n  There is no rational reason why the Senate should not pass \nlegislation which would save our nation energy, strengthen our economy, \nsave Americans money, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and to which \nthere is no known opposition, should not be passed by the Senate.\n  In an effort to bypass this grid-lock, I am pleased to introduce a \nbill which packages many of these consensus elements. The \nImplementation of National Consensus Appliance Agreements Act, INCAAA, \nconsolidates all of the consensual legislative provisions regarding the \nDepartment of Energy's appliance and consumer product energy efficiency \nprogram that the Energy Committee has reported, along with four more-\nrecent agreements, into one bill.\n  The DOE appliance standards program is one of the most powerful tools \nthat our Nation has to reduce energy demand. It is a mature, broadly-\nsupported program which has been estimated to have reduced the nation's \nelectricity demand by about 10 percent.\n  The enactment of INCAAA would strengthen this program by \nestablishing, or increasing, energy efficiency standards for several \nclasses of products. Such new or improved standards have been agreed to \nby the manufacturers of these products as well by as the Nation's \nleading energy efficiency advocacy groups such as the American Council \nfor an Energy Efficient Economy, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the \nNatural Resources Defense Council. INCAAA includes new efficiency \nstandards for outdoor lighting, supported by the National Electrical \nManufacturing Association and major lighting manufacturers such as \nGeneral Electric, Osram Sylvania, Philips, and Acuity Brands.\n  It includes increased efficiency standards for furnaces, heat pumps, \nand central air conditioners, supported by the Air-Conditioning, \nHeating and Refrigeration Institute and its dozens of members, \nincluding Carrier, Johnson Controls, Rheem and Trane.\n  It includes new efficiency standards for portable lamps, supported by \nthe American Lighting Association.\n  It includes increased energy and water efficiency standards for \nrefrigerators and freezers, clothes washers and dryers, dishwashers, \nand room air-conditioners as supported by the Association of Home \nAppliance Manufacturers and its many members, including Electrolux, \nGeneral Electric, Panasonic, and Whirlpool.\n  INCAAA also includes consensus standards and legislation reported by \nthe Energy Committee covering smaller classes of products such as \ndrinking\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\nwater dispensers, hot food holding cabinets, and electric spas. \nFinally, this bill strengthens DOE's operation and administration of \nthe appliance standards programs to include accelerated rulemaking and \nupdated decisionmaking criteria to include new developments such as \nemerging smart-grid technologies. It is important to note that the bill \nrequires no new authorizations or spending. These changes would be \nintegrated into and administered by the existing DOE program.\n  The American Council for an Energy Efficiency Economy estimates that \nINCAAA would save the Nation over 1.2 Quadrillion Btus of energy each \nyear by 2030--enough energy to meet the needs of 6.5 million typical \nAmerican households. ACEEE also estimated that INCAAA would save nearly \n5 trillion gallons of water annually by 2030, roughly the amount of \nwater needed to meet the current needs of every resident of Los Angeles \nfor 25 years.\n  Broad Senate support for the provisions of INCAAA is demonstrated by \nthe bipartisan votes in the Energy Committee when many elements of this \nbill were reported as a part of ACELA, or as amendments to ACELA. Broad \nsupport for these consensus standards among manufacturers and energy \nefficiency, and consumer groups is voiced in the letter written to the \nSenate Majority and Minority Leaders on August 13. In this letter, 16 \nmanufacturing, energy efficiency advocacy, and consumer groups urged \nour Senate leadership to ``quickly pass several consensus appliance and \nequipment efficiency standards this session of Congress.''\n  Even if the Senate is unable to enact comprehensive energy \nlegislation this year, enactment of the consensus agreements in this \nbill offers an opportunity to strengthen our economy by reducing energy \nuse, saving consumers money, and improving the environment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and co-sponsor this legislation and \nseek its enactment this year. While there are plenty of energy policy \nproposal Senators disagree on, the efficiency standards and program \nimprovements in INCAAA deserves the Senate's unanimous support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3925\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 664\n\n       Whereas Social Security is America's most successful and \n     reliable retirement program and continues to serve Americans \n     well;\n       Whereas Social Security is not in crisis or going bankrupt \n     and has been running surpluses for the last quarter-century;\n       Whereas Social Security, which currently has a \n     $2,600,000,000,000 surplus, has not contributed a dime to the \n     Federal budget deficit or national debt, and benefit cuts \n     should not be proposed as a solution to reducing the Federal \n     deficit;\n       Whereas for 75 years, through good times and bad, Social \n     Security has succeeded in protecting working persons and \n     their families from precipitous drops in household income \n     because of lost wages;\n       Whereas Social Security has kept millions of Americans out \n     of poverty, including senior citizens, widows, and disabled \n     and dependent children whose parents have died, become \n     disabled, or retired;\n       Whereas before President Franklin Roosevelt signed the \n     Social Security Act into law on August 14, 1935, \n     approximately half of the senior citizens in America lived in \n     poverty, while less than 10 percent of seniors presently live \n     in poverty;\n       Whereas more than 53,000,000 Americans receive Social \n     Security benefits, including 36,500,000 retirees and their \n     spouses, 8,200,000 disabled persons and their spouses, \n     4,500,000 surviving spouses of deceased workers, and \n     4,300,000 dependent children;\n       Whereas according to the Congressional Budget Office, even \n     if no changes are made to the Social Security program, full \n     benefits will still be available to every recipient until \n     2039, with enough funding remaining after that date to pay \n     about 80 percent of promised benefits;\n       Whereas seniors have put in a lifetime of hard work, \n     helping to make our economy grow and make our Nation great, \n     and they deserve a dignified and secure retirement;\n       Whereas Social Security provides the majority of income for \n     two-thirds of the elderly population in the United States, \n     with approximately one-third of elderly individuals receiving \n     nearly all of their income from Social Security;\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\n       Whereas proposals to privatize Social Security would \n     jeopardize the retirement security of millions of Americans \n     by relying on the ups-and-downs of the volatile stock market \n     to provide benefits;\n       Whereas Social Security benefits have already been cut by \n     13 percent, as the Normal Retirement Age was raised in 1983 \n     from 65 years of age to 67 years of age by 2022;\n       Whereas the physical demands of a job differ from industry \n     to industry and, on average, the longevity of the lives of \n     individuals differ significantly according to their level of \n     income, education, and access to health care;\n       Whereas 45 percent of workers who are 58 years of age or \n     older are in jobs that are physically demanding or have \n     difficult working conditions;\n       Whereas raising the retirement age is especially burdensome \n     to African-American, Latino, and older low-income workers;\n       Whereas according to data from the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics, in April 2010, the job market for Americans 55 \n     years of age and older was one of the worst on record;\n       Whereas Social Security benefits for retirees currently \n     average a modest $14,000 a year, with the average for women \n     receiving benefits being less than $12,000 per year; and\n       Whereas according to the Social Security Administration, \n     raising the retirement age for future retirees would reduce \n     benefits by 6 percent to 7 percent for each year that the \n     Normal Retirement Age is raised under Social Security: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate to reaffirm \n     our commitment to the Social Security program, one of the \n     greatest legislative accomplishments in the history of our \n     Nation, without privatizing Social Security, raising the \n     Normal Retirement Age, or other similar cuts to benefits \n     under title II of the Social Security Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7836-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7836-S7837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 665--TO REQUIRE A WITNESS BEFORE A COMMITTEE HEARING \n TO FILE A DISCLOSURE FORM IDENTIFYING SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL INTERESTS \nOR COMPENSATION FROM AN ORGANIZATION OR COMPANY DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE \n                          SUBJECT OF A HEARING\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted the following resolution;

In addition, the disclosure forms \n     shall be made part of the committee record.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, so far during the 111th Congress, the \nFinance Committee, of which I serve as the ranking Republican member, \nhas held over 50 hearings. At those hearings, around 200 witnesses \noffered their testimony and answered members' questions. The witnesses \nwho testify at our hearings are considered to be some of the most \nqualified experts in their field and their participation is critical to \nthe legislative process. Because of their influence on legislation, it \nis important that Congress knows to what extent the witness' testimony \nis objective and if the witness has any significant interest in the \noutcome of potential legislation.\n  Three of the hearings held by the Finance Committee this Congress \nwere roundtable discussions on health care reform. These discussions \nbrought 41 witnesses, including industry stakeholders and academic \nleaders, before the committee to share their expert knowledge on policy \noptions for health reform.\n  At one of these roundtables, Dr. Jonathan Gruber, a health care \neconomist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \ntestified before the committee on health care reform. I thought he was \nan unbiased expert, but was later disappointed to hear that he had been \npaid over $400,000 by the administration to help advance the \npresident's health care proposals. At the very least, he should have \nbeen straightforward with the committee and disclosed this financial \ninterest.\n  In addition to his testimony before the Finance Committee, Dr. Gruber \ntestified in front of the HELP Committee and was also a high-profile \nsupporter of the administration's health care reform effort in the \nmedia. In only a handful of his many articles on health care reform did \nhe disclose his financial conflict of interest.\n  While the propriety of Dr. Gruber advocating for administration \npositions in the media and other venues while failing to disclose his \nfinancial ties to the administration has been called into question, I \nam especially concerned about his advocacy before the U.S. Congress. \nWhen an academic leader comes before Congress to advocate a position, \nCongress should have confidence that the witness is both independent \nand objective and not being paid to assist the administration, or any \nother organization, in its efforts.\n  Equally troubling is the Department of Health and Human Services, \nwhich has been unresponsive to efforts by Senator Enzi and myself to \nlearn more about their practice of hiring consultants to advance the \nPresident's agenda.\n  The fact that this expert was paid by the administration--and hid \nthat fact from Congress--really taints everything this particular \nadvocate told the committees. If Congress had been aware of his \narrangement with HHS prior to his testimony, we would have had the \nopportunity to clarify that relationship with Dr. Gruber before \nconsidering his opinions and ideas. Unfortunately, when we learn about \nit after the fact, it completely discredits the information he \npresented.\n  To follow up on this alarming news, Senator Enzi and I sent a letter \nto Dr. Gruber on January 26, 2010, asking him for details of any other \ngovernment contracts he might have or might have had over the last 5 \nyears and for details on whether he disclosed his government ties \nduring media interviews, speaking engagements and written works on \nhealth care reform.\n  Dr. Gruber's response failed to answer any of the questions posed in \nthe letter. Instead, the response barely exceeded one page in length, \nwas dismissive of any concern about the lack of disclosure and \nattempted to excuse his failure to disclose and to explain away the \nneed for any detailed response. Furthermore, Dr. Gruber did not even \ncommit to providing any such disclosure of the financial relationship \nwith the Administration in the future.\n  Unfortunately, Dr. Gruber's failure to answer our questions came as \nno surprise. In my 30 years serving in the United States Congress, I \nhave found that chasing answers on the back end is much more difficult \nthan requiring clarity and transparency from the start. And many of my \ncolleagues might be surprised to find out that although many witnesses \nvoluntarily disclose their affiliations or relationships so that they \ncan explain them, no Senate committee currently requires witnesses to \ndisclose potential conflicts of interest.\n  Dr. Gruber even highlighted this point when he said in his February \n23 letter that, ``to the best of my recollection, during the course of \nmy health care reform work with Congress, no Member or staffer ever \nasked me whether I held any government contracts.''\n  In retrospect, if we were to have asked Dr. Gruber to disclose his \nagreements with the administration up front, we would have had the \nability to ask him questions in-person, and he would have been given a \nchance to explain the relationship before testifying, so that his \ntestimony could be given its proper weight. Our failure as an \ninstitution to ask for transparency in testimony is a problem that has \na simple\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\nsolution, a solution that most other institutions that rely on the work \nof academic experts have already implemented. The solution is to simply \nask witnesses who come before the Senate to disclose any potential \nconflicts of interest up front.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives are already requiring \nwitnesses to do this and there is no reason why we shouldn't require \nthe same level of transparency from witnesses who come before the \nSenate.\n  That is why today I am submitting the Witness Sunshine resolution. \nThis resolution will make the Senate committee hearings more \ntransparent and thus more credible and valuable to the legislative \nprocess. It achieves this goal by requiring each witness that appears \nbefore any Senate committee to submit a form disclosing outside \naffiliations and financial interests in any organizations, including \ngovernment entities, that are directly related to the topic of the \ncommittee hearing.\n  In August, I was happy to learn that the administration is supportive \nof this idea. In an August 4 letter, Secretary Sebelius wrote me \nsaying, ``Should the Senate Finance Committee or any other \nCongressional Committee choose to [require witnesses to submit \nfinancial disclosure forms in advance of an appearance before the \nCommittee], I would certainly encourage HHS contractors to fully comply \nwith [that requirement].''\n  So adopting this rule should be an easy decision for the Senate. Our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives have been requiring this \nlevel of transparency for over a decade and now we know that the \nadministration supports the idea as well. The House tells me that their \nwitnesses are not overburdened or discouraged to offer testimony \nbecause of this requirement. I have carefully drafted this resolution \nso that the requirement for transparency similarly does not burden \nSenate witnesses.\n  It is time for this body to meet the standards for transparency set \nby the House and followed in so many other institutions across the \ncountry.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce and bring to the \nSenate's attention today a resolution which recognizes the value of the \ndefense relationship between the National Guard of the State of Vermont \nand the military services of the Republic of Macedonia, under the \nNational Guard State Partnership Program.\n  Time and again, the Republic of Macedonia has contributed to \nimportant NATO-led missions, including several hundred troops currently \ndeployed to Afghanistan along with the 86th Infantry Brigade Combat \nTeam of the Vermont National Guard. This relationship has yielded \ntangible benefits for both our countries, and I am proud of the role \nthat Vermont has played in strengthening and broadening a growing \ninternational partnership.\n  The Vermont National Guard began its relationship with the armed \nservices of the Republic of Macedonia in 1994, shortly after the \nDepartment of the Army created the National Guard State Partnership \nProgram in 1993. Since 1995, the Republic of Macedonia and the Vermont \nGuard have participated in more than 200 joint activities, and more \nthan 4000 members of the Macedonian Ministry of Defense have been \ntrained by the Vermont Guard.\n  Macedonia has participated in NATO-led and international military \nmissions in Afghanistan since August 2002, increasing its troop levels \nthere in 2010. Especially given its relatively small population, \nMacedonia has made a substantial, needed and welcome contribution of \ntroops to the NATO International Security Assistance Force.\n  Macedonia's participation in international security efforts also \nprecedes the Afghanistan deployment. During the Kosovo crisis of 1999, \nterritory in Macedonia served as a staging area and main corridor for \nlogistical support to the NATO Kosovo Force, commonly referred to as \n``KFOR,'' and the Government of Macedonia has led the KFOR Coordination \nCentre for logistical support in Skopje since 2006. In the interest of \nunderscoring a faithful partnership with the United States, the \nGovernment of Macedonia even deployed troops to Iraq until 2008. \nMacedonian\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\nsoldiers have been recognized by the U.S. military with more than 120 \nmedals.\n  Given all of these valuable efforts, I believe it is time the United \nStates Senate offered its commendation and appreciation to the \nGovernment and people of the Republic of Macedonia. I hope the Senate \nwill heartily concur in this much-deserved recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7840-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7840-S7841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 73--HONORING THE LIFE OF DR.

Walters, an ambassador \n     for freedom and democracy, whose lifelong dedication and \n     service stand as an outstanding example of leadership for all \n     mankind.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join with \nmy colleagues today and honor a native Kansan who, 52 years ago, \ncommitted an act of courage that was the basis for inspiring many civil \nrights movements throughout our country, the late Dr. Ronald Walters, \nhumanitarian, civil rights activist and educator. In 1958, a young \nRonald Walters returned to his hometown of Wichita, KS to work during \nhis summer break from Fisk University in Nashville, TN. Like most \ncollege students, Ronald would often eat at one of the local Wichita \nhangouts for his lunch break, which, at the time, were segregated. \nSeeing the injustice of the segregation, Ronald and his cousin, Carol \nParks, decided to organize a sit-in at one of the most popular lunch \nspots in Wichita, Dockum Drugstore. Ronald and his group of protestors \nsilently sat at the Dockum's lunch counter in protest of their \nsegregated policy. They were taunted for their action, but the taunting \ninspired more people to join the sit-in protest, both black and white.\n  After more than three weeks of the silent sit-in, the owner decided \nto discard the policy of segregated counters due to the fact the sit-in \nhad caused him to lose too much money. Their success at Dockum's led \nRonald and the group of protestors to continue their sit-ins at other \nsegregated restaurants in Wichita. Though Ronald's sit-in was held in \nthe middle of America--Wichita, KS--the effect reverberated around the \nNation and is widely considered by scholars to be the Nation's first \nlunch-counter sit-in protests, which paved the way to ending \nsegregation in our country.\n  Ronald Walters completed his education at Fisk University, receiving \na Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Government, a Master of Arts \nin African Studies degree from American University in 1966, and a \nDoctor of Philosophy in International Studies degree from American \nUniversity in 1971.\n  Dr. Walters went on to be an associate professor at both Syracuse and \nBrandeis Universities before moving to Howard University, where he \nstayed for 25 years and became the chair of the Political Science \ndepartment from 1990-1996.\n  During his time at Howard, Dr. Walters continued his activism in \ncivil rights policies. He worked as a Senior\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nForeign Affairs Consultant for Congressman Charles Diggs, D-MI, and for \nCongressman William Gray, III, D-PA, in 1979. Dr. Walters was also \nchosen to be the Deputy Campaign Manager for Reverend Jesse Jackson's \nPresidential Campaign in 1984 and as the Conventions Operations \nConsultant in Reverend Jesse Jackson's 1988 Presidential run.\n  Dr. Walters was also a proud and active member of many national \norganizations, including the African Heritage Studies Association, \nAmerican Political Science Association, the Kappa Alpha Psi, Omicron \nDelta Kappa, and Pi Sigma Alpha fraternities, and the National \nConference of Black Political Scientists.\n  Dr. Walters not only was a civil rights activist, but a political \nscholar as well. He authored many articles and books throughout his \nlife, and received awards for them, including the Ralph Bunche Award \nfor the best book on race and politics from the American Political \nScience Association and the Best Book Award from the National \nConference of Black Political Scientists.\n  Dr. Walters also received many academic awards, including the 1963 \nReader's Digest Writing Award and the 1984 Distinguished Scholar/\nActivist Award from The Black Scholar Magazine.\n  Dr. Walters left Howard to become a Professor of Government and \nPolitics at the University of Maryland College Park from 1996-2009.\n  Dr. Walters' sit-in occurred almost two years before the better \npublicized lunch-room sit-ins in Greensboro, NC, but it had received \nlittle attention until 2006, when he was honored with a medal from the \nNAACP for organizing the historical Wichita, KS, sit-in.\n  Today, I am proud to join with my colleagues in the United States \nSenate to honor this Kansans' courageous actions in our Nation's \nhistory and his legacy of ensuring that America lives up to the ideals \nupon which it was founded. Dr. Walters was a true and great ambassador \nof freedom and democracy, whose lifelong dedication and service stand \nas an outstanding example of leadership for all mankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7840-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7840-S7841]\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 73--HONORING THE LIFE OF DR.

Walters, especially his wife, Mrs. Patricia \n     Walters, his 3 brothers, Duane, Terrance, and Kevin, and his \n     2 sisters, Marcia and Sharon; and\n       (2) honors the life of Dr. Ronald W. Walters, an ambassador \n     for freedom and democracy, whose lifelong dedication and \n     service stand as an outstanding example of leadership for all \n     mankind.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join with \nmy colleagues today and honor a native Kansan who, 52 years ago, \ncommitted an act of courage that was the basis for inspiring many civil \nrights movements throughout our country, the late Dr. Ronald Walters, \nhumanitarian, civil rights activist and educator. In 1958, a young \nRonald Walters returned to his hometown of Wichita, KS to work during \nhis summer break from Fisk University in Nashville, TN. Like most \ncollege students, Ronald would often eat at one of the local Wichita \nhangouts for his lunch break, which, at the time, were segregated. \nSeeing the injustice of the segregation, Ronald and his cousin, Carol \nParks, decided to organize a sit-in at one of the most popular lunch \nspots in Wichita, Dockum Drugstore. Ronald and his group of protestors \nsilently sat at the Dockum's lunch counter in protest of their \nsegregated policy. They were taunted for their action, but the taunting \ninspired more people to join the sit-in protest, both black and white.\n  After more than three weeks of the silent sit-in, the owner decided \nto discard the policy of segregated counters due to the fact the sit-in \nhad caused him to lose too much money. Their success at Dockum's led \nRonald and the group of protestors to continue their sit-ins at other \nsegregated restaurants in Wichita. Though Ronald's sit-in was held in \nthe middle of America--Wichita, KS--the effect reverberated around the \nNation and is widely considered by scholars to be the Nation's first \nlunch-counter sit-in protests, which paved the way to ending \nsegregation in our country.\n  Ronald Walters completed his education at Fisk University, receiving \na Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Government, a Master of Arts \nin African Studies degree from American University in 1966, and a \nDoctor of Philosophy in International Studies degree from American \nUniversity in 1971.\n  Dr. Walters went on to be an associate professor at both Syracuse and \nBrandeis Universities before moving to Howard University, where he \nstayed for 25 years and became the chair of the Political Science \ndepartment from 1990-1996.\n  During his time at Howard, Dr. Walters continued his activism in \ncivil rights policies. He worked as a Senior\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nForeign Affairs Consultant for Congressman Charles Diggs, D-MI, and for \nCongressman William Gray, III, D-PA, in 1979. Dr. Walters was also \nchosen to be the Deputy Campaign Manager for Reverend Jesse Jackson's \nPresidential Campaign in 1984 and as the Conventions Operations \nConsultant in Reverend Jesse Jackson's 1988 Presidential run.\n  Dr. Walters was also a proud and active member of many national \norganizations, including the African Heritage Studies Association, \nAmerican Political Science Association, the Kappa Alpha Psi, Omicron \nDelta Kappa, and Pi Sigma Alpha fraternities, and the National \nConference of Black Political Scientists.\n  Dr. Walters not only was a civil rights activist, but a political \nscholar as well. He authored many articles and books throughout his \nlife, and received awards for them, including the Ralph Bunche Award \nfor the best book on race and politics from the American Political \nScience Association and the Best Book Award from the National \nConference of Black Political Scientists.\n  Dr. Walters also received many academic awards, including the 1963 \nReader's Digest Writing Award and the 1984 Distinguished Scholar/\nActivist Award from The Black Scholar Magazine.\n  Dr. Walters left Howard to become a Professor of Government and \nPolitics at the University of Maryland College Park from 1996-2009.\n  Dr. Walters' sit-in occurred almost two years before the better \npublicized lunch-room sit-ins in Greensboro, NC, but it had received \nlittle attention until 2006, when he was honored with a medal from the \nNAACP for organizing the historical Wichita, KS, sit-in.\n  Today, I am proud to join with my colleagues in the United States \nSenate to honor this Kansans' courageous actions in our Nation's \nhistory and his legacy of ensuring that America lives up to the ideals \nupon which it was founded. Dr. Walters was a true and great ambassador \nof freedom and democracy, whose lifelong dedication and service stand \nas an outstanding example of leadership for all mankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/29/senate-section/article/S7841-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 74--HONORING THE 28TH INFANTRY DIVISION \n              FOR SERVING AND PROTECTING THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Specter) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.
