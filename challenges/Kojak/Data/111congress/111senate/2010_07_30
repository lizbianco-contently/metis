Mr. President, soon I am going to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5900. First, I \nwant to make a couple of comments.\n  H.R. 5900 is a piece of legislation sent to us by the House of \nRepresentatives that will extend for 2 months the FAA reauthorization \nact. I regret that we have another extension. It is extension after \nextension after extension. It is so symbolic of the way this place \nworks these days.\n  The reason there is an urgency to get the FAA reauthorization act \ndone is that it includes so many significant issues that deal with the \nsafety of the air traveling public, with the airport improvement funds, \nwith substantial investments in air traffic control modernization--a \nwide range of issues that are very important. Despite the fact that \neverybody understands the urgency, the FAA reauthorization bill is \nstuck in the morass of difficulties that now afflict the Senate and \nHouse these days. It is very difficult to get anything done.\n  The question will be, Will we now--extending this for 2 more months--\nat the end of this year adjourn sine die once again without having \napproved an FAA reauthorization bill?\n  The Europeans are moving very aggressively on air traffic control \nmodernization. I have met with Europeans on these issues. We should be \ndoing the same, and yet it is held hostage by not passing an FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  The issue of safety is another very important issue. I have held \nhearing after hearing on the issue of safety. The question is, Do we \nhave one standard of safety on airplanes these days as between major \ncarriers and regional carriers? When you step onto an airplane that is \n32-passenger or 50-passenger--a regional carrier--do you have the same \nlevel of safety as is applied with respect to the crew, the training, \nand all the other issues as exists with the major carriers? The law \nrequires that; FAA requires that.\n  Does it exist? Well, we explored in great detail the crash of Colgan \nAir. We saw, with respect to Colgan Air, one flight on one night--one \ntragic\n\n[[Page S6542]]\n\nnight--where 45 passengers got on a Bombardier Dash 8 at La Guardia to \nfly to Buffalo, NY. Flying through the ice that evening, they had their \nwings iced up and they went into a dive and crashed, killing all of the \npassengers on board--a flight attendant, two pilots, and one person on \nthe ground as well.\n  When we dissected what happened that evening, it was unbelievable. It \nmay be that this is one circumstance that has occurred only in that \nsituation--I doubt it. Neither pilot had slept in a bed the night \nbefore. One traveled across the United States from Seattle, WA, to \nNewark, just to reach her duty station to go to work. Think of that, \ntraveling all night because it is your commute to your job, from \nSeattle to Newark, and then getting in an airplane and flying. That was \nthe copilot who flew the right seat--a person who, a report said, was \npaid $20,000 or $22,000 a year and had to have a second job to make \nends meet, and who previously lived with her parents because of the low \nsalaries paid to pilots on commuter airlines.\n  The pilot in the left seat had not slept the night before either. \nEvidence was that he was only in the crew lounge where there are no \nbeds. He commuted from Florida, I believe--one of the Florida cities--\nto Newark to his work station.\n  It is also the case that, as we looked at the transcript of the \ncockpit recording, we found all kinds of very difficult circumstances \nthat existed--a discussion by the copilot that she had very little \ntraining flying in icing. This is someone in a cockpit flying a \ncommercial airline saying: I have had very little experience flying in \nicing. We took a look at the records of the pilot and discovered that \nthe pilot had failed, on multiple occasions, some key exams, and \nsufficient so that had the airline known, they said: ``We would not \nhave hired that pilot had we known of those failures.'' Except the \npilot's records were not transparent to the airlines. And the list goes \non. It is about the training regime, stick shakers, stick pushers in \nthe cockpit dealing with the circumstances that evening.\n\n  The question is: Was this an isolated incident or have we learned \nsomething that ought to be very concerning to all of us about safety in \nthe skies? We included a number of recommendations in the FAA \nreauthorization bill dealing with safety. Some of those recommendations \nhave been sent to us by the House of Representatives today in the 2-\nmonth extension. We will go ahead and adopt those and they will become \nlaw.\n  It does not represent all of the safety issues we have included in \nthe Senate FAA reauthorization bill. It represents significant and \nimportant safety recommendations. It deals with FAA pilot records \ndatabase and access to that database, the number of hours that are \nrequired for a pilot getting in a cockpit--1,500 hours as opposed to \nthe 250 hours. The 1,500 represents what is required by the ATP, and \nthat standard is applied in the House bill and also in the discussions \nwe have had leading up to this point with the House negotiators.\n  We include issues such as the pilot training issues, safety \ninspectors, flight crew member mentoring, development, and leadership--\na range of things that are very important.\n  The FAA is also involved separately on issues dealing with fatigue. \nThey are not at this point, I believe, dealing with commuting, but I \nthink commuting is an issue and has to be dealt with.\n  The point is that the FAA reauthorization bill is not now going to be \npassed. We will pass a 60-day extension to the end of September. The \nextension will include the safety provisions I have just described.\n  I want to mention as well the families of the victims of the Colgan \nair crash who, in my judgment, need to receive a lot of credit for \npushing these issues and making certain that those loved ones they lost \nin that crash--I guess whose memory they labor in to try to make these \nkinds of changes and push the Congress to do what is necessary to \nimprove safety. I believe the families have done very substantial work \nand very important work.\n  At every hearing I have held on the issue of safety, those family \nmembers have been present. They wear on their lapels and on their suit \njackets photographs of their loved ones. They are doing that because \nthey want to make sure this does not happen again. My heart goes out to \nthem. I also say thanks to them for doing the kind of work they have \ndone to make sure these issues do not fall by the wayside.\n  Let me make one final point. We have now from the period of perhaps 3 \nor 4 weeks in September and then a few weeks in a lameduck session to \nget the FAA reauthorization bill done, and if it does not get done, \nthen we will have once again failed. I am pretty familiar with that \nkind of failure. I have watched time and time again.\n  Without being disrespectful to any of my colleagues, I know there are \na number of issues that are of concern and of controversy. They deal \nwith the issue of the perimeter rule at Washington National Airport--DC \nNational--and also the slot provisions at DC National. There are \ndifferences of opinion in this Chamber. I believe we must resolve them. \nThose issues are not that significant. There has been discussion of 16 \nconversions that would not result in additional flights out of DC \nNational. It is not a case of somebody saying: Let's have more flights.\n  I hope that all of those who are involved in this discussion will \nfind a way to reach a compromise. This place does not work without \ncompromise. If we have a dozen people digging in their heels telling us \nthe way to resolve this issue is my way and if you do not like my way, \nI do not intend to do anything to allow anybody else to get anything, \nthen this place does not work.\n  Frankly, we are close to not working very well. In the first \ninstance, last evening we had another cloture vote. I know the majority \nleader felt strongly we probably would have the opportunity to get that \nvote. It is symbolic, I guess, of this Chamber these days. All year \nlong, we have had votes on motions to proceed on noncontroversial \nbills--cloture votes that require a cloture motion to be filed and then \nwait for 2 days and then have a cloture vote on a motion to proceed to \na noncontroversial issue. Then in addition to being required to file a \ncloture motion to shut off debate on something noncontroversial, once \nwe get cloture with an overwhelming number of votes, we have to wait 30 \nhours to take action. That is not legislating. That is stalling. That \nis obstruction. We have seen way too much of it in this Chamber.\n  At any rate, I feel of two minds at the moment. No. 1, I am very \ndisappointed that we have to have another extension. It is over and \nover again, nothing much changes, extend, extend, extend, rather than \ndo the kind of legislating we should do. We will do this extension to \nthe end of September on the FAA reauthorization bill. It relates to \nsafety in the skies. It relates to jobs. It relates to investment in \nairport infrastructure in America. It relates to air traffic control \nmodernization--all of those important issues, all of them again put on \nhold for another couple of months.\n  That is a profound disappointment, as far as I am concerned. Even as \ndisappointed as I am about that, let me say the safety provisions that \nwe will now proceed to enact, sent to us in the bill by the House of \nRepresentatives, are a significant step forward. I am pleased we are \ngoing to be able to do at the minimum this amount of work. More will be \ndone even on safety when the Senate bill, if the Senate bill, is ever \nable to be passed in the Senate and become law.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5900, the Airline \nSafety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010, \nreceived from the House and is now at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5900) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to extend the funding and expenditure authority of the \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund, to amend title 49, United \n     States Code, to extend airport improvement program project \n     grant authority and to improve airline safety, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the extension \nof the Federal Aviation Administration authorization, which includes a \nnumber of critical policy reforms that will make our skies safer for \nmillions of Americans and their families.\n\n[[Page S6543]]\n\n  On the evening of February 12, 2009, Continental flight 3407, \noperated by Colgan Air, departed from Newark International Airport for \nBuffalo, NY. The 45 passengers and five crewmembers were just miles \nfrom the Buffalo airport when a series of events resulted in the death \nof all aboard as well as a father on the ground whose home was the \nunfortunate final resting place of flight 3407.\n  Over this last year and a half, I have gotten to know many of the \nfamilies of the victims. They are a constant presence here in \nWashington, DC, working to improve safety conditions so that others are \nspared the same loss they have had to endure.\n  Sitting in my office last spring, as the NTSB began to release \ninformation on the crash, I discussed with the families the tremendous \nvalue of their advocacy. For decades the system has been slow to change \nand in the mean time innocent lives have been lost. We discussed the \npossibility of seizing on this very legislation as a vehicle for \nchange--to bring accountability and transparency to the system--to \nstrengthen the training requirements and push forward to achieving--not \njust ``one level of safety''--but a ``higher level of safety.''\n  As I speak to you today many of those family members are with us here \nin Washington. It is because of their tireless efforts--their \nunwavering pursuit for justice--that we are in a position today to take \nsome of the most significant steps in improving the safety of the \nnation's aviation system in years.\n  The measures we are considering in this extension are the result of \nbipartisan efforts in both the Senate and the House yielding a number \nof provisions that I have worked to advance--and that aim to bring \nincreased oversight and accountability to the system that force the FAA \nto respond to the growing concerns over crewmember fatigue and \ncommuting--that strengthen the training requirements for our commercial \npilots to ensure that those who are trusted with the lives of so many \nhave the critical experience needed to safely operate an aircraft and \nrespond accordingly in the event of an emergency.\n  I want to recognize my colleagues, Chairman Dorgan and Chairman \nRockefeller, who have been working around the clock on trying to bring \nthe FAA reauthorization bill to the floor. We still have work to do, \nand I look forward to joining them after the summer work period to see \nthe larger legislative package, which is long overdue, sent to \nPresident's desk.\n  It is my sincere hope, that these good people who have suffered such \nsorrow at the loss of mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons \nand daughters, husbands, wives that they can return home, their heads \nheld high, knowing that they turned their loss into action, and that \ntheir efforts might spare others the same pain that they themselves \nhave endured.\n  I thank the families for their strength. I thank them for their \nsteadfast advocacy. The American people owe them a debt of gratitude \nfor the work they have done over these many months.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that any statements relating to the measure be printed in the \nRecord, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5900) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me finally say that while I have mixed \nfeelings about having done this--one regret and the other a strong \nfeeling of accomplishment on the safety issues--I intend to come back \nto the floor in September, and if we have not made progress to resolve \nthe FAA bill--I do not shout very much, but I said yesterday I have had \na bellyful of this sort of thing--I am going to come to the floor and \nact very unlike a Lutheran Norwegian. You can count on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/30/senate-section/article/S6543-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support \nthe Oil Spill Response Improvement Act of 2010. It is a bill that seeks \nto directly deal with one of the most serious issues facing our country \ntoday in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon incident and how the \nFederal Government responds to what will likely turn out to be one of \nthe worst ecological disasters that have taken place off our Nation's \nshores.\n  The bill is a targeted piece of legislation that supports jobs in the \ngulf coast region, prevents our Nation from relying further on foreign \nnations for our energy needs, and protects the American taxpayer from \nbeing placed on the hook should, God forbid, a future incident ever \noccur. Specifically, the bill gives the President the ability to raise \ncaps on economic damages done by oil companies. It creates a Price-\nAnderson model where all entities operating in the gulf would share the \nrisk, as we do with the 104 nuclear powerplants. I don't think the \npublic is aware of the fact that they all have the same insurance \npolicy, and if something were to go wrong with one nuclear powerplant, \nall the others' insurance would be called upon. So there is no question \nabout liability; they just take care of the problem. We need to do the \nsame thing in terms of these oil rigs.\n  The legislation maintains the integrity of the Oil Spill Liability \nTrust Fund. It provides States an additional funding system to be used \nto protect the ecosystem. It accelerates the lifting of the deepwater \nmoratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. It creates a bipartisan spill \ncommission with subpoena power to investigate causes of the Deepwater \nHorizon explosion. These are good ideas that I think will address the \ncrisis at hand. They are good ideas that will help get people back to \nwork in the gulf.\n  I know Senator Reid has proposed an alternative piece of legislation. \nI understand that it maintains the current moratorium on deepwater \ndrilling off the Outer Continental Shelf, creates a liability regime \nthat will likely limit production in the Gulf of Mexico to only the \nlargest of oil companies, and raises the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund \nto pay for untested efficiency programs.\n  I welcome a robust debate, but looking at the schedule next week, my \nunderstanding is that the majority leader will likely fill the tree and \nnot allow any amendments. So what we are probably going to see is a \nRepublican-Democratic side-by-side taken care of in 1 day. To be \ncandid, this is a much too serious issue to cram into 1 day with just \nside-by-side proposals. And I think that gives rise, for those watching \nwhat we are doing here in the Senate, to some feeling that what we are \ndoing here is not genuine, is disingenuous and, quite frankly, if we do \nthis next week, I think what it will do is further cause the public to \nthink less of the institution of the Senate.\n  Regardless of whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, you ought \nto be concerned about the fact that since polling has been done \nregarding the approval of the Senate, the numbers today are the worst \nwe have ever seen. So something is going on out there, and they are \nwatching what we are doing and they are saying: These people seem to be \nmore interested in partisan politics or who is going to win the next \nelection in terms of how many new Senators or who is going to control \nthe House of Representatives instead of really looking at the problems \nconfronting our country. They are asking: Can't you people work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to solve the problems we have? There is \na fear and uncertainty today in this country that I have never seen \nanything like, and I think all of us should be concerned about how the \npeople in this country feel about what we are doing here.\n  Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, environmental advocate, \noil industry employee, I think all should agree that Congress needs to \nrespond intelligently to the situation with action that balances \nenvironmental risks with our Nation's energy requirements.\n  Much of the responsibility for this spill should lie on the shoulders \nof a few bad actors in the private sector, and they are primarily with \nBP. I have to say, from my looking at this, there is gross negligence. \nIt is amazing what they knew about and didn't do, and I think that will \nall come out, although I imagine there is going to be enough blame to \ngo around once we have had a chance to step back and see just what \nhappened.\n  I must also say that I think the decisions this administration has \nmade, not only in reacting to the spill but also in its general \nattitude toward domestic oil and gas production, have been disastrous \nfor the gulf region.\n  Last year, I sat down in my office with Secretary Ken Salazar to talk \nabout domestic oil and gas production and our Nation's energy strategy. \nIn that meeting, I conveyed to him that I have always believed one of \nthe most pressing challenges America faces today is reducing our \nreliance on foreign sources of energy. I called it the second \ndeclaration of independence--finding more oil and using less. I told \nSecretary Salazar that I was concerned about the administration's \nactions that were limiting energy production in the United States.\n  He disagreed with me. Secretary Salazar said the Department was in \nthe process of restructuring and undergoing a thorough review to ensure \nproper oversight of the oil and gas industry was being provided. He \npointed out that the Department was moving forward with lease sales in \nthe Atlantic and that, in his opinion, things were just fine. I took \nhim at his word and waited but didn't see any change in the \nDepartment's attitude.\n  I sent a letter to the Secretary on April 19, 2010--April 19--\nreiterating my concern that his Department was ignoring its obligations \nto oversee domestic oil and gas development and focusing too much of \nits attention and resources on renewed efforts to promote renewable \nenergy projects that make good photo-ops but would have little effect \nin meeting our Nation's long-term energy needs.\n  I expressed further concern that efforts to lease areas of the Outer \nContinental Shelf for oil and gas production were being restricted. For \nexample, in November of 2009, the Department of the Interior acted to \nshorten the lease terms for a specific sale of leases in the Gulf of \nMexico. The shortening of the lease terms will likely do nothing to \nguarantee more discoveries but, rather,\n\n[[Page S6545]]\n\nserve to increase risk as companies are rushed to complete production \nbefore the expiration of their lease.\n  Three months later, I have yet to receive an answer to my letter. And \nthis is particularly disappointing to me because I consider Secretary \nSalazar--a former colleague--a friend, and I have always respected him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter I sent to Secretary Salazar.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2010.\n     Hon. Ken Salazar,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Salazar: I believe one of the most pressing \n     challenges America faces today is reducing our reliance on \n     foreign energy sources and crafting a comprehensive national \n     energy policy for the United States that makes use of every \n     energy resource at our disposal. It is critical that we \n     improve our energy security to increase our competitiveness \n     in this growing global marketplace and improve our national \n     security.\n       As the Secretary of the Interior, you play an instrumental \n     role in implementing energy policy. And your department \n     should be applauded for its work in managing the nearly 8,000 \n     active onshore leases and the over 55,000 active offshore \n     leases, for its successful lease sales in 2009, and for \n     scheduling additional Federal oil and gas lease sales for \n     2010.\n       I am concerned however, by your comments that the \n     Department of Interior is moving adequately to promote \n     domestic production of oil and natural gas, and your efforts \n     to ``balance'' the federal government's procedures dealing \n     with the leasing of federal lands for energy production. I \n     know that you are sincere when you say that you are trying to \n     find an approach to managing the nation's natural resources \n     that provides the protection necessary to ensure that we are \n     not sacrificing irreplaceable natural treasures while \n     allowing for the safe and responsible production needed to \n     address future energy needs. But from what I have witnessed \n     and from what I have gathered from accounts conveyed me, I am \n     troubled that DOI is coming across as being more concerned \n     with catering to the political whims of the environmental \n     community.\n       Some have argued that unlike the attention being paid to \n     renewable energy projects, government action that would \n     promote increased domestic oil and natural gas production is \n     getting neglected. I am of the opinion that there is no \n     silver bullet when it comes to meeting future energy needs. \n     We are going to need a wide portfolio of energy options that \n     include different sets of technologies and solutions. As \n     such, no particular energy option should receive preferential \n     treatment on the basis of its constituencies. But neither \n     should the domestic production of a reliable and abundant \n     energy source, such as oil, natural gas, or coal, be \n     curtailed for the same reasons.\n       I was encouraged by the President's announcement to \n     consider expanding oil and gas production on the U.S. Outer \n     Continental Shelf. This is a good first step, but there are \n     still large areas both in Pacific and Atlantic that would \n     remain off-limits to exploration. Further, much of the \n     Eastern Gulf of Mexico remains under a congressional \n     moratorium until 2022.\n       While steps are being taken to expand domestic offshore oil \n     and gas production, I must tell you I have concerns that as \n     DOI works to schedule lease sales in the select areas that \n     have been released from moratoria, progress could very easily \n     be stalled completely by external roadblocks such as lawsuits \n     from the environmental community. This is a strategy that \n     groups have successfully utilized to halt the construction of \n     coal fired power plants. I hope the Administration and with \n     your leadership at DOI will follow through with this proposal \n     and expand our domestic oil and gas resources.\n       Additionally, your department is taking unilateral action \n     that could be construed as making more difficult for oil gas \n     production to take place domestically. For example, last \n     November DOI acted to shorten the lease terms of an upcoming \n     Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. Industry argues that the \n     shortening of the lease terms does nothing to guarantee more \n     discoveries but rather takes away from companies the \n     flexibility necessary to operate in an extremely challenging \n     and risky environment.\n       I continue to value our friendship and will work with you \n     as we both seek to achieve energy security, the creation of \n     jobs, and the rebuilding of our economy. I am optimistic that \n     we can bridge any differences as we strive to make the United \n     States more energy independent from oil rich foreign \n     countries who do not share our interests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George V. Voinovich,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Meanwhile, the Gulf of Mexico is now under a revised \nmoratorium on deepwater offshore drilling imposed by President Obama \nand the Department of Interior. This moratorium jeopardizes 30 percent \nof this Nation's domestic oil production and 13 percent of our natural \ngas production.\n  There are 33 drilling platforms currently idle in the Gulf of Mexico. \nThat doesn't sound like a large number, but keep in mind that these \nrigs are really the size of factories. Each platform supports as many \nas 1,400 direct and indirect jobs, which means that as many as 46,200 \njobs could be lost in the short term because of this moratorium. As \nthese are good-paying jobs, this could amount to as much as $10 million \nin lost wages per month, per platform.\n  Further, the moratorium threatens the livelihood of more than 300,000 \noil and gas workers in the region. The loss of revenue will be in the \nbillions. A 6-month moratorium could result in a $147 billion loss in \nlocal, State, and Federal revenue over the next 10 years. Oil and gas \nproduction in the Gulf of Mexico is a significant revenue stream for \nthe Federal Government. A moratorium on production that lasts 6 months \ncould cost the Federal Government between $120 million and $150 million \nin lost royalties and a $300 million to $500 million decline in \ngovernment revenue in just 2011. That is next year.\n  This is sure to have a devastating effect on our Nation's long-term \nnational security. I have said over and over that Americans are hurting \nfrom our addiction to oil. I am not sure they fully realize the extent \nto which our national security, and indeed our very way of life, is \nthreatened--threatened--by our reliance on foreign oil.\n  Every year, we send billions of dollars overseas for oil and pad the \ncoffers of many nations that do not have our best interests at heart, \nsuch as Venezuela, whose leader has threatened to cut off his oil \nexports. Today, over 80 percent of the world's oil reserves are in the \nhands of governments and their respective national oil companies, and \n16 of the world's 20 largest oil companies are state owned. Russia has \nproven it has no qualms about using energy as a weapon. In Venezuela, \nHugo Chavez has forcefully consolidated the nation's vast oil reserves \nunder the control of their state-owned oil company. He frequently uses \nthe company as political leverage in his region.\n  With the rise in national oil companies around the world and the \napparent weaponization of the globe's energy resources, U.S. domestic \noil production has been on a decline. We now import nearly 60 percent \nof our oil, and as a consequence we are sending billions of dollars \noverseas and putting our faith in the hands of regimes that do not have \nour best interests at heart. For example, in 2007, we spent $327 \nbillion to import crude oil and refined petroleum products. In 2008, \nthe amount we shipped overseas spiked to more than $700 billion. In \nother words, we take American money and send it overseas. And 55 \npercent of that money, or nearly $400 billion, went to oil-exporting \nOPEC nations. Today, oil amounts for over half our trade deficit.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil is even made more troubling when you \nconsider our Nation's financial situation. The national debt stands at \n$13.3 trillion--more than double the $5.6 trillion that existed when I \ncame to the Senate in 1999. By the end of 2010, the national debt is \nexpected to have grown to over $14 trillion. Last year, we borrowed \n$1.4 trillion.\n  The best way I can explain the soup we are in is that last year, for \nevery dollar the Federal Government spent, we borrowed 41 cents. Most \npeople, when I tell them that, just can't believe it. But that is the \nsituation. This year, we are going to borrow $1.5 trillion or another \nyear where we will borrow 41 or 42 cents for every dollar we \nspend. Over half the privately owned national debt is being held by \nforeign creditors, mostly foreign central banks. In fact, foreign \ncreditors have provided more than 60 percent of the private funds the \nU.S. Treasury has borrowed since 2001, according to the Department of \nTreasury.\n\n  Who are the creditors? According to the Treasury Department, the \nthree largest foreign holders of U.S. debt are China, Japan, and the \nOPEC nations.\n  These concerns led me to introduce the National Energy Security Act \nlast year with Senator Byron Dorgan. The bill expands development of \ndomestic oil and natural gas by streamlining the inventory and \npermitting of the most promising areas of the Outer Continental Shelf. \nBy the way, the group that is supporting this is a group of former \nadmirals and generals who basically said we have to do something; \nbecause of the fact of too much reliance\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\non foreign oil we are in terrible shape. We are on thin ice, in terms \nof our national security.\n  In addition, the bill provides $50 billion in Federal loan guarantee \nauthority for low-carbon electricity, including nuclear and advanced \ncoal. It promotes the electrification of the transportation fleet to \nreduce dependence on foreign oil, supports building the crucial \ninfrastructure necessary to create a robust, reliable national grid, \nand strengthens electricity transmission, including giving FERC the \npower to site transmission lines.\n  Americans today demand action and they demand we come together in a \nbipartisan fashion to solve not only this crisis in the gulf but our \nlarger energy crisis. For 10 years, I have been a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and for 10 years I have tried to \ncoax Congress into harmonizing our energy, our economy, and our \nenvironment. Congress has refused and now the chickens have come home \nto roost and we are paying the price because we were not able to get \ntogether.\n  I believe the best message we can send the world is that we get it. \nWe must demonstrate that we can safely and responsibly produce oil off \nour shores, while also promising ourselves that we are going to use \nless by undertaking a renewed effort to make the United States of \nAmerica the most oil-independent nation in the world. I envision an \nAmerica 10 years from now where we can have enough oil to take care of \nour needs. I imagine an America that is the least reliant country in \nthe world on oil, an America where our economy is not threatened by our \nreliance on foreign energy sources. It will be an America that has \ncreated hundreds of thousands of jobs through responsible development \nof our Nation's resources and through the creation of new industries in \nthe field of alternative energy.\n  Wouldn't it be great for our children and grandchildren to one day \ncelebrate the time America put aside its differences and came together \nto announce what I refer to as a second ``Declaration of \nIndependence''--to find more and use less? I believe, with this \nattitude, we can rekindle the American spirit of self-reliance, \ninnovation, and creativity to usher in a new era of prosperity.\n  The first step is to pass the Oil Spill Improvement Act to get people \nback to work in the gulf and to give the Department of Interior the \ntools it needs to provide proper oversight of the oil and gas industry. \nSecond, Congress needs to do its job--make the passing of a \ncomprehensive energy bill a priority and provide certainty as to how \nour Nation will supply energy to its economy in the future.\n  I reiterate and call upon my colleagues, the majority leader, the \nminority leader, for us next week to put out the Republican proposal \nand the Democratic proposal, and to have back-to-back votes will do \nnothing but increase the cynicism that is out there among the American \npeople about what we are doing in the Senate. Next week, we should \nfinish the small business bill--get on with that. We ought to get on \nwith consideration of the Kagan nomination by the President and we \nshould come together and say let's get serious, let's work during the \nAugust break to see if we cannot come together on a compromise between \nthe two back-to-back bills so maybe when we get back in September we \ncan have something we can all agree on and get passed and reassure the \nAmerican people we are serious about dealing with their problems and \nmaybe even give consideration--I know this would be difficult--to look \nat what many of us have suggested, to look at the bill that Jeff \nBingaman and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee put \ntogether on a bipartisan basis.\n  Perhaps we could look at a bill Senator Rockefeller and I have worked \non for over a year that deals with capturing and sequestering carbon; \nto look at a title that deals with nuclear energy that I worked with \nwith Senator Lieberman and others--and get something done. It may not \nbe satisfactory to a lot of the environmental groups, but at least we \nwould move the ball down the field this year so people know we are \nserious about becoming less reliant on foreign sources of energy and \nalso that we are genuinely concerned about reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  As I said, I have been around here, this is the 12th year on \nEnvironment and Public Works. For years, we wanted to do something \nabout NOX, SOX, and carbon, bring down the caps. \nThe environmental groups said: No, we won't agree with that, we have to \ninclude greenhouse gas emissions, so we did nothing.\n  I will never forget the Secretary of State, when she was a Senator \nfrom New York, and she wanted a compromise on emissions because the \nAdirondack Council and the folks from the Smoky Mountains agreed if we \ndid the Ps, reduce SOX, NOX, and mercury, we \ncould move along, and then the environmental groups came along and they \ngave her the ``Villain of the Month Award.'' Hillary Clinton gets the \n``Villain of the Month Award'' because she is trying to work on a \ncompromise to move us down the road.\n  We have some time left. I know it is going to be difficult because we \nhave the backdrop of the election facing us. I hope once that is over \nwe have a robust lameduck session so we can deal with some of the \nthings that are on the minds of the American people and, hopefully, \nperhaps this Commission that you and I wanted to see done on the floor \nof the Senate, that the President finally had to do through Executive \naction, could come back here with some positive suggestions on how we \ncan deal with our debt and these budgets that are not going to be \nbalanced as far as the eye can see.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/30/senate-section/article/S6546-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH GORE, CHIEF OF STAFF\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

She possesses that wide range of skills that is always \nnecessary for success. She is smart, tough, honest, and has \ndemonstrated an uncanny sense of good judgment.\n  I know the American people view the U.S. Senate through the lives of \nthose of us who are elected to serve here. But, frankly, every U.S. \nSenator will admit that a substantial amount of the credit for their \naccomplishments in the Senate belong to some very talented staff. That \nhas been especially true of Elizabeth in my office. She has directed a \ncomplicated set of issues in an office full of activity with great \nskill.\n  The term ``regular hours'' would not fit any job description in most \nSenate offices. Long hours, family sacrifices, and devotion to getting \nthe job done describes everything about the commitment Elizabeth made \nto me, my staff, and the people of North Dakota over the past decade.\n  I know Elizabeth will now add another chapter to what is already an \nillustrious career and others will discover the joy of working with \nher.\n  I join all of my staff members in saying thank you to Elizabeth Gore \nfor having spent the past decade working in my office.

Mr. President, I wish to speak to a resolution honoring \nthe National Council for International Visitors, NCIV, on the occasion \nof its 50th anniversary. The United States has the responsibility of \nprotecting its citizens by ensuring peace, and I believe that citizen \ndiplomacy as practiced by the NCIV is a crucial tool to achieving that \nend.\n  With the goal of promoting ``excellence in civilian diplomacy,'' the \nNCIV promotes the idea that individual citizens have the right and \nresponsibility to promote peaceful and cooperative foreign relations. \nNCIV champions the belief that ``citizen diplomacy has the power to \nshape American perceptions of foreign cultures and international \nperceptions of the United States, effectively shattering stereotypes, \nilluminating differences, underscoring\n\n[[Page S6547]]\n\ncommon human values, and developing the web of human connections needed \nto achieve more peaceful relations between nations.''\n  In a partnership with the Department of State, the NCIV cosponsors \nthe International Visitor Leadership Program, IVLP, which brings \ndistinguished foreign leaders to the United States for short-term \nprofessional programs. Since 1961, the NCIV has organized people-to-\npeople exchanges for more than 190,000 foreign leaders participating in \nthe IVLP, and of these participants, 285 went on to lead their \nrespective countries. The IVLP's distinguished alumni include Tony \nBlair, Margaret Thatcher, Anwar Sadat, Indira Gandhi, and Nicolas \nSarkozy, among others.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have sought to engage leaders \nof friendly and adversarial nations alike, as I recognize the potential \nfor dialogue to yield positive results where few prospects for progress \nwere at first seen. Refusing to negotiate with adversarial countries \nexacerbates relations with these nations, and the resulting mutual lack \nof understanding strengthens anti-American sentiments.\n  It is my personal experience that meeting with leaders whose policies \nare in conflict with those of the United States can yield positive \nresults. I cite my interactions with former President Hafiz al-Asad of \nSyria, President Fidel Castro of Cuba, and President Hugo Chavez of \nVenezuela as examples. Achievements resulting in some small part from \nthis personal diplomacy included expansion of emigration rights in \nSyria and cooperation with Cuba and Venezuela on counter-narcotics \npolicy. By investing in diplomacy, the United States can foster \ninternational relationships that facilitate peaceful resolutions to \nconflict.\n  The NCIV promotes these relationships on an individual basis, \n``[bridging] cultures and [building] mutually beneficial relationships \nthrough international exchanges.'' I nominated the NCIV network of \ncitizen diplomats for the 2001 Nobel Prize believing they ``have done . \n. . the best work for fraternity between nations.'' On the occasion of \nthe NCIV's 50th anniversary, I hope that my colleagues join me in \nhonoring their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/30/senate-section/article/S6547-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                REMEMBERING JOE ``THE OLD MASTER'' GANS\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join \nme in marking the 100th anniversary of the passing of Joe ``The Old \nMaster'' Gans, a great American who inspired millions with his feats in \nthe boxing ring. At a time of pervasive racial discrimination and \ninequality, Gans provided the country with a glimpse of the true \npotential of African Americans by rising to the top of what was then \nthe most popular sport in America.\n  Gans had the humblest of beginnings. He was born in Baltimore, MD, in \n1874, and orphaned 4 years later. Then, he was raised by a foster \nmother in a segregated world in which the future seemed to hold no more \nfor him than the same menial labor he performed at the Baltimore harbor \nin his teenage years. In an ironic twist of fate, the racist conditions \nthat hemmed in his world eventually lifted him out of it. His \nincredible talent for boxing was first discovered when he emerged \nvictorious in a Battle Royale, a cruel sporting event in which white \ngamblers bet on which of 10 black youths thrown together in a ring \nwould be the last standing.\n  In the years that followed, Gans honed his skills and accumulated \nsuccess after success as a lightweight boxer, becoming famous for his \nperceptive, impregnable defensive tactics and devastating counterpunch. \nWith an easy one-punch knockout victory in 1902, Gans first earned the \nworld lightweight title, at the time the greatest athletic achievement \nmade by an African American. Four years later, he solidified his hold \non the title, which he would keep until 1908, with his victory over \nMatthew ``Battling'' Nelson on Labor Day, 1906, in Goldfield, NV.\n  The Goldfield fight, held outdoors under a blazing Sun, drew an \naudience of 8,000 people. The purse was $30,000. Gans's foster mother, \nMaria Grant, sent him a telegram urging him to ``bring home the \nbacon,'' a phrase that caught on in the media accounts when Gans won \nwhat was dubbed ``the fight of the century'' after 42 grueling rounds. \nIt was the longest gloved championship match recorded under Marquis of \nQueensbury rules.\n  Despite winning the fight, Gans received much less prize money than \nhis white opponent who lost. But the winnings were enough for Gans to \nfound the Goldfield Hotel, a leading incubator of Black culture where, \namong others, the great jazz pianist Eubie Blake first attracted \nnotice. Gans' achievements became a beacon of hope for the African-\nAmerican community. The prominent preacher and civil rights leader \nFrancis J. Grimke once remarked that the great Booker T. Washington had \ndone much for African Americans, but he ``never did one-tenth to place \nthe black man in the front rank as a gentleman as has been done by Joe \nGans.''\n  Gans was one of the first practitioners of scientific gloved boxing, \nfollowing the era of bare-knuckles fights. Nat Fleischer described his \nfootwork as ``beautiful side-stepping, and legwork'' in ``Black \nDynamite.'' The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Gans ``was in and \naway or inside as it suited him best, with will-o-the-wisp \nelusiveness.'' Jack Johnson said, ``Joe moved around like he was on \nwheels.'' All in all, he fought in three divisions--featherweight, \nlightweight, and welterweight--for 18 years, compiling over 150 career \nwins and over 100 knockouts.\n  The remarkable life of Joe Gans was cut short at age 34 when he \nsuccumbed to tuberculosis. I ask my colleagues to join me, a century \nafter his death, in recognizing the inspiring accomplishments of an \nAmerican hero whom the great Baltimore writer H.L. Mencken called \n``probably the greatest boxer who ever lived.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/30/senate-section/article/S6547-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3040.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Minnesota expressing its strong opposition to the \n     creation of a federal insurance charter as proposed in S. 40/\n     H.R. 3200 and any other such federal legislation that would \n     threaten the power of the state legislatures, governors, \n     insurance commissioners, and attorneys general to oversee, \n     regulate, and investigate the business of insurance, and to \n     protect consumers; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                            Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, the current financial crisis facing the United \n     States and the world is causing Congress and the \n     Administration to review the current regulatory structure \n     presently in force with the object of revising it; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, \n     Comptroller of the Currency, Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, and other federal regulatory institutions failed \n     their responsibility, causing great harm to the financial \n     system of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the prime example of the failure of the federal \n     regulatory institutions to exercise their responsibility is \n     AIG; and\n       Whereas, the failure of AIG has been caused by the actions \n     and activities of its holding company, the regulation of \n     which is the sole responsibility of the federal government; \n     and\n       Whereas, the regulation of AIG's insurance company \n     subsidiaries has been the responsibility of the state \n     regulators who have fulfilled their responsibilities, which \n     is demonstrated by the fact that none of the approximately \n     170 insurance subsidiaries has failed; and\n       Whereas, regulation, oversight, and consumer protection \n     have traditionally and historically been powers reserved to \n     state governments under the McCarron-Ferguson Act of 1945; \n     and\n       Whereas, state legislatures are more responsive to the \n     needs of their constituents and the need for insurance \n     products and regulation to meet their state's unique market \n     demands; and\n       Whereas, many states, including Minnesota, have recently \n     enacted and amended state insurance laws to modernize market \n     regulation and provide insurers with greater ability to \n     respond to changes in market conditions; and\n       Whereas, state legislatures, the National Conference of \n     Insurance Legislators (NCOIL), the National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and the National Conference \n     of State Legislators (NCSL) continue to address uniformity \n     issues between states by the adoption of model laws that \n     address market conduct, product approval, agent and company \n     licensing, and rate deregulation; and\n       Whereas, new federal legislation to create a national \n     insurance charter is expected to be introduced in 2009 that \n     will have the potential to fundamentally alter the role of \n     state governments in the insurance industry, thereby creating \n     an unwieldy and unnecessary federal bureaucracy proposed \n     without consumer and constituent demand; and\n       Whereas, such initiatives as S. 40/H.R. 3200--the National \n     Insurance Act of 2007--proposed optional federal charter \n     legislation may bifurcate insurance regulation and result in \n     a labyrinth of federal and state directives that would \n     promote ambiguity and confusion among consumers; and\n       Whereas, bills such as S. 40/H.R. 3200 would allow \n     insurance companies choosing a federal charter to avoid state \n     insurance regulatory oversight and evade important state \n     consumer protections; and\n       Whereas, the mechanism that would have been set up under S. \n     40/H.R. 3200 cannot respond to the unique insurance market \n     dynamics and local constituent concerns present in each of \n     the 50 states as state regulation does; and\n       Whereas, bills such as S. 40/H.R. 3200 have the potential \n     to compromise state guaranty fund coverage, and employers \n     could end up absorbing losses otherwise covered by these \n     safety nets for businesses affected by insolvencies; and\n       Whereas, bills such as S. 40/H.R. 3200 would ultimately \n     impose the costs of a new and needless federal bureaucracy \n     upon businesses and the public; and\n       Whereas, many state governments derive general revenue \n     dollars from the regulation of the business of insurance, \n     including nearly $14 billion in premium taxes and $2.7 \n     billion in fees and assessments generated in 2006--of which \n     the state of Minnesota generated over $346 million; and\n       Whereas, bills such as S. 40/H.R. 3200 threaten the loss of \n     over $10 million in state revenues from insurance fees and \n     assessments, thereby putting at risk the funding of a wide \n     array of essential state services; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota, \n     That it joins the National Conference of Insurance \n     Legislators in expressing its strong opposition to creation \n     of a federal insurance charter as proposed in S. 40/H.R. 3200 \n     and any other such federal legislation that would threaten \n     the power of state legislatures, governors, insurance \n     commissioners, and attorneys general to oversee, regulate, \n     and investigate the business of insurance, and to protect \n     consumers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the State of \n     Minnesota is directed to prepare copies of this memorial and \n     transmit them to the President and the Secretary of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the chair and members of the \n     United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs, the chair and members of the United States House of \n     Representatives Committee on Financial Services, and \n     Minnesota's Senators and Representatives in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/30/senate-section/article/S6548-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Dorgan):\n       S. 3679.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family and \nMedical Leave Inclusion Act. This is a bill--previously introduced in \nthe House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis--that would extend \nthe important protections of the Family and Medical Leave Act to same-\nsex couples in America. Under current law, it is impossible for many \nemployees to be with their partners during times of medical need.\n  The late Senator Edward Kennedy once said, ``It is wrong for our \ncivil laws to deny any American the basic right to be part of a family, \nto have loved ones with whom to build a future and share life's joys \nand tears, and to be free from the stain of bigotry and \ndiscrimination.''\n  America has a rich history of embracing those once discriminated \nagainst and making them part of our nation's family. All Americans--\nregardless of their background--are deserving of dignity and respect.\n  In 1993, Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act to, among \nother things, protect American workers facing either a personal health \ncrisis, or that of a close family member.\n  Thanks to the FMLA, those people in the workforce who suffer a \nserious illness or significant injury are able to take time to heal, \nrecover, follow their doctors' orders, and return to their jobs strong, \nhealthy, and ready to be productive again. Most importantly, they know \nthat they will still have jobs to return to, because those are \nprotected by the law.\n  Likewise, workers who learn the terrible news that a child, a parent, \nor a spouse is sick or injured, and in need of help from a loved one, \ncan provide that care and support knowing that their jobs are not in \njeopardy for doing so.\n  In passing the FMLA, Congress followed the lead of many large and \nsmall businesses which had already recognized and addressed this need. \nThese companies had put in place systems that gave their employees time \nto heal themselves or their family members, and ensured that those \nemployees would return to work as soon as they could. In standing by \ntheir employees in a time of need, these companies accomplished three \nlaudable goals: they eased the burden of those employees in crisis, \nthey reassured the rest of their employees that they too would be \ncovered should they find themselves in need of that protection, and \nthey ensured the return of these skilled and trusted employees, sparing \nbusiness the expense and effort of recruiting and training new people. \nIt was a win-win strategy.\n  The FMLA took that model and its benefits and brought the majority of \nthe American workforce under the same protections.\n  Today, once again, we have the opportunity to learn from a number of \nforward-thinking, pioneering businesses--big and small and across the \nUnited States--who have taken it upon themselves to improve on the \nprotections provided by law. While respecting the spirit and purpose of \nthe FMLA, these companies have simply recognized the changing nature of \nthe modern American family.\n  According to the Human Rights Campaign--a leading civil rights \norganization that strongly supports the Family and Medical Leave \nInclusion Act--461 major American corporations, nine states, and the \nDistrict of Columbia now extend FMLA benefits to include leave on \nbehalf of a same-sex partner.\n  In 1993, the FMLA was narrowly tailored to apply only to those caring \nfor a very close family member. The idea was to capture that inner \ncircle of people, where the family member assuming the caretaker role \nwould be one of very few, if not the only person, who could do so. That \nidea is still valid, and that idea has not changed.\n  What has changed are the people who might be in that inner circle. \nThe nuclear American family has grown--sometimes by design, and \nsometimes by necessity. More and more, that inner circle of close \nfamily might include a grandparent or grandchild, siblings, or same-sex \ndomestic partners in loving and committed relationships.\n  As the law stands right now, too many of these people are left \noutside of the protections of the FMLA.\n  Earlier this summer, the U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance \nclarifying that an individual serving as a parent, but who may not have \na legal or biological relationship to a child, is eligible to take FMLA \nleave to care for that child or attend to a birth or adoption. As Labor \nSecretary Hilda Solis noted, ``No one who intends to raise a child \nshould be denied the opportunity to be present when that child is born \nsimply because the state or an employer fails to recognize his or her \nrelationship with the biological parent. . . . The Labor Department's \naction today sends a clear message to workers and employers alike: All \nfamilies, including LGBT families, are protected by the FMLA.''\n  I applaud the Labor Department and the Obama Administration for \nsending this important message, but unfortunately, the FMLA statute \nstill does not allow an employee to take leave to care for a same-sex \npartner. We must act to truly make these important protections \navailable to all families.\n  At times like these, when we as a nation are experiencing a difficult \nemployment market, those with good jobs know the value of those jobs \nand are working as hard as they can to keep them. Those people should \nnever have to weigh the value of their employment security against \nfamily duties to care for a loved one.\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\n  But even in the best of economic times, this bill makes sense. Injury \nor illness can come at any time, and families are rocked by the needs \nand decisions that come along with that reality.\n  There are many who would understandably question what this kind of \nchange in the law would cost the business community. I would remind \nthose people that the FMLA is already a very good law; it is in place \nand it is working. It provides unpaid leave when the need arises, and \nit only applies to businesses that have enough employees on hand to \nhandle the absence of a single worker without too great a burden.\n  We have also seen that 90 percent of the leave time that has been \ntaken under the FMLA has been so that employees can care for themselves \nor for a child in their care, and those situations are already covered \nunder the law as it stands. What the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion \nAct would do is provide a little more flexibility, and recognize that \nthere are a few more people in that inner circle of family who we might \ncall upon, or who might call upon us. It will not make a big difference \nto the companies involved, but it will make all the difference in the \nworld to those protected by it.\n  We often hear calls from some of our colleagues who feel that the \nGovernment tries to do too much, and that we try to force government to \ndo for us what we should be doing for ourselves or for each other. That \nis exactly why this should be a law that we can all agree upon. \nCertainly we can all agree that family is the first and best safety net \nin times of personal crisis. Families need to be given the realistic \nability to provide that assistance. What the Family and Medical Leave \nInclusion Act does is give those family members the ability to help \ntheir loved ones in ways that only they can, without fear of losing \ntheir jobs in the process.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act takes a very good law and \nmakes it even better. It contains reasonable changes that merely \nreflect the modern American family. It is the right thing to do, and I \nhope we can join together on a bipartisan basis to pass it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3680\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform \nthe system of public financing for Presidential elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will reintroduce a bill to \nrepair and strengthen the presidential public financing system. The \nPresidential Funding Act of 2010 will ensure that this system will \ncontinue to fulfill its promise in the 21st century. The bill will take \neffect in January 2011, so it will first apply in the 2012 presidential \nelection.\n  It is important to note that the cost of this bill is completely \noffset by reforms to the federal irrigation subsidy program. Friends of \nthe Earth in its 2003 Green Scissors report estimated that these \nprovisions would save at least $4.4 billion over 10 years, which is \nmore than sufficient to cover the estimated cost of this bill--$1.1 \nbillion over 4 years.\n  The presidential public financing system was put into place in the \nwake of the Watergate scandals as part of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1974. It was held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo. The system, of course, is voluntary, as the Supreme \nCourt required in Buckley. Until the 2008 election, every major party \nnominee for President since 1976 had participated in the system for the \ngeneral election and, prior to 2000, every major party nominee had \nparticipated in the system for the primary election as well.\n  In the 2004 election, President Bush and two Democratic candidates, \nHoward Dean and the eventual nominee, John Kerry, opted out of the \nsystem for the presidential primaries. President Bush and Senator Kerry \nelected to take the taxpayer-funded grant in the general election. \nPresident Bush also opted out of the system for the Republican \nprimaries in 2000 but accepted the general election grant.\n  In 2008, several of the leading candidates for President, including \nPresident Obama, Secretary Clinton, Senator McCain and Governors \nHuckabee and Romney, did not participate in the primary system. While \nSenator McCain accepted the public grant for the general election, \nPresident Obama became the first major party candidate not to \nparticipate in the general election public funding system.\n  It is unfortunate that the matching funds system for the primaries \nhas become less practicable. The system protects the integrity of the \nelectoral process by allowing candidates to run viable campaigns \nwithout becoming overly dependent on private donors. The system has \nworked well in the past, and it is worth repairing so that it can work \nin the future. If we don't repair it, the pressures on candidates to \nopt out will increase until the system collapses from disuse.\n  In the post-Citizens United world, the likelihood of general election \ncandidates participating in the system if it is not changed is greatly \nreduced as well. The current system completely prohibits private \nfundraising, requiring candidates to fund their campaigns solely with \nthe general election grant, which was $84.1 million in 2008. Senator \nMcCain, who accepted the grant, raised approximately $220 million for \nthe primaries in 2008. President Obama, who did not participate in \neither the primary or general election public funding system, raised a \ntotal of approximately $746 million for the entire 2008 campaign. The \npublic funding system is clearly not keeping pace with the current cost \nof campaigns or the ability of candidates to raise private money.\n  This bill makes changes to both the primary and general election \npublic financing system to address the weaknesses and problems that \nhave been identified by participants in the system, experts on the \npresidential election financing process, and an electorate that is \nincreasingly dismayed by the influence of money in politics. First and \nmost important, it eliminates all spending limits in the law for both \nthe primary and the general elections. This should make the system much \nmore viable for serious candidates facing opponents who are capable of \nraising significant sums outside the system. The bill also makes \navailable substantially more public money for participating candidates. \nIt increases the match of small contributions from 1:1 to 4:1 and \nprovides up to $100 million in matching funds for a participating \ncandidate in the primaries and $200 million in total grants for the \ngeneral election.\n  In exchange for the much more generous public grants provided by the \nbill, participating candidates are required to focus their fundraising \non small donors. First, they must agree to accept contributions of only \nup to $1,000 in the primaries. The current individual contribution \nlimit, established by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, is \n$2,400. In addition, only contributors of $200 or less can have their \ncontributions matched. Since each $200 contribution will yield $800 in \nmatching funds, there will be a great incentive for candidates to seek \nout small donors. The 2008 campaign saw an explosion of small donations \nto the campaigns of both parties. This bill should help promote and \nextend this trend, which is a positive development for our democracy.\n  Under the bill, for the first time, matching funds will also be part \nof the general election system. In addition to a $50 million grant, \ngeneral election candidates can receive up to $150 million in matching \nfunds, again based on a 4:1 match of contributions of $200 or less. \nGeneral election candidates can also raise contributions of up to $500 \nfrom other donors whose contributions will not be matched. General \nelection candidates, therefore, will be able to spend up to $200 \nmillion in public funds plus whatever they can raise in contributions \nof $500 or less. Even in light of the specter of corporate spending \npermitted by Citizens United, these should be adequate resources for a \ncampaign that lasts only a few months.\n  One very important provision of the bill ties the primary and general \nelection systems together and requires candidates to make a single \ndecision on whether to participate. Candidates who opt out of the \nprimary system and decide to rely solely on private money cannot return \nto the system for the general election. And candidates must commit to \nparticipate in the system in the general election if they want to \nreceive Federal matching funds in the primaries.\n  This bill also addresses what some have called the ``gap'' between \nthe primary and general election seasons. Presumptive presidential \nnominees have emerged earlier in the election\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\nyear over the life of the public financing system. This has led to some \nnominees being essentially out of money between the time that they nail \ndown the nomination and the convention where they are formally \nnominated and become eligible for the general election grant. For a few \ncycles, soft money raised by the parties filled in that gap, but the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 fortunately has now closed that \nloophole. By eliminating spending limits in the primaries, the bill \nmakes sure that candidates can continue raising and spending the money \nthey need to remain competitive. In addition, the political parties \nwill be permitted to spend up to $50 million coordinated with their \ncandidates, an increase from the current limit of $15 million.\n  Obviously, these changes make this a more generous system. So the \nbill also makes the requirement for qualifying more difficult. To be \neligible for matching funds, a candidate must raise $25,000 in \nmatchable contributions--up to $200 for each donor--in at least 20 \nStates. That is five times the threshold under current law.\n  The bill also makes a number of changes in the system to reflect the \nchanges in our presidential races over the past several decades. For \none thing, it makes matching funds available starting six months before \nthe date of the first primary or caucus, which is approximately 6 \nmonths earlier than is currently the case. For another, it sets a \nsingle date for release of the public grants for the general election--\nthe Friday before Labor Day. This addresses an inequity in the current \nsystem, under which the general election grants are released after each \nnominating convention, which can be several weeks apart.\n  The bill also prohibits Federal elected officials and candidates from \nsoliciting soft money for use in funding the party conventions and \nrequires presidential candidates to disclose bundled contributions. The \nbundling provision builds on a provision contained in ethics and \nlobbying reform legislation enacted in 2007. It requires presidential \ncandidates to disclosure all bundlers of $50,000 or more.\n  Additional provisions, and those I have discussed in summary form \nhere, are explained in a section-by-section analysis of the bill that I \nwill ask to be printed in the Record, following my statement.\n  The purpose of this bill is to improve the campaign finance system, \nnot to advance one party's interests. The current President raised and \nspent more money than any other candidate in history. But he has a \nhistory of supporting the presidential public funding system, and he \nrecognizes the importance of reforming and updating the current system. \nI am optimistic that he will endorse this bill, and will participate in \nthe system if he runs for reelection.\n  Fixing the presidential public financing system will cost money. The \ntotal cost of the system, based on data from the 2008 elections, is \nprojected to be around $1.1 billion over the 4-year election cycle. \nThough this is a large number, it is actually a very small investment \nto make to protect our democracy and preserve the integrity of our \npresidential elections. The American people do not want to see a return \nto the pre-Watergate days of candidates entirely beholden to private \ndonors. We must act to ensure the fairness of our elections and the \nconfidence of our citizens in the process by repairing the cornerstone \nof the Watergate reforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section by section \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n      Presidential Funding Act of 2010 Section by Section Analysis\n\n\n               SECTION 1: SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n                       TITLE I--PRIMARY ELECTIONS\n\n       Section 101: Increase in and modifications to matching \n     payments--Current law provides for a 1-to-1 match, where up \n     to $250 of each individual's contributions for the primaries \n     is matched with $250 in public funds. Under the new matching \n     system, individual contributions of up to $200 from each \n     individual will be matched at a 4-to-1 ratio, so a $200 \n     individual contribution can be matched with $800 from public \n     funds. Contributions are ``matchable contributions,'' \n     however, only if the donor has made $200 or less in aggregate \n     contributions to the candidate, and the candidate certifies \n     that he or she will not accept more than $200 from that \n     donor. In addition, ``matchable contributions'' may not be \n     bundled by anyone other than an individual.\n       A participating candidate can receive up to $100 million in \n     matching funds.\n       ``Contribution'' is defined as ``a gift of money made by a \n     written instrument which identifies the person making the \n     contribution by full name and mailing address.''\n       Section 102: ELigibility requirements for matching \n     payments--Current law requires candidates to raise $5,000 in \n     matchable contributions (currently $250 or less) in 20 \n     states. To be eligible for matching funds under this bill, a \n     candidate must raise $25,000 of matchable contributions (up \n     to $200 per individual donor) in at least 20 states.\n       In addition, to be eligible for matching funds, candidates \n     must agree not to accept more than $1,000 in aggregate \n     contributions from a single donor. That amount will be \n     indexed for inflation. Participating candidates must also \n     agree to not accept contributions either made by or bundled \n     by lobbyists and PACs.\n       Finally, to receive matching funds in the primary, \n     candidates must also pledge to apply for and accept public \n     money in the general election if nominated.\n       Section 103: Inflation adjustment for contribution \n     limitations and matching contributions--Contribution limits \n     will be indexed for inflation, with 2012 as the base year.\n       Section 104: Repeal of expenditure limitations--Under \n     current law, participating candidates cannot spend in excess \n     of the primary spending limit, which was $54 million in 2008. \n     The bill eliminates that spending limit.\n       Section 105: Period of availability of matching payments--\n     Current law makes matching funds available on January 1 of a \n     presidential election year. The bill makes such funds \n     available six months prior to the first state caucus or \n     primary. That date for the 2008 elections would have been \n     July 3, 2007.\n       Section 106: Examination and audits of matchable \n     contributions--Current law requires that the Commission \n     conduct an audit of the qualified campaign expenses of \n     candidates and authorized committees that received payments \n     under section 9037. This Section would require the Commission \n     to also audit matchable contributions accepted by candidates \n     and authorized committees.\n       Section 107: Modification to limitation on contributions \n     for presidential primary candidates--Under current law, all \n     elections held in a calendar year for President are \n     considered to be a single election for purposes of the \n     contribution limits. This Section addresses the possibility \n     that a primary or caucus might be actually be held the year \n     before the general election by changing ``calendar year'' to \n     ``four year election cycle.''\n\n\n                      TITLE II--GENERAL ELECTIONS\n\n       Section 201: Modification of eligibility requirements for \n     public financing--Currently, candidates can participate in \n     either the primary or the general election public financing \n     system, or both. Under the bill, a candidate must participate \n     in the primary matching system in order to be eligible to \n     receive public funds in the general election.\n       Furthermore, the candidate must agree to (1) furnish the \n     Commission with evidence of qualified campaign expenses, if \n     requested; (2) agree to keep any records, books and other \n     information the Commission may request; and (3) agree to an \n     audit by the Commission and pay any amounts required to be \n     paid as a result of that audit.\n       To receive public funding in the general election, \n     candidates must certify that they will not (1) accept \n     contributions or bundled contributions from lobbyists or \n     contributions from a political committee other than a \n     political party; (2) solicit funds for a joint fundraising \n     committee that includes a political party after June 1 of the \n     election year ; and (3) solicit funds for any political party \n     committee after they have received their general election \n     grant.\n       Section 202: Repeal of expenditure limitations and use of \n     qualified campaign contributions--Currently, candidates who \n     receive public funds are prohibited from raising any private \n     funds for general election campaign expenses. Under the bill, \n     such candidates may continue to raise ``qualified \n     contributions'' for the general election. Qualified \n     contributions are defined as contributions of no more than \n     $500 in the aggregate that are received after June 1 of the \n     election year. To accept a qualified contribution, candidates \n     must certify that the donor has not contributed more than \n     $500 in the aggregate to the candidate for the general \n     election, and the candidate will not accept additional \n     contributions from that donor once $500 has been received \n     from that donor.\n       Section 203: Matching payments and other modifications to \n     payment amounts--The major party candidates for President \n     will be entitled to equal payments of $50 million, plus \n     matching funds of up to $150 million for a maximum total of \n     $200 million in public funding. Individual contributions \n     raised after June 1 of the election year of up to $200 will \n     be matched at a 4-to-1 ratio. Contributions are ``matchable \n     contributions,'' however, only if the candidate certifies \n     that the donor has made contributions of $200 or less in \n     aggregate for the general election, the candidate will not \n     accept more than $200 from that donor, and the contribution \n     has not been bundled or forwarded by anyone other than an \n     individual fundraiser.\n       Minor party candidates can receive grants and matching \n     funds for the general election after the fact, based on the \n     percentage of\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\n     votes received by those candidates in the election. If a \n     minor party fielded a candidate in the previous election, \n     general election funds can be received by that party's \n     candidate based on the performance of the candidate in the \n     previous election. These rules mirror current law on the \n     availability of general election funding for minor party \n     candidates.\n       Section 204: Inflation adjustment for payment amounts and \n     qualified contributions--The general election grant amount, \n     ($50 million in 2012), general election matching fund maximum \n     amount ($150 million in 2012), and qualified contribution \n     limit for the general election ($500 in 2012) will be indexed \n     for inflation.\n       Section 205: Increase in limit on coordinated party \n     expenditures--Current law provides a single coordinated \n     spending limit for national party committees. In 2008, that \n     limit was about $15 million. The bill increases the limit to \n     $50 million. This will allow the party to support the \n     presumptive nominee during the so-called ``gap'' between the \n     end of the primaries and the conventions. The entire cost of \n     a coordinated party communication is subject to the limit if \n     any portion of that communication has to do with the \n     presidential election. Party spending limits will be indexed \n     for inflation.\n       Section 205: Establishment of uniform date for release of \n     payments--Under current law, candidates participating in the \n     system for the general election receive their grants of \n     public money immediately after receiving the nomination of \n     their party, meaning that the two major parties receive their \n     grants on different dates. Under the bill, all candidates \n     eligible to receive public money in the general election \n     would receive their grants and whatever matching funds they \n     are entitled to at that time on the Friday before Labor Day, \n     or 24 hours after both major party candidates have been \n     nominated, whichever is later.\n       Section 206: Amounts in presidential election campaign \n     fund--Under current law, in January of an election year if \n     the Treasury Department determines that there are \n     insufficient funds in the PECF to make the required payments \n     to participating primary candidates, the party conventions, \n     and the general election candidates, it must reduce the \n     payments available to participating primary candidates and it \n     cannot make up the shortfall from any other source until \n     those funds come in. Under the bill, in making that \n     determination the Department can include an estimate of the \n     amount that will be received by the PECF during that election \n     year, but the estimate cannot exceed the past three years' \n     average contribution to the fund. This will allow primary \n     candidates to receive their full payments as long as a \n     reasonable estimate of the funds that will come into the PECF \n     that year will cover the general election candidate payments. \n     The bill also allows the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow \n     the funds necessary to carry out the purposes of the fund \n     during the first campaign cycle in which the bill is in \n     effect.\n       Section 207: Use of general election payments for general \n     election legal and accounting compliance--Current FEC \n     regulations permit general election candidates to raise money \n     for a separate fund to pay their legal and accounting \n     expenses (so-called ``GELAC funds''). The bill specifies that \n     all such expenses will now considered general election \n     expenses and must be paid for out of their general election \n     funds.\n\n\n                    TITLE III--POLITICAL CONVENTIONS\n\n       Section 301: Repeal of public financing of party \n     conventions--This section eliminates the public financing of \n     party conventions.\n       Section 302: Contributions for political conventions--This \n     section allows the national political parties to establish a \n     separate account to receive contributions that can only be \n     used to fund their party conventions. Individuals may \n     contribute up to $25,000 in a four year election cycle to \n     that account. The aggregate annual contribution limit \n     applicable to an individual who contributes to a political \n     convention account will be increased by the amount of such \n     contributions, meaning that the contributions essentially \n     will not count toward the aggregate limit.\n       Section 303: Prohibition on use of soft money--Federal \n     candidates and officeholders and national parties and their \n     officers are prohibited from raising or spending soft money \n     in connection with a nominating convention of any political \n     party, including funds for a host committee, civic committee, \n     or municipality.\n\n\n                       TITLE IV--OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n       Section 401: Revisions to designation of income tax \n     payments by individual taxpayers--The tax check-off is \n     increased from $3 (individual) and $6 (couple) to $10 and \n     $20. The amount will be adjusted for inflation, and rounded \n     to the nearest dollar, beginning in 2010.\n       The IRS shall require by regulation that electronic tax \n     preparation software does not automatically accept or decline \n     the tax checkoff. The FEC is required to inform and educate \n     the public about the purpose of the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund (``PECF'') and how to make a contribution. \n     Funding for this program of up to $10 million in a four year \n     presidential election cycle, will come from the PECF. These \n     provisions will take effect immediately upon enactment of \n     this bill.\n       Section 402: Regulations with respect to best efforts for \n     identifying persons making contributions--Within six months \n     of enactment, the FEC must promulgate new regulations on what \n     constitutes ``best efforts'' for determining the identity of \n     persons making contributions, including persons making \n     contributions over the Internet or by credit card. The \n     regulations must require the entity receiving the \n     contribution to verify that the name on the credit card \n     matches the name of the donor.\n       Section 403: Prohibition on joint fundraising committees--\n     Federal candidates are prohibited from forming a joint \n     fundraising committee with any political committee other than \n     an authorized candidate committee.\n       Section 404: Disclosure of bundled contributions to \n     presidential campaigns--This section builds on the bundling \n     disclosure provision of the Honest Leadership and Open \n     Government Act of 2007 (``HLOGA'') to require presidential \n     campaigns to disclose the name, address, and employer of all \n     individuals or groups that bundle contributions totaling more \n     than $50,000 in the four year election cycle. Individuals who \n     are registered lobbyists would have to be separately \n     identified. HLOGA's definition of bundling would apply to \n     bundling disclosure by the presidential candidates, and no \n     change is made to the requirements of HLOGA with respect to \n     congressional campaigns.\n       Section 405: Judicial review of actions related to campaign \n     finance laws--Current law provides four separate judicial \n     review provisions: (1) Section 403 of the Bipartisan Campaign \n     Reform Act (``BCRA''), which applies to actions challenging \n     the constitutionality of any provision of that Act; (2) 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 437h, which applies to actions challenging the \n     constitutionality of any other provision of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act (``FECA''); (3) 26 U.S.C. Sec. 9011, \n     which applies to certifications or other actions taken by the \n     FEC in connection with the general election public financing \n     program; and (4) 26 U.S.C. Sec. 9041, which applies to \n     certifications and other actions by the FEC in connection \n     with the primary public funding system.\n       The bill replaces all four of those provisions with a \n     single judicial review provision. All actions shall be filed \n     in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, with \n     an appeal permitted to the Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia Circuit and then to the Supreme Court. All courts \n     are required to expedite any such actions to the greatest \n     extent possible, and Members of Congress are granted the \n     right to intervene as of right in any case challenging the \n     constitutionality of any provision of FECA or the public \n     financing provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. Members of \n     Congress may themselves bring such a case.\n\n\n                            TITLE V--OFFSETS\n\n       Section 501: Offsets--This section would reform a federal \n     irrigation subsidy program by closing a loophole in the 1982 \n     Reclamation Reform Act to require a means test to qualify for \n     federal irrigation subsidies. This would ensure that small \n     family farmers, not huge agribusinesses, benefit from federal \n     water pricing policies intended to help small entities \n     struggling to survive. This new approach limits the amount of \n     subsidized irrigation water delivered to any operation in \n     excess of the 960 acre limit that claimed $500,000 or more in \n     gross income.

Res. 603\n\n       Whereas the year 2011 marks the 50th Anniversary of the \n     National Council for International Visitors (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``NCIV''), originally founded as the \n     National Council for Community Services to International \n     Visitors (commonly referred to as ``COSERV'') in 1961;\n       Whereas the mission of NCIV is to promote excellence in \n     citizen diplomacy--the concept that the individual citizen \n     has the right and responsibility to help develop constructive \n     United States foreign relations ``one handshake at a time'';\n       Whereas citizen diplomacy has the power to shape \n     perceptions in the United States of foreign cultures and \n     international perceptions of the United States, effectively \n     shattering stereotypes, illuminating differences, \n     underscoring common human aspirations, and developing the web \n     of human connections needed to achieve more peaceful \n     relations between countries;\n       Whereas NCIV is the private sector partner of the United \n     States Department of State International Visitor Leadership \n     Program (referred to in this preamble as the ``IVLP''), a \n     public diplomacy initiative that brings distinguished foreign \n     leaders to the United States for short-term professional \n     programs under the authority of the Mutual Educational and \n     Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.; also \n     referred to as the ``Fulbright-Hays Act'');\n       Whereas the NCIV network comprises individuals, program \n     agencies, and 92 community organizations throughout the \n     United States, including approximately 80,000 volunteers who \n     are involved in NCIV member activities each year as host \n     families, professional resources, volunteer programmers, \n     board members, and other supporters;\n       Whereas the network of citizen diplomats in NCIV has \n     organized professional programs, cultural activities, and \n     home visits for more than 190,000 foreign leaders \n     participating in the IVLP, 285 of whom went on to become \n     chiefs of state or heads of government in their countries;\n       Whereas the NCIV network has hosted and strengthened the \n     relationships of the United States with notable foreign \n     leaders who are alumni of the IVLP, including: Abdullah Gul, \n     President of Turkey, Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France, \n     Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India Morgan Tsvangarai, \n     Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, and Alvaro Uribe Velez, President \n     of Colombia, as well as Willy Brandt, former Chancellor of \n     the Federal Republic of Germany, Kim Dae-Jung, Former \n     President of South Korea, Frederik W. de Klerk, former \n     President of South Africa, Indira Ghandi, former Prime \n     Minister of India, Anwar Sadat, former President of Egypt, \n     and many others;\n       Whereas United States ambassadors have in repeated surveys \n     ranked the NCIV network-facilitated IVLP first among 63 \n     United States public diplomacy programs;\n       Whereas in 2001, Senator Arlen Specter nominated the NCIV \n     network of citizen diplomats to receive the Nobel Peace \n     Prize, stating that they ``have done . . . the best work for \n     fraternity between nations'';\n       Whereas all Federal funding for the citizen diplomacy of \n     the NCIV network is spent in the United States, where it has \n     leveraged $6 in local economic impact for every Federal \n     dollar expended;\n       Whereas NCIV member organizations provide invaluable \n     opportunities for United States students to develop global \n     perspectives and vividly experience the diversity of the \n     world by bringing foreign leaders into local schools, loaning \n     teachers cultural artifacts, and developing internationally \n     focused curricula;\n       Whereas participation of United States communities, \n     businesses, and universities in the international exchange \n     programs implemented by the NCIV network strengthens the \n     ability of the United States to produce a globally literate \n     and competitive workforce;\n       Whereas NCIV celebrates excellence in citizen diplomacy and \n     has honored 7 individuals--Senator J. William Fulbright in \n     1987, the Honorable John Richardson in 1990, Maya Angelou in \n     1993, Richard Stanley in 2000, Keith Reinhard in 2007, Garth \n     Fagan in 2008, and Rick Steves in 2009--with the NCIV Citizen \n     Diplomat Award for their exemplary work towards transcending \n     barriers between the peoples of the world in visionary ways;\n       Whereas NCIV provides leadership at the national level \n     having convened leaders of sister organizations for 2 \n     national Summits on Citizen Diplomacy and providing funding \n     to its member organizations for Summits on Citizen Diplomacy \n     in communities throughout the United States, giving those \n     organizations the opportunity to foster internationally \n     focused dialogue and to cultivate lasting partnerships with \n     like-minded organizations in their own communities; and\n       Whereas NCIV member organizations serve as international \n     gateways, sharing their communities with the world and the \n     world with their communities--welcoming strangers and sending \n     home friends: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the National \n     Council for International Visitors and its extraordinary \n     efforts to promote excellence in citizen diplomacy;\n       (2) commends the achievements of the thousands of citizen \n     diplomats who have worked for generations to share the best \n     of the United States with foreign leaders, specialists, and \n     scholars;\n       (3) thanks the National Council for International Visitors \n     citizen diplomats for their service to their communities, our \n     country, and the world; and\n       (4) designates February 16, 2011, as ``Citizen Diplomacy \n     Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/30/senate-section/article/S6554-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n  impeachment trial committee on the articles against judge g. thomas \n                             porteous, jr.\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL.
