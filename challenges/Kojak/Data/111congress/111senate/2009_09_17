Madam President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nbe in a period for the transaction of morning business for 1 hour, with \nSenators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each. However, I ask \nunanimous consent that the full 30 minutes of the majority be \ncontrolled by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. The majority will control the first 30 minutes, the \nRepublicans will control the second 30 minutes. Following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will begin consideration of H.R. 2996, the \nInterior appropriations bill. Following the managers' opening \nstatements, the floor will be open for Senators to offer amendments. At \n2 p.m., we will resume consideration of H.R. 3288, the Transportation-\nHUD appropriations bill, and proceed to a series of up to six rollcall \nvotes and complete action on that bill.\n  I think it is important to say to everyone that we are now in a mode \nof doing some legislation. I appreciate very much the cooperation of \nall Senators, Democrats and Republicans. We are now in the mode of, \nwhen a bill comes up, people can offer amendments. For a number of \nyears, that simply was not the case. When there are circumstances and a \ndecision is made not to allow amendments, I understand, after people \nare in the habit of being able to offer amendments, how concerned they \nbecome. We will approach that whenever it comes about, if there is a \ndecision made to so-called fill the tree and not allow amendments.\n  In the way we are working, we are taking some tough votes. Democrats \nare offering some difficult amendments, Republicans are offering some \ndifficult amendments. But that is OK. We are working through these \nbills. We could have been voting on cloture on the Transportation \nappropriations bill. We could have been invoking cloture on that bill \nthis morning. It simply has not been necessary.\n  We have some nominations we are still working our way through. One \nRepublican Senator has held up a nomination for quite some time. He \ncame to me yesterday and said: You can go ahead and put that one \nthrough.\n  I am satisfied and confident this is the way the Senate should \noperate.\n  We have the health care bill on the horizon. If we are able to get 60 \nvotes to proceed to it, it is going to take everyone's cooperation and \npatience to work through the amendments that will be necessary to go \nforward on that bill. I am hopeful and confident we can work through \nthat bill. If not, we will have to go to reconciliation, which I hope \nwe don't have to do, but if we have to, we have to do that.\n  Anyway, I feel good about what we have been able to accomplish this \nweek. I repeat, it sets a pattern of how we should be legislating.\n  Behind me is Senator Specter. He came to me a number of times last \nyear and said: Are there going to be amendments allowed? And I said \nyes. He said he would vote to move forward on the bill. I think there \nwere other people who felt the same way, but they just were not as \nvocal as Senator Specter.\n\n[[Page S9490]]\n\n  I appreciate the good work, including that of my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, who is one of the people who has stressed \nhow important it is to have amendments. I recognize he cannot control \nhis Senators all the time, nor can I. In spite of that, we have been \nable to work through legislation.\n  I want to get the appropriations bills done, as does Senator \nMcConnell. He and I have been members of the Appropriations Committee \nduring our entire tenure in the Senate. It is important that we work \nthrough these bills. As of today, we will have completed five of them. \nWe are going to do our utmost to do the conference reports before the \nfirst of October. We may have to--not may--we will have to have a \nshort-term CR, and by the end of that short-term CR, hopefully we can \ncomplete all the appropriations bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9490-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, over the past few months, the \nAmerican people have been sending us a clear message on health care. \nThey want reforms that make health care more affordable and more \naccessible, that increase choice, and that keep government out of their \nhealth care decisions. What they don't want are so-called reforms that \ncut seniors' health care, force Americans off private health plans they \nhave, cost hundreds of billions of dollars, raise taxes, and put \ngovernment bureaucrats in charge of health care. But that is exactly \nwhat they would get under the plan released by the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee just yesterday. So while I appreciate the hard \nwork of the senior Senator from Montana on this legislation--and he \ncertainly has spent enormous amounts of time on it--I am extremely \ndisappointed that it does not reflect the concerns Americans have been \nexpressing for weeks about health care reform. That much is very clear.\n  Now it is time to let the American people study the bill themselves. \nBefore we bring any legislation to the floor, we need to make sure the \nAmerican people and all of our colleagues, every single one of them, \nhave the time to carefully read it and evaluate its potential effects \non our health care system and the economy in general. Americans got \nrushed on the stimulus. They will not be rushed on health care--not on \nan issue that affects every single American. Before we discuss or vote \non any plan, we need to know what it does, how much it costs, and how \nit will be paid for.\n  Here is what we know now about the Finance Committee plan.\n  First, the Finance Committee proposal would cut hundreds of billions \nof dollars from seniors' Medicare benefits to pay for new government \nprograms. America's seniors want us to fix Medicare, not take money \nfrom it to pay for a new, untested, trillion-dollar government program. \nThis bill would also break the President's promise to seniors that they \nwill not be required to change the coverage they have. Right now, 11 \nmillion seniors are enrolled in Medicare Advantage, a program that \ngives them more options and choices when it comes to their health care. \nNinety percent of these seniors are satisfied with their plan. The \nFinance Committee bill would make massive cuts to Medicare Advantage \nand force some seniors to give it up, something that even one of our \nDemocratic friends just yesterday called ``intolerable.''\n  Senators from both sides of the aisle are concerned about the new \nburdens this bill would impose on States in the form of Medicaid \nexpansion. Unlike the Federal Government, many States are \nconstitutionally--in fact, I think virtually all of them are \nconstitutionally required to have balanced budgets. This means that if \npoliticians in Washington force them to increase spending on Medicaid, \nthey very likely will have to cut services or raise taxes right in the \nmiddle of a recession.\n  The Finance Committee bill would kill jobs by forcing employers to \nprovide insurance, regardless of whether they can afford it. While \nadvocates of the bill say it does not contain an employer mandate, \ntheir claims just do not square with the facts. If you tell an employer \nthat they either have to provide insurance or pay a penalty, that is a \nmandate.\n  The Finance Committee bill contains approximately $350 billion in new \ntaxes, and some of these taxes, such as those on medical devices \nranging from MRIs to Q-tips and new taxes on insurance plans, will \ndrive up insurance premiums and make health care even more expensive \nfor American families. If there was one thing we thought everybody \nagreed on, it was that any reform should not make health care more \nexpensive. Yet this Q-tip tax would actually increase health care \ncosts. That is why Senators from both parties have warned that it would \nput thousands of jobs in jeopardy and actually deter innovation.\n  The Senate Finance Committee bill also contains a co-op, which is \njust another name for a government plan. It still gives the government \nfar too much control over our health care system. It cuts seniors' \nbenefits, spends hundreds of billions of dollars, and raises taxes to \npay for another trillion-dollar government program. And it still does \nnot contain the kind of commonsense reforms the American people support \nand Republicans have consistently recommended, such as meaningful \nreforms to get rid of junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals and \nreforms to level the playing field when it comes to taxes on a health \ncare plan.\n  There is no question that Americans want health care reform, but they \nwant the right reforms and they want us to take the time we need to get \nit right. During the month of August, the American people sent us a \nclear message on health care. I am disappointed that many of my \ncolleagues apparently were not listening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9490-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONSTITUTION DAY 2009\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the National Constitution Center in \nPhiladelphia first opened its doors on July 4, 2003. Situated just \nsteps away from the Liberty Bell and historic Independence Hall, it is \nthe only museum in America solely dedicated to honoring America's \nConstitution.\n  Our Constitution was signed on this day--this very day--in 1787 by 39 \nbrave, outstanding Americans. Now, 222 years later, we thank them for \ndevising the finest system of government mankind has ever produced. By \nrecognizing that rights flow from the people to their government and \nnot the other way around, our Constitution is firmly dedicated to the \npreservation of liberty. That is why we celebrate every September 17 as \nConstitution Day. It is a day for all Americans to learn more about the \nConstitution, to understand how it works, and to appreciate how it has \nguided our Nation through growth and through change.\n  I thank the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, for \nsponsoring this legislation 5 years ago to observe this historic day. \nWe all know the love Senator Byrd has for his country and his country's \nhistory. He knows that you cannot truly understand how liberty is \npreserved in America without understanding the Constitution. Thank you, \nSenator, for your efforts to ensure that future generations also learn \nthis important lesson.\n  On this day, we recognize citizens across the Nation who are honoring \nour Constitution by honoring its values and passing them along to our \nchildren and grandchildren. And we say a special thanks for the men and \nwomen in uniform who defend it. Thanks to them, the Constitution's \npromise will be there for the next generations of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9490-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout U.S. policy in Afghanistan. During the course of the August \nrecess, and of course with my customary practice, I traveled to \nPennsylvania's 67 counties to take the pulse of my constituents. While \nthere are many problems, there was considerable concern about what our \npolicy is going to be in Afghanistan. I note at this time, according to \nyesterday's New York Times, there have been 821 American servicemembers \nkilled in Afghanistan, some $189 billion has been appropriated for \nAfghanistan, and by the end of this year there will be 68,000 American \nmilitary personnel and an additional 38,000 NATO troops from other \ncountries in Afghanistan.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an extensive floor \nstatement be included in the text of the Congressional Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I intend now to summarize the substance \nof my concerns.\n  The approach on our policy has been outlined in testimony earlier \nthis week by ADM Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nin these two statements: Our policy\n\n       . . . [is] to deny sanctuary to al-Qaida and the Taliban \n     now and to generate a stable and secure Afghanistan capable \n     of denying al-Qaida return after withdrawal of our combat \n     forces and while we sustain partnership and commitment to \n     political and economic development in that nation.\n\n  Admiral Mullen told the committee:\n\n       A properly resourced counterinsurgency probably means more \n     forces, without question more time and more commitment to the \n     protection of the Afghan people and to the development of \n     good governance.\n\n  While I think it is laudable to want to protect the Afghan people and \nto provide good governance there, it is my view that is not of \nsufficient national interest for the United States to put our troops at \nrisk or to expend substantial additional sums there. The principal \nquestion, as I see it, is whether Afghanistan is indispensable to be \nsecured to prevent al-Qaida from launching another attack against the \nUnited States. If that is the purpose, that is the necessity, then we \nmust undertake anything, whatever it costs, to stop al-Qaida from again \nattacking the United States.\n  But I believe there is a series of questions which have to be \nanswered before we can assess whether that is an indispensable part of \nU.S. policy. Toward that end, I have written to the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, \nand the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on a series of \nquestions which I think requires answers before we can make an informed \njudgment as to whether the expenditures in Afghanistan are in our \nspecific and key national interests. These are the questions which I \nhave posed for these leaders:\n  What are the prospects for military success in Afghanistan against \nal-Qaida and the Taliban? What will the requirements be in the next \nyear as to additional U.S. troops and the cost of our involvement in \nAfghanistan? What may we reasonably expect NATO or other allies to \ncontribute in troops and dollars to our efforts in Afghanistan? What \nother areas around the world are open to al-Qaida as potential bases \nfor another attack on the United States? What will be done besides \nmilitary action, such as nation building and stabilizing and developing \nAfghanistan, so that they will be prepared to handle their own problems \nso we can withdraw? What assistance can we reasonably expect from \nPakistan in fighting al-Qaida and the Taliban and stopping both from \nseeking refuge by moving in and out of Pakistan? How does the \nquestionable legitimacy of President Karzai's status as result of \nallegations of proof of election fraud impact on our ability to succeed \nin Afghanistan? How does the illegal drug trafficking and alleged \ninvolvement of high-ranking officials in the Karzai government in such \ndrug trafficking impact on our efforts in Afghanistan? What does U.S. \nintelligence show as to any possible plans by al-Qaida to attack the \nUnited States or anyone else? What does U.S. intelligence show as to \nwhether India poses a real threat to attack Pakistan? What does U.S. \nintelligence show as to whether Pakistan poses a real threat to attack \nIndia? What does U.S. intelligence show as to whether Pakistan could \nreasonably devote additional military force to assist us in the fight \nagainst the Taliban? What does U.S. intelligence show as to whether the \nGovernment of Pakistan or influential officials in the Pakistani \nGovernment would consider negotiating with India for reducing nuclear \nweapons or other confidence-building measures to diffuse the tension \nwith India if actively encouraged to do so by the United States? What \ndoes U.S. intelligence show as to whether the Government of India or \nsome influential officials in the Indian Government would consider \nnegotiating with Pakistan for reducing nuclear weapons or other \nconfidence-building measures to diffuse the tension with Pakistan if \nactively encouraged by the United States to do so?\n  We have learned a bitter lesson from Iraq--that we did not have \nanswers to important questions in formulating our policy there. Had we \nknown that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, I \nthink the United States would not have gone into Iraq.\n  These questions were posed by me when we had the debate on the \nresolution for authorizing the use of force. On October 7, 2002, I said \nthe following:\n\n       What was the extent of Saddam Hussein's control over \n     weapons of mass destruction? What would it cost by way of \n     casualties to topple Saddam Hussein? What would be the \n     consequences in Iraq? Who would govern after Saddam was \n     toppled? What would happen in the region, the impact on the \n     Arab world, and the impact on Israel?\n\n  The President, as Commander in Chief, as we all know, has primary \nresponsibility to conduct war but the Constitution vests in the \nCongress the sole authority to declare war. Regrettably, the \ncongressional authority and responsibility has been dissipated with \nwhat we have seen in Korea and in Vietnam and in the authorizations for \nthe use of force in the two incursions into Iraq. We do not have the \nauthority under separation of powers to delegate that authority. And \nhad we asked the tough questions and had we gotten correct, honest, \naccurate answers, it would have been a great help to President George \nW. Bush in formulating a policy as to Iraq. I think now it would be a \ngreat help to President Barack Obama for the Congress to exercise our \npersistence in finding correct answers to these kinds of tough \nquestions.\n\n  We have a situation with Pakistan today which gives great pause. The \nUnited States has advanced $15.5 billion to Pakistan since 9/11. Some \n$10.9 billion of that money has gone for security, and there is a real \nquestion as to whether we have gotten our monies worth. The comments \nfrom the New York Times on December 24, 2007 raised these issues:\n\n       Money has been diverted to help finance weapons systems \n     designed to counter India, not al-Qaida or the Taliban . . . \n     the United States has paid tens of millions of dollars in \n     inflated Pakistani reimbursement claims for fuel, ammunition \n     and other costs.\n\n  Dr. Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies, wrote on April 10 of this year:\n\n       Far too much of the military portion of the . . . past U.S. \n     aid to Pakistan never was used to help fight the Taliban and \n     al-Qaida or can't be accounted for. Future aid should clearly \n     be tied to clearly defined goals for Pakistani action and \n     full accounting for the money.\n\n  The New York Times, on August 30 of this year, pointed out:\n\n       The United States has accused Pakistan of illegally \n     modifying American-made missiles to expand its capability to \n     strike land targets, a potential threat to India.\n\n  The questions which have been posed in the series of letters which I \nhave outlined go to the issue as to whether India poses a threat to \nPakistan. It is hard for me to contemplate that is a serious problem, \nbut we ought to be informed and we ought to be putting our efforts to \nseeing if we cannot broker a peace treaty between India and Pakistan, \nwhich would enable us to get substantial help from Pakistan in our \nfight against the Taliban.\n  In 1995, when I was chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator \nHank\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\nBrown of Colorado and I visited India and Pakistan. When we were in \nIndia, we met with Prime Minister Rao, who brought up the subject of a \npotential nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan and said he \nwould like to see the subcontinent nuclear free. He knew we were en \nroute to Pakistan to see Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and he asked us \nto take up the subject with her, which we did. As a result, I wrote the \nfollowing letter to President Clinton the day after we left India, and \nI think it is worth reading in full:\n\n       August 28, 1995.\n       Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your \n     personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator \n     Hank Brown and I have had in the last 2 days with Indian \n     Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto. Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very \n     interested in negotiations which would lead to the \n     elimination of any nuclear weapons on the subcontinent within \n     10 or 15 years, including renouncing first use of such \n     weapons. His interest in such negotiations with Pakistan \n     would cover bilateral talks, a regional conference which \n     would include the United States, China, and Russia, in \n     addition to India and Pakistan. When we asked Prime Minister \n     Bhutto when she had last talked to Prime Minister Rao, she \n     said she had had no conversations with him during her tenure \n     as prime minister. Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had \n     initiated a contact through an intermediary but that was \n     terminated when a new controversy arose between Pakistan and \n     India. From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and \n     Prime Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United \n     States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     systems. I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment. I \n     am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher.\n\n  In my letter to Secretary of State Clinton, which I sent her last \nweek, I asked her what efforts have been made to broker such a peace \ntreaty between India and Pakistan.\n  I sent on to her a copy of a letter which I had written to President \nClinton; if we could ease the tension between those two countries, if \nwe could persuade Pakistan that India does not pose a threat so \nPakistan would not have to marshal their forces along the Indian border \nbut instead could aid the United States in our fight against the \nTaliban, it would be a very different proposition.\n  The suggestion has been made now to extend $7.5 billion in additional \nfunding to Pakistan. It seems to me that is not a good use of our money \nif it is to follow the same trail as the $15.5 billion which we have \nexpended in the immediate past. If we can get the assistance of \nPakistan in fighting the Taliban, it would be one thing. If we could be \nassured that the money was being used for the intended purpose and not \ndiverted for other purposes, as it appears the other $15.5 billion was, \nit would be a very different picture.\n  In sum, it seems to me that before we ought to commit additional \ntroops to Afghanistan, it ought to be a matter of paramount importance, \nindispensable as a matter of stopping another attack by al-Qaida. But \nif al-Qaida can organize in some other spot, the issues raised by my \nquestions, it would bear heavily on what our policy in Afghanistan \nshould be.\n  In addition to the full text of my statement being printed in the \nRecord, I ask unanimous consent that copies of my letters to Secretary \nof State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, CIA \nDirector and the Director of National Intelligence, Dennis Blair, all \nbe printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2009.\n     Hon.

In a related matter, in \n     evaluating foreign aid to Pakistan. Congress needs to know \n     whether Pakistan could be persuaded to aid us in fighting the \n     Taliban. In retrospect, important judgments were made on Iraq \n     without sufficient accurate. factual information. I write to \n     you, the Secretary of State, the Director of National \n     Intelligence and the Director of the CIA (copies enclosed) on \n     related issues within their purview.\n       Is U.S. success in Afghanistan critical in stopping al \n     Qaeda from maintaining a base to plan and facilitate another \n     attack on the United States?\n       What are the prospects for military success in Afghanistan \n     against the Taliban?\n       What will the requirements be in the next year as to \n     additional U.S. troops and the cost of our involvement in \n     Afghanistan?\n       What may we reasonably expect NATO or other allies to \n     contribute in troops and dollars to our efforts in \n     Afghanistan?\n       What will be done besides military action, such as nation-\n     building, in stabilizing and developing Afghanistan so that \n     they will be prepared to handle their own problems so that we \n     can withdraw?\n       What assistance can we reasonably expect from Pakistan in \n     fighting the Taliban and stopping the Taliban from seeking \n     refuge by moving in and out of Pakistan?\n       How does the questionable legitimacy of President Karzai's \n     status as a result of allegations or proof of election fraud \n     impact on our ability to succeed in Afghanistan?\n       How does the illegal drug trafficking and alleged \n     involvement of high-ranking officials in the Karzai \n     government in such drug trafficking impact on our efforts in \n     Afghanistan?\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request. I am \n     available to meet with you or your designee for a briefing on \n     these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n       Enclosures.\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2009.\n     Hon.

In evaluating foreign aid to \n     Pakistan. Congress needs to know whether Pakistan could be \n     persuaded to aid us in fighting the Taliban. In retrospect. \n     important judgments were made on Iraq without sufficient \n     accurate, factual information.\n       I am writing to the Secretary of Defense, the Director of \n     National Intelligence and Director of the CIA (copies \n     enclosed) to obtain information principally on military and \n     intelligence matters. My inquiries to you are principally on \n     foreign relation issues involving Afghanistan, Pakistan and \n     India.\n       In August 1995, Senator Hank Brown and I were told by Prime \n     Minister Rao in a visit to New Delhi that India was \n     interested in negotiating with Pakistan to make their \n     subcontinent free of nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Rao \n     asked Senator Brown and me to raise this issue with \n     Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto which we did. I then \n     wrote to President Clinton urging him to broker such \n     negotiations. Those discussions are summarized in a letter \n     which I sent to President Clinton:\n\n                                                  August 28, 1995.\n       Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your \n     personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator \n     Hank Brown and I have had in the last two days with Indian \n     Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto.\n       Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested \n     in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen \n     years including renouncing first use of such weapons. His \n     interest in such negotiations with Pakistan would cover \n     bilateral talks or a regional conference which would include \n     the United States, China and Russia in addition to India and \n     Pakistan.\n       When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last \n     talked to Prime Minister Rao. she said that she had no \n     conversations with him during her tenure as Prime Minister. \n     Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had initiated a \n     contact through an intermediary but that was terminated when \n     a new controversy arose between Pakistan and India.\n       From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime \n     Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United \n     States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     systems.\n       I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment.

Pakistan might be \n     persuaded to increase its military forces to aid us in the \n     fight against the Taliban. I urge you and your Department to \n     undertake an initiative to broker a peace treaty between \n     India and Pakistan if you are not already doing so.\n       I am also interested in your view as to whether India poses \n     a realistic threat to Pakistan which warrants Pakistan \n     devoting military force to that potential threat, which \n     diverts a military contribution which could aid the U.S. in \n     our fight against the Taliban?\n\n[[Page S9493]]\n\n       I am also interested in your view of a proposal for the \n     U.S. to grant substantial foreign aid to Pakistan. I raise \n     this question in the context of Pakistan's failure during \n     President Musharaf's tenure to fulfill its commitments on the \n     $10 billion aid granted by the U.S. from September 11, 2001 \n     to 2007. When Representative Patrick Kennedy and I raised \n     this subject with President Musharaf in a December 2007 \n     meeting in Islamabad, he gave a very unsatisfactory answer.\n       I am available to meet with you or your designee on these \n     subjects.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n       Enclosures.\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2009.\n     Hon.

I am \n     available to meet with you or your designee for a briefing on \n     these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Statement of Senator Arlen Specter--U.S. Policy Regarding Afghanistan\n\n       Mr. President: I seek recognition today to discuss our \n     military presence in Afghanistan. We went into Afghanistan in \n     2001 following the barbaric attacks of September 11, 2001. \n     Our forces swiftly toppled the Taliban and denied Al Qaeda \n     leadership the safe haven it had enjoyed in Afghanistan. Both \n     Taliban and Al Qaeda leadership survived the attack and were \n     able to take refuge and reconstitute in the mountainous \n     regions across the border in Pakistan.\n       The cost of the war has already been high: 821 American \n     servicemembers have died (New York Times--9/16/09) and, \n     according to the Congressional Research Service, $189 billion \n     appropriated to the Department of Defense, the Department of \n     State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the \n     Veterans Administration for medical costs stemming from the \n     war in Afghanistan. By the end of this year, there will be \n     68,000 American military personnel and an additional 38,000 \n     NATO troops from other countries in Afghanistan (Los Angeles \n     Times--9/4/09).\n       Today, according to the commander of U.S. forces in \n     Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, the Taliban again \n     poses a serious threat. U.S. military personnel casualties \n     are mounting and the Pentagon is calling for a build-up of \n     U.S. forces there. Before Congress, or at least this member, \n     can take a position on more U.S. troops for Afghanistan, \n     there is a need for answers to critical questions. To help \n     gather information to allow me to make informed decisions, I \n     sent letters last week to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, \n     Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Director of National \n     Intelligence Dennis Blair, Director of the CIA Leon Panetta \n     and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen \n     posing questions about the current situation in Afghanistan \n     and Pakistan, whether there is a realistic prospect of \n     succeeding there, the importance of the mission in \n     Afghanistan to stopping Al Qaeda from again attacking the \n     United States, and U.S. efforts to engage other regional \n     players such as India to ease tensions in the region [letters \n     attached]. These questions are posed in the context that \n     Congress did not get candid, direct answers to questions \n     posed before the resolution authorizing the use of force in \n     Iraq. Had we known Saddam did not have weapons of mass \n     destruction, the United States would not have gone into Iraq.\n       The paramount question is whether Afghanistan is \n     indispensable for Al Qaeda as a base for organizing another \n     attack against the United States? If so, the United States \n     must do whatever it takes to stop that from happening, as \n     there is no more important national security interest than \n     protection of our citizens. Additional questions which need \n     to be answered include:\n       What are the prospects for military success in Afghanistan \n     against Al Qaeda and the Taliban?\n       What will the requirements be in the next year as to \n     additional U.S. troops and the cost of our involvement in \n     Afghanistan?\n       What may we reasonably expect NATO or other allies to \n     contribute in troops and dollars to our efforts in \n     Afghanistan?\n       What other areas around the world are open to Al Qaeda as \n     potential bases for another attack on the United States?\n       What will be done besides military action, such as nation-\n     building, in stabilizing and developing Afghanistan so that \n     they will be prepared to handle their own problems so that we \n     can withdraw?\n       What assistance can we reasonably expect from Pakistan in \n     fighting the Al Qaeda and the Taliban and stopping both from \n     seeking refuge by moving in and out of Pakistan?\n       How does the questionable legitimacy of President Karzai's \n     status as a result of allegations or proof of election fraud \n     impact on our ability to succeed in Afghanistan?\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\n       How does the illegal drug trafficking and alleged \n     involvement of high-ranking officials in the Karzai \n     government in such drug trafficking impact on our efforts in \n     Afghanistan?\n       What does U.S. intelligence show as to any possible plans \n     by Al Qaeda to attack the United States or anyone else?\n       What does U.S. intelligence show as to whether India poses \n     a real threat to attack Pakistan?\n       What does U.S. intelligence show as to whether Pakistan \n     poses a real threat to attack India?\n       What does U.S. intelligence show as to whether Pakistan \n     could reasonably devote additional military force to \n     assisting us in the fight against the Taliban?\n       What does U.S. intelligence show as to whether the \n     government of Pakistan or some influential officials in the \n     Pakistani government would consider negotiating with India \n     for reducing nuclear weapons or other confidence-building \n     measures to defuse the tension with India if actively \n     encouraged by the U.S. to do so?\n       What does U.S. intelligence show as to whether the \n     government of India or some influential officials in the \n     Indian government would consider negotiating with Pakistan \n     for reducing nuclear weapons or other confidence-building \n     measures to defuse the tension with Pakistan if actively \n     encouraged by the U.S. to do so?\n       In prepared testimony before the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee on September 15, 2009, Admiral Michael Mullen, \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, defined the U.S. \n     mission in Afghanistan as:\n       ``. . . to deny sanctuary to al Qaeda and the Taliban now, \n     and to generate a stable and secure Afghanistan capable of \n     denying al Qaeda return after the withdrawal of our combat \n     forces, and while we sustain partnership and commitment to \n     political and economic development in that nation.''\n       Admiral Mullen later told the Committee:\n       . . . a properly resourced counter-insurgency probably \n     means more forces, without question, more time and more \n     commitment to the protection of the Afghan people and to the \n     development of good governance.''\n       While it would be desirable to protect the Afghan people \n     and see Afghanistan develop good governance, that mission \n     alone does not constitute, in my judgment, a vital national \n     security interest that would warrant putting U.S. troops in \n     harm's way. What has not yet been made clear to me is that a \n     larger U.S. military presence in Afghanistan will further our \n     efforts to deny Al Qaeda a base from which to organize and \n     launch attacks against the U.S. Conversely, I worry that \n     further growing our force in Afghanistan risks committing \n     ourselves to a costly counter-insurgency mission focused on \n     building Afghan governmental institutions--a mission that \n     would require years if not decades to prosecute--when what is \n     in our nation's best interest may be a much more streamlined \n     counter-terrorism mission focused on pursuing Al Qaeda \n     leadership in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\n\n\n                    Securing Pakistan's Cooperation\n\n       Understanding that the Taliban and Al Qaeda reside in both \n     Pakistan and Afghanistan, any U.S. strategy in Afghanistan \n     must account for conditions across the border in Pakistan, \n     and Washington must effectively engage Islamabad as well as \n     Kabul. Questions remain, however, about Pakistan's interest \n     in pursuing a sustained campaign against the Taliban and Al \n     Qaeda on its own soil.\n       Since 2001, the U.S. has given over $15.5 billion in overt \n     aid to Pakistan, according to the Congressional Research \n     Service, of which $10.9 billion has been security related. \n     Where has this money gone? According to a December 24, 2007 \n     New York Times article:\n       ``Money has been diverted to help finance weapons systems \n     designed to counter India, not Al Qaeda or the Taliban, the \n     officials said, adding that the United States has paid tens \n     of millions of dollars in inflated Pakistani reimbursement \n     claims for fuel, ammunition and other costs.''\n       I raised this question during a December 27, 2007 meeting \n     in Islamabad with then-president Pervez Musharraf. I asked \n     Musharraf about Pakistan's record following through on its \n     commitments on the $10 billion in aid granted by the U.S. \n     between September 11, 2001 and 2007 and found his response \n     wholly inadequate. There is a new regime governing in \n     Islamabad now, and I think it crucial that Pakistan will \n     participate fully in the fight against Al Qaeda and the \n     Taliban if the U.S. is to finance it.\n       Before the U.S. sends billions more in aid--both civil and \n     military--to Pakistan, what assurances do we have that it \n     will go to the intended recipients? Dr. Anthony Cordesman, of \n     the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote on \n     April 10, 2009:\n       ``Far too much of the military portion of the . . . past \n     U.S. aid to Pakistan never was used to help fight the Taliban \n     and al Qaeda or can't be accounted for. Future aid should be \n     clearly tied to clearly defined goals for Pakistani action \n     and full accounting for the money.''\n       Is it possible to get Pakistan to focus on the threat posed \n     by Al Qaeda and the Taliban in its tribal regions when \n     Islamabad perceives an existential threat to lie next door in \n     India? Or, will Pakistan continue to divert U.S. aid to \n     bolster defenses along its Indian border, as alleged in an \n     August 30, 2009 New York Times article, which said:\n       ``The United States has accused Pakistan of illegally \n     modifying American-made missiles to expand its capability to \n     strike land targets, a potential threat to India . . .''\n       I think we need to understand that any reorientation of \n     Islamabad's strategic calculus--specifically a change of \n     perception that the existential threat lies to its west in \n     the form of Al Qaeda and the Taliban rather than to the east \n     in India--will have to emerge internally. No amount of money \n     we give Islamabad is going to convince it otherwise. The \n     current proposal by Senators Kerry and Lugar to spend $7.5 \n     billion over five years to strengthen Pakistan's civilian \n     institutions is worth considering, but this alone would not \n     guarantee Pakistan's cooperation in committing fully to the \n     fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. More important than \n     giving money, I believe, is the U.S. undertaking to broker a \n     lasting peace between India and Pakistan.\n\n\n                    Towards an India-Pakistan Peace\n\n       In August 1995, Senator Hank Brown and I were told by Prime \n     Minister Rao in a visit to New Delhi that India was \n     interested in negotiating with Pakistan to make their \n     subcontinent free of nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Rao \n     asked Senator Brown and me to raise this issue with \n     Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto which we did. I then \n     wrote to President Clinton urging him to broker such \n     negotiations. Those discussions are summarized in a letter \n     which I sent to President Clinton:\n\n                                                  August 28, 1995.\n       Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your \n     personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator \n     Hank Brown and I have had in the last two days with Indian \n     Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto.\n       Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested \n     in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen \n     years including renouncing first use of such weapons. His \n     interest in such negotiations with Pakistan would cover \n     bilateral talks or a regional conference which would include \n     the United States, China and Russia in addition to India and \n     Pakistan.\n       When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last \n     talked to Prime Minister Rao, she said that she had no \n     conversations with him during her tenure as Prime Minister. \n     Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had initiated a \n     contact through an intermediary but that was terminated when \n     a new controversy arose between Pakistan and India.\n       From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime \n     Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United \n     States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     systems.\n       I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment. I \n     am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       After returning to the United States, I discussed such a \n     presidential initiative with President Clinton, but my \n     suggestion was not pursued.\n       If the current tensions and hostilities between India and \n     Pakistan could be eliminated or reduced, Pakistan might be \n     persuaded to increase its military forces to aid us in the \n     fight against the Taliban. On September 9, 2009, I wrote to \n     Secretary Clinton to urge her to work to mediate dialogue \n     between India and Pakistan in the hope of easing bilateral \n     tensions to enable Pakistan to focus more intently on the \n     problem posed by Al Qaeda and the Taliban along its western \n     border.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Congress will be called upon to make important decision on \n     the war in Afghanistan that will have consequences for years \n     to come both in Southwestern Asia and here at home. As I said \n     on the Senate floor on October 7, 2002, the authorization of \n     the use of military force is a core duty of Congress which \n     this institution must not delegate to the Executive Branch:\n       ``. . . the doctrine of separation of powers precludes the \n     Congress from delegating its core constitutional authority to \n     the executive branch. . . . Congress may not delegate the \n     authority to engage in war. If we authorize the President to \n     use whatever force is necessary, that contemplates further \n     action. While no one is going to go to court to challenge the \n     President's authority, that is of some concern, at least to \n     this Senator.''\n       Congress must ask the tough questions about what an \n     expansion of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan would \n     accomplish. On October 7, 2002, in the lead up to the \n     authorization of the use of force in Iraq, I raised similar \n     questions on the Senate floor:\n       ``What was the extent of Saddam Hussein's control over \n     weapons of mass destruction? What would it cost by way of \n     casualties to topple Saddam Hussein? What would be the \n     consequence in Iraq? Who would govern after Saddam was \n     toppled? What would happen in the region, the impact on the \n     Arab world, and the impact on Israel?''\n       In retrospect, Congress should have been more diligent and \n     insistent on getting candid, accurate answers to such \n     questions. It would have been a help to President George W. \n     Bush to have had answers to these questions candidly and \n     correctly in determining his policy. It would now be a help \n     to President Obama to have congressional input on\n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\n     posing relevant, tough questions and getting candid, correct \n     answers. While the Constitution gives the President paramount \n     authority as Commander-in-Chief, the Constitution gives the \n     Congress the sole authority to declare war. That \n     congressional authority and responsibility have not been \n     appropriately exercised considering what has happened in \n     Korea and Vietnam and in the resolutions authorizing the use \n     of force in Iraq in 1991 and 2002, none of which constituted \n     congressional declarations of war.\n       On the ultimate issue of increased U.S. forces: Congress \n     should not, and this member will not, support a policy of \n     increasing U.S. forces in Afghanistan until such policy is \n     warranted by candid and correct factual information and \n     preferable alternatives cannot achieve the desired \n     objectives.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as we speak, there is an announcement \ncoming from the White House, it is my understanding, that they are \ngoing to cancel the Eastern European sites we have been working on for \nsuch a long period of time. I think it is appropriate to quote \nsomething I saw many years ago and was foreseen by President Reagan \nwhen he was President. He said:\n\n       Since the dawn of the atomic age, we have sought to reduce \n     the risk of war by maintaining a strong deterrent and by \n     seeking genuine arms control. Deterrence: Making sure the \n     adversary who thinks about attacking the United States or our \n     allies or our vital interests concludes that the risks to him \n     outweigh any potential gains. Once he understands that, he \n     won't attack. We maintain the peace through our strength; \n     weakness only invites aggression.\n\n  I wish people today would understand those words of Ronald Reagan \nquite some time ago and how prophetic they were as we look right now \nand see the administration is talking about canceling this program.\n  I arranged to be in Afghanistan at the time Secretary of Defense \nGates announced the budget, I believe last February, the Obama budget, \nso far as defense was concerned. I was very much concerned. I was \nconcerned about what happened to the F-22. Initially, we were going to \nhave the only fifth-generation fighter that this country has. We, \ninitially, were going to have 750 of them. He terminated the program at \n187.\n  I was concerned about the termination of the C-17 program. I was \nconcerned about the termination of the Future Combat System. The Future \nCombat System is the only ground system that has gone through a major \nchange in probably 50 or 60 years. So we will not have that improved \nground capability for our young men and women who go into harm's way.\n  Also, I made the comment that I suspected at that time, when he \nsuspended the radar site in the Czech Republic and the interception \ncapability in Poland, that that was easing into terminating that \nprogram. I think we are finding out today he is terminating that \nprogram.\n  On February 3, 2009, Iran launched a satellite, on the 30th \nanniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. On July 9 of 2008, Iran \ntested nine missiles, including the Shahab-3, which has a range of \n1,240 miles.\n  I recognize the threat to Western Europe--this wouldn't quite do it. \nIt is 1,240 miles. I think the range in order to be able to get \nsomething to Italy would be about 2,000 miles.\n  On the other hand, we never guess these things right. I remember so \nwell, in 1998, the Clinton administration made a statement in response \nto a question I asked on August 14, 1998: How long will it be until \nthey have the multiple-stage capability in North Korea? The White House \nresponded it was going to be between 10 and 15 years. Seven days later, \non August 13, 1998, they fired it.\n  This is how far off we are in our intelligence. We don't know. I \ndon't want to guess this thing too close. Riki Ellison from the Missile \nDefense Advocacy Alliance said:\n\n       The Islamic Republic of Iran has just proved for the first \n     time that it has the capability to place satellites in space \n     by successfully launching a 3-stage liquid fueled rocket that \n     has placed two objects in low-Earth orbit. . . .Iran has \n     demonstrated the key technologies of propulsion, staging, and \n     guidance to deliver a weapon of mass destruction globally.\n\n  I am hoping the White House doesn't come out and say that is \nlaunching a satellite. It is the same technology, launching a nuclear \nwarhead. This is getting very serious right now. The U.S. intelligence \ncommunity has estimated Iran may have long-range ballistic missiles \ncapable of threatening all of Western Europe and the United States by \n2015.\n  Madam President, 2015, that sounds reminiscent of August of 1998, \nwhen they said it would be 10 to 15 years. Delaying this creates all \nkinds of problems for us. Our credibility in Eastern Europe is \nsomething that bothers me. I was recently in the Czech Republic. \nPresident Vaclav Klaus--they were cooperative in saying yes. The \nParliament debated it and decided we could put a radar site there which \nwould allow us to see something coming in; otherwise, we would not be \nable to do it. Then, next door in Poland, to have an interception \ncapability--they agreed to do that. Parliament didn't want to do it. \nThey were concerned about Russia's response and a lot of opposition \nthat there might be. The thing I do not understand is why Western \nEurope is not lining up with us and saying we have to have those two \nsites. They are the ones who are naked now if we don't have that.\n  I am very much concerned about that. MG Vladimir Dvorkin, who is the \nhead of the Center for Strategic Forces in Moscow, said: ``Iran is \nactively working on a missile program,'' adding that Iran is ``1 or 2 \nyears'' from having a nuclear weapon. This concerns me. We have those \nindividuals we seem to be catering to, the Russians, in order to leave \nourselves without a type of defensive system to protect Western Europe \nand the Eastern United States. It is troubling to me.\n  In April 2009, North Korea furthered their missile and nuclear \ndevelopment by a Taepodong-2 missile in the China Sea. That has a range \nof over 2,000--about 2,500 miles. That would reach Rome. That would \nreach Berlin. There has to be a concern that they have this capability, \nthey have demonstrated this capability very clearly.\n  NATO leaders stated in December of 2008, last Christmas, that:\n\n       Ballistic missile proliferation poses increasing threat to \n     allied forces, territory and populations. Missile defense \n     forms a part of the broader response to counter this threat. \n     We therefore recognize the substantial contribution to the \n     protection of allies from long range ballistic missiles to be \n     provided by a planned development of the European-based \n     United States missile defense assets.\n\n  That is what we are talking about. In Poland, the site in Poland \nwould include up to 10 silo-based, long-range interceptors capable of \nshooting down hostile missiles from Iran in their midcourse. Let's put \nthe chart up here.\n  A lot of people do not realize this is very sophisticated. Our \nmissile defense system takes into consideration three courses. For the \nsegment here, the boost phase, we don't have anything there yet. We are \nsupposed to be working on it. I was disturbed that one of the things \nthat was terminated by this administration is that effort.\n  The terminal defense segment is one we are working on right now. The \nairborne laser in the boost phase is one of the programs I believe the \nadministration is canceling. The site in Poland would include up to 10 \nsilo-based, long-range interceptors. The radar site in\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\nthe Czech Republic would house a narrow beam midcourse tracking radar \nthat is currently used by our missile defense system in the Pacific. \nThese are things we know work.\n  I am very concerned about it. I have not heard the statement from the \nWhite House, but I have a feeling we are going to hear the same thing \nwe heard back in 1998, and it is very troubling. This is something that \ncan be--should be an act of desperation in terms of Western Europe at \nthis time.\n\n\n                             Cap and Trade\n\n  Having said that, this is some good news. That was the bad news. The \ngood news is we have notice this morning that the Democratic caucus, as \nreported in Politico, is split over the bill, the cap-and-trade bill we \nare talking about, with coal-, oil- and manufacturing-State Democrats \nraising concerns that a cap-and-trade system would disproportionately \nspike electricity bills for consumers and businesses in their regions.\n  There is a recognition now that this thing we have been talking about \never since the Kyoto treaty--the threat at that time that they were \ntalking about is now. Everyone realizes that is not what it was. \nScience has changed dramatically and most scientists now are saying \nthis is something that was overstated that one time.\n  The cost, though, is the big thing. I quit arguing about the science \na long time ago. I gave a speech from this podium not too long ago. If \nanyone is interested, I ask my colleagues to go to the Web site \ninhofe.senate.gov, where we listed 700 scientists who were on the other \nside of the issue who are now on the skeptics' side, recognizing the \nscience is not there. David Bellamy from Great Britain is one who was \nalways talking about--he was on Al Gore's side on this thing. After \ngoing through and restudying and reevaluating the science, he agreed \neverything wasn't there.\n  The same thing is true with leaders in France and Israel. But what we \nhave now is something people do understand and that is the cost of \nthis, the consistent cost. Kyoto's cost, if we lived by the emission \nstandard, would be somewhere, according to the Wharton Econometric \nSurvey, I think it was called back during the Kyoto days, would be \nbetween $300 billion and $330 billion every year. As bad as the \nstimulus was, at least that is a one-shot deal and the people would not \nhave to pay for it every year. This will be every year.\n  Then along came McCain-Lieberman in 2003 and 2005 and the same \nestimates came about that it would be a $300 billion tax increase. I \nremember 1993 when we had the Clinton-Gore tax increase, which was the \nlargest tax increase in three decades.\n  During that time we looked at it, it was a $32 billion tax increase: \nincreasing inheritance taxes, marginal rates, capital gains, and all of \nthat. That is only $32 billion. This is 10 times that size.\n  Well, the White House was trying to say, and several of them on the \nother side in our committee--in fact, the chairman of our committee--it \nis going to cost a postage stamp a day. People are willing to pay for \nthat.\n  Those postage stamps must be getting pretty expensive. Now we have \nfound out there is an analysis released by the U.S. Department of \nTreasury that was held down, not released. Now we know what it is. They \nsaid the cost would be between $100 and $200 billion a year.\n  The cost--this is according to their figures now--to an American \nhousehold would be an extra $1,761 a year. This is their analysis. I \nthink that is right. In fact, we have seen the CRA report that shows \nthe cost of this--and MIT agrees with this, I might add, because they \nevaluated the Warner-Lieberman bill 12 months ago--right now being \ncloser to $366 billion a year, with a cost per family, the study has \nshown, in my State of Oklahoma and in the State of Texas, we would be \nthe highest taxed. It would be $3,300 a year per family. That is huge. \nI know the east coast and the west coast is a little bit more than half \nof that, but still it is a huge tax increase.\n  Finally, this report that was put together by the Department of \nTreasury has been released. And they admit it. So we can quit talking \nabout some of these things that are not realistic.\n  We know what the cost is. We know also the likelihood of it coming up \nthis year is most unusual. I do not think it is going to happen. The \nSenate majority leader stated, I think 2 days ago, that the Senate may \nnot act on comprehensive energy and climate change legislation.\n  Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, a Democrat, I might add, said: We \nhave enough on our plate at the moment. With the fight over health care \nreform, it is questionable to open another front.\n  The Senate majority whip, Dick Durbin, last week added that: It is a \ndifficult schedule. Members are already anxious about health care \nreform. So I do not think it is going to come up. And I frankly will be \nready here to fight to make sure it does not come up when the new year \ncomes in.\n  I do not think there are too many people in the Senate who want to go \ninto their reelection in 2010 having voted for the largest tax increase \nin the history of America. This is exactly what it would be. Let's keep \nin mind, what was the largest tax increase in the history of America \nwas the 1993 tax increase. This would be 10 times greater than that. \nAnd the people now realize that. That was good news today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9496-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9496-S9497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MEL MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to add my comments to a few other \ncomments on Mel Martinez whom we all loved so much. I do not think I \nhave ever seen anyone since Jesse Helms who was loved by so many people \nas Mel Martinez. He had a way of smiling, and in talking about things \nin a way that others did not understand. My colleagues have already \ncome to the floor and talked about his escape from Cuba and how he came \nover and how then he was able to get his father over. It is a story \nthat America will always remember. It will always be in our history \nbooks.\n  He was always such a great guy. He will be missed around here.\n  One of the things that was not said much about him was his sense of \nhumor. I have to say I enjoyed being around him because he was, in his \nown subtle way, a very humorous person. I can remember, and I have had \nthe occasion, probably more than any other Member, going into the areas \nin Iraq and Afghanistan and Africa where there were hostilities. But I \nwas making probably my 12th or 14th trip into Baghdad on a C-130. It \nhappened to be Mel Martinez's first trip. So we were talking about: \nOnce you get out, you are going to run over to the helicopter, and they \nare going to take you to the Green Zone, all of the things to \nanticipate. I said to him: One of the problems we are going to have is \nthat when we leave, we have these old C-130E models. They should be re-\nengined. We should have J models, but we do not. Because of the cuts in \nthe military, we have not been able to upgrade those systems.\n  So I said: When we climb out of here, it is going to be in a C-130E \nmodel. We are not going to be able to climb as high and as fast as we \nwant, and there are surface-to-air missiles out there that we have to \nbe concerned about. And, of course, they are all set up. We have very \ncapable pilots and crews in these C-130s. So I said: We will be well \ntaken care of if something happens. Sure enough, it happened.\n  The first thing you do when you get out of your helicopter in Baghdad \nto get on a C-130 to come back to Kuwait or wherever you might be going \nis you take your helmet, your life jacket, your vest off, because they \nare so heavy and uncomfortable--you get in there and you take them off. \nWell, we all did that.\n  I was sitting up with, as I do quite often, the pilots, when all of a \nsudden the explosion came, the light was there, and we deployed the \nheat-seeking devices that are on a C-130. Of course, that is already \nvery loud. Someone who has never gone through that experience before \nwould assume we were about to go down.\n  I ran downstairs and I saw Mel Martinez sitting there without his \nhelmet, without his protective vest by him; he had put them back on. I \nsaid: Mel, what are you doing putting your vest and your helmet back \non?\n  He said: Well, I assumed that we were going to be shot down. And if \nKitty--that is his wife--if she found out that I did not have my vest \nand my helmet on, she would kill me.\n\n[[Page S9497]]\n\n  Well, that is Mel Martinez. He had all of those jewels. I think he is \ngoing to be missed by a lot of us for all of the reasons we have \narticulated on the floor.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Thank you very much. Would the Chair please let me \nknow when I have 1 minute remaining.\n  Monday on the Senate floor, I expressed my concern about the number \nof so-called czars in the White House and in the administration. I said \nthen that the number of czars--I believe the number is now 32--is an \naffront to the Constitution. It is anti-democratic. It is a poor \nexample of what was promised to be a new era of transparency. It is a \npoor way to manage the government. And it is the most visible symptom \nof this administration's 8-month record of too many Washington \ntakeovers.\n  Yesterday, the White House blog and a White House press secretary \nobjected to what I said on Monday, pointing out that I had supported \nmanufacturing czars and AIDS czars 6 years ago. Of course I did; I \nacknowledged that in my remarks on Monday. As I said Monday, there have \nalways been some czars in the White House and in the government since \nFranklin D. Roosevelt was President. Some of them were appointed by \nPresidents, some of them were created by statute, and a few of them \nwere confirmed by the Senate. There's never been anything like we've \nseen with this administration.\n  Also on Monday, I joined in a letter from Senator Collins, Senator \nBond, Senator Crapo, Senator Bennett, and Senator Roberts, making clear \nthat not every czar is a problem. In that letter, we identified at \nleast 18 czar positions created by the Obama administration whose \nreported responsibilities may be undermining the constitutional \noversight responsibilities of Congress or express statutory assignments \nof responsibility to other executive branch officials.\n  In this letter from Senator Collins, in which the rest of us joined, \nwe said: With regard to each of these positions, we ask that you \nexplain: the specific authorities and responsibilities of the position, \nincluding any limitations you have placed on the position to ensure \nthat it does not encroach on the legitimate statutory responsibilities \nof other executive branch officials.\n  Second, the process by which the administration examines the \ncharacter and qualifications of the individuals appointed by the \nPresident to fill the position.\n  And, third, whether the individual occupying the position will agree \nto any reasonable request to appear before, or provide information to, \nCongress.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       We also urge you to refrain from creating similar \n     additional positions or making appointments to any vacant \n     czar positions until you have fully consulted with the \n     appropriate Congressional committees.\n       Finally, we ask that you reconsider your approach of \n     centralizing authority at the White House. Congress has \n     grappled repeatedly with the question of how to organize the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  We went into some detail about that, and asked respectfully that the \nPresident consult carefully with Congress prior to establishing any \nadditional czars.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from six senators be \nincluded in the Record following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Collins and the five of us who joined in her \nletter were not the only Senators to be concerned about this issue. On \nWednesday, Senator Feingold, the Democrat from Wisconsin, questioned \nPresident Obama's policy of policy czars and sent a letter to the \nPresident, just as we did. In that letter, Senator Feingold urged the \nPresident to release information about the role and responsibility of \nthese czars, which is what we asked him to do in our letter as well.\n  Senator Hutchison of Texas, in the Washington Post on September 13, \nwrote an excellent op-ed describing how the system of checks and \nbalances is upset by an excessive number of Washington czars who are \nunconfirmed and unaccountable to the Congress, and who do not answer \nquestions from those of us who are elected to ask such questions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold's letter to the \nPresident be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2).\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. On Monday, I pointed out that not only Senator \nHutchison and Senator Collins and the other Republican Senators have \nthese concerns. Now Senator Feingold from the other side of the aisle \nhas raised questions about these czars.\n  I mentioned this Monday, but I want to repeat it in case the White \nHouse press office missed it: Senator Byrd, our President Pro Tempore, \nwidely considered by all of us in the Senate to be the constitutional \nconscience of this Senate, was the first to write the president \nexpressing concerns over the increasing appointment of White House \nczars.\n  In his letter he said:\n\n       Too often I have seen these lines of authority and \n     responsibility become tangled and blurred, sometimes \n     purposely, to shield information and to obscure the decision-\n     making process.\n\n  Senator Byrd went on to say that:\n\n       The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House \n     staff can threaten the constitutional system of checks and \n     balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken \n     direction and control of problematic areas that are the \n     statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\n\n  Senator Byrd continues:\n\n       As Presidential assistants and advisers, these White House \n     staffers are not accountable for their actions to Congress, \n     to cabinet officials, and to virtually anyone but the \n     President. They rarely testify before Congressional \n     committees, and often shield the information and decision-\n     making process behind the assertion of executive privilege.\n\n  In too many instances, White House staff have been allowed to inhibit \nopenness and transparency, and reduce accountability.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record following my \nremarks a list of 18 new czars created by the Obama administration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I want to make it clear to the White House Press \nOffice that we are focused on those 18 new czars. We recognize there \nhave been czars before, that for the reasons Senator Byrd, Senator \nHutchison, Senator Collins, and others have described. We believe this \nis too many, and we take seriously our responsibilities under Article \nII of the Constitution to confirm officials who manage the government, \nto ask them questions, to approve their appropriations, and to withhold \ntheir appropriations when it's appropriate.\n  We have these positions in the Executive Office of the President; \nthere are 10 of them: central region czar, Dennis Ross; cyber-security \nczar, domestic violence czar, economic czar, energy and environment \nczar, and health czar. Those are some of the biggest issues facing \nCongress, and here are these czars with authority for policy close to \nthe President but unaccountable to us. We have a senior director for \ninformation sharing policy, urban affairs czar, WMD policy czar, a \ngreen job czar, who resigned recently. Those are the positions in the \nExecutive Office of the President, 10 new ones. Then there are eight \nmore that are in departments or agencies, including: Afghanistan czar, \nauto recovery czar, car czar, Great Lakes czar, pay czar, Guantanamo \nclosure czar, international climate czar, and the border czar.\n  I described on Monday, as Senator Byrd has said more eloquently, the \nproblems with too many czars. The first problem is the constitutional\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\nchecks and balances described by Senator Byrd. The second problem is \nthat this is a poor way to manage the government. When I was a young \nWhite House aide, I was taught that the job of the White House staff is \nto push the merely important issues out of the White House so you can \nreserve to the President the handful of truly Presidential issues for \nhis attention. His job is to set the country's agenda, to see an urgent \nneed and devise a strategy, meet the need and persuade at least half \nthe people he is right. He can do that more effectively if the \ngovernment is managed by Secretaries and Cabinet officers.\n  Finally, czars are anti-democratic. Czars are usually Russian, not \nAmerican. Czars are usually imperialists, not Democrats. The dictionary \nsays czars are autocratic rulers or leaders. That is not consistent \nwith the kind of government we want. It is alien to our way of \nthinking.\n  Czars are becoming the most visible symbol of this administration's \ndetermination to have an increasing number of Washington takeovers: \nbanks, insurance companies, student loans, car companies, even farm \nponds. Some want to take over health care. Many Americans believe we \nhave a runaway government with too many Washington takeovers, and the \nlast thing we need are 18 new czars unaccountable to elected officials \nwhose job it is to check and balance that government.\n  I am glad in a way that the White House has noticed my comments and \nthose of Senators Collins, Bennett, Hutchison, and others. I hope they \nwill respond to Senator Collins' letter, to Senator Feingold's request, \nand to other admonitions. We call on the administration to answer \nquestions posed by these Senators: Who are these czars? What is their \nrole? What is their responsibility? How were they vetted? What \nlimitations are on their positions to make sure they don't encroach on \nlegitimate statutory responsibilities of other executive branch \nofficials, and will they agree to a reasonable request to appear before \nCongress?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Homeland Security and \n           Governmental Affairs,\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 2009.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to express our growing concern \n     with the proliferation of ``czars'' in your Administration. \n     These positions raise serious issues of accountability, \n     transparency, and oversight. The creation of ``czars,'' \n     particularly within the Executive Office of the President, \n     circumvents the constitutionally established process of \n     ``advise and consent,'' greatly diminishes the ability of \n     Congress to conduct oversight and hold officials accountable, \n     and creates confusion about which officials are responsible \n     for policy decisions.\n       To be clear, we do not consider every position identified \n     in various reports as a ``czar'' to be problematic. Positions \n     established by law or subject to Senate confirmation, such as \n     the Director of National Intelligence, the Homeland Security \n     Advisor, and the Chairman of the Recovery Accountability and \n     Transparency Board, do not raise the same kinds of concerns \n     as positions that you have established within the Executive \n     Office of the President that are largely insulated from \n     effective Congressional oversight. We also recognize that \n     Presidents are entitled to surround themselves with experts \n     who can serve as senior advisors.\n       Many ``czars'' you have appointed, however, either \n     duplicate or dilute the statutory authority and \n     responsibilities that Congress has conferred upon Cabinet-\n     level officers and other senior Executive branch officials. \n     When established within the White House, these ``czars'' can \n     hinder the ability of Congress to oversee the complex \n     substantive issues that you have unilaterally entrusted to \n     their leadership. Whether in the White House or elsewhere. \n     the authorities of these advisors are essentially undefined. \n     They are not subject to the Senate's constitutional ``advice \n     and consent'' role, including the Senate's careful review of \n     the character and qualifications of the individuals nominated \n     by the President to fill the most senior positions within our \n     government. Indeed, many of these new ``czars'' appear to \n     occupy positions of greater responsibility and authority than \n     many of the officials who have been confirmed by the Senate \n     to fill positions within your Administration.\n       With these concerns in mind, we have identified at least 18 \n     ``czar'' positions created by your Administration whose \n     reported responsibilities may be undermining the \n     constitutional oversight responsibilities of Congress or \n     express statutory assignments of responsibility to other \n     Executive branch officials. With regard to each of these \n     positions, we ask that you explain:\n       The specific authorities and responsibilities of the \n     position, including any limitations you have placed on the \n     position to ensure that it does not encroach on the \n     legitimate statutory responsibilities of other Executive \n     branch officials;\n       The process by which the Administration examines the \n     character and qualifications of the individuals appointed by \n     the President to fill the position; and,\n       Whether the individual occupying the position will agree to \n     any reasonable request to appear before, or provide \n     information to, Congress.\n       We also urge you to refrain from creating similar \n     additional positions or making appointments to any vacant \n     ``czar'' positions until you have fully consulted with the \n     appropriate Congressional committees.\n       Finally, we ask that you reconsider your approach of \n     centralizing authority at the White House. Congress has \n     grappled repeatedly with the question of how to organize the \n     federal government. We have worked to improve the Department \n     of Homeland Security and bring together the disparate law \n     enforcement, intelligence, emergency response, and security \n     components that form its core. We established the Director of \n     National Intelligence to coordinate the activities of the 16 \n     elements of the Intelligence Community, breaking down \n     barriers to cooperation that led to intelligence failures \n     before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The \n     bipartisan review by the Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs Committee of the failures associated with the \n     response to Hurricane Katrina led to fundamental reforms of \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency, improving our \n     nation's preparedness and ability to respond to disasters. In \n     each of these cases, the Congress's proposed solution did not \n     consolidate power in a single czar locked away in a White \n     House office. Instead, working in a bipartisan fashion, we \n     created a transparent framework of accountable leaders with \n     the authorities necessary to accomplish their vital missions.\n       If you believe action is needed to address other failures \n     or impediments to successful coordination within the \n     Executive branch, we ask that you consult carefully with \n     Congress prior to establishing any additional ``czar'' \n     positions or filling any existing vacancies in these \n     positions. We stand ready to work with you to address these \n     challenges and to provide our nation's most senior leaders \n     with the legitimacy necessary to do their jobs--without \n     furthering the accountability, oversight, vetting, and \n     transparency shortcomings associated with ``czars.''\n           Sincerely,\n     Susan M. Collins,\n     Lamar Alexander,\n     Christopher S. Bond,\n     Mike Crapo,\n     Pat Roberts,\n     Robert F. Bennett,\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n          [From the Hill's Blog Briefing Room, Sept. 16, 2009]\n\n                    Feingold questions Obama `czars'\n\n                           (By Jordan Fabian)\n\n       A liberal senator on Wednesday questioned President Barack \n     Obama's policy ``czars'' after the senior advisers have taken \n     heat mostly from Republican lawmakers.\n       Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) sent a letter to the president \n     requesting the White House release information regarding the \n     ``roles and responsibilities'' of the ``czars.'' The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee member also requested that the \n     president's legal advisers prepare a ``judgment'' on the \n     ``czars'' constitutionality.\n       Feingold's letter represents one of the first examples of \n     Democratic scrutiny of the president's ``czars,'' who are not \n     required to be confirmed by the Senate.\n       Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), who has been absent from the \n     Senate since experiencing health issues, also expressed \n     skepticism of Obama's use of policy ``czars'' in February.\n       Republicans in Congress ramped up criticism of the the \n     appointed advisers following the resignation of former green \n     jobs czar Van Jones after his signature was found on a \n     petition implying the Bush administration played a role in \n     the 9/11 terrorist attacks and making other controversial \n     statements.\n       Earlier today, Reps. Darrell Issa (Calif.) and Lamar Smith \n     (R-Tex.), the top Republicans on the House Oversight and \n     Government Reform Committee and the House Judiciary Committee \n     respectively, sent a similar letter to White House counsel \n     Greg Craig.\n       Energy and Environment ``czar'' Carol Browner, and FCC \n     Diversity ``czar'' Mark Lloyd have also faced flak after they \n     made other questionable remarks.\n\n     The President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: From the beginning of your \n     administration, you have made an admirable commitment to \n     transparency and open government. You showed the strength of \n     your commitment by sending a memorandum to the heads of \n     executive departments and agencies within a week of your \n     inauguration, stating: ``My administration will take \n     appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to \n     disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can \n     readily find and use.''\n       As you know, there has been much discussion about your \n     decisions to create and assign apparently significant policy-\n     making\n\n[[Page S9499]]\n\n     responsibilities to White House and other executive \n     positions; many of the persons filling these positions have \n     come to be referred to in the media and even within your \n     administration as policy ``czars.'' I heard firsthand about \n     this issue on several occasions from my constituents in \n     recent town hall meetings in Wisconsin.\n       The Constitution gives the Senate the duty to oversee the \n     appointment of Executive officers through the Appointments \n     Clause in Article II, section 2. The Appointments Clause \n     states that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint \n     ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of \n     the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United \n     States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise proved \n     for, and which shall be established by law.'' This clause is \n     an important part of the constitutional scheme of separation \n     of powers, empowering the Senate to weigh in on the \n     appropriateness of significant appointments and assisting in \n     its oversight of the Executive Branch.\n       As a member of the Senate with the duty to oversee \n     executive appointments and as the Chairman of the Senate \n     Constitution Subcommittee, I respectfully urge you to \n     disclose as much information as you can about these policy \n     advisors and ``czars.'' Specifically, I ask that you identify \n     these individuals' roles and responsibilities, and provide \n     the judgment(s) of your legal advisors as to whether and how \n     these positions are consistent with the Appointments Clause. \n     I hope that this information will help address some of the \n     concerns that have been raised about new positions in the \n     White House and elsewhere in the Executive Branch, and will \n     inform any hearing that the Subcommittee holds on this topic.\n       Thank you for considering my views on this important \n     matter. I very much appreciate your commitment to \n     transparency and open government and look forward to your \n     prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Russell D.

No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western red cedar. Program accomplishments shall be based \n     on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in the current fiscal \n     year, the annual average portion of the decadal allowable \n     sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land \n     Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised \n     using a residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska \n     values for western red cedar, all of the western red cedar \n     timber from those sales which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made available to \n     domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at \n     prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in the \n     current fiscal year, less than the annual average portion of \n     the decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the Tongass \n     Land Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when \n     appraised using a residual value approach that assigns \n     domestic Alaska values for western red cedar, the volume of \n     western red cedar timber available to domestic processors at \n     prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 United States \n     shall be that volume: (1) which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska; and (2) is that percent of the \n     surplus western red cedar volume determined by calculating \n     the ratio of the total timber volume which has been sold on \n     the Tongass to the annual average portion of the decadal \n     allowable sale quantity called for in the current Tongass \n     Land Management Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by \n     Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is sold (for \n     purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean \n     that the determination of how much western red cedar is \n     eligible for sale to various markets shall be made at the \n     time each sale is awarded). Western red cedar shall be deemed \n     ``surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' \n     when the timber sale holder has presented to the Forest \n     Service documentation of the inability to sell western red \n     cedar logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska processors at \n     a price equal to or greater than the log selling value stated \n     in the contract. All additional western red cedar volume not \n     sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 United States domestic \n     processors may be exported to foreign markets at the election \n     of the timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be \n     sold at prevailing export prices at the election of the \n     timber sale holder.\n\n              colorado cooperative conservation authority\n\n       Sec. 418.

Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Alexander, in presenting the fiscal year 2010 Interior and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill. This is the first year Senator \nAlexander and I have worked together as chairmen and ranking member of \nthe Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. I am very pleased to report \nthat it could not have been a better experience. We have consulted on \nseveral occasions and worked through several different issues. As a \nresult, I think we have produced a fair, balanced, and workable bill. I \nthank him very much, and his able staff, for all their hard work and \ncooperation.\n  In total, the fiscal year 2010 Interior appropriations bill provides \n$32.1 billion in nonemergency discretionary spending. That amount is \n$4.5 billion above the equivalent 2009 enacted level but $225 million \nbelow the President's request. I wish to stress that. This bill is $225 \nmillion below the President's request.\n  The reason is to make it consistent with the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays. Our allocation is \nsubstantially lower than that of the House of Representatives. \nTherefore, our bill is necessarily constrained. We cannot spend above \nour allocation. So there are going to be several items that will be \nconferenced in that regard.\n  Because the committee's report, which spells out all of the funding \ndetails, has been publicly available for more than 2 months, I won't go \nthrough each and every line item. But I would like to emphasize the \ngreat strides we have been able to make in five critical areas: water \nand sewer infrastructure, wildfire suppression and prevention on public \nland, bolstering our public land management agencies, investment in the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, and helping the most vulnerable in \nIndian Country.\n  First, in these five key areas, the bill provides $3.6 billion for \nwater and sewer infrastructure projects. I am proud of this. That is a \nsignificant increase over last year's level of $1.6 billion. In fact, \nthis is the largest single commitment of funds that has ever been \nprovided in an annual appropriations bill.\n  Let me say something about this. When we look at America's \ninfrastructure, I can say that I am old enough, regretfully--I guess I \nam delighted I have survived--to remember when everyone could drink \nwater out of every tap anywhere in America. You can imagine what I \nthought when I saw the front of the New York Times with the young lad \nfrom West Virginia with fillings all over his mouth because he couldn't \ndrink water properly out of the tap, when there was other evidence of \npeople in that great State bathing in water that created skin lesions. \nThat should not be the case in the United States. Therefore, this \nsignificant increase in water and sewer infrastructure is \nextraordinarily important.\n  Additionally, I hope we will have report language in our bill in \nconsultation with the ranking member that will instruct EPA to put much \nmore regulatory authority in the area of water quality so we don't run \ninto these areas. This is something I have not yet had a chance to talk \nwith the ranking member about, but I do intend to do that.\n  When we factor in the $6 billion included in the stimulus bill in \nFebruary, we are providing nearly $10 billion this calendar year to \nState and local water authorities. This is a major investment in public \ninfrastructure and one that, as a former mayor, I strongly support and \nam very pleased to be able, along with my ranking member, to \naccomplish.\n  This money will allow State and local water authorities to begin to \ntackle 1,327 wastewater and drinking water projects all across the \nNation. For those who may not be aware, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, which administers these grants, has estimated that over a 20-\nyear period communities will need to spend $660 billion--not million--\nfor drinking water and wastewater infrastructure repairs and \nrenovations. Obviously, we can't provide that level of funding during \nthese tough budgetary times. But what we were able to provide, with a \nreduced allocation, will go a long way toward helping communities \ntackle their crumbling infrastructure and provide residents with more \nreliable and cleaner water. It will also have the benefit of creating \nthousands of construction jobs to put more Americans back to work.\n  Secondly, the bill provides $1.8 billion for wildland fire \nsuppression activities. It is very important that we are providing that \nlevel of funding because that is the same amount that has been spent on \naverage in each of the last 3 fiscal years. So for the first time in \nmore than 10 years, we will be providing Federal firefighters the \nresources they need well before they run out of money. The fact that we \nare providing this level of funding is extremely important. By \nappropriating up front what we know is actually going to be needed \nbased on prior experience, we allow the Forest Service and the Interior \nDepartment to break the cycle of borrowing from other accounts and then \nhoping Congress agrees to repay that money. We have been criticized for \ndoing it. It is good, solid criticism. In this bill, it has been \nremedied.\n  The bill also includes $107 million in grants to help State and local \ncooperators fund their own firefighting and fuels reduction efforts. \nThat is a 2-percent increase over the 2009 level, and it provides $556 \nmillion for hazardous fuels reduction projects on Federal lands \nnationwide, a 7-percent increase over last year. That is critical.\n  My State is burning up, as are other States in the West. We lost 1.5 \nmillion acres last year from fire. Hazardous mitigation of fuels \nbecomes very critical.\n  As important as it is to provide our Federal firefighters with the \nfunds they need for suppression, it is just as important that we make \nthese fuel reduction funds available so these agencies can begin to get \nin front of the problem and prevent these catastrophic wildland fires \nor at least reduce their catastrophic potential.\n  The money provided in this bill will allow the Forest Service and the \nInterior Department to treat 3.5 million acres of fire-prone Federal \nlands. That is 3.5 million acres of fire-prone Federal land. This will \nreduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires such as the one being fought \nright now in southern California.\n  Let me say something about that fire. The Station fire in southern \nCalifornia is still burning in the foothills of Los Angeles. The fire \nhas swept through canyons that are drowning under decades' worth of \ndense vegetation. As of Tuesday, the fire has burned 160,000 acres, \ndestroyed 183 homes and other buildings, and cost more than $90 million \nto fight. More than 8,000 firefighters have battled the blaze, and, \ntragically, two firefighters have lost their lives.\n  The Station fire is now the largest fire in Los Angeles County \nhistory. It is also a reminder of how important it is to increase \nfunding for fuels reduction and fire suppression. I am very proud this \nbill accomplishes both.\n  Third, the bill shores up our public land management agencies by \nproviding a total of $6 billion for basic operations and backlog \nmaintenance of our national parks, national forests, national wildlife \nrefuges, and on Bureau of Land Management land.\n  For too long we have neglected these agencies and forced program cuts \non them by underfunding the fixed costs they incur every year. In this \nbill, fixed costs are fully funded. That is important. Included in \nthese funds are $2.2 billion for basic operations of our 391 national \nparks, an increase of $130 million. These funds will allow the Park \nService to continue utilizing the 3,000 seasonal employees who have \nmade a real difference in the condition and enjoyment of our parks. \nAdditional maintenance personnel, additional law enforcement officers, \nand additional park rangers will all be brought back as a way of \nenhancing the visitor experience now and preparing our parks for the \ncentennial in 2016.\n  Our national parks are jewels throughout the United States of \nAmerica. They cannot be allowed to grow into poor condition. They must \nbe maintained, and they must be operated properly.\n  Also, I wish to point out that the funding being provided in this \nbill will\n\n[[Page S9515]]\n\nallow the Park Service to continue the drug eradication program started \nlast year. I can tell you, in California, this has become a major \nproblem, with literally hundreds of thousands of acres in our national \nparks taken over by Mexican cartels that have moved into the back areas \nand set up marijuana production facilities. They are armed. They are \ndangerous. It has taken the resources of combined task forces--of \nlocal, Federal, and State officers--to go in and root out these areas \nand also to eradicate the planting that has been done. More than $10 \nmillion is being made available so law enforcement personnel can work \nwith other Federal and State agencies to extricate the illegal drug \noperations that are increasingly invading our national parks.\n  This effort is not just limited to the Park Service. Included in the \n$1.56 billion that this bill provides for operations of the national \nforests is a new $10 million increase for the Forest Service's law \nenforcement program. These funds mean the Service will be able to hire \nup to 50 new law enforcement officers to battle the epidemic of these \nmarijuana gardens on our public lands.\n  The bill also contains a $5 million increase to begin cleaning up \nmore than 25,000 acres of forest lands nationwide that have suffered \nenvironmental damage because of these drug--the word is ``gardens.'' I \nhate that word applied to these drug projects, so I will say ``drug \nprojects.''\n  Fourth, the bill increases the protection and conservation of \nsensitive lands by providing $419 million through the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Of that amount, $262 million is set aside for four \nFederal land management agencies for conservation of sensitive lands \nthat provide habitat to wildlife and recreation to visitors; $55 \nmillion is for conservation easements through the Forest Legacy \nProgram; $54 million is for acquisitions associated with habitat \nconservation plans; and $35 million is for State grants through the \nPark Service's State Assistance Program.\n  Finally, the bill helps some of the most vulnerable among us by \nproviding a total of $6.6 billion for the Indian Health Service and the \nBureau of Indian Affairs. That is an 11-percent increase over the 2009 \nenacted level. The bill includes increases of $450 million in direct \nhealth care services; $81 million in K-12 and college education \nprograms; and $83 million in law enforcement programs, which will allow \nfor additional police officer staffing on the streets and in detention \ncenters.\n  With these funds, more than 10,000 additional doctor visits will take \nplace that would not otherwise happen. This means additional well-baby \ncare to prevent problems before they happen. It means additional \nalcohol and substance abuse treatment, which is truly a plague in \nIndian Country. It means additional public health nursing visits so \nthose rural areas are not left out.\n  Funding provided through the Bureau of Indian Affairs will improve \nprograms and infrastructure at the Bureau's 183 schools. The $81 \nmillion increase in education programs will allow the Bureau to \nsubstantially increase the number of schools that meet the Adequate \nYearly Progress goals spelled out in No Child Left Behind. For the \nfirst time--and I am proud of this--nearly half of all schools will \nmeet this milestone. Additional funding for law enforcement programs \nwill allow the Bureau to increase staffing throughout Indian Country.\n  But it is not just funding for staff that is going to make a real \ndifference. The bill includes a threefold increase in funds for repair \nand rehabilitation of detention facilities. Too often, Bureau police \nofficers are forced to spend useless time transporting detainees, \nsometimes hundreds of miles, to be incarcerated in adequate detention \nfacilities. These funds will allow the Bureau to repair several local \nfacilities so less time is spent in transit.\n  All in all, I believe Senator Alexander and I have been fair and \nconscientious in crafting this bill. I urge my colleagues to let us \nmove forward with this measure as soon as possible.\n  I want my ranking member to know I am very proud of this bill, not \nonly because it is a good bill, it is the first start we have had \ntogether. I look forward to more years where we can build our fire \nsuppression, our care and concern for our national parks, the \nSmithsonian, all the 19 institutions it represents, the Kennedy Center, \nand all the various Departments we are concerned with in this \nappropriations bill.\n  It is necessarily dull to put forward figures, but as both of us have \nlearned from our prior lives, budgets and appropriations condition \npolicy. So I think this is not only a good appropriations bill, but it \nis a very good policy bill for the Departments that are included within \nthe bill.\n  It has been a sheer delight for me to work with you, I say to Senator \nAlexander. Now I would like to defer to the Senator for any comments he \nmight care to make.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California.\n  It is a joy for me to work on this legislation because, first, I care \nso much about it, as she does--this is about the great American \noutdoors, which is an essential part of our American character--and \nbecause of the privilege of working with Senator Feinstein. She has the \ngreat advantage of having been a mayor of a big city and she is capable \nof making a decision and she is results oriented, so we are able to \nwork easily together. It is the way I liked to work when I was \nGovernor. She is broad-gauged and cares about this country and about \nits environment and its outdoors and about not only protecting and \nconserving the outdoors but making it possible for Americans--300 \nmillion of us--and the people who visit us to enjoy that great American \noutdoors.\n  It is always a privilege to be in the Senate, but it is a special \nprivilege to work on the outdoors--the great American outdoors--with \nSenator Feinstein from California.\n  Last week, we celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park. I am not objective at all about the Great \nSmoky Mountains National Park. I grew up there, went hiking there, and \nI live 2 miles from its border. One reason I care about the trails so \nmuch is because I have hiked them. One reason I care about the quality \nof the air so much is because I breathe it. One reason I care about \nhaving enough rangers and making sure their salaries are paid is \nbecause I know them. So that helps in my objective.\n  But there was also a reminder. It was a beautiful day up on Newfound \nGap, right on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee. Our mountains \nin the East are not as big as the mountains in the West. They are \nolder, more mature. But the largest of the mountains in the Eastern \nUnited States are along the North Carolina and Tennessee border, 71 \nmiles along the Appalachian Trail, in the Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park.\n  So there we were, at about 5,500 feet, at the place where President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, on the same day in 1940, a few years after \nthe park was formed, dedicated the Great Smokies. But among other \nthings on that beautiful day--and the Secretary of the Interior was \nthere, Ken Salazar. It is good for our Western Secretary to get a good \nlook at the Eastern park. Dolly Parton was there. She grew up in the \nnext county, so she is our special ambassador for the Great Smokies, \nand there were all the Members of the Congress who were there from the \narea.\n  But when we look back 75 years, what did we see? It was 1934. So here \nwe were, in the middle of the greatest depression in our country's \nhistory, and what were we doing? Well, in Tennessee, we had the State \nlegislature appropriating $2 million to buy land from families and from \nlumber companies to create a park. In North Carolina, they did the same \nthing. That only made $4 million. Madam President, $10 million was \nneeded. So they collected another million dollars from the people of \nthe area.\n  Schoolchildren put pennies in jars. It is a wonderful story of how \nthey got up to $5 million. Then one of the early leaders of the group \norganizing the Great Smoky Mountains National Park convinced John D. \nRockefeller, Jr.,--who, I guess, is the grandfather of our Senator \nRockefeller--to come; and the Rockefellers gave $5 million in honor of \nLaura Spelman Rockefeller, to match the $5 million the two States and \nall the people had contributed.\n  That $10 million bought the park and gave it to the country. This was \nnot like almost every other park. It was\n\n[[Page S9516]]\n\nnot just carved out of land the people already owned. It was given to \nthe country in the midst of the Great Depression.\n  The reason I bring up that today is because it is a reminder that \neven in difficult times we kept our priorities right. India has its Taj \nMahal. Rome has its art. England has its history. But we have the great \nAmerican outdoors. If, as Ken Burns has said, our national parks are \nAmerica's best idea, we in Tennessee and North Carolina think that must \nmean the Great Smoky Mountains are the very best idea because so many \nmore people visit it than visit any other park in America.\n  But what those people did--whether it was the schoolchildren with the \npennies, the Governors of the States, the legislators, the people in \nAsheville, NC, and Knoxville, TN, the civic leaders, whether it was the \nRockefeller family--what they did also shows us the foresight of \nthinking ahead for the benefit of future generations.\n  In 1934, the assistant chief ranger of this big, new park wrote a \nmemo to the superintendent outlining the wildlife he found there. There \nwere 100 black bears in 1934. There are 1,600 today. There were 315 \nwild turkeys in 1934. The other day I saw 21 outside my window 2 miles \nfrom the park.\n  Seventy-five years ago in the Park, there were 12 whitetail deer in \nTennessee and only 6 in North Carolina. They are all over the place \ntoday. There were no peregrine falcons, no river otters, no elk. They \nare there today. Twenty-five years ago, when as Governor of Tennessee I \nspoke at the 50th anniversary of the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark, there was no Federal law controlling acid rain, there was no \norganization called Friends of the Smokies, but both are great \nsuccesses today. Those Federal laws were passed and Friends of the \nSmokies has contributed $30 million. So that celebration two weeks ago \nreminded us of the foresight 75 years ago. Those examples are \neverywhere in our culture today.\n  I am reading Douglas Brinkley's book about Teddy Roosevelt called \n``The Wilderness Warrior.'' It is so thick, it will break your back if \nyou carry it around, but it is a wonderful story of how our President, \nTeddy Roosevelt, during his relatively short term in office, had the \nforesight to make sure we have many of the wildlife refuges, the \nnational parks, the national forests, and the others we enjoy today. \nThis bill Senator Feinstein so ably described is the responsibility we \nhave as stewards of that great tradition today, to look ahead to the \nfuture about preserving and protecting the great American outdoors; \nlooking to the future as Teddy Roosevelt did, as the schoolchildren did \nin Tennessee, as John Muir did when Yosemite was created, as Lady Bird \nJohnson did half a century ago. As we look ahead, we should remember \nthat we are custodians of that tradition.\n  What should we hope for as we work on this bill and we plan ahead? My \nhope of the future is that we finish cleaning up the air, so in the \nGreat Smokies, we can celebrate the gray haze about which the Cherokee \nsang instead of seeing smog. I hope we do more to use our nearly 400 \nnational park properties to teach about what it means to be an American \nso our children and our immigrants can know that story. I hope we can \nbecome better students of the remarkable environmental diversity of our \ncountry. Just within our Great Smoky Mountains National Park, we have \n128 species of trees, as many as they have in all of Europe. I hope we \ndo a better job of creating picturesque entrances and conservation \neasements to protect the wildlife and the stunning viewscapes that are \nnot only in our parks but near our parks.\n  I am going to do my best--and Senator Feinstein and I have talked \nabout our concern about this, and I have shared that concern with \nSecretary Salazar on many occasions, including last week when he \nvisited Tennessee--I am going to make sure we pay attention to the \nperils of what some conservationists are calling energy sprawl, so that \nin our enthusiasm for renewable energy and alternative energy, which we \nneed, we don't place 50-story wind turbines and acres of square miles \nof solar thermal plants in areas that damage the treasured landscapes \nwe have spent a century trying to protect. It doesn't make sense to \ndestroy the environment in the name of saving the environment.\n  I hope we can build on the legislation, too, that Congress enacted in \n2007 when we expanded exploration for natural gas and oil in the Gulf \nof Mexico and for the first time created what I like to call a \nconservation royalty that contributes one-eighth of the revenues that \nare collected from that drilling. One-eighth of those revenues go to \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. In this case, it goes to the \nState side portion, which is used by communities for local parks and \nlocal greenways. Suffice it to say, the most popular parks in America \nare not the Great Smokies and Yosemite; the most popular parks are the \ncity parks and the community parks and the suburban parks, the parks \ndown the street. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is the source of \nfunding for many of those parks and much of that open space.\n  In the 1960s, Congress, as a result of a report by the first \nCommission on American Outdoors that was chaired by Lawrence \nRockefeller, recommended that we take some of the money we receive from \noffshore drilling and exploration and use it for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. We had never really done that, but it makes good \nsense. It is good stewardship. Where there is an environmental burden, \nwhich we sometimes have to authorize, we should pay for it with an \nenvironmental benefit. That is the trade between offshore exploration \nand money for land and water conservation funding to create city parks.\n  One other thing. I hope we find additional ways, through increased \nprivate contributions as well as the kinds of Federal appropriations we \ntalk about today, to support and care for the nearly 400 different \nnational parks properties we have, as well as our other public lands \nand treasured landscapes and national forests and along our coastlines \nand our ridgelines in this country.\n  The Senator from California gave a very thorough statement of the \nvarious programs in our bill. I won't repeat all of those numbers, but \nI do have a handful of observations I wish to make. Obviously, we don't \nagree on every detail. But we are not here to agree on every detail, we \nare here to see whether we can produce a result. I believe we have done \nthat. In the process, I thank Senator Feinstein for addressing a number \nof the concerns I and many of our colleagues on the Republican side of \nthe aisle have. She has been terrific to work with in that respect.\n  As she said, this bill is $225 million below the President's budget \nrequest, even though it is substantially higher than last year's \nfunding levels. I suppose if I were doing this all by myself, I would \nhave spent less money, but that is not the way our system works. We \neach make our arguments, fight our spending battles, decide on a budget \nresolution, and we go from there. So I believe Chairman Inouye and the \nvice chairman, Thad Cochran, have allocated the funds made available to \nthe Appropriations Committee by the Senate in a fair and responsible \nway.\n  Similarly, with the funds we have had to work with on the Interior \nbill, Chairman Feinstein and I have made our best judgment and done our \nbest to meet the many competing priorities for the varied programs \nhere. She mentioned some of the good things in the bill, and I wish to \nunderscore just a few.\n  We have continued the Centennial Initiative started under President \nBush by adding over $130 million to increase park operations in \npreparation for the national park centennial in 2016. This is a good \ntime to think about the condition of our national parks. Many of us \nvisit them, so we are familiar with their maintenance needs and their \npersonnel needs.\n  Some are reading the book I mentioned about Teddy Roosevelt, and \nmillions more, starting September 27, will see Ken Burns' film about \nthe national parks called ``The National Parks: America's Best Idea.'' \nI am confident the film will remind us of how important those parks are \nto our national character and how determined we are to make sure that \nover the next several years, as we approach the centennial, we support \nthem properly. That includes the law enforcement rangers who ensure the \nsafety of the public in our parks, the interpreters who explain\n\n[[Page S9517]]\n\nits history and America's history, and the biologists and scientists \nwho teach us about the plants and animals that live there. This bill \nhelps to expand and improve that experience.\n  We have also provided necessary increases to pay for the rangers who \nkeep visitors to all of our national forests, wildlife refuges, and \nother public lands safe; health care professionals who provide medical \ncare; the Indian Health Service teachers who provide education in the \nIndian community--Senator Feinstein described that. Simply keeping pace \nwith the inflationary pay costs and health benefits for park and forest \nrangers, Indian health care professionals, and other critical personnel \nrequired a $540 million increase in funding over the last year.\n  Senator Feinstein talked about fires. It seems as though when we read \nabout fires or see them on television they are all in California, and \nour hearts go out to the families who have lost their homes and, a few, \ntheir lives as a result of these fires.\n  But the fires are not all in California. The national Forest Service \nis busy spending too much of its time on fire protection. It has an \neffective fire protection unit that is part of its job, but what we \nhave been doing is paying for firefighting the way we used to pay for \nthe Iraq war. We did it off budget. We did it a little later. I \ncongratulate the administration and Senator Feinstein for putting into \nthis budget the amount of money we think we will actually need to fight \nfires this year. We have added over $570 million compared to last year \nfor firefighting and fire prevention programs. I hope that is enough. I \nhope we have made a budget that allows us to deal with that so we don't \nfind ourselves coming back with supplementary appropriations and so we \ndon't disrupt all of the other important programs in the Forest Service \nand in the Department of the Interior. As important as the firefighting \nfunction is to the U.S. Forest Service, we don't want to turn the U.S. \nForest Service into the U.S. fire service.\n  Let me make one comment about our process. One of the major \ncriticisms of the appropriations process in recent years has been the \nfailure of the Senate to take up each bill individually. This denies \nthe Members of this body an opportunity to offer amendments and help \nshape the final bill.\n  It is important to note that this is the first time in 4 years that \nthe Interior bill has been brought to the floor of the Senate as a \nstand-alone measure for purposes of examination and amendment by all \nSenators. This is a tribute to Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman \nCochran, and I thank Senator Reid and Senator McConnell for the fact \nthat we are here today and Senators should now come forward to offer \ntheir amendments.\n  This is the sixth appropriations bill to complete Senate floor \naction. We are nearly halfway through the process. I believe all of my \ncolleagues share my desire that we are able to complete all 12 \nindividual appropriations bills through the normal order and send them \nto the President for his signature. It is a much fairer way to operate. \nIt gives those of us who are elected a chance to have our say, and it \nsaves the taxpayer a lot of money by permitting the efficient operation \nof the government on an orderly, budgeted basis.\n  Let me close by saying again how much I have enjoyed working with \nSenator Feinstein and how much I look forward to that privilege in the \nfuture.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I wish to thank the \nranking member for those very gracious remarks. They are reciprocated \nin whole. I think his expressions about the bill are very well taken, \nand we will just proceed from there.\n  I would like Senators to be fully aware that any amendment which \nproposes to increase spending in one area of the bill will need to be \noffset with a commensurate cut in another area. The bill is at its \nallocation level, and the overall effect of the bill's bottom line must \nremain neutral. Not to do so is to create a 60-vote point of order \nagainst the amendment. So everyone who wishes to offer an amendment \nshould bear that in mind. I think both of us will fight vociferously to \nsee that the financial integrity of our bill is continued.\n  I very much appreciate Senator Alexander pointing out that this is \nthe first time since 2005 that the full Senate has had an opportunity \nto consider this bill. Considering the landmarks, the vital aspects of \nthis American government of which people are singularly proud--I mean, \nwe don't hear much criticism about the Federal Government providing \nnational parks or a forest service or an environmental protection \nagency. So this is a bill of which we are very proud.\n  I, too, wish to encourage Senators to come to the floor now. We wish \nto pass this bill as quickly as we can. The floor should be open to \namendments.\n  With that in mind, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2394\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2394.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2394.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Prohibiting use of funds to fund the Association of Community \n                 Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN))\n\n       On page 240, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n\n                      prohibition on use of funds\n\n       Sec. 4__.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be distributed to the Association of Community \n     Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) or its subsidiaries.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I compliment both Senators who just \nspoke, the Senator from California and the Senator from Tennessee. You \nunderscore why we are so proud to live in this great country and the \nimportance of these resources.\n  Also, as a former Secretary of Agriculture, I know the importance of \nadequate funding for firefighting. Without it, our forests are in \nserious jeopardy. I wanted to express that.\n  I rise today to talk about something that is enormously important. \nThree days ago, I was here on the Senate floor urging my colleagues to \nvote in favor of an amendment I offered to another appropriations bill, \nthe Transportation and Housing Appropriations bill. The amendment had a \nvery specific purpose. The purpose was to prohibit funds from going to \nthe Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as \nACORN.\n  I am very pleased to report that, in a true display of \nbipartisanship, 82 of my colleagues joined with me in voting in favor \nof protecting taxpayer dollars by voting for the amendment.\n  This was a significant and important vote in this body for a number \nof reasons. Such a strong bipartisan vote sent a very powerful message \nthat the Senate is serious about eliminating the flow of taxpayer funds \nto an organization that can best be described as being in an absolute \nfree fall when it comes to allegations of illegal activity--illegal \nactivity that, in many respects, is funded with taxpayer dollars. \nSenators came to this floor a couple of days ago and they threw aside \npartisan loyalty in favor of prohibiting funds to an organization \nbesieged by allegations of fraud and corruption and employee \nwrongdoing.\n  Bottom line: My colleagues--I am so proud of them--answered the call \nto defend taxpayers against waste, fraud, and abuse. But because of the \nlimitations of that amendment, our job simply is not complete. Of \ncourse, in order to comply with the germaneness rules, we could only do \nso much with that amendment. Therefore, I come here again today to \noffer the same amendment to this bill.\n  The amendment to the T-HUD bill was a first step. The overwhelming \nvote on Monday stopped the flow of funds for transportation or housing \nfunding that would otherwise go to ACORN.\n  At least in terms of Senate action, there is more process left there. \nUnfortunately, ACORN is still eligible to receive Federal dollars from \ninnumerable sources in the Federal budget. That is\n\n[[Page S9518]]\n\nwhy I am here today to offer the identical amendment to the Interior \nAppropriations bill and to call on my colleagues again to stand up for \nthe American taxpayers.\n  There is unbelievable evidence that ACORN or its estimated 360-plus \naffiliates could be eligible for Department of Interior funding. The \nfollowing words appear in the text of this bill 193 times: contracts, \ngrants, nonprofits, and cooperative agreements.\n  There are so many ways ACORN can receive funds from the Interior \nbill. For example, ACORN's subsidiaries openly publicize their advocacy \nfor environmental causes.\n  ACORN groups are heavily involved in community redevelopment, and so \nis the Department of the Interior. The links are obvious. They are \nundeniable.\n  In fact, on page 66 of the bill, you can--just to pull out specific \nlanguage there included for the Great Lakes restoration project that \nwould give money to nonprofits for ``planning, monitoring, and \nimplementing.''\n  This is a project that President Obama has appointed a specific \nperson to oversee. Do any of us have a certainty that ACORN won't \nreceive any of that money? I certainly don't.\n  ACORN is able to tap into taxpayer moneys from so many other ways \nbesides competitive grants. They or their web of affiliates are able to \nwork out memoranda of understanding, cooperative agreements, and even \nsubcontracts with the Federal Government.\n  Additionally, States that receive grants from the Federal Government \ncan funnel money to ACORN affiliates, and there is very little \noversight. My amendment will stop that. It will stop the money--the \ntaxpayer dollars--being directed to this group.\n  The question before us today is whether my colleagues will again come \nto the floor and say this activity is wrong, it is damning. We need to \nstand and say that no money will go to a group engaged in this \nactivity.\n  Last night, I was watching a news program, and yet another videotape \nsurfaced of ACORN employee activity. It was shocking. This videotape \ndisplayed someone saying to an ACORN employee that they intended to \nbring underage minors into this country from other countries for the \npurpose of engaging in prostitution. There was active involvement by \nthe ACORN employee in how this might happen, even to the extent of \ndescribing the contacts that this person had.\n  I want to say that we cannot relent, just because some taxpayer money \nwas safeguarded, until a full government investigation is launched and \ncompleted, and if it turns out with no problem, so be it, but we cannot \nrest until that is done and we are assured and we can assure our \ncitizens back home that no taxpayer money is being used in this \norganization.\n  It doesn't make sense to just stop with the Transportation and \nHousing Appropriations bill. We need to stand up and prohibit all \nsources of Federal funding and any possibility of Federal funding going \nto ACORN.\n  I will wrap up with a statement of deep respect for what my \ncolleagues did on Monday. I believe it was the right thing to do. It \nwas the right thing to step in here to the floor and cast a vote and \nsay: Enough is enough, it stops here, it stops today.\n  We need to do everything we can to assure our taxpayers that there is \nno possibility somebody can access this funding from ACORN. My hope is \nwe will come together as we did Monday and that we will do the right \nthing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I will respond to the Senator from \nNebraska. My belief is that we had an amendment yesterday that was \npassed overwhelmingly by this body, prohibiting the use of Federal \nfunds for ACORN, period. The staff has been researching this bill. We \ndo not believe there are any Federal funds in this bill. I believe if \nthere were a rollcall vote, it would come out essentially the same as \nit did yesterday.\n  So I say to the distinguished Senator, both the ranking member and I \nwould be prepared to take this amendment by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, this is such an important issue. This \nis an issue that people all across the country are watching on the \nSenate floor. Therefore, I feel very strongly that if there were ever \nan opportunity for Senators to come to the floor and cast a vote in a \nrollcall fashion, this is one to make a very strong statement again \nabout ACORN not receiving this funding.\n  I appreciate the offer of the Senator from California, but I must \ninsist, because of the nature of what we are dealing with--the claims \nof alleged wrongdoing, the history of wrongdoing with employees from \nthis organization, the videotapes, the potential to access the \nfunding--that we need a rollcall vote on this issue.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, through the Chair to the Senator, to the \nbest of our knowledge, there is no funding in this bill for ACORN. The \nstaff is looking and has found no funding in the bill for ACORN. \nTherefore, there is a redundancy, and this will have to be done on \nevery single appropriations bill, which doesn't seem to me to make very \ngood sense. I think an 80-plus vote yesterday is a very substantial \nvote. I think everybody who is interested has access to know--we are \ntrying very hard--and I hope the Senator will not be upset by what I am \nsaying, but we are trying to move our bill, and we will take the \nSenator's amendment so that the amendment--if there is any funding, it \nstill cannot be used, even without this amendment. So the Senator is \ncovered.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, speaking to my colleague from \nCalifornia, let me say that I appreciate the Senator's offer of \naccepting this by unanimous consent. I appreciate the Senator's claim \nthat she believes there is no way they can access funding. But I will \ntell you that I have operated a Federal Department myself--a very large \ndepartment--where we administered millions and billions of dollars of \ngrants and loans, et cetera. Once that appropriations bill is passed, \nthe Senator knows and I know that unless there is some real trouble, we \nare free at the departmental level to pretty much administer the money. \nSo there cannot be a guarantee that they won't get money out of this \nprogram.\n  The second thing I will offer here is this: This is not one of those \nissues that just comes along. This involves an organization that has \nhad a history of very serious problems. I could not feel more strongly \nthat the American people want us to come to the floor and cast a vote \non this issue.\n  The final thing I want to say is this: I feel this is an important \nissue. There is a way to solve this problem so that I don't have to \ncome down on every appropriations bill. We will be introducing a bill \ntoday--and we have reached out in a very bipartisan way to Democrats \nand Republicans, asking for people to join in this bill--that says \nsimply that across the entire Federal Government no money for ACORN. My \nhope is we can pass that bill expeditiously and we can get that into \neffect.\n  I would like nothing more than to avoid having to come down here on \neach and every appropriations bill. Again, I appreciate the offer, but \nthis is an important vote to constituents all across the United States. \nI think we owe it to them to show how we are going to vote on this \nissue.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to signal to all Members that \nthe floor is open. Amendments will be received to this bill. I say to \nmy colleagues, if you have an amendment to the Interior Appropriations \nbill, please come to the floor.\n\n\n                           Order of procedure\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the September 16 order \nwith respect to H.R. 3288 be modified to provide that the Senate resume \nconsideration of the bill at 2:30 p.m., with the remaining provisions \nstill in effect. That is the housing and transportation bill. Further, \nas in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:30 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the \nnomination of Gerard E. Lynch to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the \nSecond Circuit; that there be 2 hours of debate with respect to the \nnomination, with the time equally divided and controlled by Senators \nLeahy and Sessions or their designees; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time, the nomination be set aside to recur upon passage of H.R. \n3288; that prior to the vote on confirmation of the nomination and the \nSenate resuming executive session,\n\n[[Page S9519]]\n\nthere be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled; that upon \nconfirmation, the motion to reconsider the vote be considered made and \nlaid upon the table; that no further motions be in order; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nvote in relation to the Johanns amendment No. 2394 occur upon \ndisposition of the nomination of Gerard Lynch and that no amendment be \nin order to the amendment prior to the vote, with 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have just checked with the manager of \nthe bill, Senator Feinstein, and asked to speak for 5 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Remembering Senator Edward M. Kennedy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the other day when our colleagues were \ntalking about our departed colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, I was not \nable to be on the Senate floor, and I did want to say just a few words \nabout my friend Ted Kennedy.\n  I had the pleasure of serving in this Chamber with him for 16 years. \nHe sat back at that desk in the row behind me, and I had many \nopportunities to spend time and swap stories and talk about public \npolicy with him. I knew him before I came to the Senate. As a very \nyoung man, I worked on his brother Robert Kennedy's campaign for the \nPresidency, and I met Ted Kennedy then. And, I supported Ted Kennedy in \nhis 1980 Presidential campaign and met him then.\n  When I came to the Senate, from time to time I was invited to go to \nHyannis Port to the Kennedy compound and visited there with Senator \nKennedy and his family and went sailing with him. To sail with Senator \nTed Kennedy was an extraordinary experience. He was a wonderful sailor.\n  Many things have been said and written about Ted Kennedy over the \nyears, and especially in recent weeks since his death. I don't need to \nrepeat his many accomplishments here in the Senate; my colleagues have \ndone a great job doing that. Those accomplishments spanned 47 years and \nwould take far too long and too much time to detail, and many have done \nit, as I said.\n  I will not repeat his love of all things Irish. Everyone understood \nthat. He was a great Irish storyteller. No prouder Irishman in the \nworld, I daresay, than Ted Kennedy.\n  I don't need to tell of his many acts of thoughtfulness and kindness, \nlarge and small, for the powerful and the powerless. They are well-\nknown already as well and, already, much missed.\n  Many have talked about his wit and his love of storytelling and a \ngood joke. That, too, was Ted Kennedy. Laughing and making people laugh \nwas part of the hallmark of his character. Often when I think of him I \nthink of a booming laughter that filled the entire room when he was \nfull of joy.\n  I need not talk about his doggedness or his tireless work ethic or \nhis determination, for they, too, were well-known to all of us who \nworked with him. Those were the pillars upon which he built success \nafter success, often small, but then building and building, step by \nstep, until it was consequential and often big.\n  Those were also the pillars on which he built decades of \nrelationships. I think those relationships were the keys to \nunderstanding the man with whom we served--Ted Kennedy.\n  It didn't matter whether you were a Republican or a Democrat or an \nIndependent. It didn't matter if you were a businessman or a janitor, \nyoung or old, White or Black, rich or poor, powerful or powerless. Ted \nKennedy wanted to work with you to try to reach a compromise and see \nwhat could be achieved together. He just never, ever stopped; never \ngave up.\n  The great American essayist and author, Ralph Waldo Emerson, once \nsaid:\n\n       The characteristic of heroism is in its persistency. All \n     men have wandering impulses, fits and starts of generosity. \n     But when you have chosen your part, abide by it, and do not \n     weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world.\n\n  No one I know in this Chamber was more persistent than Ted Kennedy. \nHe chose his part; he abided by it; he didn't try to reconcile his \nprinciples to the moment or to the world; and, he fought and fought for \nwhat he believed in and what he thought was right. Sometimes it was \nvery controversial, but he was persistent and fought long and hard \nuntil the end.\n  Even when he was sick and tired and worn out he fought on because he \nloved his country and he knew his colleagues and others loved this \ncountry as much as he did. He knew there was always that common ground, \nlove of country, and he knew that people of good faith, regardless of \nparty and regardless of position, could achieve great things for the \ncountry they all loved.\n  When he was done, he had cast more than 15,000 votes, more than 300 \nlaws bear the name of Senator Ted Kennedy, and he cosponsored more than \n2,000 others. That doesn't include the thousands of laws he merely \ninfluenced. Much of that work was done on the Senate floor. It was his \nlife's work.\n  If the Senate was his home, this Senate floor surely was his front \nporch, where he would let everyone know what was on his mind. When \nSenator Ted Kennedy, at that desk, was on the Senate floor, you may not \nhave agreed with him, you might not have even cared about the subject \nbefore he began to speak, but you had to listen, you had to respond, \nand you had to take sides.\n  He was called the lion of the Senate by many. When he was on the \nfloor roaring, it was quite a sight and sound to behold, a sound that \nmoved hearts. It moved minds. It moved this very institution and, \nindeed, the country itself. He could be quietly persuasive, but on the \nSenate floor his passion literally poured out of him.\n  It was said long ago of Daniel Webster, another famous Senator from \nMassachusetts, that he was ``a great cannon loaded to the lips.'' Well, \nSenator Kennedy was a great cannon loaded to the lips, and this \ninstitution will long miss that passion, those words, his spirit, his \nlove of life, and his love of this institution and our country.\n  There is an old saying that all men die, but not all men live. Well, \nsurely Ted Kennedy lived. Senator Ted Kennedy lives in our hearts and \nin his good works and in his life's work, and I just wanted today to \njoin my colleagues in saying: Ted, Godspeed, rest in peace, and all \nMembers of this Senate miss you dearly.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I note that no colleagues are on the \nSenate floor. The floor is open for amendments, and I would like to \nurge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you have an \namendment, please bring it to the floor.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we are on another spending bill, one of \nthe spending bills we must address during\n\n[[Page S9520]]\n\nthis Congress. I compliment Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander for \ntheir work on this very important bill.\n  I also want to comment on something that was in the news today, \nstemming from a comment I made yesterday about some spending issues. I \nwill do it very briefly.\n  This deals with the issue of the economic recovery or the stimulus \npackage. I voted for that. I didn't vote for the TARP funds, $700 \nbillion for the financial bailout last fall. But I did vote for the \neconomic recovery or the stimulus program early this year because I \nbelieved it was necessary to give the economy a boost.\n  Frankly, I think this economy is showing signs of beginning to \nrecover, and that is going to be good for all Americans. There are a \nlot of important investments being made in this economic recovery \nprogram, investments in building and repairing roads and bridges and \nmany other investments in infrastructure around this country that at \nthe end of the day will both put people to work and result in important \nassets for this country.\n  Yesterday, I made a point about one particular project that is being \nfunded with stimulus funds, and I want to make sure everyone \nunderstands the point I made. Part of some stimulus funds were \ndedicated to the northern border ports of entry, smaller ports of entry \nbetween the United States and Canada. The specifications for these \nports of entry were developed in 2002 and 2006, under the previous \nadministration, by the Department of Homeland Security. So when money \nbegan to be allowed under the stimulus program to invest in the \nnorthern border ports of entry, the specifications created by the \nprevious administration were going to drive how much was spent.\n  As I looked into it, I realized that these requirements were \ncompletely out of balance. The requirements would create a common \nfootprint at small ports of entry and require the expenditure of, on \naverage, $15 million for a small port of entry in circumstances where, \non average, only five vehicles an hour were coming through the port of \nentry. I believed that was excessive.\n  That was not Secretary Napolitano's call. That was not something she \ndid. That comes from the requirements from that agency that were \ndeveloped in 2002 and 2006. So I asked Secretary Napolitano to take a \nlook at that, and suspend the projects pending a review, and she \nimmediately said, yesterday, let's review that, let's do a 30-day \nreview.\n  First of all, I want to say thanks to the Secretary. I think that is \nexactly the right action. I didn't know these were the set of \nrequirements that were going to drive that kind of funding. But, \nfrankly, waste is waste.\n  Of the 22 northern border ports of entry that are slated to be \ndemolished and rebuilt, 9 of them are in my State. Much of this money \nwould be spent in my State. But I do not think that much of this \nspending is justified because I believe those requirements must change.\n  I agree that we should ensure that small port of entry have adequate \nsecurity. I will support investment to upgrade those facilities where \nit is really necessary to do so. But I do not believe it is \nappropriate, nor do I believe Secretary Napolitano nor my colleagues \nhere in the Congress believe it will be appropriate upon review, to \nspend $15 million on average at ports of entry where you have five \nvehicles an hour coming through the port. That is way out of balance. \nIt makes no sense to me.\n  My comments were portrayed in some press accounts as some sort of \ncriticism of the Congress for passing stimulus legislation aimed at \neconomic recovery. It is not a criticism of that. A lot of that \nstimulus spending is necessary and is lifting the economy and creating \nan asset and people in jobs or putting people back to work. I think \nthat makes sense. But it also makes a lot of sense for all of us to \nvery carefully scrutinize how this is done, where it is done, whether \nit is a good investment, and whether it is fair to the taxpayers.\n  I will say again, I appreciate the fact that the Secretary is doing \nthis review. I give her credit for doing that. My hope is that at the \nend of the review, she will conclude, as I do, that we cannot spend \nmoney that way. Those requirements that were created in 2002 or 2006 \nwere excessive. You can have adequate security at these small ports \nthat have five vehicles coming through per hour, without spending $15 \nmillion to demolish and rebuild each of these facilities. It is simply \ntoo much money.\n  I understand that perhaps some people in my State will be a little \nupset if they stood to gain from nine of those ports being upgraded. I \nam all for making investments that are the right kinds of investments, \nto upgrade ports at the northern border. But I do not believe we ought \nto waste money, and I think that is what would happen with the \nrequirements that were created in 2002 and 2006.\n  Let me make one final point. I can understand, perhaps, why someone \nmight be tempted to create extraordinary requirements. In 2002, we were \nin the shadow of the terrorist attacks of 2001. I understand how that \nmight have made somebody create a set of requirements that now seem to \nbe way out of whack.\n  The fact is that we need to have a secure Northern border, but we \nalso have to use common sense. If in 2002 and 2006 there were design \nspecifications drawn up that today would cost $15 million per port of \nentry, at facilities that receive only a few vehicles per day, I say \nthis needs to be carefully reviewed. Let's now review those judgments \nand make sure that we are truly increasing border security, and that we \nare not wasting the taxpayers' money.\n  I wanted to reiterate that my statements yesterday were not a general \ncomment on the Economic Recovery Act. A lot of good, important \ninvestments are being made that create jobs and create real assets for \nthis country. But I think all of us should be vigilant and look at \nsituations such as this and where change is necessary, to require and \nmake those changes. In this case, I believe the right kind of change \ncould save a couple of hundred million dollars, and I think that is \nimportant. Even if that saving and less spending comes in my State, I \nbelieve that is important.\n  Years and years ago, a Federal courthouse was to be built in my \nState. I believed the amount of money that was proposed to build it was \ntwice as much as was necessary, and here in Congress I cut the money in \nhalf. In the end, they built a perfectly good courthouse for slightly \nless than half of the funds that had been originally proposed. I think \nall of us have stewardship requirements to the taxpayer, and that is \nwhy I wanted to amplify on what I talked about yesterday.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering H.R. 2996, Interior \nDepartment appropriations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Am I correct that at 12:30 we will go to the nomination of \nJudge Gerard Lynch to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, prior to going to that, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be able to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HAROLD HOWRIGAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember one of Vermont's \ngreatest citizens, dairy farmer, and American, my good friend, Harold \nHowrigan.\n  Harold passed away at the age of 85 at his home in Fairfield, VT, on \nSeptember 7, 2009. He was surrounded by his loving family, long and \nextended and wonderful family.\n  Harold was a family man. This large extended family included his wife \nof 56 years, Ann, and three sons and two daughters, 12 grandchildren. \nHe had an optimist's outlook on life. He had a knack for storytelling \nthat cast a spell over everyone in his presence.\n  Many of his stories were about growing up in a family with nine other \nsiblings, reared by William and Margaret\n\n[[Page S9521]]\n\nHowrigan on their hillside farm in Vermont. I can think of more than \none occasion when Marcelle and I would be there. We would be listening \nto one of these stories, and I knew that we might be late for the next \nthing, but I didn't want it to end. I wanted to hear what else he had \nto say.\n  Harold was a man who seemed to accomplish more each year than most of \nus do in a lifetime. He built his Fairfield, VT farm to over 1,000 \nacres, including the land that had been worked by his family since the \nmid 1800s.\n  It is now tended by the next generation of Howrigans. I remember him \nas a dynamic man, as genuinely comfortable in his public duties as he \nwas in the dairy parlor or out splitting wood. In addition to running \nthe farm and tending to the family he loved so much, he accepted \nleadership roles in dozens of civic and agricultural organizations from \nlocal to national in scope. He moderated the Fairfield town meeting \nright up to this year. The town meeting is a sacred institution in \nVermont. A town wants to make sure they have the very best and the \nfairest and the most knowledgeable to be their moderator. It also helps \nwhen you have somebody with an Irish sense of humor. This is a position \nof distinction in any Vermont town.\n  He was director of the St. Alban's Cooperative Creamery for 25 years \nand president for another 20. He was appointed by three Governors, both \nparties, to the Vermont Milk Commission. He was also a local and \nnational leader among maple sugar makers. He served on University of \nVermont advisory boards and on county commissions. All the while he \ntended the fire in the Fairfield sugar house each year and he got the \ncows milked each day and sang for 60 years on the choir at church. The \nchurch, of course, is named, as you would expect in a town full of \nIrish immigrants and descendants, St. Patrick's.\n  Nationally, he was a director of the National Milk Producers \nFederation for 20 years and chairman of the National Dairy Board. In \naddition to his work on dairy, he was a local and national leader for \nthe maple industry, a prolific sugar maker. I know Marcelle and I and \nour children, when we were having something at the farm that called for \nmaple syrup--and in our family, that is just about anything from \nEnglish muffins to pancakes--everybody's eyes would light up if we knew \nit was Howrigan syrup.\n  Notwithstanding his prodigious service to his community, his \nprofession and his country, his greatest impact was probably felt \nthrough his personal relationships with his family and what he \nconsidered, I think, all of Vermont, his extended family. As a friend, \nhe was a trusted adviser on agricultural issues over several decades. I \nknow Senator Jeffords also valued his friendship and advice and \nGovernors consulted him regularly. But as dad and grandpa to a large, \nactive family, he cultivated two new generations of Vermont dairy \nfarmers and maple sugar makers.\n  We could talk about all the different things he did, but it still \ndoes not give a picture of the man. He was known for a deep and \nspirited Irish pride, a sentiment I obviously share. I find myself \ncomparing that other great Irish American and dear friend, Teddy \nKennedy, whose recent loss I also mourn. But I also treasure the trip \nmy wife Marcelle and I took with Harold to Ireland. There he felt he \nwas truly in the Promised Land. We would walk about the streets of \nDublin or small towns nearby. He was so proud of his family's Irish \nheritage, he never stopped smiling throughout his visit.\n  The day of his funeral, last week, Marcelle wore an Irish pin we \npurchased with him in Ireland. I, of course, wore a green tie in his \nhonor. I watched his grandsons wearing some of the Irish ties Harold \nhad owned. I listened to his son and daughter and grandchildren talk \nabout him, capturing him in his stories and his nature. I think about \nthe very last conversation I had with him just weeks before he died. In \nall these things, he never asked for anything for himself. He always \nasked me to watch out for other people. He led by quiet example and \nhard work and kindness and love.\n  I, along with the State of Vermont and many across the United States \nand across the Atlantic, will miss Harold. He was a dear friend, truly \na great American. Similar to all Vermonters, I express my sympathy to \nhis family and I say: Goodbye, Harold, my dear friend.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9521-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9521-S9532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF GERARD E. LYNCH TO BE U.S. CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE SECOND \n                                CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Gerard E. Lynch, of New \nYork, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate, equally divided, between the Senator from Vermont and \nthe Senator from Alabama or their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate finally considers the \nnomination of Gerard Lynch to the Second Circuit. I take particular \ninterest in this because my own State of Vermont is part of the Second \nCircuit. I am a member of that bar, and I have argued cases before that \ncourt.\n  This is a nomination reported out of the Judiciary Committee over 3 \nmonths ago, on June 11 unanimously by voice vote. There were no \ndissents. When that occurred and the ranking Republican member said \nsuch glowing things about Judge Lynch, I assumed his nomination was \ngoing to be confirmed right away as we did with President Bush's \nnominations in similar situations. Now it is nearly 3 months later. In \nalmost unprecedented fashion, someone who has had the strong support of \nboth the chairman and ranking Republican of the committee is still on \nthe Executive Calendar.\n  Judge Lynch has served as a highly respected Federal judge from New \nYork for almost a decade. He has impeccable legal credentials. His \nnomination received the highest possible rating from the ABA's standing \ncommittee on the Federal judiciary, unanimously voted ``well \nqualified.''\n  The Senate can and must do a better job of restoring our tradition, a \ntradition followed with Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents, of regularly considering qualified, noncontroversial \nnominees to fill vacancies on the Federal bench without needless and \nharmful delays. We should not have to overcome filibusters and spend \nmonths seeking time agreements to consider these nominations. The \nAmerican public wonders what is going on here.\n  It is imperative that we move to fill the growing number of vacancies \nthroughout the Federal courts. These vacancies have already risen to \nover 90, including 21 on the circuit courts. I have been here with six \nPresidents. I cannot remember a time we have been this late in the year \nand, even though nominations have been made, nobody has been confirmed, \nall because of holds by the Republicans. Do they object so much to \nhaving President Obama as President that they will hold up well-\nqualified judges? These are supposed to be nonpartisan, outside the \npolitical area.\n  This alarming spike in vacancies is only further fueled by delays and \ninaction. In addition, 26 future vacancies have been announced. At this \nrate, as I said at the judicial conference this week with the Chief \nJustice and leaders of the Federal judiciary, the Federal judicial \nvacancies will soon be close to 120 unless we start acting on these \nnominations in a responsible and fair manner. These nominations should \nnot be something where Republicans or Democrats might score political \npoints. Our inaction on these nominations hurts the average American. \nThey do not care about the politics. They want Federal courts that are \ngoing to work. They do not want cases delayed because we have vacancies \nin\n\n[[Page S9522]]\n\nthe Federal court that we could easily be filling.\n  I do not think most Americans, when they go into a court, say: I am \nhere as a Republican or a Democrat. They go in and say: I am here as a \nplaintiff or defendant. They are there to seek justice, not to find out \nthere is nobody in the courthouse because the minority party does not \nwant President Obama filling vacancies.\n  During the last Presidency, we worked very hard to fill vacancies. \nWhen I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and we had a President of \nthe other party, we were able to reduce overall vacancies by two-\nthirds, from over 100 down to 34. We were able to reduce circuit court \nvacancies to single digits. Today, because we are blocked from getting \njudges through, because Republican Senators will not give this \nDemocratic President the same courtesies we gave a Republican \nPresident, those vacancies have nearly tripled. In the 17 months I \nserved as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman during President Bush's \nfirst term, the Senate confirmed 100 of the President's judicial \nnominations. So far this year, 9 months into the year, we have not \nconfirmed a single Federal district judge or circuit judge. In fact, \nJudge Lynch will be the first.\n  Despite the fact that President Obama sent his first judicial \nnomination to the Senate 2 months earlier than President Bush, despite \nthe fact that judicial nominees have the support of Republican home \nState Senators, despite the fact that the Judiciary Committee has \nreported favorably five judicial nominees to the Senate for final \naction, and despite the fact that judicial nominees have been pending \non the Senate calendar for more than 3 months, we have not been able to \nreach agreement before today to vote on a single judicial nominee for \neither a district court or a circuit court.\n  The first of President Obama's nominations, that of Judge David \nHamilton to the Seventh Circuit, was made in March. It has been on the \nExecutive Calendar since early June, despite the support of the most \nsenior of Senate Republicans, Senator Lugar. The nomination of Judge \nAndre Davis on the Fourth Circuit was reported by the committee on June \n4 by a vote of 16 to 3 but has yet to receive Senate consideration. We \nshould not further delay Senate consideration of these well-respected, \nmainstream Federal judges.\n  During the last Congress, we reduced Federal judicial vacancies from \n10 percent, under Republican control of the Senate during the Clinton \nadministration, to less than half that level. We cut circuit vacancies \nfrom 32 to less than 10 last year. Ironically, during President Bush's \ntwo Presidential terms, more nominees were confirmed with a Democratic \nSenate majority than a Republican majority, and in less time. I am \nurging Republican Senators to work together with the President to fill \nvacancies on the Federal bench.\n  I hope that Republican Senators do not seek to return to the \npractices of the 1990s that more than doubled circuit court vacancies. \nThe crisis they created led to public criticism of their actions by \nChief Justice Rehnquist during those years. It is not a good sign that \nalready this year Republican Senators threatened a filibuster of the \nDeputy Attorney General and pursued five filibusters, including one for \nElena Kagan, the Solicitor General, one for Harold Koh to be the Legal \nAdviser to the State Department, and another that was finally broken \njust last week on Cass Sunstein, who heads the White House Office of \nManagement and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. \nNor is it a good sign that in March every Republican Senator signed a \nletter to the President threatening filibusters of his judicial \nnominees before they were even nominated.\n  We are supposed to be the conscience of the Nation in the Senate. If \na Senator does not like a particular nominee, vote against him or her. \nBut these are nominees that will probably pass unanimously.\n  I hope, instead, that both sides of the aisle will join together to \ntreat the nominees of President Obama fairly. I made sure that we \ntreated President Bush's nominees more fairly than President Clinton's \nnominees had been treated. We should continue that progress rather than \nratcheting up the partisanship and holding down our productivity with \nrespect to Senate consideration of judicial nominations. Our \ndemonstrated ability to work together to fill judicial vacancies will \ngo a long way toward elevating public trust in our justice system.\n  Another troubling sign is the refusal of every Republican Senator to \ncosponsor the comprehensive judgeship bill. Last week I reintroduced \nthat legislation embodying your nonpartisan recommendations for 63 \njudgeships needed around the country. Not a single Republican Senator \nwould cosponsor the bill. Even traditional cosponsors with whom I have \nworked for years would not join. Not one of the 18 Republican Senators \nwhose states would benefit from additional judges yet supports the \nbill. For that matter, Republican Senators obstructed the hearing on a \nsimilar bill last summer, after they had requested the hearing. As we \npass legislation that is leading to increased workloads in the Federal \ncourts, we need to be cognizant of the increasing workloads and needs \nof the Federal courts.\n  Judge Gerard Lynch began his legal career as a Federal prosecutor in \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where \nhe investigated and prosecuted white collar and political corruption \ncases, and argued complex criminal appeals. Through his exemplary hard \nwork and considerable skill, he rose to be chief of the criminal \ndivision in the Southern District of New York, where he managed the \noffice's criminal cases and supervised well over 130 Federal \nprosecutors. Judge Lynch has also served as a part-time associate \ncounsel for the Office of Independent Counsel and as a counsel to a \nWall Street New York law firm.\n  He also has impeccable legal credentials. Judge Lynch graduated summa \ncum laude and first in his class from both Columbia Law School and \nColumbia University. He clerked for Justice Brennan on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States and Judge Feinberg on the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.

He clerked for Justice Brennan on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States and Judge Feinberg on the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  While maintaining a full judicial caseload, Judge Lynch has also been \na distinguished legal scholar who has received praise as one of the \ncountry's outstanding law professors. For over 13 years, he taught \ncriminal law, criminal procedure, and constitutional law as the Paul J. \nKellner Professor of Law at Columbia University's School of Law. For 5 \nyears, Judge Lynch also served as the vice dean of that fine legal \ninstitution. He is nationally known as a criminal law expert and has \nreceived numerous honors, including the distinction of being the first \nlaw professor to receive Columbia University's President's award for \noutstanding teaching.\n  Judge Lynch's nomination has received numerous letters of support, \nincluding strong endorsements from public officials and law professors \nacross the political spectrum. Otto G. Obermaier, who served as \nPresident George H.W. Bush's U.S. attorney for the Southern District of \nNew York, supports Judge Lynch's candidacy to the Second Circuit and \ncalled him a person of ``superior judgment and intelligence'' who is \n``intellectually gifted.'' Professor Henry P. Monaghan, the Harlan \nFiske Stone Professor of Law at Columbia University, writes that Judge \nLynch ``is everything you want in a judge: fair, tough-minded, \nenormously experienced, highly intelligent, and apolitical'' and his \naddition to the Second Circuit would ``strengthen'' that court. He has \nthe support of the Senators from New York.\n  I congratulate Judge Lynch and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n[[Page S9523]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withdraw that request. I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nNew York in the Chamber, a man who works so extremely hard in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, who has worked night and day for Judge \nLynch, who has made sure we all realize what impeccable credentials he \nhas.\n  I yield to the Senator, but I ask, first, unanimous consent that if \nthere are quorum calls, the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank our chairman and leader, \nSenator Leahy, for not just moving this very qualified nominee forward \nbut for his diligence and steadfastness and patience as we try to move \njudges to the floor. Senator Leahy, as everyone in this Chamber knows, \nis a very fairminded person. He always goes out of his way to allow \npeople to have their time to speak. We had this in the Judiciary \nCommittee this morning. He has done an amazing job trying to move our \njudges through. I hope those on the other side of the aisle will hear \nhis heartfelt plea that we stop all these dilatory tactics.\n  Having said that, today is a very good day because I am so pleased to \nrise in favor of the nomination of the first appointment by President \nObama to a Federal appellate court that this body will consider. If \nJudge Gerard Lynch is any indication of the quality and temperament and \nintellectual firepower of judges whom President Obama intends to \nnominate, then my friends on both sides of the aisle should have reason \nto rejoice today.\n  As Chairman Leahy has already noted, Judge Lynch was referred out of \ncommittee by a unanimous voice vote. Even my friend and colleague \nRanking Member Sessions was able to support Judge Lynch despite having \nopposed his nomination to the district court bench in 2000.\n  Judge Lynch, who currently sits as a U.S. district judge in the \nSouthern District of New York, comes to us today for confirmation much \nas he did in 2000 for his first confirmation: with an unimpeachable \nrecord of moderation, consistency, intelligence, and dedication to \nexploring all facets of complex legal questions. But since then, he has \namassed an impressive record of moderation and thoroughness. In his 9 \nyears on the bench, he has issued nearly 800 opinions, has tried nearly \n90 cases to verdict, and has been overturned by the Second Circuit only \n12 times--and one of those times, the Second Circuit was, in turn, \nreversed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  There should not be any doubt that Judge Lynch is not an ideologue. \nHis opinions and his writings show moderation and thoughtfulness. He is \npragmatic. His peers and those who practice before him have found him \nto be both probing and courteous--in sum, very judicial in his \ntemperament.\n  In response to questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee in \n2000, Judge Lynch said:\n\n       A judge who comes to the bench with an agenda, or a set of \n     social problems he or she would like to solve, is in the \n     wrong business.\n\n  As his record has shown, Judge Lynch is in the right business.\n  I have said many times that my criteria for selecting good judges are \nthree: excellence--they should be top of the line legally; moderation--\njudges should not be too far right or too far left; and diversity.\n  As is somewhat known, despite the fact that President Bush and I \nclashed on Supreme Court nominees and some of these circuit court \nnominees, within New York and within the Second Circuit we had a very \namiable arrangement where he would nominate two and then we would get--\nSenator Clinton and I would get to nominate one. We each had veto power \non the other.\n  I am proud to say that Judge Lynch was one of my first choices to put \non the district court bench. It was because of the recommendations of \nhis peers, the lawyers with whom he practiced, and just how good the \ngeneral legal community thought he was.\n\n  That stands true today. He still, more than ever before, meets the \nqualifications of excellence, moderation, and diversity.\n  There is no question of his excellence. He was first in both his \nclasses at Columbia, undergraduate and law school--first, not even \nsecond or third. Pretty good. His opinions are scholarly, and one that \nwas overturned by the Second Circuit was lauded by the panel as ``a \nvaliant effort by a conscientious district judge.''\n  There is also no question that Judge Lynch is, in fact, a moderate. \nHis impressively low reversal rate should give the lie to any argument \nthat he is outside the legal mainstream.\n  Now, the rap on Judge Lynch in 2000 among those 36 who voted against \nhim was that he would be an ``activist.'' This view rose from out-of-\ncontext outtakes from two law review articles he had written. I repeat \nnow what I said then: In both of these articles, then-Professor Lynch \nexpressed the moderate view that the Constitution cannot as a practical \nmatter remain frozen in the 18th century--the Constitution should not \nbe expanded but it must be interpreted.\n  To illustrate my point about why Judge Lynch should be accepted as a \nparagon of moderation, I want to read two quotes.\n  First:\n\n       Text is the definitive expression of what was legislated.\n\n  Second:\n\n       A text should not be construed strictly, and it should not \n     be construed leniently; it should be construed reasonably, to \n     contain all that it fairly means.\n\n  The second quote was written by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. The \nfirst quote was from our nominee, Judge Lynch.\n  So the entirety of Judge Lynch's copious opinions and rulings bears \nout the conclusion that he does not intend to legislate from the bench. \nHe has been the definition of law enforcing and justice seeking. He has \nruled for the State against prisoners, but he has also ruled that the \nState must protect the due process rights of those it seeks to detain. \nHe has sentenced defendants convicted of horrible crimes to life \nwithout parole, and he has also expressed concern when he thinks a \nsentence might be too long--while imposing the sentence in complete \naccordance with the law. He has issued complex and scholarly opinions \nin securities and antitrust cases. Judge Lynch imposed the sentence \nthat was required by law.\n  In sum, Judge Lynch is excellent, and he represents moderation.\n  Now let me say a word about diversity. Judge Lynch obviously is not a \nnominee who fits this bill. But I want to note another kind of \ndiversity that I believe deserves mention. Before he went on the bench, \nJudge Lynch sought out opportunities to be more than a smart professor \nliving in an ivory tower. He spent 5 years in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice in the Southern District of New York as Chief of the appellate \nsection and Chief of the Criminal Division. He worked as counsel to a \nprominent law firm. He took numerous pro bono cases. In short, he lived \nthe life of a real lawyer while teaching and writing. Driven by his own \nconscience, he even registered for the draft during the Vietnam war \nrather than seek a college deferment. Very few do that. This is someone \nwho has sought out a diversity of experiences which he now brings to \nthe table as a judge.\n  I look forward to this new chapter in Judge Lynch's service to our \ncountry. I hope he will get a unanimous vote, or close to it, from the \nMembers of this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as you can tell from the chart on my left, \nI rise today to speak about the issue that is probably the No. 1 \nchallenge we face in the Congress today, which is debating and devising \nsolutions for the improvement of our health care system in so many \nways. I rise today to talk about some aspects of that and especially \nnot only where we are headed in terms of focusing on both those with \ninsurance and those without insurance but also to focus on some of the \ngoals here.\n\n[[Page S9524]]\n\n  From the beginning, both President Obama and Members of Congress have \nfocused on a couple of priorities--first of all, to reduce costs. We \ncannot go forward with any health care bill that does not do that, and \nI think we will do that.\n  We have to reduce costs, but we also have to ensure choices. We have \nto continue to give the American people the kind of choice they should \nhave a right to expect and give them a sense of a peace of mind in \nterms of what that choice will mean. We ought to make sure this bill, \nfor example, leads to the following conclusion: You get the treatment \nyou need from the doctor you choose. I think we can do that in the \nCongress.\n  Thirdly, I think we have to make sure, as we are controlling costs \nand ensuring choice, that we ensure quality and that we put both \nquality and prevention in the final bill. They are in the bill I voted \nfor already this summer.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, as people know, \ndebated all summer, with hours and hours and hours of debate, accepting \nRepublican and Democratic amendments, sometimes not agreeing, but we \nvoted out a bill that did a lot of what I just talked about. It focused \non making sure we are covering more Americans. It protected Americans \nwho have coverage.\n  So many people, as the Presiding Officer knows--whether it is in the \nState of Illinois or the State of Pennsylvania or any State in the \ncountry--even those with insurance, are not secure, even those with \ninsurance feel a sense of instability, a lack of control over their own \ndestiny, sometimes because an insurance company says: We are going to \ndeny you coverage because of a preexisting condition. Why have we \npermitted that? Why have we tolerated that year after year? Instead of \njust talking about preventing them from doing that, why haven't we \nliterally made it illegal for an insurance company to do that? We are \ngoing to make sure this year we do not just talk about it but we \nlegislate about it and make that part of our law.\n  So we will go through some of those issues, but the first thing I \nwant to highlight is where we are headed if we do not do anything.\n  There are some people in Washington who, to be candid or blunt about \nit, want to scratch their heads for a couple more years or maybe 10 \nmore years.\n  Here, as shown on this chart, is where we are headed by one \nestimation. The New America Foundation is the source for this \ninformation. But here we are in 2008. When you talk about the cost of \nan annual premium, OK, it is roughly--and actually we found out the \nother day that number is a little higher--we can say it is a little \nmore than $13,000 for family coverage. If you look between 2008 and \n2016--just 8 years in that estimation, and we are already into 2009--\nthat premium will rise by more than 83 percent. Why should we allow \nthat to happen when we know we can do something about it this year? So \nthat is one way to look at this in terms of the cost of doing nothing.\n  Also, often people with insurance will say: Well, I have some \nproblems with my insurance. I worry about a preexisting condition, I \nworry about exorbitant out-of-pocket costs, and I am glad you are \nworking on that and I will support that part of the bill. But they say: \nLook, if I have coverage, I am worried about giving millions of more \nAmericans coverage without some adverse effect to those who have \ncoverage.\n  Well, let's look at this chart for a little bit of a discussion about \nthis topic: families paying 8 percent surcharge on premiums. If we look \nat this chart, what this red or red-orange part of the chart shows is a \n$1,100 hidden tax to cover the cost of uncompensated care for the \nuninsured. So the idea that those with insurance right now are not \npaying for those without insurance is ridiculous. Fortunately, in \nPennsylvania, that number is a little lower, but it is still 900 bucks. \nSo the idea that somehow if we change the system, improve the existing \nsystem, build upon what works but improve the system, that somehow that \nis going to adversely impact in a cost sense those with insurance--the \nCenter for American Progress did this research--this chart and others \nshow if you have insurance today, you are paying for those without \ninsurance. Right now you are paying for them. We know that right now.\n  So, if anything, broadening the number of Americans who have coverage \nwill actually reduce costs. It will be one of the contributors, I \nshould say, of reducing costs--not the only way but one of the ways we \ndo that.\n  Let me go to the next chart which is a depiction in very simple \ncolors, red and green, about what the existing system does adversely as \nit relates to women. There are a lot of things that insurance companies \ndo today that we don't like and we have complained about, but now we \ncan do something about it. One is a preexisting condition problem and \nanother one is the out-of-pocket costs and another one is how often \ninsurance policies definitively discriminate against some Americans.\n  This map shows in the orange or red section: gender rating allowed. \nIn other words, insurance practices that lead to policies in States \nthat result in discrimination against women. So you want this chart to \nshow all in the green States where gender rating is banned.\n  What we would like to do with our legislation, one of the goals--and \nit is in our bill and in the bill we passed this summer, the Affordable \nHealth Choices Act--is to make sure the whole country is green on this \nissue, green in the sense that we have banned gender rating; that an \ninsurance company can't say, when they are trying to determine how they \nmake up their policy, that if you happen to be a woman, a policy would \ndiscriminate against you.\n  Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is a State that has permitted this \ndiscrimination, along with all of these other States. So we ought to \nhave a national standard. Very simply: No more discriminating insurance \npolicies against women. It is that simple, folks.\n  What I voted for this summer in the bill we passed was this, along \nwith other provisions. So that is something we shouldn't just talk \nabout for another year or 2 or 5 or 10; let's do something about this \nnow. Let's make this practice illegal this year, and we can do it with \nthe legislation.\n  The next one is an enlarged version of some language. I mentioned \npreexisting conditions in my remarks today, and we are going to keep \nmentioning this because this is a reality for millions of Americans in \nthe individual market, the people who have to go it alone. They are not \npart of the big pool of people getting insurance. They have to go it \nalone to get insurance. They are the ones who are often most adversely \naffected by preexisting conditions. Why should we tolerate that?\n  The other point about this chart is, I purposefully put legislative \nlanguage on it because a lot of people here want to say: Well, this \nlegislation and language gets complicated. Admittedly, some of it does, \nbut this is pretty easy. This is in the bill we passed this summer. I \nwill just read this one sentence. Anyone can understand this. This \nisn't some complicated legislative language:\n\n       A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering \n     group or individual health insurance coverage may--\n\n  We know what they are; we know exactly what we are talking about \nhere--\n\n     not impose any preexisting condition exclusion--\n\n  That is in our bill--\n\n     with respect to such plan or coverage.\n\n  Let's do it this year. Let's make it illegal for insurance companies \nto do this to an individual or to a family or to those who happen to be \nemployees of a small business.\n  So some of this debate gets lost in detail, but this is very simple \nlanguage taken right out of the bill.\n  Let's go to the next one and our final chart before I conclude. I am \ngoing to spend more time on this issue, but I just wanted to spend a \ncouple of minutes on this issue.\n  What happens at the end of this road with regard to health care as it \npertains to children, especially children who happen to be poor or \nchildren with special needs? What will happen? At the end of the road, \nwhen we pass a bill and send it to the President and he signs it--and \nthat is what I hope will happen, of course--will poor children and \nchildren with special needs be better off or worse off? That is still a \nquestion. That is still an open question we are debating right now.\n\n[[Page S9525]]\n\n  Children are different than those of us who happen to be adults. They \nare not smaller versions of adults; they are different. Their treatment \nneeds are different. We have to give them different kinds of preventive \ncare. In Medicaid, for example, we give what they call early periodic \nscreening and diagnostic testing, known by the acronym EPSDT. We focus \non the special needs of children and give them early diagnosis, early \ntreatment. That is what I am talking about in general. So they aren't \nsmall adults. It seems like a simple concept, but we have to say it \nmore than we do. It is clear they have different needs, particularly \nthe ones who are the most disadvantaged. The poor are the ones who \ncould potentially be a lot sicker with the threat of sickness and \ndisease. We make sure they get the highest quality care throughout \ntheir childhood. That is a resolution I introduced as a statement of \npolicy.\n  So we are going to continue to debate not just a question of bringing \ndown costs--that is central to what we are trying to do--not just a \nquestion of quality, and not only the question of enhancing choice and \ngiving people some stability over their own lives with insurance and \nthose who don't have insurance, giving them some affordable choices--\nthat is all important, and we are going to spend a lot more time on \nthose questions, but another question we have to address is, what \nhappens at the end of the road for poor children or children with \nspecial needs?\n  The rule ought to be very simple: No child in those categories, no \nchild worse off. Four words: No child worse off at the end of this.\n  So we will have a lot more time to continue to debate the legislation \nand a lot of these important issues. I think the American people want \nus to act. They don't want us to just debate and not get something \ndone.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Missile Defense\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment with the administration's decision to cancel plans for \nfully developing missile defenses in Eastern Europe. This decision \ncalls into question security and diplomatic commitments the United \nStates has made to Poland and the Czech Republic. I believe it has the \npotential to undermine American leadership in Eastern Europe.\n  Given the strong and enduring relationships we have forged with the \nregion's Nations since the end of the Cold War, we should not take \nsteps backward in strengthening these ties. Yet I fear the \nadministration's decision will do just that, and at a time when Eastern \nEuropean nations are increasingly wary of renewed Russian aggression.\n  The administration's decision to abandon these sites comes at a time \nwhen the United States is in the midst of negotiations with Russia on \nreducing strategic nuclear weapons. Russia has long opposed the planned \nmissile defense sites in Europe and has on numerous occasions tried to \nlink reductions in offensive strategic nuclear arms with defensive \ncapabilities such as missile defense. In fact, President Putin, on many \noccasions, has stated in very belligerent tones his opposition to this \nagreement that was already made between the United States and Poland \nand the Czech Republic.\n  The United States should reject the Russian attempt to further this \nargument and capitalize on these ongoing negotiations.\n  As rogue nations, including North Korea and Iran, push the nuclear \nenvelope and work tirelessly to develop weapons capable of reaching \nAmerica and its allies, we must aggressively develop the systems \nnecessary to counter such belligerent efforts and enhance our national \nsecurity, protect our troops abroad, and support our allies. Enhancing \nmissile defense capabilities in Europe is an essential component to \naddressing threats we currently face and expect to face in the future. \nAs Iran works to develop ballistic missile capabilities of all ranges, \nthe United States must reaffirm its commitments to its allies and \ndevelop and deploy effective missile defense systems.\n  I wish to point out two important factors. The United States of \nAmerica does not believe missile defense systems are in any way a \nthreat to any nation. They are defensive in nature, and I believe they \nwere a key component and factor in ending the Cold War.\n  Intelligence assessments apparently have changed rather dramatically \nsince January 16. According to Eric Edelman, the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Policy under Secretary Gates during the Bush \nadministration, intelligence reports on the Iranian threat as recently \nas January of this year were more troubling than what is being \nportrayed by the current administration. Mr. Edelman maintains that:\n\n       Maybe something really dramatic changed between January 16 \n     and now in terms of what the Iranians are doing with their \n     missile systems, but I don't think so.\n\n  You know what. I don't think so either. I think the fact is that this \ndecision was obviously rushed. The Polish Prime Minister, according to \nnews reports, was called at midnight. The agreement was made and \nratified by these countries after consultation, discussion, and a \nproper process. They were not even notified of this decision. The \ndecision to abandon the missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech \nRepublic came as a surprise to them.\n  I understand that administration officials were on a plane supposedly \nto arrive in Poland today. I might add that Members of Congress were \nalso not briefed on this decision prior to reading about it in the \nnewspaper. I was not informed. I didn't know what ``new technology'' \nwas being recommended to be put in the place of the agreement. As short \na time ago as August 20, the United States said:\n\n       The United States is committed to the security of Poland \n     and of any U.S. facilities located on the territory of the \n     Republic of Poland. . . . The United States and Poland intend \n     to expand air and missile defense cooperation--et cetera.\n\n  We all know the Iranian ballistic missile threat is real and growing. \nWe all know the administration is seeking the cooperation and help of \nthe Russians. Now we will see. Now we will see.\n  Why was this agreement rushed into--or the abrogation of an \nagreement? Why the abrogation of this agreement between the United \nStates with Poland and the United States with the Czech Republic \nrescinded in such a dramatic and rushed fashion? We all know the \nIranian ballistic missile threat is real and growing. How many times \nhave the ``intelligence estimates'' been wrong dating back to and \nincluding the Cold War? As many times as they have been right, I tell \nmy colleagues--whether it be their assessment about the war in Iraq or \nwhether it be the capabilities of many of our adversaries, including \nthe Korean buildup, which we have been consistently wrong on.\n\n  The last administration reached out to the governments of Poland and \nthe Czech Republic and asked that they make what many at the time \nperceived as an unpopular agreement. Despite threats from Russia, both \ngovernments recognized the importance such a defense capability would \nprovide to their citizens and to Europe as a whole and agreed to allow \nthe United States to place ground-based interceptors in Poland and a \nmidcourse radar site in the Czech Republic. What are these countries \ngoing to do the next time we want to make an agreement with them, in \nview of the way this decision was made and announced or, shall I say, \nmade known to the media before they were even told about it. It will be \nvery interesting to see what we get in return.\n  According to a Christian Science Monitor's global news blog:\n\n       ``We see this as a pragmatic decision,'' says Pavel \n     Zolotaryov, deputy director of the official institute of USA-\n     Canada Studies, suggesting that internal U.S. factors mainly \n     account for Mr. Obama's choice. ``Obama's sober approach is \n     understandable, given the [economic] crisis, because this \n     project would have given nothing but trouble.''\n       If it sounds like Moscow has already discounted this \n     sweeping strategic concession from Washington, experts \n     suggest that's because Russia's foreign policy establishment \n     had been expecting such a decision, at least since Obama \n     hinted that he might give up the missile defense scheme \n     during his summit with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in \n     Moscow last July.\n       ``We've been getting signals since last Spring that made it \n     seem almost certain that the missile defense plan would be \n     set aside,'' said Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global \n     Affairs, a leading Moscow foreign policy journal.\n\n  The Russians seem to have anticipated this decision. Unfortunately, \nthe\n\n[[Page S9526]]\n\nPolish Government and the Czech Government did not. Members of Congress \nwere certainly not informed of this decision until after reading about \nit in the media. That is not the way to do business. I think it sends \nthe wrong signal to the Russians and to our friends and allies.\n  There are consequences with every decision. I believe the \nconsequences of this decision may--albeit unintentionally--encourage \nfurther belligerence on the part of Russians and a distinct lack and \nloss of confidence on the part of our friends and allies in the word of \nthe United States and the commitments of the United States of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that articles in the Wall Street Journal and \nthe Christian Science Monitor be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 17, 2009]\n\nU.S. To Shelve Nuclear-Missile Shield--Defense Plans for Poland, Czech \nRepublic To Be Dropped as Iran Rocket Threat Downgraded; Moscow Likely \n                            to Welcome Move\n\n                           (By Peter Spiegel)\n\n       Washington.--The White House will shelve Bush \n     administration plans to build a missile-defense system in \n     Poland and the Czech Republic, according to people familiar \n     with the matter, a move likely to cheer Moscow and roil the \n     security debate in Europe.\n       The U.S. will base its decision on a determination that \n     Iran's long-range missile program has not progressed as \n     rapidly as previously estimated, reducing the threat to the \n     continental U.S. and major European capitals, according to \n     current and former U.S. officials.\n       The findings, expected to be completed as early as next \n     week following a 60-day review ordered by President Barack \n     Obama, would be a major reversal from the Bush \n     administration, which pushed aggressively to begin \n     construction of the Eastern European system before leaving \n     office in January.\n       The Bush administration proposed the European-based system \n     to counter the perceived threat of Iran developing a nuclear \n     weapon that could be placed atop its increasingly \n     sophisticated missiles. There is widespread disagreement over \n     the progress of Iran's nuclear program toward developing such \n     a weapon, but miniaturizing nuclear weapons for use on long-\n     range missiles is one of the most difficult technological \n     hurdles for an aspiring nuclear nation.\n       The Bush plan infuriated the Kremlin, which argued the \n     system was a potential threat to its own intercontinental \n     ballistic missiles. U.S. officials repeatedly insisted the \n     location and limited scale of the system--a radar site in the \n     Czech Republic and 10 interceptor missiles in Poland--posed \n     no threat to Russian strategic arms.\n       The Obama administration's assessment concludes that U.S. \n     allies in Europe, including members of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization, face a more immediate threat from Iran's \n     short- and medium-range missiles and will order a shift \n     towards the development of regional missile defenses for the \n     Continent, according to people familiar with the matter. Such \n     systems would be far less controversial.\n       Critics of the shift are bound to view it as a gesture to \n     win Russian cooperation with U.S.-led efforts to seek new \n     economic sanctions on Iran if Tehran doesn't abandon its \n     nuclear program. Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. \n     Security Council, has opposed efforts to impose fresh \n     sanctions on Tehran.\n       Security Council members, which include the U.S. and \n     Russia, will meet with Iranian negotiators on Oct. 1 to \n     discuss Iran's nuclear program.\n       Current and former U.S. officials briefed on the \n     assessment's findings said the administration was expected to \n     leave open the option of restarting the Polish and Czech \n     system if Iran makes advances in its long-range missiles in \n     the future.\n       But the decision to shelve the defense system is all but \n     certain to raise alarms in Eastern Europe, where officials \n     have expressed concerns that the White House's effort to \n     ``reset'' relations with Moscow would come at the expense of \n     U.S. allies in the former Soviet bloc. ``The Poles are \n     nervous,'' said a senior U.S. military official.\n       A Polish official said his government wouldn't \n     ``speculate'' on administration decisions regarding missile \n     defense, but said ``we expect the U.S. will abide by its \n     commitments'' to cooperate with Poland militarily in areas \n     beyond the missile-defense program.\n       Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he \n     expected the Obama administration to drop the missile-defense \n     plans. He said that Moscow wouldn't view the move as a \n     concession but rather a reversal of a mistaken Bush-era \n     policy.\n       Still, the decision is likely to be seen in Russia as a \n     victory for the Kremlin. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev \n     will meet with Mr. Obama at next week's meetings of the U.N. \n     General Assembly and Group of 20 industrialized and \n     developing nations.\n       Although a center-right government in Prague supported the \n     Bush missile-defense plan when it was first proposed, the \n     Czech Republic is now run by a caretaker government. A Czech \n     official said his government was concerned an announcement by \n     the White House on the missile-defense program could \n     influence upcoming elections and has urged a delay. But the \n     Obama administration has decided to keep to its original \n     timetable.\n       European analysts said the administration would be forced \n     to work hard to convince both sides the decision wasn't made \n     to curry favor with Moscow and, instead, relied only on the \n     program's technical merits and analysis of Iran's missile \n     capabilities.\n       ``There are two audiences: the Russians and the various \n     European countries,'' said Sarah Mendelson, a Russia expert \n     at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``The \n     task is: How do they cut through the conspiracy theories in \n     Moscow?''\n       The Obama administration has been careful to characterize \n     its review as a technical assessment of the threat posed by \n     the Iranian regime, as well as the costs and capabilities of \n     a ground-based antimissile system to complement the two \n     already operating in Alaska and central California. Those \n     West Coast sites are meant to defend against North Korean \n     missiles.\n       The administration has also debated offering Poland and the \n     Czech Republic alternative programs to reassure the two NATO \n     members that the U.S. remains committed to their defense.\n       Poland, in particular, has lobbied the White House to \n     deploy Patriot missile batteries--the U.S. Army's primary \n     battlefield missile-defense system--manned by American troops \n     as an alternative.\n       Although Polish officials supported the Bush plan, U.S. \n     officials said they had indicated their primary desire was \n     getting U.S. military personnel on Polish soil. Gen. Carter \n     Hamm, commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe, said \n     Washington has begun talks with Polish officials about \n     starting to rotate Europe-based American Patriot units into \n     Poland for month-long training tours as a first step toward a \n     more permanent presence.\n       ``My position has been: Let's get started as soon as we can \n     with the training rotations, while the longer-term stationing \n     . . . is decided between the two governments,'' Gen. Hamm \n     said in an interview.\n       For several years, the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency \n     has been pushing for breaking ground in Poland and the Czech \n     Republic, arguing that construction must begin so the system \n     would be in place to counter Tehran's emerging long-range-\n     missile program, which intelligence assessments determined \n     would produce an effective rocket by about 2015.\n       But in recent months, several prominent experts have \n     questioned that timetable. A study by Russian and U.S. \n     scientists published in May by the East-West Institute, an \n     international think tank, downplayed the progress of Iran's \n     long-range-missile program. In addition, Gen. James \n     Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     and an expert in missile defense and space-based weapons, \n     said in a speech last month that long-range capabilities of \n     both Iran and North Korea ``are not there yet.''\n       ``We believed that the emergence of the intercontinental \n     ballistic missile would come much faster than it did,'' Gen. \n     Cartwright said. ``The reality is, it has not come as fast as \n     we thought it would come.''\n       It is not an assessment that is shared universally. Eric \n     Edelman, who oversaw missile-defense issues at the Pentagon \n     as undersecretary of defense for policy in the Bush \n     administration, said intelligence reports he reviewed were \n     more troubling.\n       ``Maybe something really dramatic changed between Jan. 16 \n     and now in terms of what the Iranians are doing with their \n     missile system, but I don't think so,'' Mr. Edelman said, \n     referring to his last day in office.\n       There is far more consensus on Iran's ability to develop \n     its short- and medium-range missiles, and the administration \n     review is expected to recommend a shift in focus toward \n     European defenses against those threats. Such a program would \n     be developed closely with NATO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Sept. 17, 2009]\n\n         Russia's Response to U.S. Missile Defense Shield Shift\n\n                             (By Fred Weir)\n\n\n   Moscow has long opposed a missile shield in Poland and the Czech \n       Republic. But the U.S. shouldn't expect too much in return\n\n       Moscow.--President Barack Obama's decision to shelve plans \n     for a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe could be seen \n     as a major concession to Moscow. But given years of vehement \n     opposition to the controversial plan, Russian reaction to the \n     move appears surprisingly lukewarm.\n       So what does it mean for U.S.-Russia relations?\n       There are indications that Russia might support tougher \n     sanctions on Iran, and fresh START talks, as well as more \n     cooperation with the war in Afghanistan. The Kremlin also \n     expects the U.S. to back off on expanding NATO, say Russian \n     analysts.\n       ``We see this as a pragmatic decision,'' says Pavel \n     Zolotaryov, deputy director of the official Institute of USA-\n     Canada Studies, suggesting that internal U.S. factors mainly \n     account for Mr. Obama's choice. ``Obama's sober approach is \n     understandable, given the\n\n[[Page S9527]]\n\n     [economic] crisis, because this project would have given \n     nothing but trouble.''\n       If it sounds like Moscow has already discounted this \n     sweeping strategic concession from Washington, experts \n     suggest that's because Russia's foreign policy establishment \n     had been expecting such a decision, at least since Obama \n     hinted that he might give up the missile defense scheme \n     during his summit with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in \n     Moscow last July.\n       ``We've been getting signals since last Spring that made it \n     seem almost certain that the missile defense plan would be \n     set aside,'' says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global \n     Affairs, a leading Moscow foreign policy journal.\n\n\n        New arms deal now within reach, but concessions on Iran?\n\n       Mr. Lukyanov says the only predictable result of key \n     importance is that negotiations for a new strategic arms \n     reduction treaty to replace the soon-to-expire 1991 START \n     accord are now likely to meet the December deadline for a \n     fresh deal.\n       ``Now we can be sure the new START agreement will be \n     completed on time, because the vexing issue of missile \n     defense and how it affects the strategic balance has been \n     removed for the time being,'' he says. ``That's quite an \n     important matter.''\n       But while Russian experts say the move can only contribute \n     to a warmer dialogue between Moscow and Washington, they say \n     no one should expect any reciprocal concessions from the \n     Kremlin on issues of key concern to the U.S., such as Iran.\n\n\n                 Why Russia has opposed missile defense\n\n       Washington has consistently argued since news of the \n     proposed missile defense shield emerged in 2006 that it was \n     intended to protect Europe and the U.S. from a rogue missile \n     attack from Iran or North Korea and not to undermine Russia's \n     strategic deterrent.\n       Moscow has retorted that those threats are merely \n     theoretical, but Russia's dependence upon its aging Soviet-\n     era nuclear missile force for its national security would be \n     deeply affected if the American scheme were to go forward.\n       ``Iran isn't going to have any long-range missiles in the \n     near future anyway,'' says Alexander Sharavin, director of \n     the independent Institute of Military and Political Analysis \n     in Moscow.\n       ``The U.S. evidently doesn't want to quarrel with Russia, \n     now that Moscow is collaborating in such areas of importance \n     to the U.S. as Afghanistan,'' where Moscow has enabled a \n     resupply corridor through former Soviet territory to \n     embattled NATO forces, and offered other forms of \n     cooperation, he says.\n\n\n       Russians expect another U.S. concession--on NATO expansion\n\n       Mr. Lukyanov says ``it's possible'' Russia may be more \n     pliable on the issue of tough sanctions against Iran, a \n     measure it has strongly resisted in the past. He says that in \n     a recent meeting with foreign policy experts, President \n     Medvedev introduced a new tone by remarking on his contacts \n     with Arab leaders who are deeply worried about Iran's alleged \n     drive to obtain nuclear weapons.\n       ``It may be that Russia will be more amenable, but this is \n     a deeply complicated issue,'' he says. ``On Iran, and other \n     regional conflicts, the differences between Moscow and \n     Washington are deep, and that hasn't changed.''\n       Russian experts also say they believe the Obama \n     administration will quietly set aside the other issue that \n     has infuriated Moscow over recent years: the effort to expand \n     NATO into the former USSR by including Ukraine and Georgia.\n       ``I wouldn't expect any formal statements to this effect, \n     but it's more or less clear that the issue of NATO \n     enlargement is off the table for the time being,'' says \n     Lukyanov.\n\n\n                        Postponed, not canceled\n\n       So why isn't sunshine breaking and a new era of strategic \n     accord dawning between Moscow and Washington?\n       ``Nothing has been canceled, missile defense has just been \n     postponed,'' says Lukyanov. ``For awhile this topic is off \n     the agenda, but later it will return. So, for now the \n     political situation may improve, but the underlying pattern \n     of relations is unlikely to change in any basic way.''\n       And Russian hawks might see the dropping of the missile \n     shield as weakness in Washington and press the Kremlin for \n     even less compromise on key U.S.-Russia issues.\n       ``I think the reaction of Russia's leadership will be \n     positive on the whole,'' says Mr. Sharavin. ``But Russian \n     hawks are very likely to find faults, and use this to build \n     up their own positions.''\n       Who's the new right-wing prophet advising the Kremlin?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes and that \nthe time be charged against Senator Leahy's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about an issue \nthat has been front and center in my office for the past 12 months--\nreforming regulation of our financial markets.\n  I am a family farmer. In my neck of the woods, farmers usually don't \nsit around and talk about economic policy and Wall Street financial \ninstitutions.\n  But I do guarantee you that where I come from, everybody talks about \ncommon sense and why so much common sense seemed to be missing when \nAmerica's financial industry almost collapsed a year ago.\n  Everyone in my State felt the impact of what happened when Lehman \nBrothers caved in, when Fannie and Freddie hit a dead end, when AIG \nwent belly up, and when we saw daily headlines about bank mergers and \nbailouts.\n  We all paid a price because of a few greedy actors on Wall Street and \nno refs on the playing field. That price was $700 billion of taxpayer \nmoney. I opposed that bailout because it rewarded the wrong people, and \nI was concerned about its ability to create a single job for our small \nbusinesses or help one family farmer. I think it was a bad deal for \nMain Street.\n  Last year, I asked Treasury Secretary Paulson--a former chairman of \nGoldman Sachs--about why this happened. His answer: ``I don't know.''\n  Where I come from, answers such as that aren't good enough, and terms \nsuch as ``too big to fail'' don't make any sense at all. It is time to \nmake some changes.\n  After what we have been through over the past year, it is clear we \nneed to reform the rules that keep America's financial industry on our \nside.\n  How? Well, it is going to take a lot of hard work, honesty, and \ncommon sense.\n  We have already started. I have teamed up with some of my friends in \nthe Senate, from both parties, to cosponsor the TARP Transparency Act. \nOur bill will better track the money being used to get the financial \nindustry back on its feet because it is taxpayer money and because \ntaxpayers deserve no less.\n  Over the course of the past year, the Senate Banking Committee has \nheld countless hearings on regulatory modernization. The administration \nhas put forth a good-faith effort in working with Congress in the \nmassive legislative overhaul. Government has worked with the financial \nindustry and consumers to outline the goals of sweeping new financial \nregulatory reform.\n  I don't believe comprehensive financial reform will guarantee we are \nsafe from financial crises, but, if done right, it can provide folks \nwith adequate protection, it can bring confidence back into the \nmarketplace, and it can minimize the risk of a financial meltdown \nsimilar to the one we barely weathered last fall.\n  Unfortunately, there are those who don't believe comprehensive reform \nshould be on the front burner. They are now lobbying to protect their \nown self-interests, their own profits, and the status quo over consumer \nprotection.\n  That is why we need to use this 1-year anniversary as a reminder to \nact now to protect consumers and investors, to close the loopholes in \nour regulatory framework, and to ensure that no company is too big to \nfail.\n  We must regulate derivatives; supervise financial companies that have \nbeen outside the scope of regulation, thereby creating a level playing \nfield; ensure that there is strong supervision of all financial firms--\nnot just depository institutions; build on the bipartisan success of \nthe credit card legislation and pass mortgage reform to protect \nconsumers; combine the numerous banking regulators into a more simple, \nstreamlined, commonsense structure that is capable of supervising 21st \ncentury financial institutions; create an entity that will protect \ntaxpayers from future financial corporate failures and minimize the \nneed for further government action; increase capital standards to \nprohibit institutions from growing too big to fail; and we must ensure \nthat those companies selling mortgages and securities keep some skin in \nthe game by holding onto a portion of the underlying asset to keep them \nhonest.\n  As we move forward with regulatory reform, I will be working hard to \neliminate any unintended consequences, specifically as it relates to \ncommunity banks and credit unions.\n  In Montana, when we talk about the banking industry, we are talking \nabout community banks and credit unions. They are the good actors. They \ndon't live on the edge. They didn't get into the Wall Street \nshenanigans that caused this mess.\n\n[[Page S9528]]\n\n  Montana's community banks and credit unions serve their towns and \ncommunities reliably and safely. We are fortunate in Montana to not \nhave had a bank fail in over 10 years. We also have one of the lowest \nrates of mortgage defaults and foreclosures in the Nation. We have had \nvery few problems as it applies to predatory subprime loans.\n  The community banks and credit unions are not the problem. I wish to \nmake sure we do not place excessive fees or regulatory burdens on these \nsmall but very important institutions, such as the community banks.\n  Over the course of the coming weeks and months, I plan to work with \nSenator Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and all my \ncolleagues toward commonsense reform that will increase supervision and \ntransparency of the financial markets, that will bring back investor \nconfidence, and that will protect consumers and safeguard us from \nanother situation where the greed of Wall Street penalizes hard-working \nfamilies.\n  Earlier this week, the President spoke on Wall Street. He said:\n\n       We are beginning to return to normalcy.\n\n  But he warned that:\n\n       Normalcy cannot lead to complacency.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. That is what we in Montana call common sense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask that the time during the quorum call be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak today on President \nObama's nominee for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals--a court one \nstep below the U.S. Supreme Court--Judge Gerard Lynch.\n  I have carefully reviewed Judge Lynch's background and his rulings as \na district court judge. He is a Columbia law graduate and a former \nFederal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. For the most \npart, he has been a very good district judge. He is exceedingly capable \nand a man of high integrity.\n  After reviewing his record and responses to questions from the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I decided to support his nomination. I do so \nbecause I believe he will adhere to his judicial oath which requires \njudges to administer justice without respect to persons, to do equal \nright to the poor and the rich, and to faithfully and impartially \ndischarge and perform their duties under the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States and not above it.\n  In responses to my questions, Judge Lynch affirmed that circuit \ncourts have no greater freedom than district courts to decide law \noutside the bounds of precedent, but they must apply the law and the \nprecedent to which they are bound.\n  Judge Lynch also stated that a judge is to ``apply the law \nimpartially'' and ``should not identify with either side'' in a case.\n  Even though I will support Judge Lynch and admire him and enjoyed \nmeeting with him, I want to share some concerns about his rulings and \nsome statements he has made over the years that I think are matters \nthat ought not go unremarked before his confirmation.\n  The role of a judge is to follow the law regardless of personal \npolitics, feelings, preferences, or ideology. I think, for the most \npart, he has done that in his cases.\n  One case that is troubling, however, is U.S. v. Pabon-Cruz in which \nJudge Lynch attempted to get around the jury process and the sentencing \nprocess because he believed a mandatory minimum sentence required by \nCongress of 10 years for a conviction of receiving and distributing \nchild pornography was unduly harsh.\n  He announced that he would tell the jury about the penalties in the \ncase, which is not appropriate. In its order prohibiting Judge Lynch \nfrom informing the jury about what the punishment would be in the case, \nthe Second Circuit, on which he now seeks to sit, expressly stated that \nJudge Lynch's ``proposed jury instruction regarding the penalties the \ndefendant faces if convicted is a clear abuse of discretion in light of \nbinding authority.''\n  Judge Lynch disagreed with the Second Circuit's decision, calling it \na ``mistaken conclusion.'' Judge Lynch clearly believed he had the \nright to ignore precedent and established law and inform the jury about \nthe penalties that were applicable upon their verdict of guilty so that \nthe jurors, in effect, would have an opportunity to ignore the law and \nchoose not to apply it because he did not think the penalty was fair, \napparently.\n  I am disappointed by the fact that Judge Lynch appears to believe \nthis sentence was inappropriate, but more importantly, that he should \nhave been allowed to invite jury nullification, which is, in effect, to \nsay to a jury: You don't find the defendant guilty if you think the \npunishment is inappropriate.\n  In response to one of my written questions, Judge Lynch said that \nwhile he accepts the ruling of the Second Circuit, he continues to \nbelieve his instincts were correct. He stated:\n\n       The rationale for this decision--\n\n  Of the Second Circuit which reversed him--\n\n       which I fully accept, in light of the ruling of the Second \n     Circuit, was erroneous--was that unlike most cases in which \n     the jury fully understands the seriousness of the crime \n     charged, in that case the jury may have misperceived the \n     relative seriousness of the two overlapping charges in the \n     case.\n\n  Judge Lynch's actions in that case are especially disconcerting when \nconsidered in light of his written remarks criticizing the textualist \napproach to constitutional interpretation.\n  In a 2001 speech on the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v. New \nJersey, Judge Lynch stated:\n\n       I would like to welcome--\n\n  Talking here about Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas--\n\n     also to a more realistic, more flexible, and in the end more \n     honest way of protecting the constitutional values they \n     share.\n\n  Judge Lynch, in effect, endorsed this flexible judicial philosophy \nand advocated it previously.\n  Concern over his statements in previous years contributed to my vote \nagainst his nomination to the U.S. District Court on that occasion.\n  In a 1997 law review article entitled ``In Memoriam: William J. \nBrennan, Jr., American''--that is, of course, Justice William Brennan \nfor whom he formerly clerked--Judge Lynch admonished the successors of \nJustice Brennan that they must also engage in constitutional \ninterpretation ``in light of their own wisdom and experience and in \nlight of the conditions of American society today.''\n  In that same article, Judge Lynch stated he personally believed it \nwas a ``simple necessity'' that the Constitution ``be given meaning for \nthe present.'' Judge Lynch's praise for Brennan's ``present-day \nmeaning'' approach included the opinion that Justice Brennan's ``long \nand untiring labor to articulate the principles found in the \nConstitution in the way he believed made most sense today seems far \nmore honest and honorable than the pretense that the meaning of those \nprinciples can be found in eighteenth- or nineteenth-century \ndictionaries.''\n\n  So I have a problem with that speech from 1997 and that strong \nstatement of adherence to the doctrine that Justice Brennan was the \nforemost advocate of a living constitution and that words don't have \nfixed meanings; that you can make them say what you want them to say to \naffect the result you think is appropriate today.\n  The Constitution is a contract with the American people. We have \nevery right to amend it through the amendatory process, but judges \ndon't have a right to amend it based on what they perceive it to mean. \nBased on what? What information have they received that makes them \nthink they have a better idea of what the Constitution ought to mean \nthan how it has been interpreted for 200 years?\n  This is a serious matter because judges are unelected. They have a \nlifetime appointment, and we give them that because we want unbiased, \nobjective analyses. But it doesn't mean they are empowered to update \nthe Constitution to make it say what they would like it to say today. \nThey are not empowered to do that. In fact, it erodes democracy when \nthey do that because the elective branches, those of us in\n\n[[Page S9529]]\n\nthis Senate, are accountable. Judges aren't accountable.\n  Another of Judge Lynch's cases that bears mention is United States v. \nReyes. In that case, a police officer asked a defendant drug dealer, \nwho had not yet been read his Miranda rights, whether he had anything \non him that could hurt the officer or his field team. Even though the \ndefendant had not been frisked, Judge Lynch concluded the defendant was \nthe subject of a custodial interrogation under Miranda, and that before \nthe police officer could ask whether he had anything to endanger the \nofficers, he had to warn him of his Miranda rights. As a result, Judge \nLynch excluded from the record statements that the defendant made at \nthat time which implicated him in the crime.\n  The Second Circuit--the circuit which he will now serve on--reversed \nJudge Lynch, holding that the public safety exception was in fact \napplicable and that the cases Judge Lynch had relied upon in his ruling \nwere distinguishable. The court noted that drug dealers often have \nhypodermic needles or razor blades on their person that could pose a \ndanger to police officers. Additionally, the defendant was not \nhandcuffed at the time of the arrest and could have reached for a \nconcealed weapon. The Second Circuit also noted that the questions \nasked by the officer were ``sufficiently limited in scope and were not \nposed to elicit incriminating evidence,'' and the police ``cannot be \nfaulted for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions.''\n  Judge Lynch has also advocated that Miranda warnings be administered \nfor searches, which has never been the case. In a symposium commentary, \nJudge Lynch proposed a Miranda-type rule for searches that would \ninvalidate consents to search unless the party whose consent is sought \nis first advised that he or she has the constitutional right to refuse \nsuch consent.\n  Well, Miranda was never required by the Constitution. It was a \nprophylactic protective rule the Court conjured up. Somehow the system \nhas survived it, but it has done some damage in terms of not getting \nthe kind of admissions and confessions you might otherwise get. That is \njust a fact. At any rate, to expand that now to searches, which has \nnever been done, I think is an unhealthy approach.\n  You might say: Well, theoretically, if you are going to do these \nMiranda interviews you could do it on searches. But I would just note \nthat Miranda itself is a protective rule, not a mandated constitutional \nrule.\n  I mentioned the foregoing issues because they are of great concern to \nme. It appears, notwithstanding, in the vast majority of his cases, \nJudge Lynch has been a very careful judge who has followed the law. He \nhas stated that he understands that circuit judges are ``bound by \nSupreme Court and prior circuit precedent, and their job is to apply, \nfairly and accurately, the holdings and reasoning of such precedent.''\n  Given his commitment to do that, I will vote for him, and I hope he \nwill continue his excellent service on the bench, but that he will \ninterpret the law as written and will refrain from imposing personal \nviews in his decisions.\n  It is unfortunate, and I am concerned also, that the President, in \nhis nominations, is moving a number of people for the Federal bench \nthat are clearly activists. Many of them don't have the length of time \non the bench that Judge Lynch does, or his skills as a judge, frankly, \nand it is causing us some concern, and we will have some real debate \nabout it.\n  The nomination of Judge David Hamilton for the Seventh Circuit Court \nof Appeals raises that issue and concern with me. The White House has \nsaid it intended to send a message with his appointment, and I would \nsay that it did. Judge Hamilton's appointment is significant. Instead \nof embracing the constitutional standard of jurisprudence, Judge \nHamilton has embraced President Obama's empathy standard. Indeed, he \nsaid as much in his answers to questions for the record following his \nconfirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n  He rejects the idea that the role of a judge is akin to that of an \numpire who calls balls and strikes in a neutral manner. Rather, he \nbelieves a judge will ``reach different decisions from time to time . . \n. taking into account what has happened and its effect on both parties, \nwhat are the practical consequences.''\n  Judge Hamilton also appears to have embraced the idea of a living \nconstitution. The last time I was at the Archives Building, I saw a \nparchment from 1789--not breathing. It is a document. It is a contract. \nIt guarantees certain rights to every American, and judges aren't \nempowered to rewrite it, to make it say what they think it ought to say \ntoday.\n  In a speech in 2003, Judge Hamilton indicated a judge's role included \nwriting footnotes to the Constitution. When Senator Hatch questioned \nhim about these comments in a follow-up question, he retreated \nsomewhat, but then gave a disturbing answer to the next question about \njudges amending the Constitution or creating new rights through case \nlaw and court decisions. This judicial philosophy has clearly impacted \nJudge Hamilton's rulings during his time as a district court judge. He \nhas issued a number of controversial rulings and has been reversed in \nsome noteworthy cases.\n  For example, he ruled against allowing a public, sectarian prayer in \nthe Indiana State Legislature and was reversed by the Seventh Circuit.\n  He ruled against allowing religious displays in public buildings and \nwas unanimously reversed by a panel of the Seventh Circuit.\n  He blocked the enforcement of a reasonable informed consent law \ndealing with abortion matters for 7 years. He continued to block \nenforcement of that law and was eventually firmly and forcefully \noverruled by the Seventh Circuit for being in violation of the law.\n  Judges, the State, and other people spent all kinds of money, and \nattorney generals of the State spent money and time and effort to \nlitigate these matters, and finally winning, but, in effect, the people \nof the State, for 7 years, were unable to enforce a constitutional \nstatute their duly elected representatives had passed.\n  That is the power of an unelected Federal judge sometimes, and we \nneed to be sure judges who go on the bench understand they are not \nallowed to do that. They are supposed to be a neutral umpire. If the \ncase law and the Constitution say this is a good statute, they need to \naffirm it whether they like it or not, whether they would have voted \ndifferently or not. If he wants to be in the legislature and vote on \nthe statutes, let him seek that office.\n  A Federal judge must be able to dispense rulings in a neutral fashion \nso the emblem that hangs over the Supreme Court, which has been \nembraced by the American people--equal justice under law--can be \ncarried out in every aspect of a legal proceeding. A judge must put \naside political views which may be appropriate as a legislator, \nexecutive, or an advocate, and interpret the law as it is written. He \nmust keep his oath to uphold the Constitution first and foremost.\n  As I have said before, the Constitution is a contract between the \nAmerican people, especially in a government of limited powers that is \nestablished by the people. It is a judge's duty to abide by the \nConstitution and protect and defend it and all the laws duly passed by \nCongress that are consistent with that Constitution. We have preserved \nour Nation well by insisting that our judiciary remain faithful to the \nplain and simple words of the Constitution and the statutes involved.\n  So, Mr. President, I am impressed with the skill, the legal ability \nof Judge Lynch, whose nomination is before us today. I have reviewed \nhis record carefully. I have listened to his answers. I have seen some \nof his speeches. In a few cases, they cause me concern. But I think \ngiving deference--and appropriate deference--to the President's \nnomination, he should be confirmed. I will ask my colleagues to support \nthe confirmation.\n  But I want to say that all of us in this body, as well as judges, \nhave a duty to preserve and defend our Constitution. You can erode the \nConstitution in a number of ways, and one way it can be changed and \naltered impermissibly is when judges redefine the meaning of words. So \nwhen a judge says we shouldn't resort to 18th century dictionaries, \nthat makes me nervous. What does that mean? You just give a new \ndefinition to the word, the one that people ratified--the amendment \nthey passed and ratified, which\n\n[[Page S9530]]\n\nhad a certain meaning and was understood to have that meaning? Now that \nyou are on the bench, and you think it shouldn't be enforced that way, \nand you would like to see a different result, you just sort of amend it \nor write a footnote to it? I don't think that is good judicial policy, \nand I feel an obligation--I think a number of us in this Senate do--to \nconfirm good judges--men and women of character and ability and \nfaithfulness to our laws and Constitution--but also raise the concerns \nthat we have and to use every bit of our ability and strength to oppose \nnominees who won't be faithful to those high ideals that have made us a \nnation of laws and made us prosperous and free.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Transportation Appropriations\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I wish to speak to an amendment of mine \nthat is to be on the floor on the transportation bill in a few minutes. \nIt is an amendment that would cut funding to a particular airport in \nPennsylvania. I wish to discuss why we are targeting this particular \ncut.\n  As all of us know, all over America for the last several months, \nmillions of Americans have come out to TEA parties and townhalls, \nexpressing concern and even anger over the level of spending and \nborrowing and debt we are incurring here in Congress; the concern about \nall the new taxes we are talking about; the takeover of everything from \nGeneral Motors to insurance companies. People are concerned, I think \nfor a lot of good reasons.\n  The question is now, particularly after the hundreds of thousands of \npeople gathered in front of the Capitol last Saturday from all over the \ncountry, expressing many of those same concerns: Is anybody listening? \nIs anyone here listening?\n  It reminds me of a couple of weeks ago when my 2\\1/2\\-year-old \ngrandson was spending the night with my wife and me. He was sleeping in \nanother room, and we have these intercoms that everyone knows about. He \nknows about the intercom and how it works, so when he got up in the \nmorning, as usual about 6:30 or something, he said: I am up. Is anybody \nhome?\n  He kept saying: Is anybody home? Is anybody home? I knew he was going \nto keep saying it until I got up and went in and got him up.\n  I think that is the question Americans are asking us here in \nCongress: Is anybody home? A lot of people last weekend, when I was \nhere, said: Keep speaking for us. Someone has to speak for us. These \nwere not mobsters, they were not the right wing. They were Americans, \nmoms and dads with kids in strollers, grandpas and grandmas, here from \nall over the country, of all political parties, who know enough to say \nwe cannot keep spending and borrowing, and the more we spend, the more \nwaste and fraud there is.\n  All of us here seem to agree, especially at campaign time: Oh, we \nneed to cut out the waste and fraud. But no matter what we bring up to \ncut, even if we pick the most egregious waste the Government \nAccountability Office comes up with every year and says these are the \nmost wasteful and inefficient programs, we can put them on the floor of \nthe Senate for a vote and we cannot cut them.\n  Where do we begin, when all we seem to do, week after week, month \nafter month, year after year, when all of us come in from all around \nthe country and for every problem we see we have a new government \nprogram or an earmark or something that is supposed to fix it? \nEverything adds to the deficit. We never make those tough decisions \nabout cutting anything.\n  My amendment actually cuts something. It was not my invention. I have \nlearned about it over countless television documentaries on the \nCongressman John Murtha Airport in Johnstown, PA. It is a small airport \nthat over the last 20 years has received $200 million in taxpayer \nfunds. This is an airport that only has 3 flights a day, an average of \na total of 20 passengers a day. All of those three flights come to \nWashington and they are always mostly empty. The people who buy the \ntickets spend about the same amount per ticket as the taxpayers' \nsubsidy for those tickets.\n  Earlier in the year, after we passed the stimulus package, another \n$800,000 went to this airport to pave the alternate runway that is \nseldom used. After I brought up this amendment to discontinue funding--\nand I want to make this clear; this is on this bill, the transportation \nbill, and it only discontinues funding for 1 year. It is not permanent. \nIt does not discontinue any funding related to defense or the military, \nso the National Guard and others continue to use it. The Defense \nDepartment can spend whatever they want on this airport. It is just \nthat the Department of Transportation cannot spend any more money to \nsubsidize air traffic from this airport.\n  It also does nothing to cut any safety funds for air traffic control. \nIt is a couple of paragraphs that say enough is enough, this airport \nhas received an inordinate amount of money. It has equipment it doesn't \neven use, millions for radar equipment that is not even staffed. Again, \n3 flights a day, only to Washington, DC, with less than an average of \n20 passengers a day. Most of the time there are more airport security \npeople in this airport than there are passengers.\n  This is not some partisan attack. In fact, if you will remember, the \nbridge to nowhere, which was a Republican project, was exposed by \nRepublicans. It helped America see an example of waste and abuse. That \nis what this amendment is about. It is not an attack on any party or \nany State, it is just an example that has been brought to light by \ncountless media sources all over the country of us wasting money--not \njust one time but year after year.\n  If my amendment is not agreed to, another $1.5 million of subsidies \nwill go to this one airport because their Congressman likes to fly back \nand forth from a local airport. Many Americans have to drive an hour or \ntwo to get to an airport. Folks in Johnstown could drive an hour to \nPittsburgh Airport if the tickets were too expensive from Johnstown. \nThis is not a particular attack on a Congressman or a State or \ncommunity. It is a beginning. It is a demonstration that here in the \nSenate we get the message. We are listening. We are actually home and \nwe are going to speak for those millions of Americans who say enough is \nenough, we cannot keep spending and borrowing and creating debt.\n  For every dollar we spend here, about half of it now is borrowed. We \nare actually on our knees begging countries such as China to loan us \nsome money so we can pay some of the debt that is coming due. Yet we \nkeep creating cash for clunkers and ``Fannie Travel,'' which is a \ntravel promotion agency we created a couple of weeks ago. Now we are \npassing a spending bill that is about 23 percent over what it was last \nyear. At a time with down economics, Americans out of jobs, we are \nincreasing spending that much.\n  With this amendment we are saying we can make a tough decision. We \ncan begin the process of starting to cut waste and fraud. But the \nreason so many people are going to vote against this amendment is there \nis a code here: I will support your spending for your State if you will \nsupport mine. I will not mess with the spending in your State if you \nwon't mess with mine. We have been doing it for years, so we have been \nadding earmarks and projects in all of our States, supporting each \nother, and the budget and the spending get bigger and bigger and no one \nhas the courage to say no, we have to stop.\n  A few of us did on the bridge to nowhere. Thanks to millions of \nAmericans saying you are right, we were able to stop that one project. \nBut we are still spending like there is no tomorrow.\n  I am asking my colleagues to agree we can cut one thing, one thing \nthat is obviously wasteful and unfair. It is not fair to ask taxpayers \nall over the country to subsidize half of every ticket that is bought \nin a little airport in Johnstown, PA. They are not helping all the \nother Americans around the country or all the other small airports. \nCertainly small general aviation airports have gotten Federal funds but \nnothing to this degree.\n\n[[Page S9531]]\n\n  We are not interfering with the general aviation function of this \nairport at all or any military use. We are just going to stop for 1 \nyear subsidizing the tickets and hopefully helping America to focus on \npart of our problem here.\n  Part of correcting a problem is admitting you have one. I don't think \nwe have done it yet in this Senate. My hope is on this vote a majority \nof the Senators will step up and say we do have a problem and this is \none amendment where we can show we are beginning to turn it around. I \nencourage all my colleagues to vote for this amendment to cut funding \nfor 1 year, at least cut these subsidies and at least demonstrate to \nAmerica that somebody is home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, in a few short minutes we are going to \nbe going to a series of votes, including a number of them on the \ntransportation and housing bill that has been before the Senate for a \nweek now. I want to take a few minutes to remind all of our colleagues \nabout the importance of this bill that we will be passing here shortly \nthis afternoon. This is a bill that has broad bipartisan support \nbecause it addresses some very real housing and transportation needs of \nfamilies in every region of this country. We worked very hard with our \ncolleague, Senator Bond, my ranking member, who has been amazingly \ngreat to work with this week. We faced some real challenges with our \nbill this year but together we made some important infrastructure \nimprovements, including providing over $75 billion for the Department \nof Transportation to support continued investment in our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  It includes $11 billion for public transit and $1.2 billion to invest \nin inner-city and high-speed rail.\n  This bill also supports the FAA's efforts to develop its next-\ngeneration air transportation system to support projected growth in air \ntravel in coming years. It also invests $3.5 billion for capital \nimprovement at airports across the country.\n  The bill provides nearly $46 billion for the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, including $100 million for HUD's housing \ncounseling program that will help families who are facing foreclosure \ntoday to stay in their homes. The bill also provides more than $18 \nbillion for tenant-based rental or section 8, including an increase of \nover $1 billion for the renewal of section 8 vouchers.\n  It also provides increased funding for the operation of public \nhousing for a total level of $4.75 billion, to make sure our Nation's \nlow-income families, which are also, as we all know, among the hardest \nhit in these tough economic times, continue to have access to safe, \naffordable housing.\n  The bill includes $75 million for a very important program I worked \non with Senator Bond, the joint HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing \nProgram. This is extremely important to our Nation's veterans. It will \nprovide an additional 10,000 homeless veterans and their families with \nhousing and supportive services.\n  The bill also addresses the needs of some of our most vulnerable \ncitizens, by providing increased funding to support affordable housing \nfor the elderly, disabled, those suffering from AIDS, and the Nation's \nhomeless.\n  Finally, the bill provides almost $4 billion for the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program to support investments in public \ninfrastructure, housing rehabilitation, and public service, assistance \nthat is critical to our States and our local governments right now.\n  In summary, this bill provides assistance to those who need it most, \nand it directs resources in a responsible and fiscally prudent way. It \nwill help our commuters, it will help owners, it will help the most \nvulnerable, and it will help our economy.\n  I hope all Senators will support the bill when we move to the final \nvote here shortly this afternoon, after we consider several amendments. \nBefore I close, I do wish to take, again, a moment to thank my partner \nand friend, Senator Bond, whom it has been a pleasure to work with \nthroughout this process, as he and I go to conference now to work hard \nto make sure we find the differences and fix the differences between us \nand the House so we can get this bill to the President.\n  I most importantly wish to thank all our staff, from the floor staff \nwho have been so generous with their time and help as we have worked \nthrough this, to all the staff who worked on the transportation and \nhousing subcommittee, including John Kamarck, Ellen Beares, Joanne \nWaszczak, Travis Lumpkin, Grant Lahmann, Michael Bain, Dedra Goodman, \nand Alex Keenan, our new staff director on transportation who has done \nan excellent job, and especially Matt McCardle and Mike Spahn for all \ntheir efforts during floor consideration.\n  I am pleased we were able to consider and debate so many amendments \nand have produced a strong bill. But I would be remiss if I did not \nsingle out and thank two members of our staff, Meaghan McCarthy and \nRachel Milberg, for all the outstanding efforts they made over the past \nseveral months under very trying circumstances late at night working so \ndiligently.\n  I wish to especially thank them for all the work they have done to \nassemble this bill and write the report. I know it was a daunting \nchallenge. I am so grateful to them for all the extra effort they have \nhad to go through under some very trying circumstances. They have done \nan excellent job. They are a delight to work with.\n  With that, I see that my ranking member is on the floor. I wish to, \nagain, thank him for being a great partner and for all his help and \nsupport to get this bill to the floor today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, the real kudos and plaudits go to my \ncolleague, the chair, Senator Murray, for having worked this through.\n  It is also a very interesting and challenging measure. But this year, \nwe have advanced a bill, we have had lots of amendments, we have \nadopted some on strong bipartisan votes. I think this is a great \ntribute to the way she has worked with us closely on the committee and \nwith the cooperation of all parties on the floor.\n  This is a bill in which many people have good ideas, and, as I said, \nwe voted on and took a few of them. But I join Senator Murray in \nthanking her staff: Alex Keenan, Meaghan McCarthy, Rachel Milberg, \nJoanne Waszczak and Travis Lumpkin for their work. They have worked \nvery closely with us.\n  Thanks for the hard work on my side to Ellen Beares and Jon Kamarck. \nThe staff contributed. And also the work of the newest member of our \nteam who came in at a time when we were badly understaffed, Dedra \nGoodman. But a very special thanks to Matt McCardle for his leadership \nand masterful management on the floor.\n  This was due to a lot of unforeseen circumstances. There were lots of \ntimes when he had to carry the load, and he also did it with good \nhumor. When I was frazzled and confused about where things may be \ngoing, Matt had it under control, and he did a truly outstanding job.\n  Again, I thank our colleagues for allowing us to proceed with this \nbill. We did not plan on being here this the eighth day, having started \nlast Thursday. But we are very optimistic that this bill can emerge \nfrom conference as a freestanding bill and be adopted by this body. I \ndo not want to see this wind up in an ``ominous'' appropriations bill \nthat does not reflect the hard work that went into it. When our work \ngoes into what they call an omnibus, what I call an ``ominous,'' \nappropriations bill, strange things happen to it. We hope we can work \nthis bill and keep it together as crafted. It is a critical piece of \nlegislation.\n  It has vitally important safety needs for transportation, \nparticularly in aviation. It continues, although not as robustly as I \nwould like, the development of more transportation infrastructure. \nThere are badly needed elements in the housing part of the bill. We \nhave to continue housing for those people who have assisted housing, \npublic housing authorities, particularly in this economic downturn, \nwhen so many\n\n[[Page S9532]]\n\npeople are feeling the pinch, special needs from the disabled, the \nelderly, to veterans, who have particularly been well served by the \nveterans assisted in supportive housing that we have provided.\n  But also, as I have warned many times before, the FHA program is a \nhigh-risk program that could subject us to billions of dollars being \nthrown on the taxpayers' credit card. And this bill provides resources \nfor HUD to get up the IT systems it needs, to get the people in place. \nIt provides for more oversight. It provides increases for the inspector \ngeneral to doublecheck to make sure the predatory lending which \ninflicted the entire economy does not transport itself into FHA-\nsupported housing.\n  So we do have some more amendments. And we look forward to working on \nthose this afternoon. We thank all our colleagues for letting us come \nthis far. We hope to get it passed and get these badly needed \nappropriations enacted into law.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2403, as Modified\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the McCain amendment No. 2403 be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As in legislative session, without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2403) as modified is as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2403, as modified\n\n       On page 318, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 2___.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used to carry out the Brownfields Economic Development \n     Initiative program (including with respect to any individual \n     property described on page 138, 139, or 141 of Senate Report \n     No. 111-69) administered by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes evenly divided for a vote with respect to the Landrieu \namendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is my understanding that this \namendment is accepted on both sides. I urge a voice vote.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, nobody has advised us of objections on our \nside.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I support the Landrieu amendment.\n  The year 2008 witnessed numerous devastating disasters: severe \nwildfires in California, floods in the Midwest, and the one-two punch \nof Hurricanes Gustav and Ike along the Gulf Coast.\n  Congress responded last fall by passing a natural disaster \nsupplemental, which in addition to providing necessary FEMA and SBA \nfunding, provided $6.5 billion in community development block grants to \nsupport recovery.\n  Unfortunately, the language included a restriction that has impaired \nthese impacted communities' ability to rebuild.\n  This amendment removes that restriction, providing flexibility for \nthese funds to be used to their greatest impact in the community, \nhelping these communities get back on their feet as quickly as \npossible.\n  Without this amendment, many communities will be unable to balance \ntheir budget priorities, jeopardizing critical projects in the recovery \nprocess, or worse yet, leading to the abandonment of projects \naltogether.\n  Communities across this Nation have been greatly impacted by natural \ndisasters over the past several years, including the State of Texas. \nTax bases have been decimated and many communities are still struggling \nto recover. These devastated communities want to be able to stand on \ntheir own; however, they don't currently have the resources to do so. \nBy providing maximum flexibility of vital Federal funds, as we have for \nprevious disasters, we remove one more barrier from their way on the \nroad to recovery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2365) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay \non the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2359\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 2359, \nthe Vitter amendment.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. It simply says that no public housing assistance will \nbe granted to anyone who is convicted of a crime involving drug \ntrafficking, not simple possession but distribution, et cetera, or \nbeing a member of a violent gang. These are serious adult offenders. I \ndon't believe we should use taxpayer funds with housing assistance, \nparticularly in public housing projects, in that manner. It \nspecifically focuses on New Orleans, LA, only New Orleans, where we are \npouring massive amounts of Federal dollars to rebuild public housing \nprojects in a fundamentally different, better way after Katrina, \nridding those projects of the crime problem which had previously been \nembedded there. It is very important in terms of that recovery.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise in opposition to amendment No. \n2359. Our colleague Senator Landrieu spoke at length last night about \nthe reasons she opposes this amendment, which is targeted to her city \nof New Orleans.\n  I am here as the chairman of the Banking Committee, to share with you \nsome of the reasons I believe this legislation could have benefitted \nfrom a more thorough vetting through the authorizing process.\n  While superficially an attractive effort to be tough on crime, the \nproposed amendment is likely to have serious unintended consequences \nwhile providing no apparent increase in public safety. The proposed \namendment is overly broad, burdensome, and would present great \ndifficulties for Federal, State, and local administrators to actually \nimplement.\n  Representatives of public housing agencies have raised concerns about \nimplementing this legislation. Advocates for low income families oppose \nthis amendment.\n  Needless to say, we want to ensure the security of families receiving \nhousing assistance. That is why current law already provides tools for \ndenying or terminating assistance for drug-related and violent crimes \nand activities in public housing and section 8 assistance, which \nappears to be the amendment's objective.\n  I have other concerns about things that may or may not have been the \nobjective of the amendment.\n  This provision only applies in New Orleans, raising questions about \nequal protection and the unfortunate possibility of federal law that \nchanges from city to city.\n  It is a vast expansion of current Federal law. While Senator Vitter \ndescribes the amendment as applying to\n\n[[Page S9533]]\n\nrebuilt public housing, it is actually very broad. The bill extends far \nbeyond public and assisted housing into all forms of federal housing \nassistance, including homeless assistance, loans, loan guarantees, or \nother assistance provided under a HUD housing program.\n  It is administratively burdensome. The legislation would put \nadditional screening burdens on housing providers, banks, nonprofits, \nand others who are not currently required to, nor do they have the \nresources to, conduct criminal background checks. These could include \ncities administering CDBG, a homeless shelter whose clients vary night \nby night, or banks processing FHA loans.\n  It has unintended consequences, and I will provide some examples.\n  It erects barriers to helping the homeless: The language would appear \nto apply to homeless shelters, whose clientele change from night to \nnight. Running checks on clients that may only be there for one day or \nsporadically is nearly impossible, and a waste of scarce resources. Do \nwe really mean to prohibit assistance for these individuals--many of \nwhom are veterans or children--because shelters won't be able to run \nbackground checks?\n  It puts new burdens on banks and homeowners. Every bank originating \nan FHA loan would have to do a criminal background check on the family \nbuying the home, or refinancing a home. Can you imagine the burden that \nwould create for community banks and homebuyers?\n  It puts new burdens on small businesses and State and local \ngovernment CDBG programs. The language could actually require that \nState and local CDBG programs conduct background checks on small \nbusiness owners receiving economic development assistance to ensure \nthat they were not a) offenders and b) not residing in federally-\nsubsidized housing.\n  It provides no room for rehabilitation. The amendment bars someone \nfrom ever getting housing assistance, including FHA loans, if they were \never convicted of selling drugs or were a member of a gang, without \nconsideration of rehabilitation. What if that happened 15 years ago? \nThis amendment would run counter to the goals of the Second Chance Act, \nwhich this body approved under unanimous consent to help ex-offenders \nget the services they need to become productive members of society.\n  In sum, this amendment is superficially attractive. I understand \nthat. But the policy is ill-considered. It will unintentionally hurt \nhomebuyers, veterans, and children without necessarily providing any \nadditional protections. It will create very serious administrative \nburdens for the public and private sector, with no way to pay for those \nburdens. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment--let's approach \nthis issue in a more thoughtful way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this amendment would deny housing \nassistance to any New Orleans household with a member of a criminal \ngang or someone convicted of certain drug offenses. Public housing \nauthorities already have the ability to deny or terminate housing \nassistance to persons who have committed drug-related and violent \ncrimes under current law. This amendment does far more than that. It \nextends to all forms of housing assistance. It is a permanent \nprohibition. If anyone in the family has committed these offenses ever, \nthen that entire household would never be able to receive HUD \nassistance, including homeless assistance or even an FHA loan.\n  I am concerned that this amendment is targeted to one city, New \nOrleans. We should not be targeting one city or dictating housing \npolicy city by city under this bill.\n  Importantly, the underlying bill provides funding to help our \nNation's homeless veterans. Many of those veterans have struggled with \nsubstance abuse. If this amendment passes, those veterans will not be \nallowed to get assistance.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, we are not talking about drug \npossession, we are talking about trafficking. HUD and the housing \nauthority have the ability to negotiate for other family members to \nstay in public housing and not be penalized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2359.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, if I could have the attention of all \nSenators, a number of Senators have come to me and said they want to \nmove quickly through the amendments this afternoon. We can't do it if \nSenators are leaving. I ask all Senators to please stay on the floor as \nwe move through these last amendments.\n  With that, I believe the next amendment is in order.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I urge all Members to return promptly. I \nknow several Members on both sides have other commitments. If we are \ngoing to make those, we need to keep those 10 minute votes to at least \n15 minutes. Thanks.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2410\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is amendment No. 2410 \noffered by Senator DeMint.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  This amendment I hope is a beginning or maybe a turning point for the \nSenate where we identify wasteful spending and begin to make some \nprogress toward cutting those things that we don't have to do here at \nthe Federal level.\n  I heard some comments about the amendment yesterday which I don't \nthink accurately reflect what the bill does. We do nothing to cut any \ndefense spending or defense use of this airport. We do nothing to cut \nany safety aspects such as air traffic control. It is simply for 1 year \nof this appropriations bill which stops the funding for additional \nsubsidies to an airport that has received $200 million over the last 20 \nyears and has as much subsidy per ticket as passengers pay. This has \nbeen the subject of documentaries on many media sources. We need to \nshow America we are listening.\n\n[[Page S9534]]\n\n  Please support this amendment to cut these funds for 1 year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I would urge a no vote on this amendment. \nIt sets the wrong precedent and singles out one airport which happens \nto be in Cambria County, PA.\n  At a time when we are in the middle of a recession and with the \nunemployment rate in this county at 9.5 percent, and we are going to \nsay here in Washington that we are going to vote on something that will \nshut down an airport--it is bad policy. We should allow this decision \nto be made by the Federal authority that should be making the decision, \nwhich is the Federal Aviation Administration. It is the right thing to \ndo to oppose this amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will be in order. Under the \nprevious order, there is 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote in \nrelation to the McCain amendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the amendment prohibits funding for \nbrownfields economic development initiatives. In May--and not for the \nfirst time--the President recommended termination of the brownfields \neconomic development initiatives. You can look it up. Even the \ncommittee this time, in the Record, said:\n\n       The committee does not recommend an appropriation for the \n     brownfields redevelopment program, consistent with the budget \n     request.\n\n  On pages 138 and 139, there is $1.3 million for brownfields \nredevelopment in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. So now we are not \nonly going against the President's recommendations, we are going to go \nagainst the bill itself and give another $1.3 million in pork. All I \nsay is you cannot make it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, on behalf of myself and Senator Lieberman, \nthere is no debate about whether the brownfields redevelopment program \nought not to exist. It is duplicative and cut out. This is under the \neconomic development initiative program, which supports a wide range of \nprograms to encourage economic redevelopment, including polluted, \ncontaminated, blighted properties. In Waterbury, CT, home of the brass \ncapital of our country, dating back to the early 19th century, most of \nthe business was military related during the Civil War. There were no \npollution requirements back then.\n  Today those properties are virtually worthless because of the \ncontamination. This is a city with a 13-percent unemployment rate. It \nis a hard-working blue-collar town where people put in hard labor every \nday. This is a chance for that community to get back on its feet. That \nis why it is under the economic development program.\n  I urge my colleagues to be supportive of a hard-working community so \nwe can let them get back on their feet. We urge defeat of the \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we can save $11 billion without cutting a \ndime from this appropriations bill. It turns out there is duplication \nbetween spending in the stimulus bill that already passed and this \nbill.\n  What we do is simply send the bill back to committee to report back \nforthwith, to rescind the money in the stimulus bill that duplicates \nthe Transportation and HUD financing in this bill, except for any funds \nthat have already been obligated, which, obviously, we would go ahead \nand spend, and, secondly, any money relating to highway construction. \nThat would be totally protected. Beyond that, any duplication in the \nstimulus bill would be rescinded.\n  It amounts to about $11 billion. I think that is a great savings we \ncan all\n\n[[Page S9535]]\n\nsupport. As I said, it does not take a dime out of this bill.\n  I ask for my colleagues' support. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the bill in front of us provides \ncritical resources to the Departments of Transportation and Housing and \nUrban Development for investments in transit, rail, airports, and \npublic housing. This is important for investing in jobs in our economy.\n  The funding in this bill has a direct impact on every community \nacross the Nation. We should not delay this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have about 12, 13 seconds. As I said, \nthis motion takes absolutely no money from the appropriations bill \nbefore us. What it would do is identify about $11 billion in duplicate \nfunding in the stimulus bill and rescind that. So you would not be \nvoting to cut a dime out of this bill if you support my motion.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I urge a ``no'' vote, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to join Senator Murray and \nSenator Bond, the respective chairman and ranking member of the \nTransportation, HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, in a colloquy \nconcerning the user fee funded pipeline safety programs overseen by the \nPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am pleased to discuss this issue with my colleagues. \nPipeline safety programs are very important in my State and help ensure \nthat tragic accidents can be prevented. I understand that the pipeline \nsafety programs at PHMSA are funded almost exclusively through user \nfees.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is correct, and in order to better assess the \ncurrent program priorities at PHMSA and to determine how these user \nfees are being allocated across the regulated community, I believe \nPHMSA should provide to the Committees on Appropriations a report that \ndiscloses the percentage of program funds and State grants that are \ndedicated to each of the following sectors: liquid pipelines, natural \ngas transmission pipelines, liquefied natural gas pipelines, and \nnatural gas distribution pipelines.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank Senator Cochran for his comments and agree that \nPHMSA should produce a report as soon as possible on this topic. We \nneed to ensure that pipeline safety programs are adequately funded and \nthat Congress and the regulated industries that support these programs \nunderstand how they are funded.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I agree with my colleagues and would like PHMSA to \nproduce such a report. I thank Senator Cochran for bringing this issue \nto the attention of all Senators.\n\n\n                          FUNDING ALLOCATIONS\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Murray for her \nleadership on this bill and her commitment to funding improvements in \nour Nation's housing and transportation infrastructure. I rise to \nengage the chairman of the subcommittee in a colloquy to clarify the \nState-by-State allocation of Federal-Aid Highway Program funding, which \nis shown in the committee report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be pleased to enter into a colloquy with the \nSenator.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator. As I noted, page 46 of the committee \nreport includes a table that shows the estimated State-by-State \nobligation limitation for Federal-Aid Highway Program funding. This \ninformation was prepared for the Appropriations Committee by the \nFederal Highway Administration based on current law and the funding \nlevel provided in this bill. It is my understanding that this table is \ndesigned to be illustrative rather than determinative of actual funding \nlevels. Could the Senator confirm that this understanding is correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. The table included in the \ncommittee report is illustrative and does not direct the actual \ndistribution of the funds provided under this bill.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator, and I appreciate that clarification. \nAs the Senator knows, I had been concerned because the table indicates \nthat the State of Rhode Island is one of only two States, along with \nMaine, that would lose funding under the increased appropriation \nincluded in this bill.\n  I have consulted with the Federal Highway Administration, which has \nproduced a new estimate based on more accurate assumptions. That table \nhas been shared with the Appropriations Committee staff. Rather than a \ndecline of over $5 million, this estimate shows an increase of nearly \n$6 million for the State of Rhode Island. In addition, no State is \nshown to lose funding in fiscal year 2010.\n  Would the Senator agree that this new table is a more accurate \ndepiction of the distribution federal highway funds?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I agree that the table the Senator refers to reflects \nthe Federal Highway Administration's current estimate of how Federal-\nAid Highway Program funding included in this bill would be distributed \nunder current law.\n  Mr. REED. Again, I thank the chairman for her leadership on this bill \nand for her help in clarifying this matter. For the benefit of all \nsenators, I would ask unanimous consent that the Federal Highway \nAdministration table we have discussed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material

Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Senate amendment to H.R. 3288 and to thank my colleagues on the \nTransportation, Housing & Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee for their fine work in crafting a bill that \nmeets the priorities of the Nation while remaining fiscally \nresponsible.\n  I would particularly like to thank my colleagues for the provision of \n$150 million for capital and preventive maintenance of the Washington \nMetropolitan Transit Authority's Metro System. The Metro system is \nsometimes known as ``America's Subway'' and for good reason. Many \nMetrorail stations were built at the request of the Federal Government \nand nearly half of all stations are located at Federal facilities. \nFederal employees comprise 40 percent of WMATA's peak ridership. WMATA \nalso plays a critical role for ensuring the continuity of Federal \nGovernment operations during an emergency. The Federal Government's \ninterest in Metro is clear.\n  I am sure you all recall the tragic Metrorail accident on June 23 of \nthis year that took the lives of nine individuals. We cannot allow \nanother such tragedy to occur. I appreciate the committee making a \ncommitment to the safety of the 100 million passengers who travel on \nMetro each year.\n  Mass transit is critically important in Maryland as we look for ways \nof reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The committee has funded \ntwo important mass transit projects in Maryland, the purple line in \nsuburban Washington and Baltimore's red line. The purple line is a \nproposed 16-mile light rail or bus rapid transit line extending from \nBethesda in Montgomery County to New Carrollton in Prince George's \nCounty. The Baltimore red line is a proposed 14-mile light rail rapid \ntransit line extending from the Woodlawn area of Baltimore County, MD, \nthrough downtown Baltimore City to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical \nCampus in East Baltimore. Each project will ease traffic congestion, \nreduce carbon emissions, conserve energy, and improve the quality of \nlife for many Marylanders.\n  Maryland has a number of military installations throughout the State. \nConsequently, several communities will be affected by the upcoming \nround of base realignment and closures, BRAC. I would like to thank the \ncommittee for taking this into consideration and providing funding for \nBRAC-related improvements at Andrews Air Force Base in Prince George's \nCounty, near Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, near Aberdeen Proving \nGrounds in Harford County, and in the vicinity of the National Navy \nMedical Center in Montgomery County. Nearly 50,000 new residents will \narrive in Maryland as a result of BRAC. I appreciate the committee's \nhelp to make sure Maryland's transportation infrastructure is well-\nprepared for this population influx.\n  I would also like to thank the committee for funding two important \neconomic development initiative projects in Maryland, the Harriett \nTubman Underground Railroad Park and Visitors Center and the Maryland \nFood Bank.\n  Harriett Tubman was born on Maryland's Eastern Shore. It was from \nthere that she escaped from slavery and went on to become one of the \nleaders of the Underground Railroad. Funding for the Harriett Tubman \nUnderground Railroad Park and Visitors Center will support the \ncontinued design, engineering, and site preparation for the joint \nState-Federal Visitors Center at the State park and envisioned Federal \npark. The project is in rural Dorchester County. Tourism is a growing \npart of the economy and is viewed by the State and county economic \ndevelopment officials as the economic future of the area. The adjacent \nBlackwater\n\n[[Page S9537]]\n\nNational Wildlife Refuge is already a major attraction for eco-\ntourists. This Visitors Center will serve as a focal point of a growing \ntourism economy in the region while also celebrating one of America's \ntrue heroes.\n  The Maryland Food Bank provides food to 900 soup kitchens, food \npantries, shelters, and other community-based organizations across the \nState. These agencies, in turn, feed hundreds of thousands of hungry \nMarylanders each year. Last year, the Maryland Food Bank distributed \n14.3 million pounds of food. The dire state of the economy has placed \nincreased demands on the food bank. Critical infrastructure needs must \nbe met in order to sustain and expand services to meet the growing \nneed. I am grateful that the committee has provided funds through this \nbill to meet those needs. This funding will greatly benefit Maryland's \nhungry families.\n  In closing, again let me say how much I appreciate the work of \nSenator Murray, Senator Bond, and their staffs along with the rest of \nthe subcommittee. They have in crafted a bill that adequately provides \nfor critical transportation infrastructure, addresses housing needs for \nAmerica's most vulnerable populations, and injects economic drivers \ninto underserved communities, all while remaining 2 percent under the \nPresident's requested budget. I find that quite impressive and I \nsupport this bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of \nprovisions I authored in the fiscal year 2010 Transportation-HUD \nappropriations bill that would increase safety, save energy, and \ndecrease emissions by creating a 1-year pilot project to allow trucks \nweighing up to 100,000 pounds to travel on Maine's interstates. This \nprovision also requires an analysis by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation and the State of Maine to study the effects of the \nincrease on safety, road and bridge durability, energy use, and \ncommerce. The U.S. Department of Transportation will report its \nfindings to Congress. This Maine pilot project does not have any impact \non other States' weight laws and regulations.\n  By way of background, let me explain why this pilot project is \nneeded. Under current law, trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are allowed \nto travel on the portion of Interstate 95 designated as the Maine \nTurnpike, which runs from Maine's border with New Hampshire to Augusta, \nour capital city. At Augusta, the turnpike designation ends, but I-95 \nproceeds another 200 miles north to Houlton. At Augusta, however, heavy \ntrucks must exit the modern four-lane, limited-access highway and are \nforced onto smaller, two-lane secondary roads that pass through cities, \ntowns, and villages. The same problem occurs for Maine's other \ninterstates like 295 out of Portland and 395 in the Bangor-Brewer area.\n  Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are already permitted on \ninterstate highways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as \nwell as the Canadian Provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight \nlimit disparity on various segments of Maine's Interstate Highway \nSystem is a significant impediment to commerce, increases wear-and-tear \non our secondary roads, and, most important, puts our people needlessly \nat risk.\n  Diverting trucks onto these secondary roads raises critical safety \nconcerns. In fact, there have been several accidents, some of which \nhave tragically resulted in death, which have occurred after these \nlarge trucks were diverted onto secondary roads and through smaller \ncommunities. For example, in May 2007, a 17-year-old high school \nstudent from Hampden, ME, lost her life when her car was struck by a \nheavy truck on route 9. The truck driver could not see the car turning \nonto that two-lane road as he rounded a corner. Interstate 95 runs less \nthan three-quarters of a mile away, but Federal law prevented the truck \nfrom using that modern, divided highway, a highway that was designed to \nprovide ample views of the road ahead.\n\n  A year earlier, Lena Gray, an 80-year-old resident of Bangor, was \nstruck and killed by a tractor-trailer as she was crossing a downtown \nstreet. Again, that accident would not have occurred had that truck \nbeen allowed to use I-95, which runs directly through Bangor.\n  In June 2004, Wilbur Smiths Associates, a nationally recognized \ntransportation consulting firm, completed a study to examine the impact \na federal weight exemption on non-exempt portions of Maine's Interstate \nHighway System would have on safety, pavement, and bridges. The study \nfound that extending the current truck weight exemption on the Maine \nTurnpike to all interstate highways in Maine would result in a decrease \nof 3.2 fatal crashes per year. The study also found that the fatal \naccident rate on the secondary roads was 10 times higher than on the \nturnpike, and the injury accident rate was seven times higher.\n  While improving safety is the key objective, a uniform truck weight \nlimit of 100,000 pounds on Maine's interstate highways also would \nreduce highway miles, as well as the travel time, necessary to \ntransport freight through Maine, resulting in economic and \nenvironmental benefits. Moreover, Maine's extensive network of local \nroads would be better preserved without the wear and tear of heavy \ntruck traffic.\n  Interstate 95 north of Augusta, ME, where trucks are currently \nlimited at 80,000 pounds, was originally designed and built for \nmilitary freight movements to Loring Air Force Base at weights much \nheavier than 100,000 pounds. Raising the truck weight limit would keep \nheavy trucks on the interstates, which are designed to carry more \nweight than the rural State roads.\n  The argument that 100,000 pound trucks would cause greater road \ndeterioration is misguided. Current Maine law requires that vehicles \ncarrying up to 100,000 pounds on State roads be six-axle combination \nvehicles. Current Federal law requires that vehicles carrying 80,000 \npounds be five-axle. Contrary to erroneous assumptions, six-axle \n100,000 pound vehicles are not longer, wider or taller than the five-\naxle 80,000 pound vehicles. The six-axle 100,000 pound vehicles, \nwhich include an addtional set of brakes, allow for greater weight \ndistribution thereby not increasing road wear and tear. Further, \nstopping distances and safety are in no way diminished, and preliminary \ndata from studies conducted by the Maine State Police support this \nstatement. That is why Maine's Commissioner of Public Safety, the Maine \nState Troopers Association, and the Maine Association of Police all \nsupport this pilot project.\n\n  A higher weight limit in Maine will not only preserve our rapidly \ndeteriorating roads, but will provide economic relief to an already \nstruggling trucking industry. Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are \npermitted on interstate highways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and \nNew York as well as the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. \nMaine truck drivers and the businesses they serve are at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  Last year, I met with Kurt Babineau, a small business owner and \nsecond generation logger and trucker from Maine. Like so many of our \ntruckers, Kurt has been struggling with the increasing costs of running \nhis operation. All of the pulpwood his business produces is transported \nto Verso Paper in Jay, ME, a 165-mile roundtrip. This would be a \nconsiderably shorter trip if his trucks were permitted at 100,000 \npounds to remain on Interstate 95. Instead, his trucks must travel a \nless direct route through cities and towns. Kurt estimated that \npermitting his trucks to travel on all of Interstate 95 would save him \n118 gallons of fuel each week. At last year's diesel cost of \napproximately $4.50 a gallon, and including savings from his drivers \nspending less time on the trip, he could have saved more than $700 a \nweek, and more than $33,000 and 5,600 gallons of fuel annually. These \nsavings would not only be beneficial to Kurt's bottom line, but also to \nhis employees, his customers, and to our nation as we look for ways to \ndecrease the overall fuel consumption.\n  An increase of the Federal truck weight limit in Maine is widely \nsupported by public officials throughout Maine, including the Governor, \nthe Maine Association of Police, and the Maine Department of Public \nSafety, which includes the State Bureau of Highway Safety, the Maine \nState Police, and the Bureau of Emergency Communications. I have \nseveral letters of support from these officials and organizations, \nwhich I will submit for the record with my statement. The Maine\n\n[[Page S9538]]\n\nLegislature also has expressed its support for the change having passed \nresolutions over the past several years calling on Congress to raise \nthe Federal truck weight limit to 100,000 pounds in Maine. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important provision in the Fiscal Year 2010 \nTHUD appropriations bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               State of Maine,\n\n                               Augusta, Maine, September 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye, Chair,\n     Hon. Thad Cochran, Ranking Member,\n     Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patty Murray, Chair,\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond, Ranking Member,\n      Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD and Related Agencies, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Inouye, Cochran, Murray and Bond: As the FY \n     2010 Transportation-HUD Appropriations bill nears debate in \n     the U.S. Senate, I would like to again express my strong and \n     unwavering support for Section 194 of the bill, which would \n     permit the state of Maine to conduct a one-year pilot program \n     to assess the benefits of allowing increased weight limits \n     for heavy vehicles traveling on any part of Maine's \n     Interstate highway system. My support is grounded in my \n     conviction that this pilot will establish that the higher \n     weight limits on Maine's Interstates will improve the safety \n     and efficiency of heavy vehicles operating on Maine Roads.\n       Currently, on Maine's Interstate highway system, higher \n     state truck weight limits may be enforced only on Interstate \n     95 beginning in Kittery and on the Maine Turnpike portion of \n     I-95, which ends in Augusta. Lower federal truck weight \n     limits are enforced on all other Maine Interstate highways. \n     As you know, only the United States Congress can change \n     Interstate truck weight limits, and MaineDOT has been working \n     with the Maine Congressional delegation for some time to pass \n     a federal law to rectify this problem. The current situation \n     negatively impacts the safety of Maine's highways, the health \n     of Maine's economy, and the durability of its highways and \n     bridges. Thus, I strongly support inclusion of section 194 in \n     the FY 2010 DOT-HUD Appropriations Bill.\n       Maine has a long history of allowing trucks at 100,000-lbs. \n     gross vehicle weight (GVW) to operate on the Maine Turnpike \n     portion of I-95 south of Augusta, with a record of positive \n     economic, environmental and safety outcomes. An extension of \n     this practice to the remainder of the Maine Interstate \n     highway system would divert 100,000-lb. trucks from secondary \n     roads lined with numerous schools, intersections, driveways \n     and traffic lights, and put them on the highway \n     infrastructure that is designed to handle such demands.\n       A MaineDOT Engineering Opinion signed in June 2008 by five \n     of our top bridge and infrastructure engineers, including the \n     department's Chief Engineer with more than 50 years of \n     highway engineering experience, stated that, ``. . . it is \n     the professional opinion of the undersigned that Maine's \n     interstate system can support the addition of the 100,000-\n     lb. GVW vehicles to Maine's interstate traffic stream, \n     without any noticeable or significant damage to the \n     system's infrastructure.''\n       More specifically, MaineDOT study findings indicated that \n     an Interstate truck weight exemption would save the State of \n     Maine between $1.3 million and $2 million annually in bridge \n     and pavement costs. A companion 2004 Maine DOT study of the \n     currently exempted Maine Turnpike estimated that the federal \n     truck weight exemption on that highway, which allows higher \n     state weight limits, saves the state between $2.1 million and \n     $3.2 million annually in bridge and pavement costs. Also, the \n     increased pavement consumption of a six-axle combination \n     truck compared with the five-axle truck is relatively small \n     due to the advantage of adding an axle to offset the weight \n     increase and to the reduced number of trips by the loaded \n     vehicle. A federal truck weight exemption would annually \n     remove an estimated 7.8 million loaded truck-miles of travel \n     from Maine's primary and secondary road system, diverting the \n     traffic to the safer Interstate highway system.\n       From an environmental standpoint, the federal truck weight \n     exemption would reduce Maine's and the nation's dependence on \n     foreign oil by eliminating the need to divert to less direct \n     routes, thereby reducing overall fuel usage. In addition, \n     increasing payload capacities reduces the number of truck-\n     miles traveled for a given load, thereby reducing fuel usage. \n     Fewer trucks on the road and lower fuel usage also result in \n     lower emissions--a direct environmental benefit.\n       Also, the State of Maine just completed a study entitled \n     ``Estimating Fuel Consumption and Emissions in Maine: A \n     Comparative Analysis for a Six-Axle, 100,000-1b. Vehicle.'' \n     The study was prepared by the American Transportation \n     Research Institute. Preliminary findings included significant \n     efficiency improvements and trip-specific emissions \n     improvements in the comparison of two different parallel \n     routes--an Interstate route and a state highway route. \n     Efficiency improvements measured in miles per gallon were \n     determined to be 14-21 percent on the Interstate route. \n     Emissions were also expected to decrease by 6-11 percent for \n     CO2 and 3-8 percent for NOX and MNHC on \n     the Interstate.\n       In summary, enacting a federal truck weight limit exemption \n     on the currently non-exempt Maine Interstate highway system \n     would:\n       Reduce truck crashes on Maine's highways;\n       Reduce the number of trucks necessary to haul a given load;\n       Allow heavy truck traffic on the much safer Interstate \n     highway system;\n       Divert many through-trucks from congested town centers with \n     schools, gas stations, intersections, crosswalks, etc.;\n       Reduce regional transportation costs, making Maine industry \n     more competitive with its neighbors and enhancing interstate \n     and international trade;\n       Reduce net fuel consumption; and\n       Save $1.3 to $2.0 million annually in infrastructure costs \n     by reducing impacts.\n       As Senate action on the FY 2010 DOT-HUD Appropriations Bill \n     moves forward, I want to voice my strong support for Section \n     194, which will promote safer and more efficient truck \n     movement on Maine's highways.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John E. Balducci,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   State of Maine,\n\n\n                                  Department of Public Safety,\n\n                                   Augusta, ME, September 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Maine Department of \n     Public Safety, I am writing in support of your efforts to \n     include a one year pilot program in the FY2010 \n     Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations \n     Bill to allow trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds to operate \n     the entire length of the Interstate Highway here in Maine. We \n     strongly believe that such a program will allow all Mainers \n     to travel more efficiently and especially more safely along \n     our rural roads if this were to occur.\n       Last year in Maine, 155 people tragically died on Maine's \n     highways. 23 of these deaths involved large trucks. We also \n     know that of these 23 deaths, more than 80% occurred on our \n     rural roads. We attribute many of these deaths to the fact \n     that large trucks are forced by current Federal law and \n     policy to exit our safe, divided 4-6 lane interstate highway \n     at Augusta, a mere 100 miles into Maine, and travel along two \n     lane rural roads. Many of these trucks are then forced to \n     travel six to eight hours or more along our rural roads to \n     reach their destinations instead of being allowed to travel \n     along the divided highway.\n       These roads pass through our villages, our towns, past \n     churches, schools, shopping centers, parks and Little League \n     fields. Unlike our major highway that limits access, thereby \n     cutting down on collisions, these rural roads have thousands \n     of locations where roads cross, people enter from parking \n     lots and private driveways and young children, adults and \n     elderly people walk, bike and run.\n       Each time you add an access point to these roads, you \n     increase the potential for a tragic accident to occur. Each \n     time a truck is forced to travel along an undivided highway, \n     the potential for other vehicles to cross over into its lane, \n     to unexpectedly pull out in front of the truck, for a young \n     child to run into the roadway or for a bicycle to swerve into \n     the lane of travel, increases dramatically. Each of these \n     incidents is a tragedy waiting to happen.\n       The Maine Department of Public Safety, which includes the \n     State Bureau of Highway Safety, the Maine State Police and \n     the Bureau of Emergency Communications, strongly supports \n     your proposal. State and Federal Motor Carrier statistics \n     that have been gathered over the years tell us that every \n     time you can get a large truck off a small rural road and \n     onto a divided limited access highway, the chance to avoid \n     accidents and prevent death greatly increases. The proposed \n     bill is a smart, practical and well reasoned approach to this \n     problem. The Maine Department of Public Safety wholeheartedly \n     supports your efforts.\n       Please feel free to contact me at my office at 207 626 3800 \n     if there is any further information I can provide to you in \n     support of your efforts. Thank you for your time and \n     dedication to the efforts to make Maine's roads safer for all \n     of our citizens and visitors.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Anne H. Jordan, Esq.\n     Commissioner of Pubic Safety, State of Maine.\n                                  ____\n\n         State of Maine, Department of Public Safety--Maine State \n           Police\n                                  Augusta, ME, September 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing on behalf of the Maine \n     State Police to support your efforts to increase gross \n     vehicle weights on Maine's non-exempt Interstate highway \n     system. The changes you propose will not only benefit the \n     economy of the State of Maine, but will significantly improve \n     the safety of Maine's roads.\n       As you know, Maine allows gross vehicle weights of up to \n     100,000 lbs. on six-axle tractor semitrailers on state \n     highways. As a result, when they reach the non-exempt \n     portions of Maine's Interstate highway system heavy \n     combination trucks that would travel on the Interstate system \n     are diverted to the state highway system. This results in \n     100,000 lbs. trucks traveling through busy downtown\n\n[[Page S9539]]\n\n     areas, through population centers, through congested \n     intersections and next to schools and playgrounds.\n       A June 2004 report prepared for the Maine Department of \n     Transportation (MaineDOT) concluded that allowing 100,000 \n     lbs. trucks on the non-exempt Interstate Highways in Maine \n     would result in fewer crashes. This report indicates that the \n     crash rates on non-Interstate facilities in the study network \n     are more than 2 1/2 times higher than the crash rate on the \n     non-exempt Interstate System. In addition, the fatal crash \n     rate on non-Interstate facilities is nearly 10 times the \n     fatal crash rate on Interstate facilities while \n     incapacitating injury crashes are more than twice as \n     prevalent. National studies have found a strong relationship \n     between road class and crash risk. Findings from these \n     reports indicate that trucks traveling on rural interstates \n     are 3 to 4 times less likely to have a fatal crash than \n     trucks traveling on rural state and county highways.\n       Safety is a primary concern of the Maine State Police. \n     Given that the Interstate highway system is the safest road \n     network for heavy vehicle operations, we fully support your \n     efforts to allow 100,000 lbs. six-axle semi-trailers on the \n     non-exempt portion of Maine's Interstate highway system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Col. Patrick J. Fleming,\n     Chief, Maine State Police.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Maine State Troopers Association,\n\n                                  Augusta, ME, September 11, 2009.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I last wrote to you in 2005 in \n     support of your efforts to increase the gross vehicle weights \n     to 100,000 lbs. on Maine's non-exempt Interstate highway \n     system. At that time, I wrote in my capacity as Chief of the \n     Maine State Police. After retiring in 2007, I moved into the \n     private sector as a labor consultant providing services to, \n     amongst others, the Maine State Troopers Association (MSTA). \n     It is on their behalf that I write today. I might add that my \n     personal sentiments in support of your efforts have not \n     waivered and if anything have strengthened.\n       The statistics continue to support the increase, both from \n     an economic, and to my mind most importantly, a public safety \n     standpoint. The proposed one year pilot program will provide \n     an opportunity for due diligence on the part of policy makers \n     and policy implementers by way of an analytical survey of the \n     results of moving heavy trucks off the secondary roads and on \n     to the Interstate system which was engineered for such \n     traffic. This also will allow for policy decisions to be made \n     based on facts and not simply emotion or speculation.\n       MSTA's members are on the front line of Maine's highway \n     safety efforts and are responsible for enforcing State and \n     Federal commercial vehicle laws and regulations. They see no \n     down side to this proposal. And as compelling as the data is, \n     intuitively it just makes sense. While the naysayers believe \n     it will increase risk, no data supports that notion.\n       Safety remains the primary concern of Maine's Troopers as \n     it did in 2005. For that reason we offer our support in your \n     efforts to move 100,000 lb. six-axel semi-trailers on the \n     non-exempt portion of Maine's Interstate system. Thank you \n     for your efforts on this important initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Craig A. Poulin,\n     Executive Director, MSTA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n             Maine Association of Police, South Portland, ME, \n                                            September 9, 2009.\n\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins, The Maine Association of Police \n     offers and urges support of your efforts to include a one \n     year pilot project in the FY 2010 Transportation, Housing and \n     Urban Development Appropriations bill to allow trucks \n     weighing up to one hundred thousand pounds to utilize the \n     full length of Maine's interstate highway system.\n       Currently, federal law prohibits trucks weighing more than \n     eighty thousand pounds from traveling the I-95 corridor from \n     the city of Augusta, north. Because the Maine Turnpike, also \n     designated as I-95, is a private, toll road, this prohibition \n     does not exist from the New Hampshire border to Augusta.\n       This inconsistency creates a situation in which commercial \n     vehicles not conforming to the federal weight restriction are \n     forced to leave the interstate system and travel state \n     secondary roads. As law enforcement first responders, this \n     forced departure from the interstate system is of great \n     concern. Given the nature and daily use of secondary roads \n     vital to Maine citizens, this restriction creates an \n     unnecessary risk by forcing these commercial vehicles off of \n     a system that is specifically designed and engineered for \n     this type of commercial traffic.\n       The pilot project also provides for the diligent study of \n     the impacts that this temporary change will have on Maine's \n     interstate system to address concerns that many would have as \n     to the long term impact of commercial traffic. An unintended \n     side benefit also provides an opportunity for Maine Law \n     Enforcement to gauge the impact of removing this traffic from \n     secondary roads through crash reporting and other statistical \n     data. It also affords law enforcement a clear venue to direct \n     enforcement and safety operations as they relate to \n     commercial vehicle issues.\n       The one year pilot project provided by this current budget \n     takes a common sense approach to address an important issue \n     in Maine that has gone unattended. It provides the \n     opportunity to study the balance between an effective and \n     efficient commerce system, fuel efficiency and environmental \n     impacts, but most of all, the safety of Maine citizens and \n     those who visit our great state. We look forward to the \n     committee's support of your efforts in making this \n     opportunity a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Paul Gaspar,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 11, 2009.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Coalition for \n     Transportation Productivity (CTP) and its 120 members \n     nationwide, I am writing to express strong support for \n     Section 194 of the FY 2010 Transportation-HUD Appropriations \n     Bill now pending before the Senate. This provision would \n     enable the state of Maine to conduct a one-year pilot program \n     to test the impact of allowing 100,000 pound, six-axle \n     single-trailer trucks to access Maine's interstate highway \n     network.\n       CTP was organized to promote the passage of federal \n     legislation giving each state the option to increase its \n     interstate vehicle weight limit to 97,000 pounds for six-axle \n     trucks if the state determines that the infrastructure of \n     these roads can safely accommodate the heavier loads. Maine \n     officials have determined that their state roads are fully \n     capable of handling these loads. It is important to note that \n     highway safety, environmental performance and economic \n     productivity would all be improved by allowing this pilot \n     program to occur.\n       Increasing the interstate weight limit would allow \n     businesses and shippers to carry a specific amount of freight \n     using fewer trucks. This is especially significant for \n     highway safety because accident rates among heavy vechicles \n     are strongly tied to the vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and \n     consolidating freight would reduce VMTs to make roads safer. \n     It is important to note that since the United Kingdom raised \n     its gross vehicle weight limit for six-axle vehicles in 2001, \n     fatal truck-related accident rates have declined by 35 \n     percent. More freight has been shipped, while the number of \n     VMTs to deliver a ton of freight has declined.\n       Moreover, the current interstate weight limit often forces \n     trucks to travel on rural roads that often wind through \n     towns, passing schools and private driveways, where accidents \n     are more likely to occur. The provision would put these \n     trucks on better-engineered, divided interstate highways, \n     where they can safely and efficiently transport goods.\n       Allowing six-axle vehicles to carry more weight would also \n     yield cleaner air and greener shipping by cutting fuel use \n     and carbon emissions. A 2008 American Transportation Research \n     institute study found that six-axle trucks carrying about \n     100,000 pounds get 17 percent more ton-miles per gallon than \n     five-axle trucks carrying 80,000 pounds. More efficient \n     shipping means a smaller carbon footprint.\n       Finally, raising the interstate vehicle weight limit will \n     have widespread economic benefits. At a point when many \n     producers are facing tough economic times and smaller \n     budgets, the provision will enable them to reduce the number \n     of weekly shipments--cutting costs, spurring investment and \n     protecting valuable jobs.\n       Futhermore, producers in Maine and across the country are \n     currently at a productivity disadvantage because Canada, \n     Mexico and most European countries now have higher truck \n     weight limits. Harmonizing weight limits with our major \n     trading partners will ease the cost of moving U.S. goods into \n     international markets and stop costly freight consolidation \n     at our ports and border crossings. With Canada's higher \n     weight limits, the provision in Maine would help Northeastern \n     producers compete for market share and efficiently export \n     goods.\n       It is a fact that allowing heavier, more efficient trucks \n     to operate on our nation's interstates would improve safety, \n     reduce environmental impact and strengthen the economy. CTP \n     applauds Sen. Collins for introducing the provision.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Runyan,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Trucking Associations,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye: The American Trucking Associations \n     supports Senator Collins' efforts to secure a 1 year pilot \n     program in the Fiscal Year 2010 Transportation and Housing \n     and Urban Development Appropriations bill that would allow \n     for more productive vehicles to be operated on Maine's \n     interstate highways. The inclusion of this provision will \n     improve safety, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and benefit \n     Maine's economy.\n       Under current law, six axle vehicles with a gross vehicle \n     weight of 100,000 lbs are allowed to operate on the Maine \n     Turnpike (I-95) from\n\n[[Page S9540]]\n\n     the New Hampshire border to Augusta, ME. Upon reaching \n     Augusta, however, the federal weight preemption on the \n     Interstate Highway System forces trucks weighing more than \n     80,000 lbs off of I-95 onto smaller secondary roads which are \n     less safe than Interstates. The removal of the federal \n     prohibition would allow trucks on the roads that are best \n     suited for them.\n       This pilot project is also an effective strategy for \n     mitigating the impacts of carbon dioxide on climate change \n     due to the reduction in fuel use as a result of fewer trips \n     needed to deliver a given amount of freight. A recent study \n     found that more productive vehicles could reduce fuel usage \n     up to 39% with similar reductions in greenhouse gas \n     emissions.\n       Furthermore, the allowance of more productive vehicles on \n     the Interstate will help to alleviate Maine's current \n     economic disadvantage. Jurisdictions surrounding Maine all \n     have significantly higher weight limits on their highways. \n     New Hampshire and Massachusetts both allow trucks up to \n     99,000 lbs. and Canada allows for truck weights greater than \n     100,000 lbs. Maine's inability to allow for higher weight \n     limits has made it a virtual island unto itself.\n       ATA encourages the Committee to include the Maine pilot \n     project as part of the final FY 2010 THUD Appropriations \n     bill. This is good public policy and we commend Senator \n     Collins for her efforts to address Maine's needs.\n\n                                             Timothy P. Lynch,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                     Office of Legislative Affairs\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, several of my colleagues offered \namendments that would prohibit funding for individual transportation \nand housing projects in the underlying bill, including several \nimportant projects for Connecticut. I question the judgment of my \ncolleagues who attack specific programs without regard for the purpose \nthese projects serve or the impact they will have in the commuunity. I \nalso question the notion that Washington knows better than the \ncommunities and States which projects will provide critical services, \nstimulate their local economies, and preserve jobs.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to explain some of the critical \nfunding for Connecticut in this important legislation.\n  In my State of Connecticut, home to some of America's most \nfrustrating traffic congestion, transit is the future of \ntransportation. Investments in sustainable development have resulted in \nthe creation of job centers and residential communities built around \ntransit stations, all the while serving to clear space on the roads. \nThis transportation funding bill includes $4 million for improvements \nto the New Haven-Hartford-Springfield rail line, which would establish \nboth faster intercity and commuter rail service between New Haven, \nHartford, and Springfield, provide residents of central Connecticut \nwith better access to southwest Connecticut, New York City, western \nMassachusetts, and Vermont. It also includes nearly $10 million in \ntransit-related projects across the State, including the development of \nthe Thompsonville Intermodal Transportation Center in Enfield, a \npassenger rail station in West Haven, the Bridgeport Intermodal Center, \nand expanding transit services and access in Stamford. Transit projects \nsuch as these connect Connecticut residents with jobs and make it \npossible for the regional economies to grow.\n  Sustainable development and livable communities depend on helping \ntowns and regions across Connecticut invest in their transportation, \nhousing, land use, and economic development needs. That is, for \nexample, this bill includes $1.5 million in funding for the city of \nWaterbury for the development of brownfield properties and the \nNaugatuck River Greenway. This community faces a 12.7 percent \nunemployment rate and millions of square feet of unused, factory space \ncontaminated by generations of brass production and industrial uses. \nFunding for development of former brownfield sites in Waterbury has \nbeen a target on this Senate floor. An amendment was offered to strip \naway this project's funding. For Members of this body who have never \nvisited Waterbury, I welcome them to walk the streets of this city and \nquestion whether this community needs Federal assistance to redevelop \nproperties that have been long-contaminated, abandoned, and blighted. \nThere have been investments on the local and State level to provide \nthis city with the tools they need to thrive. It is only just that the \nFederal Government do the same.\n  Our ability to foster economic growth through sustainable development \nin Connecticut depends on our ability to have affordable housing and \nassist homeowners struggling to keep their homes in this financial \ndownturn. By providing the resources to keep people in their homes and \nassistance to communities to expand affordable housing, we can truly \nstrengthen our economy. That is why this bill includes critical funding \nfor housing and foreclosure programs across Connecticut. The bill makes \ninvestments in regions, including funds for the Southeastern \nConnecticut Housing Alliance in Norwich to provide technical assistance \nto communities in New London County to increase affordable housing and \nsupport for the Urban League of Southern Connecticut to provide for \nforeclosure prevention assistance programs to all of Connecticut. In \ncentral Connecticut, funding will support foreclosure prevention and \nhomeownership initiatives in Middletown.\n  This bill provides nearly $17 million for the State of Connecticut, \nrepresenting investments in critical programs and services to help the \npeople of my State. This bill supports local officials and \norganizations that know best the needs of their communities. It \nrepresents jobs and economic growth and I am proud to support it.\n  Madam President, I was pleased to join with my colleagues Senator \nMurray and Senator Bond to provide much-needed funding to avoid \nterminations of section 8 housing voucher assistance to families across \nthe country. The Census Department's recently released poverty figures \nshow that in 2008--before the full brunt of the current recession--\nnearly one in five American children lived in poverty. Given the \nchallenges confronting the economy and our families, housing assistance \nprograms like section 8 vouchers could not be more important.\n  Senators Murray and Bond have worked hard in recent years to ensure \nthat the section 8 voucher program is adequately funded. Unfortunately, \ninitial budget estimates that they received from the Bush \nadministration last year proved to be too low to accommodate the needs \nof the program. In recent months, we have seen newspaper accounts of \nsection 8 funding shortfalls in communities around the country, with \nfamilies worried that they would have their housing assistance reduced \nor terminated altogether. The funds provided by this amendment will \nhelp ease the minds of many families.\n  I am also pleased that these funds have been identified from within \nthe section 8 voucher account itself, so this solution is also budget-\nneutral.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank Senators Murray and Bond for \ntheir good work in assembling this challenging bill. The \nTransportation-HUD appropriations bill is responsible for funding our \nnational transportation infrastructure, vital housing assistance and \nfunding to combat homelessness, and aid to our hard-pressed cities and \ntowns. In this bill, the Senators have been able to provide valuable \nHUD funding increases for priorities such as public housing, section 8 \nassistance, and community development block grants. I also appreciate \nthe bill's strong funding for transportation, and particularly public \ntransportation programs.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues for the $100 million \nthey provided for competitive capital grants to transit agencies \nseeking to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. \nSenator Shelby and I worked with the managers to include these grants \nin the economic recovery bill earlier this year.

Madam President, it is Constitution Day. Two hundred \ntwenty-two years ago today, the Constitutional Convention finished its \nwork and proposed our fundamental charter.\n  With this vote, the Senate will finally begin fulfilling one of its \nmost important constitutional duties by granting consent to the \nPresident's lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary. This is the \nfirst Federal circuit court judge the Senate has confirmed all year. \nThe Senate has yet to confirm a single district court judge. Judicial \nvacancies have spiked and could approach 120 soon.\n  We all know Judge Lynch is an outstanding judge and will make an \nexcellent circuit judge. His nomination has been on the calendar \nawaiting Senate action for more than 3 months. I am glad his wait is \nfinally over. The President made a good nomination, and the Senate \nshould grant consent so that Judge Lynch's appointment may finally \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this nominee is a brilliant lawyer and \nan excellent, hard-working judge. He has made a number of speeches in \nthe past which evidenced an activist philosophy. I voted against him in \n1997 when he came up. And absent one or two opinions since then, it \nseems he has done an excellent job on the bench.\n  I remain concerned that we are seeing a pattern of nominees who \nbelieve they have the power to amend the Constitution.

But this \nnominee is a man of good integrity, a proven record on the bench, and I \nwill support the nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 2394 offered by the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Johanns.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, this morning I presented the argument \non this amendment to the Senate. The question was raised: We don't \nthink there is money that comes out of this budget relative to this \norganization, ACORN. I went back to the office and did some research. \nThis is a bill that controls hundreds of grant programs. After studying \nthat, it appears I was right. ACORN gets money out of this \nappropriations.\n  Moments ago my staff brought me information that would suggest that\n\n[[Page S9542]]\n\nACORN has, in fact, received funding. The EPA is a part of this bill. \nIf Members go to this bill at page 182, they will see the EPA is there. \nWe went to the EPA Web site. Here is what the Web site says, \nreferencing a grant program, that it is a collaboration of nonprofit \norganizations led by Ellis Hamilton.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, these videotapes that are the excuse for \nthis amendment understandably have offended most who have heard about \nthem, including me. I detest the stupidity and crassness that they \ndepict. If people have acted improperly, they should be fired, and if \nthey have acted illegally, they should be prosecuted. Period. The Obama \nadministration has been equally critical.\n  ACORN is not the reason for my vote. There is not even an ACORN \noffice in my entire State. Nor, for that matter, is there any reason to \nbelieve that this group ever has or ever would have any interest or \nexpertise in applying for competitive grants under the programs funded \nin this Interior appropriations bill.\n  Everyone--except perhaps many of the casual observers who are the \ntarget audience of the orchestrated anti-ACORN frenzy--knows that \nscore-at-any-price partisanship is being mixed in an unseemly way with \npublic policy.\n  For more than a year--since long before these videotapes were made--\nit has been well known that a partisan project has been launched to \ndemonize ACORN. ACORN in several ways has made easy work of that.\n  To me, this knee-jerk injection of politics into the competitive \ngrant process is the real issue here. Congress should not compound the \nwrongful and stupid actions depicted on these videos by deciding to set \npolitical standards for competitive Federal grants. Federal agencies \nuse a nonpartisan review process to award grants to the most \ncompetitive applicants. Just as I would be against banning other \nspecific organizations on the right or on the left from applying for \ncompetitive grants, I believe it is harmful, even though popular, to \napprove an amendment such as this.\n  It is unseemly to allow use of a partisan playbook to run roughshod \nover long-established competitive grant procedure. The admittedly few \nvotes that were cast against this amendment, against the tide of \npopular opinion, have at least made it more likely that in calmer \nmoments months or years from now, there may at least be some thought \ninvested before Congress again acts to inject raw political \npartisanship from the left or from the right--into the competitive \ngrant mechanisms of Federal agencies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as chairman of the committee, I urge \na ``no'' vote on this amendment. We voted on this yesterday. The vote \nwas compelling, 87 to 7. To the best of our knowledge--and the staff \nhas scrubbed the bill--there is no money for ACORN in the Interior \nappropriations bill. To do this is to set a precedent to do this on \nevery single appropriations bill. This morning I said to the \ndistinguished Senator from the great State of Nebraska: We will take \nthis amendment. He refused. I guess all of this is really to show \npeople. It is unnecessary. It delays. This is an important bill. We \nwould like to get it passed. Please vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I wish to inform all Members, this will be \nthe last vote today. Tomorrow is a Jewish holiday. We will not be in \nsession tomorrow. We will be in session Monday for Senators to offer \namendments on the Interior appropriations bill. There will be no votes \non Monday. There will be a vote or two prior to the caucus on Tuesday. \nMembers with a pent-up desire to offer amendments, the floor will be \ntheirs all day Monday. We will come in as early as they want to start \noffering amendments. We need to move forward on these appropriations \nbills. I appreciate everyone's cooperation getting this Transportation \nbill done. This is the fifth one we have completed. We have seven more \nto go.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 2394.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from \nCalifornia for her indulgence and her good work on this legislation and \nfor her leadership generally.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Madam President, I come to the floor almost every day to share \nletters from constituents in Ohio that tell a story about how they have \nworked within the health care system. Some of these stories will break \nyour heart. Some of these stories are all too common in my State and \naround the country. Whether it is in Lima or Toledo or Ravenna or Saint \nClairsville, people who oftentimes thought they had good insurance, who \nhad paid their premium month after month, year after year, had gotten \nvery sick, spent a lot of money on biologic drugs and on hospital stays \nand then their insurance\n\n[[Page S9543]]\n\nwas canceled so their insurance was not there when they needed it, even \nthough they paid month after month after month.\n  Let me take 5 minutes to share three or four of these letters from \npeople around Ohio.\n  The first one comes from Robert and Shirley from Clinton County. \nClinton County is Wilmington, OH, just 60, 75 miles or so northeast of \nCincinnati. Robert writes:\n\n       I recently retired after working 38 years in the same \n     company, where we paid for our medical coverage under the \n     company plans.\n       After retirement they grouped me and my wife in a retired \n     group and our price plan went up tremendously.\n       My wife and I are both 57 years of age and until recently \n     we were both really healthy.\n       Recently I was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes, and my wife \n     was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes and [then] developed other \n     medical conditions.\n\n  As so often occurs, diabetes, unfortunately, leads to other medical \nconditions.\n  Robert writes:\n\n       I would like to share some numbers with you:\n       My retirement income is: $1,680.00 per month.\n       My medical insurance is: $1,253.00 per month.\n       My [drug plan] is: $251.00 per month.\n       My dental is: $45.00 per month.\n\n  That means he is paying $1,549 a month for drugs, dental care, and \nmedical insurance. His retirement income is $1,680 a month.\n  He then writes:\n\n       I must say that my wife and I are very disappointed in the \n     way that some Democrats are going to the backing of the \n     ``Party Of NO,'' without taking into consideration the \n     Democratic Party has always been for the working man and \n     woman.\n\n  What Robert writes is that too often people in this situation--they \nretire and, in his case, he had worked for a company for 38 years. They \nhad been relatively healthy. Then they got sick. They have paid into \ninsurance all these years. It sounds like insurance companies have \nfound them pretty profitable over the years because they have not been \nsick. All of a sudden, when they get sick--they are retired--their \ninsurance costs have gone up so dramatically.\n  That is not what insurance is supposed to do.\n  What our legislation will do is give people, particularly those at \nthose ages between 57 and 65--because we are leaving Medicare alone. We \nare going to actually make Medicare better because we are going to \nclose that doughnut hole so people with expensive drugs can get more \nassistance from the government from the Medicare plan. So we make \nMedicare better.\n  But in this 8 years, for Robert and Shirley, between retirement and \nMedicare, somebody has to help them a little more. They have paid their \ndues. They have paid into insurance. He has worked 38 years at the same \ncompany.\n  Our legislation will allow them to go into the exchange, the \ninsurance exchange. They will then be able to choose among an Ohio \ncompany such as Medical Mutual or Aetna or CIGNA or the public option. \nThey will have a choice and they then make their decision based on what \nplan works for them. If their income is only $1,500 a month, $1,600 a \nmonth, as Robert's and Shirley's income is, then they will get some \nassistance for paying for that insurance so they can have much better \ninsurance.\n  Valorie, from Geauga County, says:\n\n       I have always been concerned about the availability for \n     affordable health care for those less fortunate than my \n     husband and myself. But never has this necessity been driven \n     home than this past February when we both lost our jobs due \n     to the economy. Once my severance package runs out, I will \n     not be able to pick up health insurance for my husband and \n     myself. We are both close to 60. We will probably have a \n     difficult time finding jobs. I am grateful the President \n     enabled us to have COBRA benefits we could afford, but they \n     will soon expire. What will we do after that?\n\n  COBRA gives you, after you lose your job, an opportunity to continue \nyour health insurance for a year and a half. You pay the part of the \nhealth insurance you were paying when you were employed but, \nunfortunately, you have to pay the employer's side of the health \ninsurance also, even though your income has dropped to close to \nnothing. President Obama, in the stimulus package we passed back in \nFebruary, included assistance for people in COBRA where the government, \nI believe for a year, paid 60 percent of those COBRA costs, allowing \npeople to keep their health care. But once COBRA expires, as Valorie \nsays, they have problems.\n\n       I am worried and I pray that neither of us becomes ill \n     because we cannot now afford our medical visits. I know there \n     are others in the same predicament. It is my hope Congress \n     can work on some reasonable solutions for all who need \n     affordable health insurance.\n\n  Valorie is not much different from Robert and Shirley in that she is \nclose to retirement but not yet Medicare age; not for another half \ndecade or so for Valorie, and she doesn't have much income now. She has \nlost her job. Her husband lost his job. She could benefit greatly from \ngoing into either the public option--but it is her choice--or Aetna or \nCIGNA or Medical Mutual or any of the other private insurance plans, \nand she would look at which one works for her best. She would get some \nassistance in paying her premiums, but she would be paying less because \nthose plans would have less cost than certainly she could get in the \nprivate market which always charges more money.\n  The third letter is from Kimberlee from Perrysburg, OH, a Toledo \nsuburb. Perrysburg has more solar energy jobs than any other city in \nthe country. I just add that for a little commercial for Perrysburg and \nmy State. Kimberlee says:\n\n       I am a 52-year-old woman and stroke survivor. I am still in \n     the recovery process, but my left side is still paralyzed. I \n     can no longer attend physical therapy because my insurance \n     stopped. I can't afford private medical insurance. I am on \n     Medicaid, but Medicaid doesn't cover all of my needed \n     physical therapy. I now have to do my therapy at home just as \n     I was starting to make real improvement with my physical \n     therapy. In a short time without therapy a person will lose \n     everything they tried so hard to gain. Wouldn't it be better \n     to continue the therapy until recovery is made. In the long \n     run, wouldn't it be less costly to the public?\n\n  Kimberlee is right. Most of us in this body are lucky enough to be \npretty healthy. We have good insurance. We aren't in jobs that age us \nquickly like my father-in-law who worked in a utility company plant for \nyears and wore his body out in so many ways. It is hard for us to \nempathize with somebody like Kimberlee. She is 52 years old, a stroke \nsurvivor, needs physical therapy and can't afford to get it. What kind \nof health care system is this? For somebody who has worked hard, is 52, \nhas had a stroke, wants to do what she needs to do in physical \ntherapy--and that is no fun. Anybody who has had it knows it is not a \nvacation; it is hard work. She wants to do that. She can't get the \ntreatment. Likely she will get sicker. If we can't pass this health \ninsurance reform--we will pass it, but if we can't, it means her life \nwill be more and more difficult and probably more expensive ultimately \nfor the health care system because she will end up more likely back in \nthe hospital with more physical problems than she had earlier.\n  The last letter I wish to share, and then turn the floor back to the \nsenior Senator from California, is from Alice from Franklin County in \ncentral Ohio. It is the county where the State capitol is located in \nColumbus. She writes:\n\n       When I was between jobs, I purchased individual coverage \n     for my family. It was difficult to navigate and confusing, \n     but COBRA is much too expensive for the average person, \n     including me. I am a woman in my 30s. One insurance company \n     discouraged me from getting a maternity rider for the policy. \n     Without this rider I would not be covered if I became \n     pregnant. I managed to avoid getting pregnant during this \n     period, but consider if I had. How many people must be in \n     this situation? What about for my brother-in-law and his \n     wife? Both are schoolteachers. They decided it was better for \n     her to stay home with their daughter and newborn, but they \n     couldn't afford to put his wife on a health plan. Right after \n     the baby was born, my sister-in-law had a seizure and was \n     diagnosed with a brain tumor. They got most of it. She seems \n     fine, but I can't imagine what that is going to cost. They \n     have two babies and a house they bought a couple of years \n     ago. Now they will probably have hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars in medical bills. The current system is bankrupting \n     families. I don't know why the opposition can't see how this \n     is dragging people down.\n\n  That is kind of the whole point. These are people who are working, \ndoing things right. Both were schoolteachers. They decided that she \nwould stay home with the two young children. They bought a house. They \nare going to be faced with hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical \nbills. How many people in this country--we\n\n[[Page S9544]]\n\nknow this--how many people in this country end up, because of health \ncare costs, because they had insurance that wasn't quite really \ninsurance, because the insurance got canceled when they got sick or had \na really expensive treatment--how many people like that end up in \nbankruptcy because they don't have enough insurance or they have the \nwrong kind of insurance and they got unlucky and got sick. It doesn't \nmake sense for us, in a country where people do things right--they are \nworking hard, they are playing by the rules, they are paying their \ntaxes, contributing to society, and they are public schoolteachers, and \nthen somehow their insurance doesn't work well enough for them and they \ngo into bankruptcy. What purpose does that serve for any of us in this \ngreat country?\n  These health care bankruptcies will drop dramatically in number, will \nalmost be eliminated with this health care bill. People occasionally \nmay fall through the cracks, but once we pass our health insurance \nreform, we are not going to read in the paper anymore that people have \nhad to file for bankruptcy because they got sick and their insurance \ndidn't work. That is reason enough to vote for this legislation.\n  I ask my colleagues to work together in as bipartisan a way as \npossible to pass this legislation. The Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, on the bill we wrote this July, accepted 161 \nRepublican amendments. There is a lot of bipartisanship to a lot of \nthis bill. The big question is the very great philosophical \ndifferences. Most Democrats support a public option. We think people \nshould have more choice, make insurance companies more honest. \nRepublicans philosophically don't support the public option. They think \nit is too much government. But most Republicans also didn't support the \ncreation of Medicare. I think in the end, a lot of Republicans will \njoin us because they want to be on the right side of history. They want \nto be part of something that is going to make a big, positive \ndifference in the lives of tens of millions of Americans.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, it is my understanding that the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee wishes to speak \nas in morning business and I certainly have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                            Missile Defense\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia. Her courtesy is legendary in this body and I thank her for \nthat.\n  I am taken aback and flabbergasted by the Obama administration's \ndecision announced today to cancel the European missile defense site. I \nask, what does that mean? What will be the consequences of that \ndecision? I wish to share a few remarks about it and note that this \nshift is contrary to the sense-of-the-Senate language that we included \nin the Defense bill passed a few weeks ago by this Senate. It is a very \nsignificant decision. I want to give it more thought. I don't want to \noverstate the problem. However, I wish to be on record today as saying \nthis is a surprising decision, one that I have been involved in the \ndiscussion of for quite a number of years, and I feel as if it is a big \nerror.\n  What happens? We asked our allies in Central Europe, Poland, and the \nCzech Republic to stand with us and to agree to place a radar in the \nCzech Republic and to place our defensive missile interceptors in \nPoland. The heads of those governments agreed to that. There was a lot \nof opposition here in the United States to the proposal. Likewise, \nthere was opposition expressed in Poland and the Czech Republic from \nthe traditional European left, many of them Marxists or hard-line \nleftists who have opposed the West's and the world's defense program \nfor many years. However, that opposition was overruled and these \nnations were proud to be and to stand with the United States of \nAmerica. It did not bother them that their big neighbor, Russia, \nobjected. They are a sovereign nation of which they are quite proud. \nThey were proud to make a decision and reach an agreement with the \nUnited States of America that could defend this country from limited \nmissile attack from a rogue nation such as Iran. If Iran were to launch \na missile attack that could reach the United States, its path would \ntake it over Europe, and European nations were not immune to the threat \nof such an attack on their soil.\n  So they felt they were participating both in the defense of Europe \nand in the defense of the United States, and it was a good government \npublic interest decision that they were pleased to participate in and \nstood up with us. We made a commitment to Poland and the Czech \nRepublic, of course, when we asked them to do this and go through this \nprocess to build a system.\n  For years, we have been moving forward with that plan in mind in the \nSenate. This year, we had quite a bit of discussion about it in the \nSenate and we reached an agreement that I think pretty much stated \nflatly what our position. There were some who objected, and this is how \nwe modified the language to finally state:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that (1) the United States \n     Government should continue developing and planning for the \n     proposed deployment of elements of a Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system, including a midcourse radar in the Czech \n     Republic and Ground-based interceptors in Poland, consistent \n     with the Duncan Hunter National Defense Act of 2009.\n\n  Paragraph 2 says:\n\n       In conjunction with the continued development of the \n     planned Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, the United \n     States should work with its North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies to explore a range of options and \n     architectures to provide missile defenses for Europe and the \n     United States against current and future Iranian ballistic \n     missile capabilities.\n       Any alternative system that the United States Government \n     considers deploying in Europe to provide for the defense of \n     Europe and a redundant defense of the United States against \n     future long-range Iranian missile threats should be at least \n     as capable and cost-effective as the proposed European \n     deployment of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system; and \n     any missile defense capabilities deployed in Europe should, \n     to the extent practical, be interoperable with United States \n     and North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n  Indeed, NATO endorsed this program.\n  For a while, some of our Members said, Well, I am not too sure about \nthis. What does NATO say? NATO did endorse it. This action of backing \ndown from our European-site Missile Defense system sends an overt \nsignal to our allies that we don't fulfill our commitments, and it is \nbound to make our allies in Central Europe particularly nervous. This \ndecision sends a message from the administration that we reward bad \nbehavior.\n  The defense of this decision to abandon this program is that we are \nnot doing this to curry favor with Russia, but that clearly is a State \nDepartment goal in this process because the Russians have objected to \nthe deployment of this system--although it had virtually no capability \nwith 10 interceptors in Poland to in any way defend against the massive \narsenal that the old Soviet Union developed and that Russia now \nmaintains.\n  So it does appear to be an attempt to placate Russia at the expense \nof our great allies, the Czech Republic and Poland. And we are walking \naway from a bipartisan commitment to national missile defense on a \nEuropean site, as I noted, included in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for 2010. We accepted the sense-of-the-Senate \nlanguage unanimously because both parties agreed to this. Senator \nLieberman and I were the primary sponsors, along with Senator Begich \nand others on the Democratic side, and a strong contingent of \nRepublicans.\n  Let me say this about the whole system. I am worried--and I hope my \ncolleagues will take this point under consideration. We have spent \napproximately $20 billion developing something many people believed \nwould never work; that is, the ability to intercept in space an \nincoming ICBM missile and hit it bullet to bullet. We don't even deploy \nor utilize explosives. The kinetic energy is so great that it destroys \nthe target when it hits. Our military experts have said that if North \nKorea were to be able to successfully launch a missile, they believe \nthey could knock it down. We are improving our system as we have a \nnumber of them deployed, and we plan to deploy more. Yet this year's \nbudget was a stunning retrenchment in our missile defense system. Let \nme summarize the things that occurred.\n\n[[Page S9545]]\n\n  Even though this language contemplated moving forward in Europe, this \nis what we did regarding the United States. For quite a number of \nyears, we planned to deploy 44 interceptor missiles--most in Alaska and \na number in California. We talked about what to do about the Iranian \nthreat, to provide redundant coverage for those missiles coming over \nfrom the east. We agreed that we would seek the agreement of Poland and \nthe Czech Republic to base assets there. Fifty-four interceptors were \nto be deployed, 10 at the European site and 44 on the West Coast of the \nUnited States. What happened in this year's budget was that the 44 to \nbe deployed in Alaska and California have been cut to 30.\n  The next technological advance to our missile defense system, the \nMEV--multikill vehicle--would be the warhead which could take out \nmultiple incoming missiles with one missile. We think that was very \ncapable technology that would be developed. That was zeroed out.\n  We had an additional system of a smaller but very high-speed \ninterceptor, called a kinetic energy interceptor, KEI, that has been on \nthe drawing board for a number of years and is showing a great deal of \npromise. That was zeroed out after years of funding.\n  We had plans and were working on the airborne laser, ABL, an amazing \ntechnology that our Defense Department believes will work--and we will \ntest it this year. The airborne laser can knock down missiles, \nparticularly in their ascent phase from an airplane. That missile \nsystem, after this year, will be zeroed out.\n  The 10 missiles we intended to base in Central Europe have been \neliminated, it appears. At least that has been the President's \nrecommendation and decision that we heard about today.\n  So I would say this: We believe, looking carefully at the numbers and \nputting in some extra loose change, for $1 billion, we could fully \ndeploy the full system--with the full compliment of 44 missiles in the \nUnited States and 10 in Europe. We have spent over $20 billion to get \nto this point. So it is unthinkable to me that we would eliminate any \nfuture advancements in the system. I think, from a cost point of view, \nit is an unwise decision.\n  I am concluding that money is not the problem. I can only conclude \nthat the Obama administration has decided that they agree with the \nnaysayers who opposed President Reagan when he said this could ever be \na successful system. They opposed it, and it looks like a political \ndecision to me. Some sort of judgment decision to cancel this is \ninvolved here more than a dollars-and-cents issue because in the scheme \nof a $500 billion-plus defense budget, $1 billion over several years to \ncomplete the system as planned is not the kind of budget-breaking \nnumber that should cause us to change our policy.\n  Senator Lieberman and I had offered this sense of the Senate \namendment, and it passed the Senate just a few weeks ago. I believe it \nis the right policy. I think the administration is trying to do some, \nperhaps, good things. They think maybe they are attempting to placate \nor somehow reach out to Russia and gain some strategic advantage from \nthat--although the Secretary of Defense, I understand, today said it \ndidn't have anything to do with the Russian foreign policy, and I am \nnot sure the administration acknowledges that either. ``The Czech \npremier, Jan Fischer, said Thursday''--this is in an Associated Press \narticle--``that President Barack Obama told him Washington had decided \nto scrap the plan that had deeply angered Russia.'' It seems to me that \nis a part of it.\n  Let's go to the core of this Russian objection. As I have said on the \nfloor, Russia knows this system poses no threat to their massive \narsenal. They know that. Their objection to this system has been, in my \nview, a political objection, a foreign policy bluster and gambit to try \nto create a problem with the United States and extract something from \nus. They consistently oppose it.\n  Let's note the Reuters news article today by Michael Stott, which is \nan analysis of this. The headline of the article is ``Demise of U.S. \nshield may embolden Russia hawks.'' In other words, this weakness, this \nretreat, this backing down may well encourage them to believe that if \nthey are more confrontational on other matters, they may gain more than \nby being nice to this administration.\n  The lead paragraph said:\n\n       Washington hopes that by backing away from an anti-missile \n     system in east Europe, it will get Russian cooperation on \n     everything from nuclear weapons cuts to efforts to curb \n     Iranian and North Korean nuclear ambitions.\n       But will Moscow keep its side of the bargain?\n\n  That is a good question.\n  Mr. Stott goes on in his perceptive article to say:\n\n       With the shield now on the back burner, both sides believe \n     a deal cutting long-range nuclear arsenals can be inked this \n     year and Russia has already agreed to allow U.S. military \n     cargos to transit across its territory en route to \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  That is something we have been asking them for some time, and they \nhave dangled it out there. Apparently, a valuable but not critical \nability to transport cargo may have been gained from this.\n  The author says:\n\n       Russian diplomacy is largely a zero-sum game and relies on \n     projecting hard power to forced gains, as in last year's war \n     with Georgia over the rebel regions of Abkhazia and South \n     Osettia or the gas dispute with Ukraine at the start of the \n     year.\n       Western concepts of ``win-win'' deals and Obama's drive for \n     21st century global partnerships are not part of its \n     vocabulary.\n\n  The Western idea that if you cut a deal, both sides will benefit--\nthat is not the way the Russians think.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Diplomats here say Moscow hardliners could read the shield \n     backdown as a sign of Washington's weakness. Far from doing \n     the bidding of the United States, they may instead press for \n     further gain to shore up Russian power in the former Soviet \n     bloc.\n\n  That is the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Georgia, Poland, the Baltics, \nLatvia, Estonia, Lithuania, and Hungary.\n  The author goes on to say:\n\n       Ukraine, Georgia, and other Kremlin foes in the ex-Soviet \n     Union may be the first to feel the consequences.\n       Poland and the Czech Republic are also nervous. In Warsaw, \n     the timing of the U.S. move is particularly delicate as it \n     coincides with the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of \n     eastern Poland.\n       Analysts are particularly concerned about Ukraine, which \n     faces a presidential election next January. Most of Russia's \n     vast gas exports flow through its territory and the country \n     reluctantly hosts a large Russian naval base.\n\n  I don't know what the geopolitical goals are here. I think it is a \nmistake not to deploy this system we committed to deploying. I believe \nwe are not going to be able to rely on the good faith of the Russians, \nand I think they may misread what we have done. Instead of leading to \nfurther accommodation, it may lead to emboldening them to go forward \nwith further demands against the United States.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar \nrecently announced plans to cover 1,000 square miles of land in Nevada, \nArizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah with solar \ncollectors to generate electricity. He is also talking about generating \n20 percent of our electricity from wind. This would require building \nabout 186,000 50-story wind turbines that would cover an area the size \nof West Virginia, not to mention 19,000 new miles of high-voltage \ntransmission lines.\n  Is the Federal Government showing any concern about this massive \nintrusion into the natural landscape? Not at\n\n[[Page S9546]]\n\nall. I fear we are going to destroy the environment in the name of \nsaving the environment.\n  The House of Representatives has passed climate legislation that \nstarted out as an attempt to reduce carbon emissions. It has morphed \ninto an engine for raising revenues by selling carbon dioxide emission \nallowances and promoting renewable energy.\n  The bill requires electric utilities to get 20 percent of their power \nmostly from wind and solar by 2020. These renewable energy sources are \nreceiving huge subsidies all to supposedly create jobs and hurry us \ndown the road to an America running on wind and sunshine, as described \nin President Obama's inaugural address.\n  Yet all this assumes renewable energy is a free lunch, a benign so-\ncalled sustainable way of running the country with minimal impact on \nthe environment. That assumption experienced a rude awakening on August \n26 when the Nature Conservancy published a paper entitled ``Energy \nSprawl or Energy Efficiency: Climate Policy Impacts on Natural Habitat \nfor the United States of America.''\n  The report by this venerable environmental organization posed a \nsimple question: How much land is required for the different energy \nsources that power the country? The answers deserve far greater public \nattention.\n  By far, nuclear energy is the least land intensive. It requires only \n1 square mile for one reactor, that is to produce 1 million megawatt \nhours per year, enough electricity for about 90,000 homes. Geothermal \nenergy, which taps the natural heat of the Earth, requires 3 square \nmiles. The most landscape consuming are the biofuels ethanol and \nbiodiesel, which require up to 500 square miles to produce the same \namount of energy. Coal, on the other hand, requires 4 square miles, \nmainly for mining and extraction. Solar thermal heating, a fluid with \nlarge arrays of mirrors and using it to power a turbine takes 6 square \nmiles. Natural gas needs 8 and petroleum needs 18. Wind farms require \nover 30 square miles.\n  This sprawl has been missing from our energy discussions. In my home \nState of Tennessee, we just celebrated the 75th anniversary of the \nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park, America's most visited national \npark. Yet there are serious proposals by energy developers to cover \nmountains all along the Appalachian chain from Georgia through the \nfoothills of the Smoky Mountains through the Blue Ridge Mountains of \nVirginia, all the way up to the White Mountains of New Hampshire with \n50-story wind turbines because the wind blows strongest across \nmountaintops. I can tell from the Presiding Officer's smile that she is \nthinking of the strong winds on the White Mountains which are among the \nstrongest in the entire United States of America.\n  Let's put this into perspective. We could line 300 miles of \nmountaintops from Chattanooga, TN, to Bristol, VA, with wind turbines \nand still only produce one-quarter of the electricity we get from one \nreactor on 1 square mile at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar \nnuclear plant.\n  The 1,000-square mile solar project proposed by Mr. Salazar would \ngenerate on a continuous basis 35,000 megawatts of electricity. You \ncould get the same output from 30 new nuclear reactors that would fit \ncomfortably on existing nuclear sites. And this does not count the \nthousands of miles of transmission lines that will be needed to carry \nthe newly generated solar power through and to population centers.\n  There is one more consideration. Solar collectors must be washed down \nonce a month or they collect too much dirt to be effective. They also \nneed to be cooled by water. Where amid the desert and the scrubland \nwill we find all that water? No wonder the Wildlife Conservancy and \nother environmentalists are already opposing solar projects on some \nwestern lands.\n  Renewable energy is not a free lunch. It is an unprecedented assault \non the American landscape. Before we find ourselves engulfed in energy \nsprawl, it is imperative we take a closer look at the advantages of \nnuclear power.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a summary of the Nature Conservancy paper entitled ``Energy \nSprawl or Energy Efficiency,'' which was published on August 26.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Abstract\n\n       Concern over climate change has led the U.S. to consider a \n     cap-and-trade system to regulate emissions. Here we \n     illustrate the land-use impact to U.S. habitat types of new \n     energy development resulting from different U.S. energy \n     policies. We estimated the total new land area needed by 2030 \n     to produce energy, under current law and under various cap-\n     and-trade policies, and then partitioned the area impacted \n     among habitat types with geospatial data on the feasibility \n     of production. The land-use intensity of different energy \n     production techniques varies over three orders of magnitude, \n     from 1.9-2.8 km\\2\\/ TW hr/yr for nuclear power to 788-1000 \n     km\\2\\/TW hr/yr for biodiesel from soy. In all scenarios, \n     temperate deciduous forests and temperate grasslands will be \n     most impacted by future energy development, although the \n     magnitude of impact by wind, biomass, and coal to different \n     habitat types is policy-specific. Regardless of the existence \n     or structure of a cap-and-trade bill, at least 206,000 km\\2\\ \n     will be impacted without substantial increases in energy \n     efficiency, which saves at least 7.6 km\\2\\ per TW hr of \n     electricity conserved annually and 27.5 km\\2\\ per TW hr of \n     liquid fuels conserved annually. Climate policy that reduces \n     carbon dioxide emissions may increase the areal impact of \n     energy, although the magnitude of this potential side effect \n     may be substantially mitigated by increases in energy \n     efficiency. The possibility of widespread energy sprawl \n     increases the need for energy conservation, appropriate \n     siting, sustainable production practices, and compensatory \n     mitigation offsets.\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Climate change is now acknowledged as a potential threat to \n     biodiversity and human well-being, and many countries are \n     seeking to reduce their emissions by shifting from fossil \n     fuels to other energy sources. One potential side effect with \n     this switch is the increase in area required by some \n     renewable energy production techniques. Energy production \n     techniques vary in the spatial extent in which production \n     activities occur, which we refer to as their energy sprawl, \n     defined as the product of the total quantity of energy \n     produced annually (e.g., TW lu-/yr) and the land-use \n     intensity of production (e.g. km\\2\\ of habitat per TW hr/yr). \n     While many studies have quantified the likely effect of \n     climate change on the Earth's biodiversity due to climate-\n     driven habitat loss, concluding that a large proportion of \n     species could be driven extinct, relatively few studies have \n     evaluated the habitat impact of future energy sprawl. It is \n     important to understand the potential habitat effects of \n     energy sprawl, especially in reference to the loss of \n     specific habitat types, since habitats vary markedly in the \n     species and ecosystem processes they support.\n       Within the United States, the world's largest cumulative \n     polluter of greenhouse gases, concern over climate change has \n     led to the consideration of a cap-and-trade system to \n     regulate emissions, such as the previously proposed \n     Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 2191) and the Low \n     Carbon Economy Act (S. 1766). Major points of contention in \n     structuring a cap-and-trade system are the feasibility and \n     desirability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) at coal \n     plants, the creation of new nuclear plants, and whether to \n     allow international offset programs that permit U.S. \n     companies to meet obligations abroad. The rules of a cap-and-\n     trade system, as well as technological advances in energy \n     production and changes in the price of fossil fuels, will \n     affect how the U.S. generates energy. In this study we take \n     scenarios of a cap-and-trade system's effect on United States \n     energy production and evaluate each scenario's impact on \n     habitat due to energy sprawl. Our scenarios are based on the \n     Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast of energy \n     production in 2030 under current law (the ``Reference \n     Scenario''), including the renewable fuel standard of the \n     Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, and under three \n     cap-and-trade scenarios: the ``Core Cap-and-Trade Scenario'', \n     where the full Lieberman-Warner Climate Change Act is \n     implemented; the ``Few Options Scenario'', where \n     international offsets are not allowed and where new nuclear \n     production and coal production with CCS are not possible; and \n     the ``CCS Scenario'', where Congress enacts the Low Carbon \n     Economy Act, a cap-and-trade system more favorable to coal \n     with CCS.\n       Under each scenario, we first estimate the total new land \n     area in the U.S. needed to produce energy for each production \n     technique as a function of the amount of energy needed and \n     the land-use intensity of production. We examine the effect \n     of U.S. climate policy on future energy sprawl using energy \n     scenarios based on proposed legislation, building on a body \n     of literature on this topic. Note that our analysis focuses \n     only on U.S. land-use implications, ignoring other, \n     potentially significant international land-use implications \n     of U.S. climate policy. Second, we use available information \n     on where new energy production facilities would be located to \n     partition this area among major habitat types. We calculate \n     the new area directly impacted by energy development within \n     each major habitat type, but do not attempt to predict where \n     within each major habitat\n\n[[Page S9547]]\n\n     type energy development will take place, nor possible \n     indirect effects on land-use regionally or globally due to \n     altered land markets. Our analysis provides a broad overview \n     of what change in the energy sector will mean for area \n     impacted in different natural habitat types, recognizing that \n     such a broad analysis will inevitably have to simplify parts \n     of a complex world.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, my home State of Nevada has seen \ndevastating effects from this recession. The foreclosure crisis has \nturned neighborhoods across my State literally almost into ghost towns. \nI have long argued the crash of the housing market has been at the root \nof our economic crisis. We have to focus on fixing the housing problem \nin this country if we want the economy to turn around.\n  In February, I offered a bill called the Fix Housing First Act. This \nwould have fixed the housing problem; it would have turned the housing \nmarket around in this country. I believe it would have created jobs all \nacross this country, including in my home State of Nevada.\n  My Fix Housing First Act would have let American home owners \nrefinance their mortgages at around a 4-percent interest rate in a 30-\nyear fixed mortgage. This would have meant an average of around $300 to \n$400 savings per month for the average homeowner in the United States \nand back in my home State of Nevada.\n  Additionally, my bill included a provision, produced by Senator \nJohnny Isakson from Georgia, that was a $15,000 home buyer tax credit \nto incentivize home ownership. The tax credit would have been a \nstepping stone for our country to begin to come out of the housing \ncrisis. While my bill was defeated along party lines, we were able to \npass an $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit, sponsored by myself \nand Senator Ben Cardin, from Maryland.\n  Today I join my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to extend this \n$8,000 first time home buyer tax credit for another 6 months, until \nJune of next year. Unless Congress acts, this $8,000 is set to expire \nat the end of November. There is evidence that is showing the tax \ncredit is working. If we do not extend this tax credit, homes will not \nbe saved, and they will likely go into foreclosure.\n  We in the Senate need to act in a bipartisan fashion to extend the \nfirst-time home buyer tax credit of $8,000. It is the right thing to do \nto get housing back on the track, especially in States such as Nevada, \nFlorida, California, and Arizona. These states are still suffering when \nit comes to the housing industry. Housing is at the root of a lot of \nthe economic problems we have in this country.\n  I encourage this body to act. Chairman Bernanke said the other day \nthe recession is over. At 9.7 percent unemployment rate in this \ncountry, I don't think the recession looks to be over to those people \nstill out of a job. My State of Nevada has over a 12-percent \nunemployment rate. Clark County, where Las Vegas is, has over a 13-\npercent unemployment rate. I don't think folks living there think the \nrecession is over.\n  We need to continue to work to fix this economy, and this first-time \nhome buyer tax credit is a good place to start.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9547-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CRAGIN & PIKE INSURANCE COMPANY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the critical \nrole of structural steel in our nation's infrastructure and industrial \neconomy.\n  On September 18, 2009, Steel Day will be celebrated through events \nhosted nationwide. These events recognize the many employment \nopportunities the structural steel industry has provided to American \nworkers and the contribution structural steel has made to our \nconstruction industry as a safe, strong and effective building \nmaterial.\n  The structural steel industry is a major employer in Illinois and \nother States across the country. Today, the United States has three \nmajor steel mills and more than 2,600 steel fabricators, which together \nemploy over 250,000 Americans.\n  Roughly 98 percent of structured steel in a building can be recovered \nand recycled and 93 percent of all columns and beams produced at U.S. \nsteel mills are composed of recycled materials. In fact, interest in \ndomestic steel as a building material has been bolstered by its \ndesirable status in LEED certification, a rating system developed by \nthe US Green Building Council.\n  Improvements in the technology used to create and erect steel \nprojects have lowered construction costs and improved onsite safety, \nresulting in increased demand worldwide. In light of these economic, \nenvironmental, and safety factors, it is no surprise that there is \ncurrently a three-to-one preference for using structural steel in the \nconstruction of multistory residential and nonresidential buildings.\n  I congratulate the structural steel industry on Steel Day. Steel has \nfeatured prominently in America's past and present and will undoubtedly \nplay an important role in our Nation's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9547-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9547-S9548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to pay respect \nto the life and character of our dear friend Ted Kennedy. A man as much \na part of this institution as the very walls of the Capitol, Ted has \nearned his place in the world's history books and will never be \nforgotten.\n  I consider myself privileged to have worked with Ted on several \nimportant issues, ranging from hate crimes legislation, to our time \ntogether on the Judiciary Committee. Ted was responsible for the \nMatthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act, an important piece of legislation \nproviding protection for vulnerable Americans that I was proud to \ncosponsor. He was instrumental in the passage of SCHIP, a program that \nnow insures the health of millions of children across the country. The \nimpact Ted Kennedy had on civil rights legislation throughout his \ncareer is simply immeasurable. Countless programs now serving the \nAmerican people could not\n\n[[Page S9548]]\n\nexist today if not for the hard work and determination of Ted Kennedy.\n  One of my most vivid memories working with Senator Kennedy was during \nthe now well known confirmation hearings of Robert Bork for the Supreme \nCourt. Ted spoke eloquently and with conviction against Judge Bork's \nnomination, fearing the erosion of civil rights that would occur were \nhe confirmed. Ted refused to let this erosion of rights take place, and \nI am proud to have joined him in his fight against the nomination of \nRobert Bork.\n  Ted proved through his actions, both on and off the Senate floor, \nthat he was, above all, a man of compassion. The single unifying theme \nof Ted's distinguished body of work was his clear commitment to the \npeople of this great country. His love for the American people was \nclear through the legislation he so strongly supported. Ted's greatest \nconcern was for the well-being of every American, and he made it his \nmission to ensure the underprivileged received the fair treatment they \ndeserved.\n  In his lifetime, Ted Kennedy was able to accomplish more than most \nmen could ever dream of accomplishing. I have no doubt that if we were \nlucky enough to have him with us today, he would continue to add even \ngreater accomplishments to his already impressive resume. Ted will be \ndeeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9548-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENUMERATED POWERS ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise on this Constitution Day to urge \nsupport for S. 1319, the Enumerated Powers Act. My friend and Judiciary \nCommittee colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, introduced the bill \nin June, and I am proud to be a cosponsor. It would create a mechanism \nby which we can highlight and, if necessary, debate whether we actually \nhave the power to do what we do.\n  Today, the prevailing view seems to be that Congress can do anything \nwe want to do, any time, and in any way. There are always problems to \nsolve, good ideas to implement, money to spend, activities to regulate, \nagendas to pursue, or constituencies to please. But those are merely \nthe ends and, in our system of government at least, the ends cannot not \njustify the means. Not if we truly value our liberty. Our liberty \nrequires that government be limited, that government's actions have \nlegal authority, ultimately rooted in the Constitution itself.\n  The Constitution, for example, does not grant Congress all \nlegislative authority. Article I gives Congress only ``legislative \npowers herein granted.'' Those powers are listed, or enumerated, in \narticle I, section 8. The 10th amendment affirms that the Federal \nGovernment has only powers that are affirmatively delegated to it. \nJames Madison explained in The Federalist No. 45 that these powers \ndelegated to the Federal Government are ``few and defined.'' Why all \nthis emphasis on definition and limitation, especially of the Federal \nGovernment? Because individual liberty requires limited government.\n  In The Federalist No. 51, Madison wrote that ``if men were angels, no \ngovernment would be necessary.'' In other words, some government is \nnecessary to have any liberty at all. But Madison went right on to \nwrite that ``if angels were to govern men, neither external nor \ninternal controls on government would be necessary.'' In other words, \nunlimited government makes liberty impossible. The truth is that men \nare not angels and angels do not govern men. Acknowledging that truth, \nAmerica's Founders in their genius created a system of limited \ngovernment to maximize ordered liberty.\n  I realize that such notions as definition and limitation are not in \nfashion today. Many today think these ideas passe, antiquated, or--and \nthis is my personal favorite--archaic. Limited government is fine when \nwe have no major problems to solve, when there are no big crises \nlooming large. But today we face the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression and many Americans want government to be robust and \nfull-throttled. We want government to come to the rescue, to set things \nright, to make everything OK. I realize that today saying no is not \npopular, whether for individuals or for the government.\n  So we have to make the same basic, fundamental choice that America's \nFounders did. How much do we prize liberty? The laws of human nature \nand, therefore, of government have not changed. Men have not become \nangels and angels do not govern men. That condition will never exist. \nOrdered liberty will always require limited government, and so we must \nrepeatedly ask whether, and how much, we prize liberty.\n  This bill embodies these principles by requiring that each of \nCongress state its constitutional authority. In other words, each act \nof Congress must state the very condition that indicates it is \nconsistent with limited government. Congress has no authority to act, \nCongress has no authority to exist at all, unless that authority is \nderived from the Constitution. It is no less important than that. So \nthis bill would require that each act of Congress state the one \ncondition that is necessary for that act of Congress to be legitimate--\nauthority derived from the Constitution.\n  That statement alone would be important but purely symbolic. \nVirtually everyone could ignore it. So this bill would create a \nmechanism for challenging and even debating whether an act of Congress \nis indeed authorized by the Constitution. It does not require such a \ndebate for every act of Congress but provides for a point of order that \ncan result in such a debate. That debate would focus everyone's \nattention on the absolutely necessary connection between Congress' \nactions and the Constitution and, ultimately, on the Constitution \nitself.\n  In the landmark case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice John \nMarshall wrote that ``[t]he powers of the legislature are defined, and \nlimited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the \nconstitution is written.'' A written Constitution that delegates \nenumerated powers to Congress is central to limited government and, \ntherefore, central to our liberty. If we prize liberty, we must prize \nlimitations on government. Chief Justice Marshall later wrote in \nMcCulloch v. Maryland that ``this government is acknowledged by all to \nbe one of enumerated powers. The principle that it can exercise only \nthe powers granted to it . . . is now universally admitted.''\n  That was then. How about today? Do we still believe that ordered \nliberty requires limited government? Do we still believe that Congress \nmay only do what the Constitution authorizes us to do? Or do we believe \nthat Congress needs no more than a good idea powered by a good \nintention? Are the principles embraced by Madison, by Marshall, still \nuniversally admitted today? If so, then this bill is an important way \nto prove it. On this Constitution Day, I urge my colleagues once again \nto embrace those principles of limited government and to demonstrate it \nby supporting this bill. Policy ideas and political positions shape our \nlegislative activity, the Constitution should do so as well. I applaud \nmy colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, for introducing this bill \nand offering this opportunity to raise these principles closer to the \nposition of importance they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9548-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9548-S9549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONSTITUTION DAY 2009\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today marks the 222nd anniversary of the \nsigning of the Constitution by the States that assembled in \nPhiladelphia. The constitutional design of our three branches of \nGovernment has provided for collaboration in protecting this \nfundamental balance. Earlier this week, when I addressed the Chief \nJustice and the Judicial Conference of the United States, I noted the \nanniversary of the signing of our Constitution. This anniversary \ndeserves more attention than it has received, and I was heartened to \nsee that one of Vermont's great newspapers, The Caledonian-Record, also \nsaw fit to note this anniversary in a recent editorial. The Caledonian-\nRecord noted, ``Our Constitution is timeless and the most relevant \nguide to continuing our freedoms. Millions of Americans have died in \nits defense. Celebrate it!''\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee I am constantly \nreminded of the Constitution's continued importance and relevance to \nour daily lives. From the first amendment, which protects newspapers \nlike The Caledonian-Record, to the rights of Americans to vote, the \nConstitution is the cornerstone of our democracy. We all must\n\n[[Page S9549]]\n\nremember how fortunate we are to enjoythe rights our Founders embedded \nin our guiding document.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Caledonian-Record, Sept. 14, 2009]\n\n             It's Constitution Week: Celebrate Our Freedoms\n\n       Every year, America's newspapers celebrate the United \n     States Constitution by focusing on the document, with \n     features and editorials that acknowledge the central place in \n     America's freedoms that the Constitution possesses. We do it \n     to assure that Americans, in the rush of making a living, of \n     raising children, of growing up or growing old, and of all of \n     the other distractions of our lives, do not forget the vision \n     and the wisdom that almost miraculously guided our Founding \n     Fathers in composing this document. It is as important today, \n     indeed, probably more important, than it was in 18th century \n     America.\n       This is Constitution Week. It is fitting that it should \n     immediately follow the national commemoration of the worst, \n     most deadly domestic terrorism attack in our history, Sept. \n     11, 2001. That attack, literally brought home that nowhere in \n     the world are freedom loving people safe from the militant \n     insanity of ideologically driven terrorists, in this case of \n     radical Islamists. In previous epochal events, they were \n     Nazis, Japanese imperialists, Marxists, and others. In every \n     case, the adjuration that arose from 9/11 applies, and never \n     more strongly than in reverence of the Constitution, ``Never \n     forget!''\n       For the last 200-plus years, there have been, and are now, \n     those who would like to change our Constitution in ways that \n     occupy the whole continuum, from updating its grammar to \n     totally destroying it in the name of social action and the \n     progressive insistence that only the evolution of the present \n     to the future is relevant, that a document so old is a \n     totally irrelevant relic.\n       Not so!

Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure to bring \nbefore the Senate today the achievements of some of the most brilliant, \ninventive young minds in the United States. I take this time to \nacknowledge the 19 recipients of the 2009 Davidson Fellows Award, a \nscholarship awarded to exceptional students to assist them in \nfurthering their education. These scholarships are given by the \nDavidson Institute for Talent Development to profoundly gifted \nindividuals under the age of 18 who have completed academically \nrigorous projects that demonstrate a potential to make a significant, \npositive contribution to society. This year's recipients achieved \nacademic distinction in the areas of science, literature, philosophy, \nout-of-the-box thinking, technology, and music. These young individuals \nare more than deserving of this honor and our recognition. I would like \nto take a few moments to describe what each recipient has accomplished.\n  In the realm of science, we have eleven remarkable young people, \nincluding Eric Sherman, from Ephrata, PA, who developed a technique \nthat allows scientists to identify potential bone marrow donors for 6 \npercent of the cost and 1 percent of the time of traditional \ntechniques. Using polymerase chain reaction and cycle sequencing, he \nsequenced the genes that determine a person's Human Leukocyte Antigen \ntype. Eric then wrote a computer program to analyze the DNA sequence \nand return possible antigen matches. This technique can potentially be \nused to identify donors for other transplantable organs, such as \nkidney, liver, and lung, creating the opportunity to save hundreds of \nlives and millions of dollars each year. Eric is 15 years old.\n  A 17-year-old young woman from Albuquerque, NM, Erika DeBenedictis \nresearched methods of identifying low-energy paths for spacecraft. By \ncarefully planning the route a spacecraft will take, it is possible to \nreduce the amount of fuel needed by utilizing the natural gravity and \nmotion of planets in the solar system. Erika developed an itinerary-\nbased algorithm to reach specified destinations, which streamlines the \nprocess of finding low-energy paths. Such orbits are particularly \nuseful for heavy spacecraft, in which self-propulsion is especially \ndifficult. Use of low-energy paths would allow these spacecraft to \nreach previously impractical destinations.\n  A 17-year-old young man from Rochester, MI, Rahul Pandey created a \nnegative index refraction lens made of metamaterials. Metamaterials \nhave the unique property to bend electromagnetic waves of a certain \nfrequency backward, so an image is possible on the opposite side of a \nlens. He modeled the energy flow of negative index materials in terms \nof lens geometry, refractive index, focal length, and source distance, \nfinding a perfectly linear relationship. Rahul's work has applications \nin stealth technology, antenna elements, radio frequency signal \nswitching, and lenses that do not adhere to the diffraction limit.\n  Aditya Palepu, from Oakton, VA, developed a pattern classification \nalgorithm that extracts linear and Gaussian relationships from raw data \nusing a bottom-up approach. Given any data set, all possible models are \ngenerated, iteratively weeded down, and refined to better fit the data. \nThis algorithm is effective on benchmark Iris data and synthetic \ndistributions, and was designed so the model library can be expanded to \nmore data sets. Aditya's work has applications in facial/object \nrecognition, data mining, trend analysis, and was used to classify a \nWashington, DC crime database revealing the clustering of criminal \nactivity. Aditya is 17 years old.\n  From Woodbury, MN, Prithwis Mukhopadhyay researched the molecular \nmechanism by which carrageenan may induce pre-malignant cell \ntransformation. Carrageenan is an FDA-approved food additive found in \ndairy products, processed meats, dog food, infant formula, and \ncosmetics. Using mammary epithelial cells, he found carrageenan reduced \nASB activity and increased sulfated sGAG, especially chondroitin \nsulfate, which induced cell migration and pre-malignant transformation. \nAt 16 years old, Prithwis' work shows how carrageenan influences breast \ncancer cell proliferation and migration.\n  Fiona Wood, from North Haven, CT, explored the brain's ability to \nperceive and measure interval time using late-spiking (LS) neurons. She \ncreated the first biophysically realistic computational model of an LS \nneuron, and used it to construct neural networks that can accurately \nand realistically encode time. For all animals, an ability to perceive \nand measure time is essential for a wide variety of tasks. Fiona's work \ncan lead to better understanding of brain diseases in which interval \ntime encoding is impaired, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and \nschizophrenia. Fiona is 17 years old.\n  A 17-year-old young man from Winston Salem, NC, Darren Zhu worked to \ndevelop more efficient data storage technologies by exploring \nnanofabrication methods for spintronics. Spintronics, or spin-based \nelectronics, are inherently more powerful than electronics, as they \nexploit electron spin and subsequently are more sensitive than \nintegrated circuit technology. He incorporated molecular self-assembled \nmonolayers, or SAMs, into spintronics and performed surface analyses to \nfind that isocyanide-based SAMs are a viable candidate for \nimplementation in nanoscale spintronics fabrication. Darren's work has \nstrong applications in nanotechnology, specifically in the field of \nnanolithography.\n  A 16-year-old young man from Addison, TX, Roman Stolyarov designed \nand produced an omnidirectional dielectric mirror for visible light \nusing a unique one-step fabrication process. The mirror is composed of \n12 ultrathin alternating layers of two chalcogenide glasses, which were \ndeposited by thermal evaporation onto a transparent silicon dioxide \nglass substrate. Simulations show that doubling the number of \nalternating layers would produce near perfect reflectivity, a \nphenomenon impossible for silvered mirrors, given their inherent losses \nin the visible spectrum. Roman's process will allow for rapid \nmanufacturing of wavelength specific mirrors with applications in radar \nfiltration and fiber technologies.\n  From Teaneck, NJ, Yael Dana Neugut studied arsenic metabolism and \nrenal function in an arsenic-exposed population in Bangladesh. She \nfound that the association between urinary excretion of arsenic \nmetabolites and creatinine is likely due to their shared metabolic \npathway, and that creatine may be an effective way to prevent and treat \nlong-term exposure to arsenic.\n\n[[Page S9550]]\n\nMore than 100 million people worldwide are chronically exposed to high \nlevels of arsenic and are at risk of serious diseases, such as cancer \nand heart disease. A randomized trial of creatine supplementation is \ncurrently underway in Bangladesh. Yael is 17 years old.\n  A 17-year-old young man from East Setauket, NY, Jason Karelis studied \nan enzyme called MenD that plays a role in the biosynthesis of a lipid \ncalled menaquinone in Staphylococcus aureus, the bacterium that causes \nstaph infections. Menaquinone is an electron carrier crucial to S. \naureus. Jason constructed a mutant strain of S. aureus with a disrupted \nMenD gene and observed its growth on media only with menaquinone added, \nevidence that MenD is vital for S. aureus. Staph infections are a major \npublic health concern and Jason's work provides a platform for a new \nclass of antibiotics.\n  From Hilo, HI, Nolan Kamitaki designed a computer simulation to \ndetermine how viral characteristics and medical supply distribution \npatterns affect an epidemic's spread across a social network. Starting \nwith a particle-based simulation to analyze basic interaction rates, he \nmoved to a small world network, modeling an epidemic's spread across a \npopulation. Nolan's findings showed that children, due to their greater \ndegree of social connection, are most useful for prevention and are the \nmost effective recipients of medical processes. Nolan is 16 years old.\n  In the area of literature, we have a young woman from North Potomac, \nMD. Amy Levine, a 16-year-old, examines the shades of gray between \nblack and white in her literature collection, Grayscale Unraveled. She \ndemonstrates how life choices that have the greatest impact initially \ndo not appear to be choices at all, but have the potential to be the \nmost transformative. Amy's portfolio explores the small yet important \nevents that determine who we are and how we live, while breaking down \nthe black and white decisions people make to show the grayscale that \ndescribes the world.\n  Also in the area of literature, we have Nicole Rhodes, a 17-year-old \nfrom Vancouver, WA, who created the portfolio The Dictionary of \nDistance to explore different facets of distance in writing. She \nconsiders the distance between a piece's narrator and characters, the \nspace between the author and the work, and the space separating \ncharacters and other elements to determine how distance alters memory. \nThrough this examination, Nicole is able to analyze the writing \nprocess, the writer's perspective, and the final written product. Her \nportfolio includes a variety of forms, styles, and subjects, united in \nthis investigation.\n  From Indianapolis, IN, Doreen Xu explores the foundation of evil in \nher philosophy portfolio, The Roots of Evil. She delves into the human \npsyche to examine several distinct sources of evil, concluding that all \nhuman evil is caused by frustrated human desire. Doreen explores this \nnewly defined dimension of evil with an enlightened perspective, \nfostering a new method of viewing evil. She hopes this will allow evil \nto be more effectively combated, leading to a more progressive and \nharmonious global society. Doreen is 16 years old.\n  The first recipient in the world of music is Melody Lindsay, from \nHonolulu, HI, who believes we celebrate mankind's best achievements \nthrough music. In her portfolio, Harping Around the World: Cultural \nLeadership for the 21st Century, she draws on her experience as a \nharpist to connect with audiences. She is particularly interested in \ninspiring young people to discover and pursue their own passion for \nclassical music. Melody, at age 17, has performed on and serves as a \nCultural Ambassador for NPR's ``From the Top'' and was a Focus on Youth \nPerformer for the ninth and tenth World Harp Congresses.\n  From La Crescenta, CA, Connie Kim-Sheng seeks to convey the insights \nof classical composers in her portfolio, Inspired by Beauty: Piano \nMasterworks. Her performance of pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, \nDebussy, and Ginastera provide musical texts that illuminate the span \nof human feeling and experience, demonstrating a multitude of complex \nharmonies. At 17 years old, Connie has performed on NPR's ``From the \nTop,'' and for audiences in Sydney, Australia; Calgary, Canada; and Los \nAngeles. Through her music, Connie hopes to encourage greater respect \nfor cooperation and pluralism in society.\n  A 13-year-old young woman from San Diego, CA, Sarina Zhang strives to \nshow the beauty and emotional value of classical music in her \nportfolio, Reaching out to the World with the Magic of Music. Through \nperformance, she strives to connect with her audience, moving them with \nthe simple truth of classical music. A pianist and cellist attending \nThe Juilliard Pre-College Division, she has been featured on NPR's \n``From the Top,'' performed at Carnegie Hall, and toured \ninternationally with the San Diego Civic Youth Orchestra.\n  For exemplary works in the category of ``Outside the Box,'' \nrecipients include Allison Ross from Mercer Island, WA. She created a \nportfolio, African and Western Heroes' Journeys in Literature: An \nExemplification. Against the backdrop of August Wilson's fiction and \nthe constructs of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Cycle, she explores the \nrelationship between classical Western and African hero mythologies. \nAllison, at 16, investigates the derivations, common motives and \ncultural differences between the two traditions offering original \nnarratives and critical analysis. Through this work, Allison hopes that \nothers will share her enthusiasm for exploring themes that unite our \nheritages.\n  And finally, in his ``Outside the Box'' project, a 15-year-old young \nman from Cupertino, CA, Anshul Samar seeks to make learning a side \neffect of fun with his project, Igniting Interest in Chemistry with \nElementeo Chemistry Card Game. In Elementeo, players battle with their \nelement army, activate reactions, create compounds, and conquer \nopponents using black holes and slippery bases. Anshul hopes that by \nintroducing young people to chemistry in a fun and interactive manner, \nthey will discover a passion for science and pursue it throughout their \nlives.\n  These brilliant young men and women are essential for the success of \ntheir generation. It is our duty to recognize, support, and nurture \ntheir progression through academia as they mature into the leaders of \ntheir generation. We should consider ourselves privileged that some of \nthe triumphs of these ingenious young minds have already born fruit. I \nwould like to thank the Davidson Institute for making such scholarships \navailable and for taking the time to seek out these worthy candidates. \nI would also like to thank each winner and applicant of the Davidson \nAward for showing to us the promise and potential your generation \nholds. We can rest assured that our future is in good hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9550-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9550-S9551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ERNIE HARWELL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the man whose voice \nwas the sound of summer, to the man who guided Michiganders through \nbaseball seasons for more than 40 years. I rise in tribute to Ernie \nHarwell.\n  For those who love baseball and the Detroit Tigers, Ernie Harwell's \neasy Georgia drawl on a summer evening has been a tonic after a hard \nday's toil. He has been our eyes and ears at the corner of Michigan and \nTrumbull and, later, at the team's new downtown ballpark. Since 1960, \nwhen Ernie broadcast his first Tigers game, until today, perhaps no \nperson, no player nor manager, has been more closely identified with \nTigers baseball. Certainly none has formed so strong an emotional tie \nwith the fans of our team.\n  Ernie grew up in Atlanta, and he often tells fans that as a boy he \nwas tongue-tied, coping with a speech impediment, but with therapy and \nhard work, he turned his voice into a tool so powerful it brought the \ngame to life. His first broadcasting job was with the minor league team \nin his hometown, but in 1948, when broadcasting legend Red Barber of \nthe Brooklyn Dodgers fell ill, Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey \ncalled down to Atlanta. He asked if he could bring up young Ernie to \nfill Barber's seat at Ebbets Field. OK, the Atlanta general manager \nreplied, but you will have to give me something in return. And so Ernie \nbecame the first and so far only broadcaster in baseball history to be \nincluded in a trade, sent to Brooklyn for a minor league catcher.\n  That was one of Branch Rickey's finest deals. In Brooklyn and then in \nBaltimore, Ernie honed his craft and won\n\n[[Page S9551]]\n\nthe admiration of fans. He was the television broadcaster for one of \nthe most famous moments in baseball history, Bobby Thompson's ``Shot \nHeard Round the World'' in 1951. The national networks began to tap his \ntalent for other events, such as pro and college football games and the \nMasters golf tournament.\n  And then, in 1960, he came to Detroit.\n  It is hard to describe to those who aren't from Michigan or fans of \nthe Tigers just what Ernie Harwell meant to us over the next five \ndecades. His voice on the radio guided us through good seasons and bad, \nthrough our city's times of prosperity and of tragedy. Through that ebb \nand flow he was a constant, his voice never too excited, never too \ndowncast. We rejoiced when he told us an opposing batter took strike \nthree ``like the house by the side of the road,'' chuckled as he \nreported a foul ball had become a souvenir for a fan from Detroit or \nHowell or Warren or Lansing, or another town Michigan fans recognized. \nIn the first days of every March, at the opening of his very first \nbroadcast of spring training, Ernie announced the official end of \nMichigan winter with a reading from the Song of Solomon:\n  ``For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers \nappear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the \nvoice of the turtle is heard in our land.''\n  But over the decades, Ernie became more to us than just a welcome \nvoice on the radio. He became a friend. For as good as he was behind \nthe microphone, he is an even better man, and the quality of his \ncharacter shone brightly, on his broadcasts and on the countless times \nhe greeted fans with a hearty hello, or treated a clubhouse attendant \nwith the same respect and affection as the million-dollar ballplayer. \nWe came to respect and honor his voice, but to cherish his great heart.\n  This beloved friend is hurting now. His illness, he tells us without \na trace of bitterness, will soon take him from us. But as he faces what \nhe calls the end of his journey, the greatness of his heart has once \nagain shined forth.\n  Last night, the Tigers took a break from the heat of another pennant \nrace to pay tribute to this legend and friend. Amid the cheers and \ntears, Ernie once again put the fans first. Here is what he said:\n  ``In my almost 92 years on this earth, the good Lord has blessed me \nwith a great journey, and the blessed part of that journey is it's \ngoing to end here in the great state of Michigan.\n  ``I deeply appreciate the great people of Michigan. I love their \ngrit. I love the way they face life. I love the family values they \nhave. And you Tiger fans are the greatest fans of all. No question \nabout that.''\n  There is an example of true courage and grace for all of us to try to \nfollow.\n  Soon, this great voice will be silenced, a great heart stilled. But \nErnie Harwell's love of the game, his humanity, his courage, will \nremain with us always. I treasure the moments I have spent with him. I \nthank him for the hours of joy he has given me, my wife and children, \nand the people of Michigan. I wish him and his beloved wife Lulu all \nthe joy they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9551-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Sergeant First Class Jared C. Monti\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will take time today not \njust to remember but to honor the sacrifice and courage of SFC Jared C. \nMonti of Raynham, MA. It is a solemn privilege to do so for a man who \nhas been awarded our Nation's highest military decoration--the Medal of \nHonor.\n  Sergeant Monti joins an elite group of Americans who have received \nthe Medal of Honor. Just 3,447 before him--all soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and airmen of uncommon courage, valor, and gallantry--have \nbeen so honored. He is the sixth to be awarded the Medal of Honor for \nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Millions of Americans have defended our Nation's liberty for more \nthan two centuries. But these 3,447 and now Sergeant Monti--risked \ntheir lives above and beyond the call of duty. And 617, like Sergeant \nMonti, gave their lives for the cause of America's freedom.\n  Our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen perform acts of bravery \nevery day. But some of those acts, like Sergeant Monti's on June 26, \n2006, exceed even our country's highest expectations.\n  During his more than 12 years in the Army, Sergeant Monti was \nrecognized by his superiors as a man with a career of unlimited \npotential ahead of him. But Sergeant Monti's final act of bravery, on \nthat fateful day in June 2006, also showed him to be a selfless leader \nwith uncommon courage.\n  Sergeant Monti was leading a patrol of 16 troops on a mountain range \nin Afghanistan when attacked by a Taliban force of more than 50 \nfighters. Sergeant Monti not only prevented the Taliban force from \noverrunning his unit but also positioned his forces to disrupt a \nflanking attempt.\n  The sergeant managed to call in air support which eventually forced \nthe enemy to retreat and prevented the patrol from being overrun \nagainst overwhelming odds.\n  When he realized one of his fellow soldiers was missing, he went \nsearching for him. He found him lying wounded and exposed in the open \nground. Sergeant Monti exposed himself to heavy enemy fire three times \ntrying to rescue the wounded soldier. On the third attempt, the \nsergeant was mortally wounded.\n  Sergeant Monti's ability to act quickly and decisively in the midst \nof enemy fire is testimony to his leadership, without which his \npatrol's casualty rate that day would have been substantially higher.\n  Courage is one of the virtues we as Americans admire most. That is \nwhy the highest military decoration--and one of the oldest--our country \nbestows on its soldiers is the Medal of Honor. It has been awarded only \nto the few possessing a special brand of courage, heroism, and \npatriotism, Americans like Sergeant Monti.\n  Sergeant Monti was an extraordinary American and an extraordinary \nsoldier, one of extraordinary gallantry. By his actions, he has taken \nhis rightful place in the revered company of our country's most \nselfless heroes.\n  By tradition, Medal of Honor winners are shown the highest respect \nwith salutes by all ranks, from the Commander in Chief on down. It is a \nfitting tradition for we stand in awe of these brave warriors. So I am \nproud to join all those saluting Sergeant Monti this day, including the \nCommander in Chief. And on behalf of a grateful nation and his home \nState of Massachusetts, we also salute his parents, Paul and Janet, and \nexpress our gratitude to them for their sacrifice which cannot be \nexpressed in words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9551-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9551-S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       COMMENDING LEONID NEVZLIN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Leonid \nNevzlin on his recent appointment to serve as international chair of \nthe United Jewish Communities UJC/ Jewish Federations of North America \n2009 General Assembly in Washington, DC, beginning on November 8 of \nthis year. Leonid's leadership in the Jewish community and his \ncommitment to so many philanthropic causes around the world make him a \nnatural for this important role. I am pleased to commend him today on \nthis honor.\n  The UJC/Jewish Federations of North America plays an extraordinary \nrole in inspiring a spirit of philanthropy and service. It has brought \nnotable energy to the Save Darfur movement and continues to promote \neffective lobbying on a broad range of social justice issues. The UJC's \nGeneral Assembly, which is held annually, is an event that brings \npeople from across North America and the world together to discuss and \nto plan the organization's important work.\n  Leonid Nevzlin has shown a steadfast commitment to human rights, \nsocial justice, and democracy in his life and philanthropic work. Born \nand educated in Russia, Leonid began his philanthropic efforts by \nestablishing the Moscow Jewish Cultural Center and worked to develop a \nnumber of Jewish educational programs that serve communities throughout \nRussia. As president of the Russian Jewish Congress, Leonid showed his \nleadership on a range of noteworthy causes, including preserving Jewish \nculture.\n  Leonid continued this service when he moved to Israel and established \na\n\n[[Page S9552]]\n\ncharitable foundation dedicated to preserving and promoting Jewish \nheritage globally. Among other initiatives, Leonid founded a research \ncenter at Hebrew University in Jerusalem that adopts a \nmultidisciplinary approach to the study of Jewish history. He has \ncarried his commitment to education and cross-cultural exchange beyond \nuniversities and continues to have a meaningful impact on Jewish \ncommunities worldwide through the Jewish People Policy Planning \nInstitute, the Birthright Israel and Masa Israel Journey Programs, and \nhis leadership in the redevelopment of Beit Hatfutsot, the Museum of \nthe Jewish People, in Tel Aviv.\n  The Torah tells us that ``Deeds of giving are the very foundation of \nthe world.'' Leonid Nevzlin has built a strong foundation for so many \nJewish communities around the world through his deeds of giving. He \ninspires us with his philanthropic and entrepreneurial spirit, and I \ncongratulate him today on a well-deserved appointment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9552-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9552-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9552-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1713.

A bill to ensure that health insurance issuers and medical \nmalpractice insurance issuers cannot engage in price fixing, bid \nrigging, or market allocations to the detriment of competition and \nconsumers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our Nation's antitrust laws exist to \nprotect consumers. These laws promote competition, which ensures that \nconsumers will pay lower prices, and receive more choices of higher \nquality products. The vast majority of the companies doing business in \nthe U.S. are subject to the Federal antitrust laws.\n  A few industries have used their influence to obtain a special, \nstatutory exemption from the antitrust laws, and the insurance industry \nis one of them. In the markets for health insurance and medical \nmalpractice insurance, patients and doctors are paying the price, as \ncosts continue to increase at an alarming rate. As the insurance \nindustry prospers behind its exemption, patients and small businesses \nsuffer. I am pleased to introduce today the Health Insurance Industry \nAntitrust Enforcement Act of 2009, which will repeal the antitrust \nexemption for health insurance and medical malpractice insurance \nproviders.\n  The health care industry is the subject of a great deal of debate. \nThere are many proposals to bring competition to health insurance \nproviders. While we are debating these solutions, we should not lose \nsight of the fact that the health insurance industry currently does not \nhave to play by the same, good-competition rules as other industries. \nThat is wrong, and this legislation corrects it.\n  The lack of affordable health insurance plagues families throughout \nour country, and the rising prices that hospitals and doctors pay for \nmedical malpractice insurance drains resources that could otherwise be \nused to improve patient care. Antitrust oversight in these industries \nwill provide consumers with the confidence that insurance companies are \noperating in a competitive marketplace.\n  There is simply no justification for health insurance and medical \nmalpractice insurance companies to be exempt from Federal laws \nprohibiting price fixing. Subjecting health and medical malpractice \ninsurance providers to the antitrust laws will enable customers to feel \nconfident that the price they are being quoted is the product of a fair \nmarketplace. This bill will prohibit the most egregious anticompetitive \nconduct--price fixing, bid rigging and market allocations--conduct that \nharms consumers and drives up health care costs.\n  In the 110th Congress, I introduced a much broader repeal of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act with Senator Lott. While Congress did not reach \nconsensus on that legislation, surely in this environment of rising \nhealth care costs, we can agree on this more narrowly tailored repeal. \nInsurers should not object to being subject to the same antitrust laws \nas everyone else. If they are operating in an appropriate way, they \nshould have nothing to fear. American families, doctors and hospitals \nrely on insurance. It is important to ensure that the prices they pay \nfor this insurance are established in a fair and competitive way.\n  I look forward to repealing the antitrust exemption in the health \ninsurance and medical malpractice insurance industries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Insurance Industry \n     Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that health \n     insurance issuers and medical malpractice insurance issuers \n     cannot engage in price fixing, bid rigging, or market \n     allocations to the detriment of competition and consumers.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing in the \n     Act of March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq., commonly known \n     as the ``McCarran-Ferguson Act'') shall be construed to \n     permit health insurance issuers (as defined in section 2791 \n     of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-91) or \n     issuers of medical malpractice insurance to engage in any \n     form of price fixing, bid rigging, or market allocations in \n     connection with the conduct of the business of providing \n     health insurance coverage (as defined in such section) or \n     coverage for medical malpractice claims or actions.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION TO ACTIVITIES OF STATE COMMISSIONS OF \n                   INSURANCE AND OTHER STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY \n                   BODIES.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall apply to the information \n     gathering and rate setting activities of any State commission \n     of insurance, or any other State regulatory entity with \n     authority to set insurance rates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mr. Nelson, of Florida):\n  1682. A bill to provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with\n\n[[Page S9557]]\n\nclear antimarket manipulation authority, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture. Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCommodities Market Manipulation Prevention Act of 2009.\n  When bad-actors like Enron and Amaranth Advisors, LLC, manipulate \ncommodities prices, it means that Americans pay more for commodities \nlike oil, gasoline, heating oil, food, and natural gas. Unfortunately, \ncurrent law does not protect our economy with a tough enough standard \nto prevent, deter, and enforce illegal market manipulation in critical \ncommodity futures markets.\n  Current law makes it very difficult for the Commodities Futures \nTrading Commission to prosecute market manipulation cases. This is \nbecause current law requires the CFTC to meet a more rigorous standard \nto prove market manipulation than other financial market regulatory \nagencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission.\n  Specifically, the Commodities Exchange Act requires the CFTC to prove \n``specific intent'' to manipulate. That is a very difficult standard to \nreach. You would have to have a pretty dumb individual to, for example, \nwrite in an e-mail that you specifically intend to manipulate prices. \nBut that's what current law currently requires the CFTC to prove.\n  In addition, CFTC case law also requires that it prove an artificial \nprice exists, that the defendant had market power to move the price, \nand that he or she actually did cause the artificial price. \nParticularly in today's complex markets, proving ``artificial price'' \ncan be a daunting task, which more often than not comes down to a \n``battle of the experts'' in court. Because these requirements are so \nonerous, the CFTC often ends up moving to a lesser charge of \n``attempted manipulation,'' which requires only proving intent and some \nact showing that intent. This is still a high standard, but is much \neasier than proving a full manipulation case.\n  As a result, Federal courts have recognized that, with the CFTC's \nweaker anti-manipulation standard, market ``manipulation cases \ngenerally have not fared well.'' In fact, the standard is so weak that \nin the CFTC's 35-year history, it has only successfully prosecuted and \nwon one single case of manipulation. That case is currently on appeal \nin Federal court.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission, on the other hand, under \nsection 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange of 1934, has a different, \neasier-to-prove manipulation standard that it has employed successfully \nfor over 75 years. Basically, the SEC does not need to prove specific \nintent, as the CFTC does. The SEC just has to prove that the defendant \nacted ``recklessly.''\n  This legislation would give the CFTC the same anti-manipulation \nstandard currently employed by the SEC. This means that the CFTC would \nbe empowered to prove a manipulation case under the same ``reckless \nconduct'' standard that the SEC, FERC, and FTC employ, in contrast to \nits current difficult-to-prove ``specific intent'' standard. That is, \nthis legislation will repeal the affirmative rule that says you are \nallowed to act recklessly in the commodity futures markets as long as \nyou have no specific intent to do harm.\n  Congress also recently granted this same authority to the FERC in \n2005 and the FTC in 2007 in legislation I wrote that carefully tracked \nsection 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to ensure the \nFERC and FTC would interpret and enforce their new market manipulation \nauthorities consistent with the SEC. This legislation also carefully \ntracks section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in part \nbecause Federal case law is clear that when the Congress uses language \nidentical to that used in another statute, Congress intended for the \ncourts and the Commission to interpret the new authority in a similar \nmanner.\n  In the words of the Supreme Court from the 1904 case of Kepner v. \nUnited States, ``when a statute uses words whose meaning under the \njudicial decisions has become well-known and well-settled, it will be \npresumed that the Legislature used such words in the sense justified by \nlong judicial sanction.'' In the 75 years since the enactment of the \nSecurities and Exchange Act 1934, a substantial body of case law has \ndeveloped over the last half century around section 10(b). This will \nprovide certainty in how this legislation will be interpreted and \napplied by the Courts and the CFTC.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court has compared this body of law to ``a \njudicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative \nacorn.'' So it's worth noting that courts have held that the SEC's \nmanipulation authority is not intended to catch sellers who take \nadvantage of the natural market forces of supply and demand; only those \nwho attempt to affect the market or prices by artificial means \nunrelated to the natural forces of supply and demand.\n  In this country, our current standard in the futures arena just isn't \nworking. It is not sufficient to fully prosecute and deter abuses in \nthe markets. We need to get the right standard to prevent, deter, and \nenforce market manipulation in these markets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish guidelines and incentives for States to \nestablish criminal arsonist and criminal bomber registries and to \nrequire the Attorney General to establish a national criminal arsonist \nand criminal bomber registry program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with \nSenator Boxer in introducing the Managing Arson Through Criminal \nHistory, MATCH, Act of 2009. This bill is a companion to a bill \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Bono Mack \nand Schiff.\n  The bill would establish Federal and State arson registries; require \nconvicted arsonists and bombers to register and update certain \nspecified information for 5 years after a first conviction, 10 years \nafter a second conviction, and for life after a third conviction; and \nauthorize grants and incentives through the Department of Justice so \nthat these registries will be operational within 3 years.\n  Southern California just went through one of the worst fire disasters \nin its history. The Station Fire destroyed 160,500 acres, destroyed \nmore than 80 homes and threatened more than 12,000 homes. Right now, \nthe fire is still burning in wilderness areas on its eastern flank in \nthe Angeles National Forest.\n  Two firefighters, Fire Captain Tedmund ``Ted'' Hall, 47, of San \nBernardino County, and Firefighter Specialist Arnaldo ``Arnie'' \nQuinones, 34, of Palmdale, served with dedication and courage. They \nwere killed August 30th when their truck slipped off a winding dirt \nroad high in the Angeles National Forest. Officials believe the truck \nmight have been overrun by flames from the wildfire.\n  Though the incident is still under investigation, officials believe \nthat Hall and Quinones may have ordered dozens of people to seek \nshelter while they fought through active flames to search for an escape \nroute.\n  There is no doubt that the Station Fire, the largest wildfire in the \nhistory of Los Angeles County, was the result of arson after \ninvestigators examined forensic evidence from scorched landscape off \nAngeles Crest Highway. The spot is believed to be the source of origin \nof the Station fire and investigators have found incendiary material \nnear the site.\n  This was a disaster of massive proportions--preliminary estimates \nindicate that these fires will cost $100 million. In these tough \neconomic times, this cost and its effect on the economy of California \nis enormous and will have an impact for years to come.\n  Although the Federal Government may foot 80 to 90 percent of the bill \nfor fighting the fire, which broke out in national parkland, the \nstate's share will hit at a time when California is in the grip of a \nfiscal crisis.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the first or last time that a wildfire in \nCalifornia is started by an arsonist. It doesn't need to be that way. \nThe bill that I introduce today--the MATCH Act would assist fire \ninvestigators and law enforcement officials by giving them up-to-date \ninformation on potential arsonists and bombers.\n  The bill would require convicted arsonists and bombers to register \nand regularly update their personal information in a new arsonist \nregistry. In the future this will allow law enforcement and fire \ninvestigators to have an accessible database they can use to either \nfind or rule out people of interest.\n  This will allow them to more easily complete their investigations, \nfind the person responsible, and ensure that more wildfires won't get \nstarted intentionally.\n  This bill represents common-sense legislation that will help law \nenforcement officers do their jobs. Hundreds of firefighters worked on \ncontrolling the Station Fire. We owe it to these brave men and women \nwho put their lives on the line--and others like them who will do so in \nthe future--to give fire investigators this important new tool, so they \ncan help bring arsonists and bombers to justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to place reasonable safeguards on the use of \nsurveillance and other authorities under the USA PATRIOT Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nJudicious Use of Surveillance Tools In Counterterrorism Efforts, or \nJUSTICE, Act of 2009. I have had the privilege of working closely on \nthis bill with Senator Durbin, as I have on so many of these issues \nover the years, and I welcome the support of Senators Tester, Tom \nUdall, Bingaman, Sanders, Akaka and Wyden. I am also pleased that the \nbill has the support of organizations and activists across the \npolitical spectrum, from former Republican Congressman Bob Barr to the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union to the American Library Association.\n  At the end of this year, three provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act will \nsunset unless Congress acts to reauthorize them. In my view, Congress \nshould take this opportunity to revisit not just those three \nprovisions, but rather a broad range of surveillance laws enacted in \nrecent years to assess what additional safeguards are needed.\n  The JUSTICE Act does just that: It takes a comprehensive approach to \nfixing the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act, once and for all. \nIt permits the government to conduct necessary surveillance, but within \na framework of accountability and oversight. It ensures both that our \ngovernment has the tools to keep us safe, and that the privacy and \ncivil liberties of innocent Americans will be protected. Because we can \nand must do both. These are not mutually exclusive goals.\n  Indeed, the Department of Justice just this week acknowledged as much \nin a letter setting forth its views on Patriot Act reauthorization. The \nDepartment said: ``We also are aware that Members of Congress may \npropose modifications to provide additional protection for the privacy \nof law abiding Americans. As President Obama said in his speech at the \nNational Archives on May 21, 2009, `We are indeed at war with al Qaeda \nand its affiliates. We do need to update our institutions to deal with \nthis threat. But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule \nof law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability.' \nTherefore, the Administration is willing to consider such ideas, \nprovided\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\nthat they do not undermine the effectiveness of these important \nauthorities.''\n  I welcome the administration's openness to potential reforms of the \nPatriot Act and look forward to working together as the reauthorization \nprocess moves forward this fall.\n  But I remain concerned that critical information about the \nimplementation of the Patriot Act has not been made public--information \nthat I believe would have a significant impact on the debate. During \nthe debate on the Protect America Act and the FISA Amendments Acts in \n2007 and 2008, critical legal and factual information remained unknown \nto the public and to most members of Congress--information that was \ncertainly relevant to the debate and might even have made a difference \nin votes. And during the last Patriot Act reauthorization debate in \n2005, a great deal of implementation information remained classified. \nThis time around, we must find a way to have an open and honest debate \nabout the nature of these government powers, while protecting national \nsecurity secrets.\n  As a first step, the Justice Department's letter made public for the \nfirst time that the so-called ``lone wolf'' authority--one of the three \nexpiring provisions--has never been used. That was a good start, since \nthis is a key fact as we consider whether to extend that power. But \nthere also is information about the use of Section 215 orders that I \nbelieve Congress and the American people deserve to know. I do not \nunderestimate the importance of protecting our national security \nsecrets. But before we decide whether and in what form to extend these \nauthorities, Congress and the American people deserve to know at least \nbasic information about how they have been used. So I hope that the \nadministration will consider seriously making public some additional \nbasic information, particularly with respect to the use of Section 215 \norders.\n  There can be no question that statutory changes to our surveillance \nlaws are necessary. Since the Patriot Act was first passed in 2001, we \nhave learned important lessons, and perhaps the most important of all \nis that Congress cannot grant the government overly broad authorities \nand just keep its fingers crossed that they won't be misused. Congress \nhas the responsibility to put appropriate limits on government \nauthorities--limits that allow agents to actively pursue criminals, \nterrorists and spies, but that also protect the privacy of innocent \nAmericans.\n  This lesson was most clear in the context of National Security \nLetters. In reports issued in 2007 and 2008, the Department of Justice \nInspector General carefully documented rampant misuse and abuse of the \nNational Security Letter, NSL, authority by the FBI. The Inspector \nGeneral found--as he put it--``widespread and serious misuse of the \nFBI's national security letter authorities. In many instances, the \nFBI's misuse of national security letters violated NSL statutes, \nAttorney General Guidelines, or the FBI's own internal policies.'' \nAfter those Inspector General reports, there can no longer be any doubt \nthat granting overbroad authority leads to abuses. The FBI's apparently \nlax attitude and in some cases grave misuse of these potentially very \nintrusive authorities is attributable in no small part to the USA \nPATRIOT Act. That flawed legislation greatly expanded the NSL \nauthorities, essentially granting the FBI a blank check to obtain some \nvery sensitive records about Americans, including people not under any \nsuspicion of wrong-doing, without judicial approval. Congress gave the \nFBI very few rules to follow, and failed to adequately remedy those \nshortcomings when it considered the NSL statutes as part of the Patriot \nAct reauthorization process in 2005.\n  The JUSTICE Act, like the bipartisan National Security Letter Reform \nAct that I introduced in the 110th Congress, would finally provide the \nstatutory safeguards needed to protect against abuse of NSLs. And it \nwould remedy First Amendment violations in the NSL statutes that were \nidentified last year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit, in a decision where Justice Sotomayor participated on the \npanel.\n  Specifically, the JUSTICE Act restricts the types of records that can \nbe obtained without a court order to those that are the least sensitive \nand private, and it ensures that the FBI can only use NSLs to obtain \ninformation about individuals with some nexus to a suspected terrorist \nor spy. It makes sure that the FBI can no longer obtain the sensitive \nrecords of individuals three or four times removed from a suspect, most \nof whom would be entirely innocent. It follows the road map laid out by \nthe Second Circuit to make sure the gag orders that accompany NSLs do \nnot violate the First Amendment.\n  It prevents the use of so-called ``exigent letters,'' which the IG \nfound the FBI was using in violation of the NSL statutes. It requires \nadditional congressional reporting on NSLs, and it requires the FBI to \nestablish a compliance program and tracking database for NSLs. And it \nrequires the Attorney General to issue minimization procedures for \ninformation obtained through NSLs, so that information obtained about \nAmericans is subject to enhanced protections and the FBI does not \nretain information obtained in error.\n  The JUSTICE Act also fixes Section 215, one of the most controversial \nprovisions of the Patriot Act and one of the three that is subject to \nthe 2009 sunset. This provision permits the government to obtain court \norders for Americans' business records under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act; it is often referred to as the ``library'' provision, \nalthough it covers all types of business records.\n  On Section 215, the legislation establishes a standard of \nindividualized suspicion for obtaining a FISA business records order, \nrequiring that the government be able to demonstrate the records have \nsome nexus to terrorism or espionage, and it creates procedural \nprotections to prevent abuses. The bill also ensures robust, meaningful \nand constitutionally sound judicial review of both National Security \nLetters and Section 215 business records orders, and the gag orders \nthat accompany them.\n  The bill also ensures that Americans can feel safe in their homes by \nplacing reasonable checks on the so-called ``sneak and peek'' search \nwarrant provision of the Patriot Act. It would eliminate the overbroad \ncatch-all provision that allows these searches to be used in virtually \nany criminal case, and it would shorten the presumptive time limits for \nnotification that the search occurred. It also would create a statutory \nexclusionary rule, in recognition of the strong Fourth Amendment \ninterests at stake with regard to this extraordinary exception to the \nusual requirement that law enforcement knock and announce themselves \nbefore executing a search warrant.\n  The JUSTICE Act also includes a number of reasonable safeguards to \nprotect Americans' private communications. It permits the FBI to use \nroving wiretaps under FISA, but provides safeguards to protect innocent \nAmericans from unnecessary surveillance. It ensures that the FBI does \nnot obtain sensitive information about Americans' Internet usage \nwithout satisfying an appropriate standard, and subjects those \nauthorities, called ``pen registers and trap and trace devices'', to \nnew procedural checks. It provides new safeguards for the Patriot Act \nprovision on computer trespass, which allows computer owners who are \nsubject to hacking to give the government permission to monitor \nindividuals on their systems without a warrant.\n  The bill also addresses the FISA Amendments Act, FAA, which granted \nthe government new, over-expansive surveillance authorities and \nprovided immunity to any companies that cooperated with the blatantly \nillegal warrantless wiretapping program that went on for more than five \nyears--and that the prior administration repeatedly misled Congress \nabout. That legislation became law last year over my strong objection, \nbut it is not too late for Congress to fix it.\n  I offered several amendments to the FISA Amendments Act on the Senate \nfloor--amendments that would have helped to make sure that the privacy \nof Americans' communications are properly protected. And now those \namendments are part of the JUSTICE Act.\n  First, the bill would ensure that the FISA Amendments Act cannot be \nused to authorize the government to collect the content of all \ncommunications between the U.S. and the rest of the world. Under the \nFAA, millions upon millions of communications between\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\ninnocent Americans and their friends, families, or business associates \noverseas could legally be collected, with absolutely no suspicion of \nany wrongdoing. The JUSTICE Act would ensure such bulk collection will \nnever occur.\n  Second, the JUSTICE Act would include a meaningful prohibition on the \npractice of reverse targeting--namely, wiretapping a person overseas \nwhen what the government is really interested in is listening to an \nAmerican here at home with whom the foreigner is communicating. It \nwould do so by requiring the government to obtain a court order \nwhenever a significant purpose of the surveillance is to acquire the \ncommunications of an American in the U.S.\n  Third, the bill would create potential consequences if the government \ninitiates surveillance under the FAA using procedures that have not \nbeen approved by the FISA Court, and the FISA Court later finds that \nthose procedures were unlawful. Say, for example, the FISA Court \ndetermines that the procedures were not even reasonably designed to \nwiretap foreigners outside the U.S., rather than Americans here at \nhome. Under the bill, the FISA Court would have the discretion to place \nlimits on how the illegally obtained information on Americans can be \nretained and used.\n  Fourth, this bill includes a provision that will help protect the \nprivacy of Americans whose international communications will be \ncollected in vast new quantities. On the Senate floor last year, I \njoined with Senator Webb and Senator Tester to offer an amendment to \nprovide real protections for the privacy of Americans, while also \ngiving the government the flexibility it needs to wiretap terrorists \noverseas. And that amendment is in this bill.\n  And finally with respect to the FAA, the bill would repeal the grant \nof immunity to any companies that participated in the illegal NSA \nwiretapping program. Senator Dodd was a leader on this during debate on \nthe FAA and deserves a great deal of credit for drawing attention to \nthis issue. Granting immunity seriously undercut our statutory scheme, \nwhich relies on both the government and the private sector to follow \nthe law in implementing surveillance techniques. That is exactly why \nthe surveillance laws have long provided liability protection for \ncompanies that cooperate with a government request for assistance, as \nlong as they receive either a court order or a certification from the \nAttorney General that no court order is needed and the request meets \nall statutory requirements. But if requests are not properly \ndocumented, companies are supposed to refuse the government's request, \nand they are subject to liability if they instead decide to cooperate.\n  This framework, which has been in place for 30 years, protects \ncompanies that comply with legitimate government requests while also \nprotecting the privacy of Americans' communications from illegitimate \nsnooping. Granting companies that allegedly cooperated with an illegal \nprogram the retroactive immunity that was in the FAA undermines the law \nthat has been on the books for decades--a law that was designed to \nprevent exactly the type of abuses that occurred. Repealing that \nprovision helps bolster the statutory framework that has for so long \nhelped to protect the privacy of Americans' communications.\n  The JUSTICE Act also provides additional congressional and judicial \noversight of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It ensures that \nthe FBI provides some limited public reporting regarding its secret \nintelligence surveillance authority under FISA. It would give courts \nmore authority to oversee the process for determining whether and how \ncriminal defendants against whom FISA-derived evidence is being used \nshould get access to the underlying applications and orders so they can \nmount a challenge.\n  The last title of the bill simply ensures that the law labels as \nterrorists only those people who truly wish to do this country harm--\nnot domestic protesters who engage in civil disobedience or people who \nprovide humanitarian assistance.\n  These concerns are not new. ``Sneak and peek'' searches, the need for \nreasonable limits on the FBI's use of roving wiretaps, access to \nbusiness records, and the overly expansive computer trespass authority \nwere all issues I first raised in the fall of 2001 as some of the \nreasons why I believed the PATRIOT Act was flawed and threatened \nfundamental constitutional rights and protections. Eight years later, \nit is time to finally get this right. Again and again, the previous \nadministration requested and the Congress provided vast new \nsurveillance authorities with minimal checks and balances. Many of \nthese new tools were appropriate, and passage of this bill would leave \nin place surveillance authorities that are dramatically broader than \nwhat existed prior to 9/11. But what has been missing--what this bill \nfinally provides--is the assurances that these new authorities are \ntailored to our national security needs and subject to proper \noversight. Every single one of the changes in this bill is reasonable, \nmeasured and justifiable. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1688. A bill to prevent congressional reapportionment distortions \nby requiring that, in the questionnaires used in the taking of any \ndecennial census of population, a checkbox or other similar option be \nincluded for respondents to indicate citizenship status or lawful \npresence in the United States; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthis important legislation, The Fairness in Representation Act, with my \ncolleagues Senators Enzi and Bunning. Next year's decennial census will \nbe an enormous and expensive effort to complete the constitutionally \nmandated ``actual enumeration.'' I am proud of our Census department \nand the many people around the nation that will work together to \nproduce what we hope and expect will be a fair and accurate census.\n  Unfortunately, current 2010 Census questionnaires lack a critical \nquestion: Are you a U.S citizen? How are we to accurately apportion \nrepresentation in the House of Representatives and the Electoral \nCollege when no count of legal residents exists? Article 1 Section 2 of \nthe U.S. Constitution mandates that a census be taken every 10 years \nexpressly for the purpose of apportioning seats in the House of \nRepresentatives. However apportionment is based on each State's total \npopulation--including illegal aliens--relative to the rest of the \ncountry. Currently our census doesn't give us a count of the legal \nresidents of this country. In the 1964 Supreme Court ruling, Wesberry \nv. Sanders the Court states that ``The House of Representatives, the \n[Constitutional] Convention agreed, was to represent the people as \nindividuals and on a basis of complete equality for each voter.'' By \ncounting citizens, legal residents and illegals alike, we are in effect \neroding the power of the vote of those citizens who live in areas with \nfewer non-citizens. The large number of non-citizens in a district \nerases the principle of ``one man, one vote'' because it takes fewer \nvotes to be elected to Congress.\n  The political costs of this broken system are great. I have drafted \nthis legislation to require the decennial census to include a question \nregarding citizenship. The legislation will further direct the census \nto make such adjustments in the total population figures as may be \nnecessary, in order that those who are not U.S. citizens or are not \nlawfully present in the U.S. are not counted in tabulating population \nfor the purposes of apportionment. Apportionment of congressional seats \nand the Electoral College will be based on the legal population, rather \nthan unfairly advantaging those communities with high illegal \npopulations. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will \ncorrect an inexcusable error and return our representation system to \nits constitutional roots.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Udall, of New Mexico):\n  S. 1689. A bill to designate certain land as components of the \nNational Wilderness Preservation System and the National Landscape \nConservation System in the State of New Mexico, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with my \ncolleague\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\nSenator Tom Udall to introduce the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks \nWilderness Act. This legislation will designate approximately 259,000 \nacres of wilderness in Dona Ana County, including the iconic Organ \nMountains that overlook the City of Las Cruces. The legislation will \nalso establish two Conservation Areas in Dona Ana County--the 86,600-\nacre Organ Mountains National Conservation Area on the east side of Las \nCruces, and the 75,600-acre Desert Peaks National Conservation Area to \nthe west, which adjoins the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument to \nits south.\n  The Organ Mountains are among the many scenic landscapes in Dona Ana \nCounty that define Southern New Mexico and the rich culture of its \npeople. In addition to protecting the viewshed of the Organ Mountains \nfrom future development, this proposal seeks to preserve other \nimportant landscapes such as the Dana Ana Mountains, Robledo Mountains, \nand the ancient volcanic cinder cones and grasslands of the Potrillo \nMountains. Many visitors also come to explore the caves, limestone \ncliffs, and winding canyons of the proposed Desert Peaks National \nConservation Area.\n  While the public lands protected by this bill are important for their \nscenic and recreational values, they also represent a valuable economic \nresource for county residents, through ranching, hunting, and tourism \nthat takes place here. This proposal will preserve healthy habitat for \ngame and sensitive species; quality grazing land; and cultural \nresources like petroglyphs and historical features. Even those who may \nnever visit these areas will benefit from their protection by consuming \nthe clean water that these major watersheds provide to the people \nliving in the valleys below.\n  This proposal is the culmination of over 2 years of consensus \nbuilding accomplished by listening to input from a broad spectrum of \nthe community. As a result, the proposal that has been developed meets \nthe goals of conserving our treasured landscapes in Dona Ana County \nwhile addressing the valid concerns raised by frequent users of our \npublic lands. I would like to take a moment to mention a couple of \nimportant changes we have made to the bill based on the input we \nreceived from the community to address both border security concerns as \nwell as access issues for the ranchers who graze cattle in the region.\n  Dona Ana County shares its southern border with Mexico, and national \nsecurity issues are always an important factor to consider in any \nlegislation that involves border counties. For example, currently the \nWest Potrillo Mountains Wilderness Study Area comes as close as a half \nmile in some places from the U.S.-Mexico border, which has created \nchallenges for both the Department of Interior and the Department of \nHomeland Security to meet the goals of their distinct, yet equally \nimportant missions. This legislation seeks to provide additional \nflexibility for Customs and Border Patrol to accomplish its mission of \nborder enforcement by releasing from Wilderness Study Area status more \nthan 16,000 acres along the southern border. By assisting Border Patrol \nwith its mission, the Bureau of Land Management will be better suited \nto meet its goals of natural resource protection as well.\n  With regard to ranching, access to water infrastructure is critical \nin the hot climate of southern New Mexico. To this end, we worked \nclosely with all grazing permittees in the area to ensure all roads \nthat lead to water improvements, like windmills, solar wells, water \ntroughs and pipelines, were excluded from new wilderness areas. Other \nmajor infrastructure, like corrals, have also been excluded, and the \ncongressional grazing guidelines that are referred to in this \nlegislation will provide ranchers with the ability to use motorized \nvehicles to maintain stock ponds, fences, and other improvements in \nwilderness areas and to respond to emergencies. It is my belief that \nthis approach will allow for the protection of these public lands while \nensuring that ranching will continue.\n  My constituents in Dona Ana County have long expressed their desire \nto strike a balance between development and the preservation of the \npublic lands that they grew up enjoying or that attracted them to the \narea in the first place. As such, this proposal is supported by a wide \narray of constituencies ranging from conservation and sportsmen's \ngroups, city and county officials, to the Hispano Chamber of Commerce. \nWith enactment of this bill, it is my hope that while Dona Ana County \ncontinues to prosper and grow, our unique places will be protected for \ngenerations to come. I am pleased that Senator Udall has cosponsored \nthis bill, and I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1689\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n         There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bingaman \nin introducing Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Wilderness Act. The bill \ncelebrates and preserves a portion of the unique and delicate landscape \nof southern New Mexico. Wilderness and conservation areas in Dona Ana \nand Luna Counties will protect a vast number of archeological sites and \nriparian areas, maintain habitat and migration corridors for wildlife, \nand preserve some of the only Chihuahuan Desert in the United States.\n  Set in the heart of Dona Ana County, Las Cruces is New Mexico's \nsecond largest city, and growing. The citizens of Las Cruces and the \nsurrounding communities want to ensure that the area will continue to \ndevelop in a way that preserves the surrounding pristine landscapes \nincluding the iconic Organ Mountains. The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks \nWilderness Act is consistent with the city and County's long-term \ngrowth plan, and will act to maintain growth patterns in a way that \nwill allow all citizens to enjoy the impressive views and landscapes \nsurrounding Las Cruces.\n  The Organ Mountains Wilderness and NCA, just one portion of this \ncomprehensive legislation, will keep these impressive peaks available \nfor the enjoyment of southern New Mexicans, and all who visit the area. \nThis mountain range is strikingly unique and gives great character and \nidentity to other surrounding landscape and to the city of Las Cruces \nitself. A vast range of individual and public and private organizations \ncame together to work on the protection of the Organ Mountains and the \nseven other wilderness areas included in the bill. Hunters, anglers and \nconservationists worked with ranchers and city and county officials to \ndetermine what areas were in greatest need of protection. Nearby \nmilitary facilities worked with the Bureau of Land Management on land \nexchanges that are reflected in the bill and will benefit the public \nand military entities. Recommendations from the Border Patrol on how to \nensure that the new wilderness fit into their homeland security efforts \nwere incorporated into the bill. Years of negotiation and cooperation \nhave resulted in the legislation being introduced today.\n  In total, the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Wilderness Act will \nprotect 421,344 acres of desert landscape including 162,270 acres of \nNational Conservation Area, and 259,071 acres of Wilderness Area. This \narea of rare and beautiful landscapes will be valued for generations. \nFrom the jagged basalt lava flows of the Cinder Cone Wilderness to the \nroaming hawks and scrambling javelinas of the Robledo Mountains, this \nunique piece of southern New Mexico has abundant natural value for its \ncitizens.\n  With this legislation, we build upon the work of conservation greats \nlike Aldo Leopold, a man who saw the beauty of New Mexico's untamed \nwilderness lands and sought to preserve them for future generations. It \nwas Mr. Leopold who said, ``Conservation is a state of harmony between \nmen and land.'' With the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Wilderness Act, \nwe move a step closer to achieving that state of perfect harmony. I \nthank Senator Bingaman for his work to preserve this landscape and urge \nmy colleagues to support this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9567-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9567-S9568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 273--COMMEMORATING DR.

Borlaug was born on March 25, 1914, \n     of Norwegian parents on a farm in Cresco, Iowa, and was \n     educated in a 1-room school house throughout grades 1 through \n     8;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug attended the University of Minnesota, \n     where he earned a Ph.D. degree in Plant Pathology;\n       Whereas, beginning in 1944, Dr. Borlaug spent 2 decades in \n     rural Mexico working to assist the poorest farmers through a \n     pioneering Rockefeller Foundation program;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug's research and innovative ``shuttle \n     breeding'' in Mexico enabled him to develop a new approach to \n     agriculture and a new disease-resistant variety of wheat with \n     triple the output of grain;\n       Whereas this breakthrough achievement in plant production \n     enabled Mexico to become self-sufficient in wheat by 1956, \n     and concurrently raised the living standard for thousands of \n     poor Mexican farmers;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug was asked by the United Nations to \n     travel to India and Pakistan in the 1960s, as South-Asia and \n     the Middle East faced an imminent widespread famine, where he \n     eventually helped convince those 2 warring governments to \n     adopt his new seeds and new approach to agriculture to \n     address this critical problem;\n       Whereas, Dr. Borlaug brought miracle wheat to India and \n     Pakistan, which helped both countries become self-sufficient \n     in wheat production, thus saving hundreds of millions of \n     people from hunger, famine, and death;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug and his team trained young scientists \n     from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and \n     Afghanistan in this same new approach to agriculture, which \n     introduced new seeds but also put emphasis on the use of \n     fertilizer and irrigation, thus increasing yields \n     significantly in those countries as well;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug's approach to wheat was adapted by \n     research scientists working in rice, which spread the Green \n     Revolution to Asia, feeding and saving millions of people \n     from hunger and starvation;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1970 as the ``Father of the Green Revolution'' and is only 1 \n     of 5 people to have ever received the Nobel Peace Prize, \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug headed the Sasakawa Global 2000 program \n     to bring the Green Revolution to 10 countries in Africa, and \n     traveled the world to educate the next generation of \n     scientists on the importance of producing new breakthrough \n     achievements in food production;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug tirelessly promoted the potential that \n     biotechnology offers for feeding the world, while also \n     preserving biodiversity, in the 21st century when the global \n     population is projected to rise to 9,000,000,000 people;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug continued his role as an educator as a \n     Distinguished Professor at Texas A University, while also \n     working at the International Center for the Improvement of \n     Wheat and Maize in Mexico;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug founded the World Food Prize, called by \n     several world leaders ``The Nobel Prize for Food and \n     Agriculture'', which is awarded in Iowa each October so as to \n     recognize and inspire Nobel-like achievements in increasing \n     the quality, quantity, and availability of food in the world;\n       Whereas the Senate designated October 16 as World Food \n     Prize Day in America in honor of Dr. Borlaug; and\n       Whereas it is written of Dr. Borlaug that throughout all of \n     his work he saved 1,000,000,000 lives, thus making him widely \n     known as saving more lives than any other person in human \n     history: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate has received with profound sorrow and deep \n     regret the announcement of the passing of Dr. Norman Borlaug; \n     and\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\n       (2) the Senate directs the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of \n     the deceased.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9568-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 274--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF PEACE DAY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Harkin) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Borlaug was born on March 25, 1914, \n     of Norwegian parents on a farm in Cresco, Iowa, and was \n     educated in a 1-room school house throughout grades 1 through \n     8;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug attended the University of Minnesota, \n     where he earned a Ph.D. degree in Plant Pathology;\n       Whereas, beginning in 1944, Dr. Borlaug spent 2 decades in \n     rural Mexico working to assist the poorest farmers through a \n     pioneering Rockefeller Foundation program;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug's research and innovative ``shuttle \n     breeding'' in Mexico enabled him to develop a new approach to \n     agriculture and a new disease-resistant variety of wheat with \n     triple the output of grain;\n       Whereas this breakthrough achievement in plant production \n     enabled Mexico to become self-sufficient in wheat by 1956, \n     and concurrently raised the living standard for thousands of \n     poor Mexican farmers;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug was asked by the United Nations to \n     travel to India and Pakistan in the 1960s, as South-Asia and \n     the Middle East faced an imminent widespread famine, where he \n     eventually helped convince those 2 warring governments to \n     adopt his new seeds and new approach to agriculture to \n     address this critical problem;\n       Whereas, Dr. Borlaug brought miracle wheat to India and \n     Pakistan, which helped both countries become self-sufficient \n     in wheat production, thus saving hundreds of millions of \n     people from hunger, famine, and death;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug and his team trained young scientists \n     from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and \n     Afghanistan in this same new approach to agriculture, which \n     introduced new seeds but also put emphasis on the use of \n     fertilizer and irrigation, thus increasing yields \n     significantly in those countries as well;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug's approach to wheat was adapted by \n     research scientists working in rice, which spread the Green \n     Revolution to Asia, feeding and saving millions of people \n     from hunger and starvation;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1970 as the ``Father of the Green Revolution'' and is only 1 \n     of 5 people to have ever received the Nobel Peace Prize, \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug headed the Sasakawa Global 2000 program \n     to bring the Green Revolution to 10 countries in Africa, and \n     traveled the world to educate the next generation of \n     scientists on the importance of producing new breakthrough \n     achievements in food production;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug tirelessly promoted the potential that \n     biotechnology offers for feeding the world, while also \n     preserving biodiversity, in the 21st century when the global \n     population is projected to rise to 9,000,000,000 people;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug continued his role as an educator as a \n     Distinguished Professor at Texas A University, while also \n     working at the International Center for the Improvement of \n     Wheat and Maize in Mexico;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug founded the World Food Prize, called by \n     several world leaders ``The Nobel Prize for Food and \n     Agriculture'', which is awarded in Iowa each October so as to \n     recognize and inspire Nobel-like achievements in increasing \n     the quality, quantity, and availability of food in the world;\n       Whereas the Senate designated October 16 as World Food \n     Prize Day in America in honor of Dr. Borlaug; and\n       Whereas it is written of Dr. Borlaug that throughout all of \n     his work he saved 1,000,000,000 lives, thus making him widely \n     known as saving more lives than any other person in human \n     history: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate has received with profound sorrow and deep \n     regret the announcement of the passing of Dr. Norman Borlaug; \n     and\n       (2) the Senate directs the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of \n     the deceased.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9571-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9571-S9572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PEACE DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

In fact, as his going away gift to me, my friend \nJack, who was right down here, before he retired gave me a dog chain as \na souvenir. I kept it in my desk here for years. But sometimes things \ntake a long time to get worked out. It may not seem like much, but it \ntook a long time to get this done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/17/senate-section/article/S9572-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF ERROLL SOUTHERS\n\n  Mr. REID.
