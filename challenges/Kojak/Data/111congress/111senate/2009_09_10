KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. REID. ``A freshmen Senator should be seen, not heard; should \nlearn, and not teach.''\n  Mr. President, that is a quote from Senator Ted Kennedy. These are \nthe very first words he spoke on the floor of this Chamber. He was \nhesitant to rise and speak that April day when he said those words. He \nhad been a Senator for less than 18 months. The country was still \nreeling from President Kennedy's death just months before.\n  But the question before the Senate was the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nand Senator Kennedy knew he could hold his tongue no longer.\n  He rose to speak because he loved his country. He waited as long as \nhe did to give that maiden speech because he loved this institution. In \nthat speech, he said a Senator of his stature at the time should be \nseen and not heard. But 45 years later, we can still hear his great \nbooming voice. He said young Senators should learn and not teach. But \nwho can list all we learned from his leadership?\n  It was a thrill to work with Ted Kennedy personally. He was a friend, \nthe model of public service, and an American icon. He was a patriarch \nof both the Kennedy family and the Senate family. Together, we mourn \nhis loss.\n  At so many difficult times in their family's history, the Kennedys \nhave turned to their Uncle Teddy for comfort. At so many critical times \nin our country's history, America has turned to Ted Kennedy for the \nsame.\n  We can all remember how he walked solemnly with the grieving First \nLady at Arlington National Cemetery. We can remember how his deep love \nfor his brother helped him somehow summon the strength to deliver a \ndefining eulogy in New York. We can all remember how, as patriarch, he \nmemorialized his nephew off the shores of Massachusetts.\n\n  For decades, Ted Kennedy was a rock to his family. The impact he has \netched\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\ninto our history will long endure. It is now left to us to remember the \nman who helped remember the lives of so many others. He was a very \nfamous man. If you take the subway, people would always come up to \nSenator Kennedy. I would joke with him, ``Ted, are they coming for me \nor for you?'' It was obvious whom they were coming for. It was a joke.\n  Ted was so good. When he thought you did something well, he would \ndrop you a note or give you a call. It meant a lot to me that he would \ntake the time to do that. I have come to learn since his death that he \ndid that for so many people. You didn't have to be a Senator. He would \ndo that for anybody whom he thought deserved a pat on the back. It is \nup to us to celebrate a Senator who helped so many live better lives.\n  I have long been a devotee of the Kennedys and an admirer of their \nservice to our Nation. As a student at Utah State University, I founded \nthe first Young Democrats Club--in that bastion of Republicanism. I \nworked for President Kennedy's election in 1960.\n  A week before President Kennedy took the oath of office and implored \nus to ask what we can do for our country, John Kennedy sent me a \npersonal letter of thanks. He had won the election, but he had not yet \nbeen inaugurated.\n  That letter still hangs at the doorway of my Capitol office, just a \nfew feet off the Senate floor, where the three youngest Kennedy \nbrothers ably served. That letter he sent me was for the work I did out \nWest for that campaign.\n  Many times, Ted would come to my office, and he would stop and look \nat that letter. He would always say, ``That's his signature,'' \nindicating that some staff hadn't signed it or some machine hadn't \nsigned it. He was proud that his brother had done what he learned from \nhis brother to do--send these very meaningful letters. He was proud of \nhis brother. He was proud of his own work in the Western States during \nthe 1960 race and proud that I kept that memento in such a prominent \nplace.\n  President-elect Kennedy's letter was short, but it overflowed with \noptimism. He wrote to me that the incoming era would allow us to ``make \nour country an even better place for our citizens to live, as well as \nto strengthen our country's position of leadership in the world.'' \nThink how I felt getting that letter. I was still a student.\n  Ted Kennedy shared the dream his brother had, and he never stopped \nworking to realize it.\n  Ted Kennedy's legacy stands with the greatest, the most devoted, the \nmost patriotic men and women to ever serve in these Halls. Because of \nTed Kennedy, more young children could afford to become healthy. \nBecause of Ted Kennedy, more young adults could afford to become \ncollege students. Because of Ted Kennedy, more of our oldest and \npoorest citizens could get the care they need to live longer, fuller \nlives. Because of Ted Kennedy, more minorities, women, and immigrants \ncould realize the rights our founding documents promised them. Because \nof him, more Americans could be proud of their country.\n  Ted Kennedy came from a family of great wealth and status. He didn't \nneed to work hard for himself. So he chose a life of working hard for \nothers. When he was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1959, the \napplication asked him to state his main ambition. Ted Kennedy answered: \n``The public service of this State.''\n  To quote one of his favorite poems--the Robert Frost verses that now \nrest on his desk on the Senate floor--that has made all the difference.\n  Ted Kennedy's America was one in which all could pursue justice, \nenjoy equality, and know freedom. That is Ted Kennedy.\n  Ted's life was driven by his love of a family who loved him and his \nbelief in a country that believed in him. Ted's dream was the one for \nwhich the Founding Fathers fought and which his brothers sought to \nrealize.\n  The liberal lion's mighty roar may now fall silent, but his dream \nshall never die. One of his older brothers was killed in World War II. \nHe was a pilot going into a mission, and he recognized going into it he \nwould probably never come back. His other brother--the President--was \nassassinated. His other brother, as a Senator running for President, \nwas assassinated.\n  Again, Senator Kennedy's dream shall never die.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, would like to speak of our \ndeparted colleague, Ted Kennedy, whose passing last month focused the \nattention of the Nation and whose extraordinary life has been \nmemorialized over these past weeks in so many poignant stories and \nheartfelt expressions of gratitude and grief.\n  Today, the Senate also grieves--not only because he was a friend but \nbecause the Senate was so much a part of who he was and because he \nbecame so much a part of the Senate.\n  The simplest measure is sheer longevity. At the time of his death, \nTed could call himself the third longest-serving Senator in history, \nhaving served almost one-fifth of the time the Senate itself has \nexisted. Or consider this: When I was an intern here in the sixties, \nTed was already a well-known Senator. When I was elected to the Senate \nnearly a quarter of a century ago, Ted had already been here for nearly \na quarter of a century. He served with 10 Presidents or nearly 1 out of \nevery 4 of them.\n  No one could have predicted that kind of run for Ted on the day he \nbecame a Senator back on November 7, 1962--no one, that is, except \nmaybe Ted. Ted had signaled what his legacy might be as far back as \n1965, when he spoke of setting a record for longevity. Mike Mansfield \nsaw a glimpse of it, too, a few years later. When somebody mentioned \nTed as a possible Presidential candidate, Mansfield responded:\n\n       He's in no hurry. He's young. He likes the Senate. Of all \n     the Kennedys, he is the only one who was and is a real Senate \n     man.\n\n  As it turned out, Mansfield was right. But Ted knew even then that \nhis legacy as a lawmaker would not come about just by sitting at his \ndesk; he would have to build it. And over the course of the next 47 \nyears, that is exactly what he did, slowly, patiently, doggedly, making \nhis mark as much in tedious committee hearings as on the stump, as much \nin the details of legislation as in its broader themes.\n  Ted's last name ensured he was already one of the stars of American \npolitics even before he became a Senator. To this day, he is still the \nonly man or woman in U.S. history to be elected to the Senate while one \nof his relatives sat in the White House. But to those who thought Ted, \neven if elected, would avoid the rigors of public life, he became a \nliving rebuke. In short, he became a Senator.\n  He surprised the skeptics, first of all, with his friendliness and \nhis wit. When he made his national political debut in 1962 on ``Meet \nthe Press,'' a questioner asked him if maybe there were already too \nmany Kennedys. His response: ``You should have talked to my mother and \nfather . . . ''\n  Russell Long was an early admirer. In what has to go down as one of \nthe falsest first impressions in modern politics, Long spoke \napprovingly of the new Senator from Massachusetts as ``a quiet . . . \nsort of fellow.''\n  Ted got along with everybody. The earliest memories family members \nhave are of Ted laughing and making other people laugh. His secret \nweapon then, and years later, as Chris Dodd rightly pointed out at one \nof the memorial services, was simply this: People liked him, so much so \nthat he could call people such as Jim Eastland, somebody with whom he \nhad absolutely nothing in common, a friend.\n  Ted had learned early on that he could be more effective through \nalliances and relationships than by hollering and carrying on. We all \nknow he did a fair amount of that as well. He provided some of the best \ntheater the Senate has ever known. But once he left the Chamber, he \nturned that off. He sought out allies wherever he could find them--\nStrom Thurmond, Dan Quayle, Orrin Hatch, John McCain, and even George \nW. Bush--and he earned their cooperation by keeping his word and \nthrough thousands of small acts of kindness. Senator McCain has \nrecounted the birthday bash Ted threw 10 years ago for his son Jimmy's \n11th birthday. Senator Barrasso remembers the kindness Ted showed him \nas a new Senator. And Senator Barrasso's family will long remember how \nmuch time Senator Kennedy spent\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\nsharing stories with them at the reception after the swearing in and \nthat he was one of the last ones to leave.\n  Like so many others, I have known Ted's graciousness firsthand. \nAnyone who watches C-SPAN2 could see Ted railing at the top of his \nlungs against my position on this policy or that policy. What they \ndidn't see was the magnificent show he put on a few years ago in \nKentucky at my invitation for students at the University of Louisville \nor the framed photo he gave me that day of my political role model, \nJohn Sherman Cooper. I interned for Cooper as a young man. Ted knew \nthat, and he knew Cooper was a good friend and neighbor of his brother \nJack's.\n  Ted's gregariousness was legendary, but his passion and intensity as \na lawmaker would also reach near-mythic proportions in his own \nlifetime. Even those of us who saw the same problems but different \nsolutions on issue after issue, even we could not help but admire the \nfocus and the fight Ted brought to every debate in which he played a \npart. Over the years, we came to see what he was doing in the Senate.\n  When it came to Ted's future, everyone was always looking at it \nthrough the prism of the Presidency. They should have focused on this \nChamber instead. It was here that he slowly built the kind of influence \nand voice for a national constituency that was common for Senators in \nthe 19th century but extremely rare in the 20th.\n  He became a fiery spokesman for liberals everywhere. Ted and I would \nhave had a hard time agreeing on the color of the carpet when we were \nin the Chamber together. Yet despite his public image as a liberal \nfirebrand, he was fascinated by the hard work of creating consensus and \njumped into that work, even toward the end, with the enthusiasm of a \nyoung staffer. Ted's high school teammates recall that he never walked \nto the huddle; he always ran. Anyone who ever sat across from Ted at a \nconference table believed it.\n  Ted realized Senators could do an awful lot once they got past the \nmagnetic pull Pennsylvania Avenue has on so many Senators. His brother \nJack once said that as a Senator, he thought the President had all the \ninfluence, but it wasn't until he was President that he realized how \nmuch influence Senators had. It was a similar insight that led Ted to \ntell a group of Boston Globe reporters in 1981 that for him, the Senate \nwas fulfilling, satisfying, challenging, and that he could certainly \nspend his life here, which, of course, he did. Then, when it was \nwinding down, he saw what he had done as a Senator and what the Senate \nhad done for him. He wanted others to see it too, so he set about to \nestablish the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, \na place that would focus on this institution the way Presidential \nlibraries focus on Presidents.\n  The Founders, of course, envisioned the legislative and executive \nbranches as carrying equal weight. Article I is about Congress, after \nall, not the Presidency. His life and legacy help restore that vision \nof a legislative counterweight of equal weight. That is an important \ninstitutional contribution every Senator can appreciate. It is \nsomething he did through hard work, tenacity, and sheer will. It was \nnot the legacy most expected, but it is the legacy he wrought, and in \nthe end he could call it his own.\n  Toward the end of his life, one of the great lawmakers of the 19th \ncentury, Henry Clay, was asked to speak to the Kentucky General \nAssembly. Thanks to Clay's efforts, the Compromise of 1850 had just \nbeen reached, and Clay had become a national hero through a job he had \nspent most of his career trying to escape. His speech received national \ncoverage, and, according to one biographer, all acknowledged his \nprivileged station as an elder statesman.\n  For years, Clay had wanted nothing more than to be President of the \nUnited States. But now, after this last great legislative victory, \nsomething else came into view. Clay told the assembled crowd that day \nthat in the course of months and months of intense negotiations leading \nup to the Great Compromise, he had consulted with Democrats just as \nmuch as he had with members of his own party and found in them just as \nmuch patriotism and honor as he had found with the Whigs. The whole \nexperience had moved Clay away from party rivalry, he said, and toward \na new goal. ``I want no office, no station in the gift of man,'' he \nsaid, ``[except] a warm place in your hearts.''\n  Every man has his own story. Ted Kennedy never moved away from party \nrivalry. He was a fierce partisan to the end. But over the years, he \nreminded the world of the great potential of this institution and even \ncame to embody it. We will never forget the way he filled the Chamber \nwith that booming voice, waving his glasses at his side, jabbing his \nfingers at the air, or the many times we saw him playing outside with \nhis dogs. How many times did we spot him coming through the doorway or \nonto an elevator, his hair white as the surf, and think: Here comes \nhistory itself.\n  As the youngest child in one of the most influential political \nfamilies in U.S. history, Ted Kennedy had enormous shoes to fill. Yet \nin nearly 50 years of service as a young Senator, a candidate for \nPresident, a legislative force, and an elder statesman, it is hard to \nargue that he didn't fill those shoes in a part he wrote all by \nhimself.\n  It is hard to imagine the Senate without Ted thundering on the floor. \nIt will be harder still, I am sure, for the Kennedy family to think of \na future without him. You could say all these things and more about the \nlate Senator from Massachusetts, and you could also say this: Edward \nMoore Kennedy will always have a warm place in our hearts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9195-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Majority Leader Reid and Minority \nLeader McConnell for the time they have set aside for us today to \nremember Ted Kennedy, our beloved colleague, my senior Senator for \nnearly a quarter of a century, a friend, a man I met first and who had \ngreat influence on me in politics back in 1962 when, as a young, about-\nto-be college student, I had the privilege of working as a volunteer in \nhis first campaign for the Senate.\n  It is difficult to look at his desk now cloaked in the velvet and the \nroses, a desk from which he championed so many important causes, a desk \nfrom which he regaled us, educated us, and befriended us for so many \nyears, and even more difficult for us to think of this Chamber, our \nNation's Capital, or our country without him.\n  On many occasions in the Senate, he was the indispensable man. On \nevery occasion in this Chamber and out, he was a man whose heart was as \nbig as heaven, whose optimism could overwhelm any doubter, and whose \njoy for life was a wonderfully contagious and completely irresistible \nthing.\n  Ted loved poetry, and though the verse was ancient, the poet could \nhave had Ted in mind when he wrote:\n\n       One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day \n     has been.\n\n  Our day with Ted Kennedy was, indeed, splendid, its impact \nimmeasurable. Just think for a moment what a different country we lived \nin before Ted Kennedy came to the Senate in 1962 and what a more \nperfect Union we live in for the 47 years he served here. Before Ted \nKennedy had a voice in the Senate and a vote in the Senate, there was \nno Civil Rights Act, no Voting Rights Act, no Medicare, no Medicaid, no \nvote for 18-year-olds, no Martin Luther King, Jr., holiday, no Meals on \nWheels, no equal funding for women's collegiate sports, no State health \ninsurance program, no Family Medical Leave Act, no AmeriCorps, no \nNational Service Act. All of these are literally just a part of Ted's \nlegislative legacy.\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\nIt is why the Boston Globe once wrote that in actual measurable impact \non the lives of tens of millions of working families, the elderly, and \nthe needy, Ted belongs in the same sentence with Franklin Roosevelt.\n  Ted's season of service spanned the administrations, as we heard from \nthe minority leader, of 10 Presidents. He served with more than 350 \nSenators, including those for whom our principal office buildings are \nnamed: Richard Russell, Everett Dirksen, and Philip Hart. He cast more \nthan 16,000 votes. He wrote more than 2,500 bills. He had an important \nhand in shaping almost every single important law that affects our \nlives today. He helped create nearly every major social program in the \nlast 40 years. He was the Senate's seminal voice for civil rights, \nwomen's rights, human rights, and the rights of workers. He stood \nagainst judges who would turn back the clock on constitutional \nfreedoms. He pointed America away from war, first in Vietnam and last \nin Iraq. And for three decades, including the last days, he labored \nwith all his might to make health care a right for all Americans.\n  Through it all, even as he battled, he showed us how to be a good \ncolleague, always loyal, always caring, always lively. His adversaries \nwere never his enemies. And his friends--his friends--always came \nfirst.\n\n  In my office there is a photograph of the two of us on day one--\n1985--my first day in the Senate. Ted signed it: As Humphrey Bogart \nwould have said: This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. For \nalmost 25 years it was a beautiful friendship, as I worked at his side \nlearning from the best. And, yes, like any colleague in the Senate, \nthere were moments when we had a difference on one issue or another, \nbut we always found a way to move forward in friendship and in our \nefforts to represent the State.\n  Teddy was the best natural teacher anyone in politics could ask for. \nI may not always have been the best student, but he never stopped \ndispensing the lessons. I came to the Senate out of an activist \ngrassroots political base, where the coin of the realm was issues and \npolicy positions. Activists are sometimes, as I learned, so issue \nfocused and intent that they can inadvertently look past the personal \ntouch or the emotional connection for fear that it somehow distracts \nfrom the agenda. But Teddy, through his actions, showed us how \nessential all of those other elements of political life are.\n  Yes, Tip O'Neill taught a generation of Massachusetts politicians \nthat all politics is local. It was Teddy who went beyond that and \ntaught us that all politics is personal. All of us knew the kindness of \nTed Kennedy at one time or another, Mr. President.\n  During my first term in the Senate, I came down with pneumonia. I was \nthen single and tired and Ted deemed me not to be getting the care I \nought to get. So the next thing I knew, he literally instructed me to \ndepart for Florida to stay in the Kennedy home in Palm Beach and be \ncared for until I got well. Indeed, I did exactly that.\n  He also showed up at my house the evening of Inauguration Day of \n2005, and together with Chris Dodd we shared laughter and stories from \nthe campaign trail. We were loud enough and had enough fun that someone \nmight have wondered if we were somehow mistaken and thought we had won. \nHe understood the moment. He knew the best tonic was laughter and \nfriendship. Many times that is all he needed to do, just be there. You \ncouldn't help but feel better with him around.\n  All of us who served with him were privileged to share Ted's \nincredible love of life and laughter. In the cloakroom, sometimes the \nroars of laughter were so great they could be heard out on the Senate \nfloor. Once I remember Ted was holding forth--I will not share the \ntopic--and the Presiding Officer pounded the gavel and demanded, \n``There will be order in the Senate and in the cloakroom.'' It was the \nfirst time I ever heard that call for order.\n  His pranks were also works of art and usually brilliantly calculated. \nOne night after a long series of Thursday night votes that had pushed \nSenators past the time to catch commercial flights home to the \nNortheast, Senator Frank Lautenberg had arranged for a private charter \nfor himself in order to get up to Massachusetts. It turned out a number \nof Senators needed to travel in that direction, and when Frank learned \nof it, he kindly offered Senator Claiborne Pell, Ted, and myself a ride \nwith him. There was no discussion of sharing the cost. Everyone thought \nFrank was being very generous.\n  But the next week, when we were reassembled on the floor of the \nSenate, official looking envelopes were delivered to each of us under \nFrank Lautenberg's signature with exorbitant expenses charged for this \nflight. Senator Pell roared down the aisle, came up to me sputtering \nabout this minor little aircraft and how could it possibly cost so much \nmoney. Senator Lautenberg was red faced, protesting he knew nothing \nabout it, when out of the corner of my eye I spotted Ted Kennedy up \nthere by his desk with this big Cheshire cat grin starting to split a \ngut, so pleased with himself. The mystery was solved. Ted had managed \nto secure a few sheets of Lautenberg stationery, and he sent false \nbills to each of us.\n  He once told me his earliest recollections were of pillow fights with \nhis brother Jack and, in the years following, sailing with Jack. At the \nend of the day Ted's job was the long and tedious task of folding and \npacking the sails away. In politics and in the great progressive \nbattles that were his life's work, Ted never packed his sails away. \nWere he here today, he would exhort us to sail into the wind, as he did \nso many times. There is still so much to do, so much that he wanted to \ndo, and so much that he would want us to do now, not in his name but in \nhis spirit.\n  When Ted was 12 years old, he spent hours with his brother Jack \ntaking turns reading the epic Civil War poem ``John Brown's Body,'' by \nSteven Vincent Benet. It is book length and filled with great and \nterrible scenes of battle and heartbreaking vignettes of loss and \nprivation and home. It surprises me to read it now and find so much in \nit that in fact reminds me of Ted. Benet wrote:\n\n       Sometimes there comes a crack in time itself. Sometimes the \n     earth is torn by something blind. Sometimes an image that has \n     stood so long it seems implanted on the polar star is moved \n     against an unfathomed force that suddenly will not have it \n     anymore. Call it the mores, call it God or Fate, call it \n     Mansoul or economic law, that force exists and moves. And \n     when it moves it will imploy a hard and actual stone to \n     batter into bits an actual wall and change the actual scheme \n     of things.\n\n  Ted Kennedy was such a stone who actually changed the scheme of \nthings on so many issues for so many people. Over the years, I have \nreceived hundreds of handwritten notes from Ted--some funny, some \ntouching, all of them treasures.\n  Just before Thanksgiving Ted sent me a note that he would be spending \nthe holiday with his beloved sailboat, the Maya. He added: If you are \nout on the sound, look for the Maya. She will be there. Indeed, I will \nnever sail the sound again without thinking of the Maya and her big \nhard skipper.\n  There is an anonymous quote that I once read, which because of Ted's \nfaith--which was grounded and deeply important to him--I think it \ndescribes how we should think of his departure from the Senate. It \nsays:\n\n       I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads \n     her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue \n     ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength. I stand and \n     watch her until at length she hangs like a speck of white \n     cloud just where the sea and sky come down to mingle with \n     each other. Then, someone at my side says; ``There, she is \n     gone!'' ``Gone where?'' Gone from my sight. That is all. She \n     is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when \n     she left my side and she is just as able to bear her load of \n     living freight to her destined port. Her diminished size is \n     in me, not in her. And just at the moment when someone at my \n     side says, ``There, she is gone!'' There are other eyes \n     watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the \n     glad shout; ``Here she comes!'' And that is dying.\n\n  That is the way Ted Kennedy will live in the Senate--his spirit, his \nwords, and the fight that still comes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts for his eloquent statement which I have had the privilege \nto hear. Let me make a short statement myself about my friend and \ncolleague, Ted Kennedy.\n  I came to the Senate in January of 1983, and my first real \nopportunity to work with Ted came in the Armed\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\nServices Committee at the beginning of that service. Although he had \nalready been in the Senate for 20 years, he had chosen that year to go \non the Armed Services Committee. Since we were both going on that year, \nin 1983, we were considered the two freshmen committee members. Ted and \nI were able to work together on the Armed Services Committee for many \nyears.\n  He has been described as a visionary leader, a great orator, the \nkeeper of the faith for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. All \nof those descriptions, of course, are true. But the Ted Kennedy I came \nto know and with whom I had the great opportunity to work was a \npassionate, committed advocate and was the workhorse of the Senate. \nFrankly, Ted Kennedy set a very high standard for himself in the effort \nthat he made on each and every issue that came up for debate. He set a \nhigh standard for the homework he did in preparation for that debate. \nAll of us who served with him found ourselves trying to meet a similar \nstandard. The result was that he raised the level of performance for \nthose of us who served with him by the example he set.\n  In addition to serving with Ted Kennedy on the Armed Services \nCommittee for many years, in May of 1990, following the death of \nSenator Matsunaga, I had the good fortune to be assigned to what was \nthen called the Labor and Human Resources Committee--Ted's committee. \nAs chairman, Ted gave a whole new meaning to the word ``proactive'' in \nthat committee. The volume of useful legislation he was able to move \nforward through the committee was truly impressive. A major key to his \nsuccess was the way he found to underscore for all members the \nimportance of what the committee was working on. As chairman, he \nrightly saw it as his job to put together the agenda and the priorities \nfor the committee's work. But before doing that he would sit down with \nthe rest of us over dinner at his house to get our views on what those \npriorities needed to be. The serious approach he took to the \ncommittee's work inspired those of us who served there to elevate the \nimportance of that work in our own minds as well.\n  During the course of our work in the Senate, each of us gets the \nopportunity to interact with many colleagues, to form judgments about \nthose colleagues. During my 27 years I have served with many capable \nand dedicated public servants who deserve recognition and praise. But \nit is clear to me none of us exceeds Ted Kennedy in our passion or \ncommitment for accomplishing the work we have been sent to do.\n  Hendrick Hertzberg wrote a short piece in the New Yorker last week \nthat captures well the Ted Kennedy with whom I was privileged to know \nand serve. Mr. Hertzberg wrote:\n\n       The second half of his 47-year senatorial career was a \n     wonder of focused, patient, unwavering service to a practical \n     liberalism that emphasized concrete improvements in the lives \n     of the poor, the old, the disabled, children, the uninsured, \n     the undocumented, the medically or educationally \n     disadvantaged.\n\n  That phrase--focused, patient, unwavering service--is a good \ndescription of the Ted Kennedy I knew as my chairman and my friend, and \nI will miss him very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I also want to rise this morning to share \nsome brief thoughts about our colleague from Massachusetts. I want to \ncommend John Kerry and Jeff Bingaman for their comments capturing the \ngood qualities of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  This is a hall noted for a robust amount of noise, and it seems quiet \ntoday because Teddy is not here. So we gather to share a few thoughts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsome remarks I made at the memorial service for Senator Kennedy at the \nJohn F. Kennedy Library.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       What A Golden Friend I Had\n\n                           By Sen. Chris Dodd\n\n       Tonight, we gather to celebrate the incredible American \n     story of a man who made so many other American stories \n     possible, my friend Teddy Kennedy.\n       Unlike his beloved brothers, his sister Kathleen, and his \n     nephews, Teddy was granted the gift of time--he lived, as the \n     Irish poet suggested, not just to comb gray hair, but white \n     hair.\n       And if you look at what he achieved in his 77 years, it \n     seems, at times, as if he lived for centuries.\n       Generations of historians will, of course, chronicle his \n     prolific efforts on behalf of others. I will leave that to \n     them.\n       Tonight, I just want to share some thoughts about my \n     friend.\n       And what a friend he has been--a friend of unbridled \n     empathy, optimism, and full-throated joy.\n       Examples of that friendship are legion.\n       I remember, many years ago, a close friend of mine passed \n     away. Teddy didn't know him.\n       I was asked to say a few words at the funeral.\n       As long as I live, I will never forget that, as I stood at \n     the pulpit and looked out over the gathering, there was \n     Teddy, sitting in the back of the church.\n       He obviously wasn't there for my friend. He was there for \n     me, at my time of loss.\n       That was what it was like to have Teddy in your corner.\n       When our daughters Grace and Christina were born, first \n     call I received was from Teddy.\n       When I lost the Iowa caucuses last year, not that anyone \n     thought I was going to win, first call I received was from \n     Teddy and Vicki.\n       When my sister passed away last month, first call I \n     received was from Teddy, even though he was well into the \n     final summer of his own life.\n       And two weeks ago, as I was coming out of surgery, I got a \n     call from Teddy, his unique voice as loud and booming as \n     ever. ``Well,'' he roared, ``Between going through prostate \n     cancer surgery and doing town hall meetings, you made the \n     right choice!''\n       And though he was dying, and I was hurting, he had me \n     howling with laughter in the recovery room as he made a few \n     choice comments, I cannot repeat this evening, about \n     catheters.\n       As we all know, Teddy had a ferocious sense of humor.\n       In 1994, he was in the political fight of his life against \n     Mitt Romney.\n       Before the first debate, held in Boston's historic Faneuil \n     Hall, I was with Teddy and Vicki and his team and, along with \n     everyone else, offering him advice.\n       ``Teddy,'' I cautioned, ``We Irish always talk too fast. \n     Even if you know the answer to a question, you have to pause, \n     slow down, and at the very least appear thoughtful.''\n       Out he went, and, of course, the first question was \n     something like this: ``Senator, you've served the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts for nearly 35 years in the \n     United States Senate. Explain, then, why this race is so \n     close.''\n       Teddy paused. And paused. And paused. Five seconds. Ten \n     seconds.\n       Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, he answered.\n       After the debate, I said, ``Good Lord, Teddy, I didn't mean \n     pause that long after the first question! What were you \n     thinking about?''\n       He looked at me and replied, ``I was thinking--that's a \n     damn good question! Why is this race so close?''\n       In these last months of his life, I have so treasured our \n     conversations.\n       At 6:30 in the morning of July 16th, the morning after his \n     Senate health care committee finished five weeks of \n     exhausting work on the bill he had written, and that I \n     believe will be the greatest of his many legacies, my phone \n     rang.\n       There was Teddy, beyond ecstatic that we had finished our \n     work, and that his committee had been the first to report a \n     bill.\n       Always the competitor.\n       Teddy was never maudlin or self-pitying about his illness, \n     but he was always fully aware of what was happening.\n       Over the last year or so, Teddy got to enjoy what is, of \n     course, every Irishman's dream--and that is to attend your \n     own eulogies. That's why we call the obituary page the Irish \n     sports page.\n       And I know he enjoyed a uniquely Celtic kick out of hearing \n     people who abhorred his politics say incredibly nice things \n     about him.\n       Volumes, of course, will be published by those attempting \n     to unlock the mystery of why Teddy was such an effective \n     legislator.\n       Was it his knowledge of parliamentary procedure? His \n     political instincts? His passionate oratory? His staff?\n       Please let me save the pundits and political scientists \n     some time--and all of you some money--and tell you what \n     Teddy's secret was: People liked him.\n       Now, he always had a great staff, and great ideas, but that \n     only counts for so much in the United States Senate, if you \n     lack the respect and admiration of your colleagues.\n       And Teddy earned that respect.\n       He arrived in Washington as the 30-year-old brother of a \n     sitting president and the attorney general of the United \n     States.\n       Many people drew their conclusions about him before he \n     spoke his first words in the Senate.\n       And over the years, he became a target of partisans who \n     caricatured him as a dangerous liberal.\n       Now, liberal he was, and very proud of it.\n       But once you got to know him, as his Senate colleagues did, \n     you quickly learned he was no caricature.\n\n[[Page S9198]]\n\n       He was a warm, passionate, thoughtful, tremendously funny \n     man who loved his country, and loved the United States \n     Senate.\n       If you ever needed to find Teddy in the Senate chamber, all \n     you had to do was to listen for that distinctive thunderclap \n     of a laugh, echoing across that hallowed hall as he charmed \n     his colleagues.\n       He served in the Senate, as you all know, for almost a \n     half-century alongside liberals and conservatives, Democrats \n     and Republicans, and he befriended them all with equal gusto.\n       It's great, of course, to see his friends Senators Orrin \n     Hatch and John McCain here.\n       It is to their credit that they so often supported Teddy's \n     efforts.\n       And, I say in some jest, it is to Teddy's great credit that \n     he so rarely supported theirs.\n       But Teddy's personal friendships with Orrin and John, and \n     so many others, weren't simply the polite working \n     relationships that make politics possible.\n       They are the real and lasting bonds that make the United \n     States Senate work.\n       That's what made Teddy one of our greatest Senators ever.\n       Some people born with a famous name live off of it. Others \n     enrich theirs. Teddy enriched his.\n       And, as we begin the task of summing up all that he has \n     done for his country, perhaps we can begin by acknowledging \n     this:\n       John Fitzgerald Kennedy, inspired our America; Robert \n     Kennedy, challenged our America; and our Teddy, changed our \n     America.\n       Nearly every important law passed in the last half century \n     bears his mark, and a great many of them bear his name.\n       Teddy was defined by his love of our country, his passion \n     for public service, his abiding faith, and his family.\n       His much-adored Vicki, his children Kara, Teddy, and \n     Patrick, his step-children Caroline and Curran, his \n     grandchildren, nieces and nephews--all of you need to know, \n     you brought him unbounded joy and pleasure.\n       Teddy was a man who lived for others.\n       He was a champion for countless people who otherwise might \n     not have had one, and he never quit on them, never gave up on \n     the belief that we could make tomorrow a better day. Never.\n       Last August in Denver, one year to the day before his \n     passing, Teddy spoke at our national convention.\n       His gait was shaky, but his blue eyes were clear, and his \n     unmistakable voice rang with strength.\n       As he passed the torch to another young president, Teddy \n     said: ``The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the \n     dream lives on.''\n       He spoke of the great fight of his life--ensuring that \n     every American, regardless of their economic status, is \n     guaranteed the right to decent health care.\n       We are all so saddened that he did not live to see that \n     won.\n       But in a few short days, we will return to our work in \n     Teddy's Senate.\n       The blistering days of August will be replaced, I pray, by \n     the cooler days of September.\n       And we will prevail in the way Teddy won so many victories \n     for our country: by listening to each other; by respecting \n     each other and the seriousness of the institution to which we \n     belong, and where Teddy earned an immortal place in American \n     history.\n       As he so eloquently eulogized his brother Bobby 40 years \n     ago, Teddy doesn't need to be enlarged in death beyond what \n     he was in life.\n       We will remember him for the largeness of his spirit, the \n     depth of his compassion, his persistence in the face of \n     adversity, and the breadth of his achievement.\n       We will remember him as a man who understood better than \n     most that America is a place of incredible opportunity, hope, \n     and redemption.\n       He labored tirelessly to make those dreams a reality for \n     everyone.\n       Those dreams, the ones he spoke of throughout his life, \n     live on like the eternal flame that marks President Kennedy's \n     grave, the flame that Teddy and Bobby lit 46 years ago.\n       And in all the years I knew and loved him, that eternal \n     flame has never failed to burn brightly in Teddy's eyes.\n       Now, as he re-joins his brothers on that hillside in \n     Arlington, may the light from that flame continue to \n     illuminate our path forward.\n       And with the work of our own hands, and the help of \n     Almighty God, inspired by Teddy's example, may we lift up \n     this great country that my friend Teddy loved so much.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I was very honored to be asked by Mrs. Kennedy and her \nfamily to share some thoughts that evening, and I was proud to do so.\n  I commend my colleague from Rhode Island, Patrick Kennedy, for his \ncomments at his father's funeral, and Teddy's son Edward Kennedy, as \nwell, who made wonderful comments about their father at that funeral \nservice.\n  A few short thoughts this morning, and a proposal I wish to make to \nour colleagues as we recognize the contribution of Senator Kennedy. \nWhen we consider how to pay tribute to our colleagues, we often try to \ndevise monuments, to celebrate the work of those who served here and \nmade a significant contribution to our country. It is not an easy task. \nI have tried to think about what would be an appropriate way to \ncelebrate, in some concrete way, the work of Ted Kennedy. He certainly \nhas been, as our colleagues and others have pointed out over these last \ncouple of weeks, one of the greatest Members to ever serve in this \nbody.\n  I had the distinction and honor of serving as the chairman of the \nRules Committee a few years ago. I was asked to complete some of the \novals in the reception room. For those who have not been to Washington, \nor to the Capitol, there is a room a few feet from where I am speaking \nhere this morning called the reception room. It was designed by the \ngreat artist, Brumidi, and he intended that work to celebrate the work \nof the Senate.\n  In the mid-1950s, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, then a freshman Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, was asked by the leadership of this body to form a \ncommittee to identify the five most significant Senators who had served \nup until the 1950s. Then-Senator John Kennedy of Massachusetts went to \nwork, reviewing the contributions of the people who served in this body \nsince the founding of our Republic in 1789. He concluded there were \nfive Members who deserved recognition. The first three were the obvious \nones: Clay, Calhoun, and Webster. The last two, Senator LaFollette of \nWisconsin and Senator Taft of Ohio, were more controversial, but were \naccepted as fine contributions to that room that celebrates those who \nhave contributed the most to this body and our country.\n  I was asked a couple of years ago to help add a couple more names to \nthat honor roll of renowned Members of this body. We concluded that \nSenator Vandenberg, who made such a contribution to the post-World War \nII foreign policy of our Nation, along with Senator Wagner of New York, \nwho back in the 1920s and 1930s and 1940s was the author of much of the \nsocial legislation that we celebrate in this country today, were fine \nadditions to those who had already been recognized in this reception \nroom just off the floor of the Senate.\n  One day it will be appropriate to add our colleague and friend from \nMassachusetts, who deserves to be in that hall of celebrated heroes, \nhaving made a significant contribution to this institution and to the \npeople of our country.\n  But there are other ways to celebrate him as well. I suspect that \nSenator Kennedy, if he had a chance to weigh in on how he would like to \nbe recognized and remembered, might choose other means.\n  There are very few issues over the last half century on which Senator \nKennedy did not leave his mark, and a good many of the most significant \npieces of legislation that passed this Senate in his time not only bear \nhis mark but bear his name as the author. That, in a sense, is a \nmonument, one with a meaning far broader than anything we might \ninscribe on any wall.\n  Across America there are people who might have lacked for an advocate \nhad Ted Kennedy not stood up for them, people who can now stand up for \nthemselves with dignity and hope and a chance to make it in America \nbecause they had a friend by the name of Edward Moore Kennedy.\n  These Americans are also a monument that I think Senator Kennedy \nmight say is fitting enough--that there are people today doing better, \nliving more secure lives, growing up with a sense of confidence and \noptimism about their future and the future of our country because of \nhis contribution. That in itself is a great monument.\n  Perhaps we could consider the flood of tributes that have come from \nacross the aisle as well as across the globe, from those who shared in \nhis crusade for social justice and those who spent their careers \nopposing him, and those who never enjoyed the privilege of working \nalongside him. All understood how important Senator Kennedy was, not \nonly to this Nation but to millions of people around the globe who \ntoday lead better lives because he stood up for them even though they \nwere not citizens of our own country.\n  He understood that the Founders of our Republic, when they talk about \ninalienable rights, were not limiting those rights in our minds to \nthose who happen to enjoy the privilege of being citizens of our \ncountry but knew that they were God-given rights that every human being \nis endowed with upon\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\nbirth, regardless of where they live. Ted Kennedy understood that \nintuitively, deeply, and passionately. That in itself, I suppose, could \nbe a great tribute, knowing there are people whom he never met, never \neven knew what he looked like, who lead better lives today because of \nhis contribution.\n  Then perhaps we might consider these tributes offered by our \ncolleagues here and others, the literally thousands who lined up in \nthose long hours to pay tribute to their Senator from Massachusetts at \nthe John F. Kennedy Library, the more than 50,000 people in \nMassachusetts who had known and respected, elected and reelected and \nreelected and reelected, over and over again, their Senator. They \nappreciated him immensely for the work he did for them and their \nCommonwealth for almost 50 years. In itself that is a great tribute. It \nwould be enough, I think, for many of us, being recognized by the \npeople of your State for having fought on their behalf.\n  Teddy's monument can be found in his talented and wonderful family as \nwell. Joe Biden talked about this in the memorial service in the John \nKennedy Library. When you consider this remarkable family of Senator \nKennedy and those of his brothers, their children, their nieces and \nnephews, it is a source of inspiration when you think of what each of \nthem has done, the contributions they have made.\n  A few short weeks prior to Teddy's passing, he lost his sister \nEunice, who was a wonderful friend of mine over many years. She did \nremarkable things as an individual. To think, millions of people who \nsuffer from mental disabilities enjoy a greater respect today because \nof one individual, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Teddy's brother Joe lost his \nlife in World War II, defending our country and fighting for freedom. \nHis sister Jean has done a remarkable job with the very special arts in \nher contribution to the country. And then look at his wonderful wife \nVicki, who was such an incredible source of strength and inspiration \nfor him during their life together and particularly over the last 15 \nmonths. There is no doubt in my mind Teddy lived as long as he did with \nbrain cancer because Vicki was at his side and took such nurturing care \nof him and has done a remarkable job providing all of us the \nopportunity to celebrate his life as we all wished to do.\n\n  His children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews all are following \nTeddy's example by making a difference in this country. His son Patrick \nI mentioned already, serves in the other body. His son Teddy is a great \nfriend of mine, lives in Connecticut and is making a significant \ncontribution as citizen of our State. He holds no office, doesn't have \nany title. He and his wife make a wonderful difference on many issues \nin our State every single day, and his daughter Kara, for whom he has \nsuch great affection, has also made her contributions as well. That in \nitself can be a monument. How many would say if your children and \nfamily do well and stand up and make a difference in the lives of other \npeople, what better tribute; what higher form of compliment could you \nhave, or form of flattery, than to know that your children, your \nfamily, your nieces or nephews, your sisters and brothers are out \nmaking a difference in the lives of others?\n  In a way, it is hard to decide what is an appropriate way to \ncelebrate the life of someone who filled the room on so many occasions, \nnot only with his booming voice--as we all are familiar with here, \nparticularly the staff of the Senate who would, many times, be the only \nones in this room as Ted Kennedy would be pounding that podium back in \nthat corner, expressing his passionate views about some great cause of \nthe country. But we remember also his determination that this country \nlive up to its expectations, that it become the more perfect union that \nour Founders described more than two centuries ago.\n  Today, I wish to make a suggestion to my colleagues. I talked to the \nleadership about it and to the Republican leadership as well. Never \nbefore in the history of this country have three brothers served in \nthis Chamber: Jack Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and, of course, Teddy \nKennedy. That has never happened before in the history of our Nation. \nOne of the rooms that has been of similarly historic significance to \nour Nation is the caucus room in the Russell Office Building. It has \nbeen the site of remarkable hearings and meetings. Since its building \nalmost a century ago, that room has been very important. The hearings \non the Titanic were held in that room; the Watergate hearings, going \nback years ago, were held in that room. It is there that we have \ncommemorated tragedies. We have met to celebrate triumphs in that room. \nWe have gathered as Members with our spouses from time to time to share \nsome quiet moments with each other as we reflected on our \nresponsibilities here as Senators. We have held some of the greatest \ndebates that have ever occurred in that room. It is there that Senator \nKennedy's Health Committee, in which I was privileged to act as sort of \na fill-in for him over the last number of months, held 5 weeks of \nhearings and debate and markup of a bill that concluded in the adoption \nof the health care reform legislation that he authored.\n  It is in that room that Senator Kennedy's brothers each announced \ntheir candidacies for the Presidency of the United States. Both Jack \nKennedy and Robert Kennedy, in that very room, announced that they \nintended to seek that office. And it is there that I propose we affix \nthe Kennedy name, not just as a monument to the things these three \nbrothers did as Senators and as colleagues of ours here, but in the \nspirit of compassion and compromise, the fierce advocacy and tender \nfriendship that Teddy and his brothers brought to this body.\n  This was Teddy's wish and desire. I asked him what could we do to \nrecognize him, and he said, I would like to have you recognize my \nbrothers as well for their contribution.\n  Ted Kennedy believed in impassioned debate. He believed in pounding \nthat podium when it was appropriate. But he also believed that at the \nend of the day we best serve the people of our great Nation when we \nrespect each other and work together in common cause to solve the \nproblems of our day. Whatever history is made in the caucus room of the \nRussell Senate Office Building in the next century, I would like to \nbelieve it will be guided by that spirit of respect and good humor that \nTeddy Kennedy brought to this institution for almost a half century. \nThus, may the Kennedy Caucus Room stand as one monument to the \ncontribution of a family what has made such a difference to our \ncountry. They devoted their considerable talents and energy and their \nlives to serving our Nation that they loved and that loved them back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleague to pay \ntribute to an extraordinary American, probably the greatest Senator to \nserve in this body. I think time will confirm that as we go forward. I \nparticularly want to express my deepest sympathy to Vicki and Kara and \nPatrick and Ted Jr. I have had the privilege now of serving with \nSenator Ted Kennedy but also with Congressman Patrick Kennedy, and both \nof these gentlemen have demonstrated zeal for public service and \ncommitment and passion to help people that has been emblematic of the \nKennedy family.\n  I particularly am proud of Patrick, his words at his father's \nfuneral. His continued dedication to the people of Rhode Island is not \nonly commendable but inspiring to me and to all of us.\n  Like so many of my generation, I grew up with the Kennedy family. In \n1960, John Kennedy carried the banner of the Democratic Party as the \nPresidential candidate. He won, but, as we understood then and now, we \ngot the whole family, not just President John Kennedy, and it was a \nremarkable family--his brother Robert, the Attorney General and later \nthe U.S. Senator from New York, and then, of course, Ted Kennedy.\n  His contribution to the country and to the world is probably \nunmatchable as we go forward in every area: health care, which was his \nparticular passion and on which President Obama spoke so movingly last \nevening about his commitment to moving forward in this Congress and \nfinally achieving a dream that has alluded our country for years and \nyears and years; his work with his son Patrick on mental health parity, \nwhich is so important.\n  On education, I had the privilege of serving with him on the \nEducation\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\nCommittee and as a Member of the House to collaborate with him on \neducation bills, and every major education initiative in this country \nbears his stamp, his input, his inspiration. He worked very closely \nwith my predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell, for the creation of the \nPell grants and for so many other initiatives in education. He not only \nworked with Senator Pell, they developed a very deep and abiding \nfriendship.\n  One of the impressive things about Ted Kennedy is that the public \npersona was impressive, the private persona was equally impressive and \nextraordinarily endearing. He was someone who had a great sense of \ncamaraderie and friendship and good humor.\n  I can recall being invited to join Senator Kennedy at the Pells' home \nin Newport after Senator Pell retired. Every year, unannounced, without \nany fanfare, Senator Kennedy would sail his boat up into Newport and \ninsist on taking Senator Pell out for a cruise, and then they would all \nretire to the Pell home for a delightful supper. I was privileged to be \nthere on a couple of occasions.\n  Toward the end of his life, Senator Pell had difficulty moving \naround, but Senator Kennedy would insist on coming every summer. The \nlast outing, we literally had to carry Senator Pell aboard. Senator \nPell at that time was not communicating as effectively as he was \npreviously, but he didn't have to because Senator Kennedy could take \nboth parts of the conversation--in fact, he could take multiple parts \nof the conversation. There was never a lost word or a dull moment. It \nwas a great opportunity to see an extraordinary statesman but an \nextraordinary gentleman at the same time.\n  He said famously about his brothers that they lived to see the \nAmerican dream become reality, and he said famously that the dream \nlives on. But he also, more than dreaming, tried to give substance, \nshape, and texture to that dream, effectively to try to ensure that \nopportunity was available to every American family, that they could use \ntheir talent to build their family and to secure their future and to \ncontribute to a better America. That was why he led on health care, \nbecause without adequate health care, you cannot realize your talents, \nyour potential, and you cannot contribute as much to this great \ncountry. He led on education because it is the great engine that pulls \nthis Nation forward and individually gives people an opportunity to \nmove up and to help their families move forward.\n  On civil rights, he was a strong advocate. In fact, I think it is \nfair to say that his first major speech was in favor of the 1964 Civil \nRights Act because he understood that the talent of America was not \nrestricted to any group and that to meet the challenges of this Nation \nand this world, we need the contribution and the participation of every \nAmerican, regardless of race, regardless of gender.\n  He also was someone who understood that for the working men and women \nof this country, they needed help, they needed to share in the bounty \nof this country. What we have seen over the last decade has been \ngrowth, up until the crisis of last September, but that growth was not \nshared fairly or evenly, executives getting huge salaries and bonuses \nand working men and women were barely keeping up. In order to have a \nstrong, prosperous economy, we need a strong, prosperous middle class. \nHis work in terms of education and health care and labor--all of that \nhad a purpose not only of helping individuals but, wisely, trying to \nestablish an environment for economic growth that we all could share.\n  He also served on the defense committee with me. And he was very \nperceptive. He had spent many years viewing the world, and his \nunderstanding of not only the military but the forces, economic and \ncultural, that shape our interaction with other countries was profound \nin its insights. He was, very clearly, opposed to the operation in Iraq \nbecause he understood that it was a strategic deviation from the real \ntask, which continues in Afghanistan, to root out al-Qaida, to \nstabilize the region, the most volatile region in the country. That is \njust one example of his insight into the international arena.\n  There is a story, and it is attributed to either his brother John or \nto Senator Kennedy, but I think it might be apropos for both. It might \nbe slightly apocryphal, but either John or Ted, according to the story, \nwas standing outside a factory and a worker came up and said: They tell \nme you have never worked a day in your life.\n  And Kennedy was taken aback.\n  Then shortly, the worker said: Don't worry, you haven't missed \nanything.\n  A family of great privilege, of great opportunity, in fact worked \nevery day of their lives, and particularly Ted Kennedy, hard, \nrelentlessly to ensure that person coming out of the factory had a \nchance.\n  Finally, what I sensed when I was at the funeral service, which was \nextraordinarily moving and inspirational, the outpouring of affection \nand regard for Senator Kennedy, not by the dignitaries who assembled \nbut by ordinary citizens of Massachusetts and here lining the route to \nArlington, bespeaks a connection and a validation by the American \npeople of an individual who had trials and tribulations but rose above \nit in constant service to the country, in constant service to the \npeople who do not have a voice, and constant service to those who need \na chance to help themselves, to help their family, and to make the \nNation a better place. It reminded me of words spoken about Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt. His cortege was moving through Washington, DC, and a \nman was visibly shaken and weeping.\n  A reporter went up to him and said: You know, you are so upset, did \nyou know the President?\n  He said: No, I did not know him, but he knew me.\n  Ted Kennedy knew us all. He knew our strengths, he knew our \nweaknesses, he knew that this government could make a difference, a \npositive difference in the lives of people. He had shared the same \ndifficulties and challenges we face: children stricken with cancer, the \nloss of his brothers and one of his sisters in an airplane crash, the \nhuman reality.\n  And because he knew us, he never stopped working for us.\n  His legacy is extraordinary. It will inspire and sustain us as we go \nforward. His loss, not just to his family, which is considerable, but \nfor all of us, is balanced by how much he made us better, more attuned \nto the challenge of serving America and leading the world. We will miss \nhim. But our task now is to take up his work, to continue his effort. \nThat is the greatest tribute we can pay. Let us begin with this debate \non health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand.) The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to add my voice to those who \nhave already paid tribute to our friend and colleague, the late Senator \nTed Kennedy, who passed away this last month after a courageous battle \nwith cancer.\n  He was quite an institution. I came into this body in a seat held by \nan individual who was quite an institution as well. Bob Dole was in \nthis seat. So I know that when people look to the person who follows \nafter Ted Kennedy, you just can't replace an individual like that who \nwas such a towering figure in this body, was the lion of the Senate, as \nmany have noted, and certainly deserved that topic and that accolade.\n  While Senator Kennedy and I did not see eye to eye on most political \nissues, I admired him greatly as a colleague and certainly as a \ndedicated public servant. Ted Kennedy fought for what he believed and \ndid so with passion and conviction and incomparable ability. When he \nwas your opponent on an issue, you knew you had a fight on your hands, \nand when he was on your side, you knew you had an advocate who worked \nhard and effectively.\n  His skills as a legislator were unmatched. I think really what was at \nthe core of that was he really enjoyed working with other people. He \nhad built relationships across the aisle with individuals, so that he \ncould personally go to other individuals with that relationship he had \nbuilt. Even though there were huge disagreements on policy issues on \nmany other fronts, he had the personal relationships. To him, I think, \nin many cases, it was a lot more about the person rather than policy. I \nthink that is a good lesson for many of us to learn. He mastered the \nlegislative process, became one of the most effective Members of this \nbody and that this body has ever known. One\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\nof the keys of his effectiveness was his tenacity and perseverance and \nattending to, in many cases, the unglamorous details and the sometimes \ntedious work that goes into crafting and passing a bill.\n  He also understood that getting things done as a politician means \ncompromise. He had a great sense of when to fight on principle and when \nto reach out to the other side and arrive at an agreement in order to \nadvance the cause for which he was fighting. I think you can probably \nlook back over the last decade or 15 years of this body and no major \npiece of legislation passed without Ted Kennedy's fingerprints \nsomewhere around or on that piece of legislation.\n  Despite our political differences, I always found him to be \nprofessional, courteous, thoughtful, and a caring individual. He was \nalways looking for ways to find common ground and had a wonderful \nability to win others over to his side with that charm, Irish wit, his \nfellowship, and gregarious nature. And once he made an agreement, you \ncould depend on him to be true to his word and honor in public an \nagreement he had made in private.\n  Over the years, I had the opportunity to work on several legislative \nissues with Senator Kennedy. As many testified, he was the best ally \none could ever hope for.\n  Most recently we worked together to pass the Prenatally and \nPostnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act, a pro-life piece of \nlegislation. When I would travel around the country saying that Ted \nKennedy and I had introduced a pro-life piece of legislation together, \nmany people would be quite startled. I would explain what this was. It \nwas a piece of legislation that would encourage people, once they had a \ndiagnosis that their child had Down Syndrome in utero, not to abort the \nchild but instead to have the child, put together an adoption registry \nof individuals who were willing to adopt children with Down Syndrome. \nWe have this terrible plague in the country where 90 percent of our \nchildren who are diagnosed with Down Syndrome never get here; they are \naborted.\n  In our office we went to the disability community. We went to his \nsister Eunice and talked with her about it. And I went to Ted. I \nremember how effective his sister Eunice would be on lobbying Ted on \nthis piece of legislation. Just this past year, when we were able to \nmove things forward with it, I met with Eunice. She was obviously \ngetting more difficult and failing of health at that point. She said: \nIs Teddy being helpful? Is Teddy working with you and helping? I would \nsay: Yes, he is, but you can always help us more and push him more. And \nshe did. What an effective team that was on providing help for those \nespecially with mental disabilities, even on this pro-life piece of \nlegislation that I hope will result in more people getting here who \nhave disabilities so that they are not killed in utero but instead that \nthey get here and, if people can't handle that issue in their families, \nthat they put them up for adoption. We have adoption registries ready \nto go for people who want to adopt a child who may have more \ndifficulties. Working together we were able to find common ground on \nprotecting the dignity of these precious Americans by providing parents \nwho receive a pre- or postnatal diagnosis of genetic disability with \nresources, information, and a network of support.\n  I am so pleased to know Senator Kennedy lived to see this bill passed \nand signed into law. It stands as an example of how we can find common \nground to advance the interests of all Americans in spite of \ndifferences. This body truly will not be the same place without Ted \nKennedy, without his rhetoric and his strong voice, his abilities as a \nlegislator.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family and friends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I join today with colleagues to pay \ntribute to the life and legacy of Senator Ted Kennedy. Each of us has \nlost a friend with his passing--and all Americans--but especially those \nin need have lost a champion of government's ability to bring light to \ndark places. All of us stand in awe of the lengthy record of \naccomplishment Senator Kennedy leaves us. It was a great privilege to \nserve many years with Ted Kennedy on the Armed Services Committee and \nto witness firsthand the traits so well known to Members of the Senate: \nthe tireless preparation, the intimate knowledge of the legislative \nprocess, the relentless focus on justice and equality.\n  Today our citizens are safer, our military more capable, our troops \nbetter equipped because of his service.\n  Senator Kennedy approached his work with diligence and dedication. \nBut he also knew that work goes more smoothly when it is accomplished \nwith friendship and good humor. It was possible to disagree with Ted \nKennedy but never to dislike him. His sense of humor was contagious, \nand his concern for those around him, from fellow Senators to staff, to \nthe many often unheralded people who make the Senate function, ensured \nthat he was loved as well as respected throughout this body. That love \nextends across lines of party and ideology, in part because of that \ngood humor and genuine concern for others for which he is so rightly \nknown.\n  But it was not just these qualities that endeared Ted Kennedy to \nfigures of all political persuasions. It was the seriousness and good \nfaith with which he approached ideas that differed from his own. In \n1983, this liberal Catholic from Massachusetts traveled to the \nconservative Liberty Baptist College in Virginia where he told the \nstudents:\n\n       The more our feelings diverge, the more deeply felt they \n     are, the greater is our obligation to grant the sincerity and \n     essential decency of our fellow citizens on the other side.\n\n  Ted Kennedy lived out that sentiment every day. We salute his ability \nto work across party lines to achieve consensus, to work on a piece of \nlegislation until doubters became enthusiastic supporters. He excelled \nin transforming nays to yeas. Senator Kennedy was a master of our own \nspecialized world, and his legislative legacy stands with those of the \ngiants of this Chamber. He tackled what some see as the great game of \npolitics with gusto.\n  But Ted Kennedy's life's work was not a game. Politics was not a \ncontest staged for its own sake or in pursuit of power or prestige. Ted \nKennedy was a master not of the politics of the moment but of the \npolitics of meaning.\n  Ted Kennedy's task was to touch lives. He touched the family whose \nchildren have health insurance because of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program he helped establish; the child who has a better \nchance at an education because of his work on the No Child Left Behind \nlaw. More Americans can fully participate in our democracy because of \nthe civil rights and voting rights legislation he pushed forward.\n  We saw Ted Kennedy's passion for justice, tolerance, and \nunderstanding again recently when we were working on the Matthew \nShepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention legislation. I \nquoted him during that debate on that legislation when the Defense \nauthorization bill was on the floor, and I quote him again now. He \nsaid:\n\n       We want to be able to have a value system that is Worthy \n     for our brave men and women to defend. They are fighting \n     overseas for our values. One of the values is, we should \n     not, in this country, in this democracy, permit the kind \n     of hatred and bigotry that has stained the history of this \n     Nation over a considerable period of time.\n\n  The children of our men and women in uniform have some of the best \nchildcare available, thanks to the National Military Child Care Act Ted \nKennedy championed in 1989. He was actively involved more recently \nfollowing the outrages at Walter Reed Army Medical Center when we \npassed the wounded warrior legislation in 2008.\n  The lesson of Ted Kennedy's life and career is that politics at its \nbest is not a game to be refereed by TV pundits. It is not a contest of \npoll numbers or a scorecard of grievances to nurse and favors to \nreturn. Senator Kennedy struck many deals. He brokered many \ncompromises. He won many votes. But the true majesty of his career is \nnot to be found in this Chamber, though his work was done here. His \nlesson for us is that democracy is best understood in the homes and \nlives of its citizens. It is in the homes of families less burdened by \nwant. It is in the minds of children freed by education. It is in the \nrelief of parents who no longer fear for a child in need of medical \ncare. It is in the\n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\nsouls of Americans who find inspiration in his triumph over tragedy and \nover his own shortcomings. It is in the hearts of the colleagues he \nleaves behind who will be inspired to rededicate ourselves to a \npolitics that recognizes our common humanity and seeks common ground in \nthe pursuit of justice.\n  My wife Barbara and I will always keep in our hearts Vicki, the love \nof Ted's life, and we will always remember Ted's love affair with the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there was a historic moment on Capitol \nHill last night. The President of the United States asked for a joint \nsession of Congress to address one of the most important and \ncontroversial issues of our time. Emotions were running high in the \nHouse Chamber as Members of the House and Senate gathered to hear the \nPresident. We know they ran high because there were expressions of \nsupport and disapproval during the President's speech. I sat with Harry \nReid and other leaders from the Democratic side in the Senate and \nwatched carefully as the speech unfolded. I thought the President was \nat his best, even under fire, with the high emotions in the Chamber. I \nwondered what the ending would be and how it would be received.\n  If Members will recall, at the end of the speech, the President \nreferred to a letter that had been sent to him by the late Senator Ted \nKennedy to be read after the Senator had passed away. As the President \nreferred to that letter, an amazing thing happened in that Chamber \nfilled with hundreds of hundreds of people. The emotions quieted down. \nAt one point, one could have heard a pin drop in the House Chamber as \nPresident Obama recalled the legacy and the promise of the life of \nSenator Edward Kennedy.\n  I came today to this seat on the Senate floor. It is not my ordinary \ndesk, but it is the row where I sat for a number of years as a new \nMember of the Senate. It was a particularly good assignment to sit in \nthis row because behind me was Paul Wellstone and then Ted Kennedy. One \nnever had any better back-benchers than those two men. Now they are \nboth gone.\n  As I reflect on the absence, particularly of Senator Kennedy, I \nrecall for history his first speech on the floor of the Senate. It was \nApril 9, 1964. Here is the amazing fact: This speech took place 16 \nmonths after he took his Senate seat. That booming voice and presence, \nwhich was so dominant in the Senate for decades, waited patiently for \nhis turn, 16 months after the special election in Massachusetts that \ngave him the Senate seat once held by his brother John. When he rose to \nmake his first speech on April 9, 1964, he said he planned ``to address \nissues affecting the industry and employment in my home state [of \nMassachusetts],'' a thoughtful decision by someone recently elected, to \nmake sure that your first speech touches issues important to the \nfriends at home. He said he would make that speech one day. But he \ndecided his first speech would be much different.\n  On that day, with his first speech, conscience and the cause of \nfreedom compelled Ted Kennedy to speak instead in eloquent support of \nthe bill the Senate was then debating. It was a measure President \nKennedy proposed nearly a year earlier. Now, less than 5 months after \nthat terrible day in Dallas, TX, when his brother was assassinated, the \nyoungest Kennedy brother stood at the same desk his brother John had \nused when he served the Senate, the same desk Ted Kennedy used for the \n47 years he served in the Senate. He presented more than a dozen \nletters he had received from religious leaders all urging Congress to \npass the Civil Rights Act and end the evil of segregation in America. \nThat was Ted Kennedy's first speech in the Senate.\n  He said:\n\n       When religious leaders call on us to urge passage of this \n     bill, they are not mixing religion and politics. This is not \n     a political issue. It is a moral issue to be resolved through \n     political means.\n\n  He continued.\n\n       Religious leaders can preach, they can advise, they can \n     lead movements of social action. But there comes a moment \n     when persuasion must be backed up by law to be effective. In \n     the field of civil rights, that point has been reached.\n\n  He concluded by saying:\n\n       My brother was the first President of the United States to \n     say publicly that segregation was morally wrong. His heart \n     and soul are in this bill. If his life and death had a \n     meaning, it was that we should not hate but love one another; \n     we should use our powers not to create conditions of \n     oppression that lead to violence, but conditions of freedom \n     that lead to peace. It is in that spirit that I hope the \n     Senate will pass this bill.\n\n  That first speech by Ted Kennedy bore so many of the qualities that \nwould define his public career. The moral courage to take on the most \nurgent moral question of his time no matter how controversial, the \ndetermination to pick up his brother's fallen standard, the prodigious \namount of work behind the scenes building alliances, and an optimist's \nunshakable faith that his beloved America would become an even more \njust and decent Nation.\n  Listening to Senator Kennedy's speech that day were some of the \ngiants of the Senate--Hubert Humphrey, a man who more than anyone \nbrought me to public life when he allowed me to serve as an intern in \nhis Senate office. The first to speak was a man whom I would come to \nknow well, Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. He said:\n\n       I have never heard an address of a more truly noble and \n     elevated tone.\n\n  He called the young Senator from Massachusetts:\n\n       A worthy continuer of the great traditions of the seat \n     which he occupies in the Senate, beginning, I believe, with \n     John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster and Charles Sumner and \n     through . . . to his beloved and lamented brother . . .\n\n  Senator Wayne Morse stood to speak as well, and he made a prediction \non the first day Ted Kennedy spoke in this Chamber. He said:\n\n       [I]n my judgment, the junior Senator from Massachusetts has \n     already demonstrated that before he leaves the U.S. Senate, \n     he will have made a record in this body that will list him \n     among the great Senators in the history of the Senate.\n\n  That prediction was made 45 years ago by Senator Wayne Morse of \nOregon.\n  Edward Moore Kennedy was one of the greatest Senators not only of our \ntime but of all time. There was no better advocate and no more \ndetermined fighter for civil rights and human rights. He was a son of \nprivilege, but he was a man, despite that background, who identified \nwith the poor and the dispossessed and the voiceless in America.\n  His fingerprints can be found on significant legislation of the last \nhalf century: health care, voting rights, women's rights, gay rights, \nimmigration reform, worker safety, fair housing, consumer protection, \ncampaign finance reform, sensible gun laws, national service, minimum \nwage--the list goes on and on.\n  He was a protector of the vulnerable--of widows and orphans, the \nwounded and maimed, the grieving and dispossessed. He was a champion of \npeople with disabilities. He believed we should all be judged by what \nwe can do, not by what we cannot do.\n  When I was asked by my local media in Illinois, after Ted Kennedy's \npassing, if there was something about him that I knew that other people \ndid not know, I said there was one thing most people did not know. As a \nresult of an airplane crash early in his Senate career, where his \nbroken body was dragged out of the plane by his Senate colleague, \nSenator Birch Bayh of Indiana, whose son now serves in this Chamber, \nTed Kennedy, with a broken back and ribs, went through a long period of \nconvalescence and a lifetime of problems as a result of that almost \nfatal accident.\n  Those of us who were around him every day knew that Ted was in pain a \nlot of the time--physical pain--because of his back problems. If you \nhad a press conference with Ted Kennedy, you brought a little stool \nthat he could perch on because standing caused pain. You watched him as \nhe labored to get out of a chair trying to make sure he could stand and \nspeak. But never a word of complaint--not one. A physical condition \nthat might have created a total disability for some other people did \nnot stop him. In addition to the intellectual part of this man, there \nwas this physical commitment that he would give whatever it took to \nserve his people in Massachusetts and serve the causes and values which \nmotivated his public life.\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\n  He was an advocate for the elderly throughout his career. Little did \nhe realize his passion would eventually affect him personally, as he \nserved long enough to qualify for Social Security and Medicare.\n  He believed education was the key to the American dream and he worked \ntirelessly to extend it, helping to create programs from Head Start for \npreschoolers to the Direct Lending program for college students.\n  He helped bring an end to apartheid in South Africa and violence in \nNorthern Ireland.\n  His office wrote more than 2,500 bills and more than 300 of them \nbecame law. In addition, some 550 bills he cosponsored became law. \nNearly every major legislative achievement of his was advanced with a \nRepublican partner.\n  He was a genius at compromise, principled compromise. As someone \nsaid, he was able to maintain a sense of idealism in setting goals and \nrealism in achieving them. He had an optimist's willingness to settle \nfor progress, not perfection.\n  It was from his bother Jack, he said, that he learned the most \nimportant lesson: that you have to take issues seriously, but do not \ntake yourself too seriously. As we all know, he was gracious and \ngenerous in sharing credit for success. But he also, because of the \nsuffering in his life through his family and personally, developed this \nheart of gold, this empathy for other people and their own misfortunes.\n  If one of his colleagues in the U.S. Senate had something bad come \ntheir way, you could almost bet the first call they would receive would \nbe from Ted Kennedy, regardless of which side of the aisle you were on. \nHe would be the first to talk about some misfortune or illness in your \nfamily. How he learned this so quickly we never figured out, but the \nKennedy network was there gathering that information, making certain he \nalways offered a helping hand and a pat on the shoulder if you needed \nit.\n  Health care was such an important part of his public career--decent, \naffordable health care, as a right but not as a privilege. And he did \nmore than anyone in our Nation's history to advance that noble cause.\n  He voted to create Medicare and Medicaid, protecting those programs \nfor decades. Community health centers were a Kennedy initiative in \n1966. How much good that has done for America is incalculable.\n  He was the chief architect of the WIC program, the COBRA law, and the \nRyan White Act. Fewer Americans are forced to make the agonizing choice \nof keeping their job or caring for a loved one who is sick because Ted \nKennedy helped pass the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  Eleven million children of low-income working parents are able to see \na doctor this year--11 million of our young kids in America--because \nTed Kennedy helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  He was the driving force behind cancer research and speedier approval \nof drugs. He helped lead the fight to end discrimination by insurance \ncompanies against people with mental illness and addiction, which his \nson Patrick has managed to pick up that standard and help, with his \nfather, pass that legislation, a bill which meant so much to Senator \nPaul Wellstone and so many others, Pete Domenici included.\n  During the last few months of his life, he expended what little \nenergy he had left to urge us to pass health care, and that is why the \nPresident's speech last night struck a chord with so many people. He \ncontinued to work hard at his job, even on the phone, during the last \ndays of his life.\n  His son Patrick said that while his father was hospitalized this last \nyear for treatment in North Carolina and Massachusetts, he would roam \nthe halls of the hospital--you can just see him--asking other cancer \npatients and their families how they were doing and how they were \nmanaging their bills. Some of the answers, they said, broke his heart.\n  He was ready to come back and vote on health insurance reform if the \nvote was needed. Even in the closing days of his life, Senator Reid, \nreaching out to Vicki, knew that Ted would be there if his vote made \nthe difference, even if it was the last physical act of his life.\n  Just as he implored the Senate in his first speech so many years ago \nto pass the civil rights bill in honor of his brother, the fallen \nPresident, we all know that Senator Kennedy, were he here today, would \nurge us to finish the cause of his life and make affordable health care \nfor every American a right, not a privilege.\n  It is our obligation to search in good faith, as he did so often, for \nthe principled compromise that will enable us to finish this urgent \nmoral challenge of our time in the name of Ted Kennedy.\n  I was fortunate to attend the memorial service in Boston at Our Lady \nof Perpetual Help--a packed church with hundreds standing in the rain \noutside, wishing they could attend. Thousands had passed by to see his \nremains and to pay a tribute to him over the final days. It was a great \nsendoff to a great man.\n  I was so touched by his family--that extended Kennedy family--\nstarting with Vicki, his best ally in his life, a woman who stood by \nhim through those tough times in the closing months of his life, his \nchildren, nephews, nieces, grandchildren. All of them gathered. As they \nwent to take Communion, John McCain leaned over to me and said: You can \nsee the map of Ireland on all those faces. And you could. It was a \ngreat gathering of the Kennedy clan.\n  I want to express my condolences not only to the family but to the \ngreat Kennedy staff, always regarded as the best on Capitol Hill. Ted \nKennedy not only did great work, he helped build great people, who \ncontinue to serve us in public careers. They have done so much for this \nNation. They will continue to do so, inspired by his example.\n  We are saddened by his passing, but we are determined to carry on. We \nknow if he were here today his voice would be booming on this floor for \nthe extension of unemployment benefits, making sure COBRA deductions \nare still there for those who have lost work, not forgetting to \nincrease the minimum wage, making sure health care does not forget the \ntens of millions who are being left behind without health insurance in \nthis country.\n  We are going to miss that booming voice, but he is going to continue \nto be an inspiration to all of us.\n  Last year, at the Democratic National Convention in Denver there was \na little breakfast for Ted. He gave a great speech at the convention, \neven though there was a question at the last moment as to whether he \nwould be able to physically do it. At that breakfast, Vicki, his wife, \ncame up to me and she handed me this little plastic bracelet, and she \nsaid: I thought you might want to have this. It has written on it one \nword: ``Tedstrong.''\n  Well, I put that bracelet on, and I just took it off for the first \ntime since then at this moment. I will not be wearing this bracelet, \nbut it will be in my Senate desk, and each time I open it, I will \nremember that great man, Ted Kennedy.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the assistant Democratic leader, in \nhis eloquent remarks, mentioned Ted Kennedy's maiden address, which is \na tradition we have here in the Senate. We try to wait for an \nappropriate time before we say much, and then we try to say something \nwe think makes a difference.\n  I waited an appropriate time and made some remarks on the floor in \nsupport of legislation that would help put the teaching of American \nhistory and civics back in its rightful place in our schools so our \nchildren could grow up learning what it means to be an American. I know \nthe Presiding Officer has a great interest in that subject as well, and \nshe and I have worked on that together. I proposed that we create \nsummer academies for outstanding teachers and students of United States \nhistory.\n  Ted Kennedy was on the floor. He was the chairman or ranking member \nof the committee that handled that at the time. He came over afterwards \nand said: I will get you some cosponsors. The next thing I knew, he had \n20 Democratic cosponsors for my little bitty bill that I had \nintroduced. However well I thought of him before that, I thought even \nbetter of him after that. I think it is a small example of why he was \nso effective here in what he cared about.\n  I remember him talking about taking his family--his extended family--\nonce\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\na year to some important place in America, some place that made a \ndifference. He was especially taken with their trip to Richmond, I \nbelieve it was, where they went to the place where Patrick Henry went \ndown on one knee and made his famous address. I guess one reason he was \nso interested in U.S. history was because he and his family were and \nare such a consequential part of it, but he made a big difference in \nwhat we call the teaching and learning of traditional American history.\n  On another occasion, he called me up to his hideaway--he had been \nhere long enough to have a great room somewhere; I do not know where it \nis, but it has a great view of the Capitol--to talk about Gettysburg \nand what we could do to preserve that.\n  Then, we were working together, when he died, with Senator Byrd, who \nhas been such a champion through U.S. history, on legislation that \nwould tie the teaching of American history to our national parks, which \nwe are celebrating this year, with Ken Burns' new movie, and with other \nways to try to help use those nearly 400 national park sites we have to \nteach American history.\n  He and I and David McCullough had breakfast, for example, and talked \nabout David McCullough teaching a group of teachers about John Adams at \nthe John Adams House in Massachusetts, as one example. Then, of course, \nthat turned to what was Ted Kennedy going to do about finding an \nappropriate place to honor John Adams in Washington, DC. That was \nanother piece of unfinished business Ted Kennedy left that others of us \nwill have to continue to work on. That is why he got along so well \nhere.\n  When he cast his 15,000th vote, I remember saying the sure-fire way \nto bring a Republican audience to its feet was to make an impassioned \nspeech against high taxes, against more Federal control, and against \nTed Kennedy, and he laughed that great big laugh of his. But it was \ntrue. But almost everyone on this side will say there was no one on \nthat side who we would rather work with on a specific piece of \nlegislation because no matter how much we might disagree with him--and \nwe certainly did on many issues--when it got to the point where it was \ntime to decide: Can we do something? he was ready to do something. And \nhis word was good. And his ability to help pass an important piece of \nlegislation was unquestioned. Plus, we liked him. We liked his spirit, \nand we liked his personality.\n  My first engagement with Senator Kennedy was as a very young man when \nI came here in 1967 as a young aide to then-Senator Howard Baker. \nSenator Baker, who was the son-in-law of Senator Dirksen, then the \nRepublican leader, teamed up with Ted Kennedy, the younger brother of \nthe former President, and they took on the lions of the Senate, Sam \nErvin of North Carolina and Everett Dirksen, and won a battle over one \nman, one vote. I was the legislative assistant on this side and Jim \nFlug, the longtime friend and aide of Senator Kennedy, was the \nlegislative assistant on that side.\n\n  I am here today, as we all are, to pay our respects to Senator \nKennedy. Maybe some of us can help with some of that unfinished \nbusiness, such as helping to make sure we expand the idea of teaching \nAmerican history in our national parks to larger numbers of outstanding \nteachers and to outstanding students of U.S. history; and continuing \nthe effort to do something about the long lines of adults in America \nwho are waiting to learn our common language--English. Ted was very \ninterested in that, as I am. But most of all, what I wish to say is \nwhat I believe most of us feel: We will miss him. We will miss his big \nvoice, we will miss his big smile, and we will miss his big presence.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am deeply honored to pay tribute to \nTed Kennedy today and to honor his extraordinary legacy.\n  I will always think of Ted Kennedy as many think of him--as the lion \nof the Senate. From that seat, in that seat in the back of this \nbeautiful Senate Chamber, he used his powerful voice to speak out for \nthose whose voices were rarely heard. I also have described Ted as the \ndrummer in a large orchestra. Ted Kennedy was a steady drumbeat--a \nsteady drumbeat for justice, for fairness, for compassion, and for \nprogress. On days when the Senate wasn't that interested in listening; \non days when maybe the polls were against him; on days when his \ncompassion might not have been in fashion, that drumbeat got louder and \nlouder and louder because Ted Kennedy knew that at the end of the day, \nthe values he stood for would be embraced again.\n  Ted never let us forget why we are here--never. He always reminded us \nto be courageous. He always reminded us to be strong in fighting for \nthe causes we believe in, not by lecturing us about it but by being \nbrave, being strong, being courageous, taking on the tough issues. He \nspent 9 long years standing in the back of the Chamber talking about \nraising the minimum wage and explaining why people needed it--9 long \nyears--but he knew the drumbeat would go on until we passed it. And we \ndid.\n  Ted Kennedy had genuine and deep friendships in the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle. His greatest legislative skill was to know every \nSenator and to know their passions. When I first came to the Senate in \nthe early 1990s, I had spent 10 years in the House and Senator Kennedy \nwas already an icon, but he knew I was passionate about health issues \nand, in particular, women's health issues. So even though I was new to \nthe Senate, he came to me when he was managing a bill on the floor to \nprotect the rights of women who were trying to get into reproductive \nhealth care clinics. At that time, protesters were blocking the \nentrances to the health care clinics so the women could not get in and \nget treated. So Senator Kennedy wrote a bill that simply said: It is \nfine to express your views, but you cannot block women or individuals \nfrom entering those clinics. It is dangerous, it is wrong, and you are \ndenying women health care. Senator Kennedy asked me if I would be his \nlieutenant--that was his word, his ``lieutenant''--and help him manage \nthat bill on the floor of the Senate. Well, clearly, I was so pleased. \nIt was such a thrill to watch him work and, as did so many of Ted \nKennedy's bills, it passed and it became the law of the land and women \ncan get health care without being intimidated and frightened and \nharmed.\n  Later, when he was championing the bill to increase the minimum \nwage--and he did it year after year after year--he asked me and the \nother women of the Senate to come to the floor and to organize and \nspeak about the impact raising the minimum wage would have on women and \nfamilies across the country. He said: Barbara, you know, 60 percent of \nthe people earning minimum wage are women. A lot of our colleagues \nthink it is teenagers. That is not true. It is women. They are \nsupporting their families. Can you help me with this? I said: Senator, \nI am all over it. I am with you.\n  The women of the Senate had a special role to come to the floor--\nunfortunately, for 9 years in a row--until we made the case that it was \nimportant America's families, working so hard, can actually afford to \nlive in this, the greatest country of all.\n  Although Ted had deeply held views, he worked beautifully with \nMembers across the aisle. We have colleague after colleague coming down \nto speak about their experiences. He was an expert at finding the \nthread of common ground. Sometimes it was just a tiny little strand of \ncommonality, but he could weave it into something bigger and bigger and \ncome to an agreement without losing his principles.\n  Ted's legislative work has touched the lives of every American, and I \nthink it is going to take 5, 6, 7, 10 of us to pick up this void he has \nleft. I am so proud that Tom Harkin, who has come to the floor, will be \nthe chairman of the HELP Committee because Tom shared with Ted those \ndeep feelings about us being here not to champion the voices of those \nwho have a strong voice and are heard but for those who don't have a \nstrong voice: the middle class, the workers, the working poor, the \nfamilies, the children. They don't have a voice here.\n  Ted Kennedy worked to help get 18-year-olds the right to vote. He \nmade it easier for Americans to change jobs and keep their health \ninsurance. He expanded Head Start Programs. He wrote\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\nthe law creating Meals-on-Wheels. He was the driving force behind the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act. Many of these Senator Harkin and he \npartnered up on. He led efforts to reform the Nation's immigration \nsystem--never a popular issue, a tough, hard issue. He worked to \nincrease competition in the airline industry. He worked to protect \nwomen from violent crime.\n  Virtually every major health care advance of the last four decades \nbears his mark--Whether it is the CHIP program, the Ryan White CARE \nAct, COBRA, the mental health parity bill or increased funding for \ncancer research. The list goes on and on and on.\n  Senator Kennedy was once asked what his best quality was as a \nlegislator, and he answered with a single word: ``Persistence.'' \nPersistence. That is a message to all of us on both sides of the aisle. \nIf you believe something in your heart is right, you don't give up. You \ndon't give up because progress takes time. Piece by piece, every year, \nfor almost half a century, he advanced the causes he believed in: \nexpanding access to health care, educating our children, extending \ncivil rights, helping our society's least fortunate.\n\n  I will say, if we were in danger of losing our way in the Senate, \nSenator Ted Kennedy held steady. He stayed true to his ideals. That is \nwhy it is fitting that his new biography is entitled ``True Compass.'' \nIn many ways, he was a compass in the Senate.\n  I wish to thank the people of Massachusetts for sending Ted Kennedy \nto us for these last 47 years. He loved his State. He fought for you \nand he fought for all Americans.\n  I wish to thank his wife Vicki, who gave him so much joy, and the \nentire Kennedy family for sharing Ted Kennedy with us.\n  I will miss his warm and engaging presence, his sense of humor, his \nbellowing laughter, and the way he reached out to all Senators in \nfriendship. No one person will ever be able to fill his shoes. No one. \nHe was one of a kind and irreplaceable. But we know how to honor his \nlegacy. We know how to fill this void and that is by continuing his \nlife's work. I believe the most fitting tribute we can give him is to \ncarry on his fight for a quality education for all our children, \naffordable health care our families can rely on and an economy that \nworks for everyone.\n  Ted Kennedy came from a privileged and renowned family, but he saw so \nmuch suffering in his lifetime, so much loss. He saw what happens in \nyour family when two of your three children have cancer. Even though \nyou have every bit of financial stability to give them what they need, \nhe saw how hard it was. And then to have another child with an \naddiction and the pain of that. So what Senator Ted Kennedy understood \nis, if it is so hard for me to see my children suffer, what must it be \nlike for someone without the financial resources or someone who had an \ninsurance company walk away from them at the time they needed it the \nmost, they needed help the most.\n  Ted Kennedy could put himself in other people's shoes, and that is \nwhat he did every single day. Even when it was hard for him to get up \nfrom his chair, he stood and he fought. As he said during his \nconcession speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention: ``For all \nthose whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause \nendures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.''\n  I say to Ted and to his family, I believe these words are true. The \nhope still lives and the dream shall never die.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, it is difficult to imagine or accept \nthe fact that Ted Kennedy is no longer serving in the Senate. He was \nsuch a presence here, a big man with a big smile and a bigger heart. He \nwas sympathetic to those in need and willing to do all he could to \naddress their needs. He got results, improving and expanding Federal \nprograms to make available education and nutrition benefits to more \nAmericans than ever before.\n  I first met the Senator from Massachusetts when he was running in his \nfirst campaign for the Senate in 1962. It was a happenstance meeting. I \nwas an instructor at the Naval Officer's Candidate School in Newport, \nRI, and a friend had invited me up to Hyannis Port during the weekend. \nI ended up at Ted and Joan Kennedy's house. He was there working with \nhis friends from Massachusetts on fund-raising activities. We exchanged \ngreetings. He said: You are in law school?\n  I said: Yes, I am.\n  He said: It is hard as hell, isn't it?\n  I said: It sure is.\n  Well, that was about all the conversation we had that day and I had \nno idea, first of all, how his campaign would turn out and certainly \nthe most remote thing in my mind would have been my being a Member of \nthe Senate. But he and his wife Joan were spending the summer in \nHyannis Port near the other Kennedy family members, so I was getting to \nsee some of them as well as enjoying the New England weather; the \nambiance in the summer was a real treat. But instead of politics, we \ntalked about how hard law school was.\n  I didn't think I would ever see him again. I had no reason to think I \nwould, much less end up serving in the Senate with him and serving the \nday he took charge as chairman of the Judiciary Committee from my \npredecessor in the Senate, James O. Eastland. It was a day that \nattracted a lot of attention. The hearing room was absolutely full of \npeople. As a matter of fact, the news media was all over the place. It \nwas hard to get near the seats of the committee members.\n  I remember when Alan Simpson and I were the two most junior \nRepublicans, and as we were trying to get situated there at the end of \nthe row of seats of committee members, one of the camera men bumped \nAl's head with his camera, and Al told him he should not do that again \nbecause he might have a hard time finding his camera--or some words to \nthat effect. But what a day of excitement and interest. That is the \nkind of excitement Ted Kennedy brought not only to the Judiciary \nCommittee and his leadership as a brand new chairman, but his entire \ncareer reflected that kind of exuberance. People responded and reacted \nto him in a very positive way in the Senate.\n  We could make a long list of the things he did in terms of \nlegislative accomplishments and political leadership in the Senate. But \nhe was a good person. He was a thoughtful person and generous with his \nhouse. He invited all the members of the Judiciary Committee to come \nout for dinner at his house in Washington. What a nice, thoughtful \nthing to do, and what an exciting evening it turned out to be. Everyone \nenjoyed it enormously.\n  Ted Kennedy became a very determined advocate for serious reforms, \nand he left an impressive record of legislative accomplishments and \nprotecting and enlarging the civil rights of ordinary citizens.\n  I came to respect Senator Kennedy and appreciate his friendship over \nthe years we served together in the Senate. His personal qualities, his \ngenerosity, and his serious commitment to fairness and assistance for \nthose who needed help from their government will long be remembered and \nappreciated.\n  May he rest in peace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank my dear friend from Mississippi \nfor his kind words. I know they will be appreciated by the Kennedy \nfamily.\n  Madam President, when I heard the Senator from Mississippi, and \nbefore him the Senator from Illinois, the Senator from California, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and others who have spoken, it brought back \nso many memories. On August 26, very early in the morning, we heard the \nnews about Senator Kennedy. Marcelle and I knew that day was coming. We \nknew the day was coming and that we would lose a close friend of over \n35 years, but our farmhouse in Vermont was still filled with grief upon \nthe learning of the news. We walked back and forth on the road in front \nof the house, looking out over the mountains and finding it hard to put \ninto words how we felt.\n  We left Vermont to come down and join Vicki, such a dear and \nwonderful person, and all of Senator Kennedy's family at the memorial \nservice in Boston, where so many offered touching stories of how they \nremembered Senator Kennedy.\n  Ted Kennedy, Jr., gave an incredibly moving tribute to his father. I \ntold him\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\nafterward that was the kind of eulogy Senator Kennedy would have liked. \nIt was so Irish. Ted Kennedy, Jr., made us all laugh, and he made us \nall cry, almost in the same sentence. How Irish, how Kennedy, but how \ntrue were the emotions of every man and woman in that church--from the \nPresident, to the Vice President, to former Presidents, to Senators, to \nMembers of the House, to close friends, and to so many of the Kennedy \nfamily.\n  I think of being sworn into this body as a 34-year-old nervous \nSenator. One of the first people who came up to shake my hand after \nbeing sworn in was Ted Kennedy, then Mike Mansfield and Howard Baker. I \nwas awed to think I was in the presence of such people.\n  After serving with Ted for 35 years and speaking with him almost \nevery single day, I look over at his desk, at something I have seen \nover the 35 years when we have lost colleagues, but I don't know of any \ntime it has hurt so much to see the black drape across the desk, to see \nthe vase of white flowers. I went by there yesterday and just put my \nhand on the desk. I will admit I was overcome with emotion and left the \nfloor.\n  I have so many memories, as we all do, of my friendship with Ted. \nSenator Durbin spoke about how Ted Kennedy had a way of--no matter who \nyou were, if you had tragedy in your family or an illness or something \nhad happened, he would call or write, and he would offer help. It made \nno difference who you were.\n  I was very close to my father. He had met Ted a number of times. When \nmy father passed away, virtually the first telephone call my mother \nreceived that morning was from Ted Kennedy. I remember my mother taking \ncomfort in that.\n  Senator Kennedy's office is just one floor below mine in the Russell \nSenate Building. We both have stayed there all these years. On many \noccasions, especially when he was going for a vote, we could hear his \ngreat laugh echoing down the halls, and it would change our whole mood, \nour whole day. We often talked about the bond of the New England Irish \nand spoke about that again when we came back from Pope Paul John II's \nfuneral and refueled the plane in Ireland. It was like following the \nPied Piper at Shannon Airport. There were paintings of President \nKennedy there. The Senator from Iowa remembers that.\n  As we walked through, Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd were telling Irish \nstories. There are memories of when Ted was walking the dogs outside of \nRussell Building, and we would talk and chat, saying: How is your \nfamily? How is this one or that one?\n  After Ted died, one of our newspapers in Vermont had a front-page \npicture that my wife Marcelle had taken back in 1968. It showed a young \nTed Kennedy in Vermont campaigning for his brother Robert and talking \nwith an even younger State attorney. We talked about Robert Kennedy--\nthe two of us--and I gave that photograph to Ted a few years ago \nbecause I found it in my archives. He chuckled and talked about how \nyoung we looked, and then he asked for another copy so he could sign \none to me. That day we sat there and talked about his brothers--\nobviously, the President, John Kennedy; Senator Robert Kennedy; and \nalso his brother, Joe Kennedy, who had died. I talked about being \ninterviewed by Robert Kennedy, who was Attorney General, when he \ninvited me down to the Department of Justice. I was a young law \nstudent, and he talked to me about the possibility of a career in the \nDepartment of Justice. That talk meant so much to me, and his brother \ntold me how independent the Department of Justice must be, even from \nthe President of the United States. We never have enough time in this \nbody, and a rollcall started and that conversation stopped. But I \nremember every bit of that so much.\n  I remember after that time we campaigned for Robert Kennedy, the next \ntime I saw him was here when I was a Senator-elect. As a former young \nprosecutor, I walked into his office with trepidation and almost \nthinking I was going into the inner sanctum. I was going to talk with \nhim about what committees I might go on. This great voice said: Good \nmorning, Senator.\n  Coming from him, I turned around, assuming another Senator was \nwalking in behind me, and I realized he was talking to me.\n  Ted's wonderful wife Vicki was part of a small book club, and my wife \nMarcelle was in that. The days they would meet, Ted would come up and \nput his arm around my shoulder and say, ``Patrick, we are in trouble \ntoday. Our wives are meeting, and tonight we are going to get our \nmarching orders.'' You know what, Madam President. He was right.\n  All of the years I served on the Judiciary Committee, until this past \nyear, I sat beside him. I am going to miss him on that committee. I am \ngoing to miss his help and advice. I am going to miss him on the Senate \nfloor because not having him with us in the Senate is going to make a \nhuge difference in negotiations on legislation, whether it is on a \ncurrent issue of health care reform or any other issue.\n  I remember one meeting with Ronald Reagan when he was President. The \nPresident turned to Ted--and several of us, Republicans and Democrats, \nwere meeting with him--and said, ``Thank goodness you're here, Ted. You \nare bringing us together.''\n  That difference extended beyond our shores. He personally made such a \ndifference in bringing peace to Ireland and ending apartheid in South \nAfrica. I remember going with President Clinton after the peace \nagreement, and everybody--while they would thank the Prime Minister of \nIreland and Great Britain and President Clinton, they all wanted to \ncome over and thank Ted Kennedy.\n  His sense of history and of our country and his firm and constant \nbelief in America's promise and America's future was inspiring. His \nwillingness to spend time with the most junior Senators as with all \nothers of both parties made him a Senator's Senator. I think every \nsingle Senator, Republican or Democrat, would agree he was a Senator's \nSenator.\n  It is easy in politics to appeal to the self-interests in each of us. \nTed Kennedy appealed to the best in us, to the American verities that \nare written not on water but in stone. He appealed to our sense of \njustice, to our sense of responsibility to each other, and to our \nuniquely American sense of hope and possibility. In the Senate, he \nlabored to help reach bipartisan progress on health care, education, \ncivil rights, voting rights, immigration reform, and so much more.\n  Madam President, the powerful have never lacked champions. Ted \nKennedy was a champion for ordinary Americans and for those who \nstruggle, those who do not have a champion. He believed everyone in \nthis great land deserved the opportunity to pursue the American dream.\n\n  I thought last night at the President's speech--I talked before the \nspeech with Mrs. Kennedy and after the speech with Senator Kennedy's \nthree children. It was just impossible to fully put into words how much \nI miss him.\n  Marcelle and I miss our friend dearly, but we know it was a privilege \nto call him our friend. It was a privilege to serve alongside such a \npublic servant dedicated as he was to making better the lives of \nmillions of his fellow Americans.\n  It is a sad passing of an era, but Ted Kennedy would also tell us it \nis a time to look to the future.\n  Madam President, I close with this. I always thought when I left the \nSenate I would say farewell to this body and Ted Kennedy would be here \nto wish me Godspeed. I wish him Godspeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank all of our colleagues who have \ntaken the time to come to the floor to speak for and on behalf of our \ngreat friend and colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy. I particularly enjoyed \nthe remarks of the distinguished Senator from Vermont who served with \nhim for 35 years. I only served 33 years with Ted. I thank them for the \nremarks and the reverence most everybody has had for our departed \ncolleague.\n  I rise today to offer my remarks on the passing of my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Ted Kennedy. Over this past recess, America lost one \nof its greatest leaders and this Chamber lost one of its most dynamic \nand important Members. I mourn the loss not only of a respected \ncolleague but of a dear personal friend. I think I speak for all my \ncolleagues when I say that Senator Kennedy will be missed and that the \nSenate is a lesser place without him here.\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\n  People have often remarked about the working relationship I had with \nSenator Kennedy, oftentimes calling us the ``odd couple.'' We used to \nlaugh about that. But the truth be told, he and I really didn't agree \non a lot of things. Over the years, Senator Kennedy and I were on \nopposite sides of some of the fiercest battles in this Chamber's \nhistory. While we have long been good friends, we did not pull any \npunches on one another. If we were opposing one another in a debate, \nSenator Kennedy would come to the floor and, in his classic style, he \nwould lay into me with his voice raised--and he had a terrific voice--\nand his arms flailing. Of course, I would let him have it right back. \nThen, after he finished, he would finally come over and put his arm \naround me and say: How was that? I would always laugh about it, as we \ndid. We laughed at each other all the time.\n  That is what set Senator Kennedy apart from many in Washington. For \nhim, politics rarely got personal. He was never afraid to voice his \ndisagreement with the views of a fellow Senator. But, in the end, I \nbelieve he always maintained a warm and cordial relationship with \nalmost every one of his colleagues. That is difficult to do sometimes, \nparticularly when partisan tempers flare up, but it always seemed to \ncome easy for Senator Kennedy.\n  Despite our tendency to disagree on almost everything, Senator \nKennedy and I were able to reach common ground on many important \noccasions and on some important issues.\n  As I mentioned at the recent memorial service, one of my defining \nmoments as a Senator came when I met with two families from Provo, UT. \nThe parents in these families were humble and hard working, and they \nwere able to provide food and clothing and shelter for their children. \nBut the one necessity they could not afford was health insurance. Their \nchildren were children of the working poor. The struggles of this \nfamily touched me and inspired me to work with Senator Kennedy to \ncreate SCHIP, which continues to provide health care coverage to \nmillions of children of the working poor and others throughout the \ncountry and which passed with broad bipartisan support.\n  Over the years, Senator Kennedy and I worked successfully to get both \nRepublicans and Democrats on board for a number of causes. We drafted a \nnumber of pieces of legislation to provide assistance to AIDS victims, \nincluding the Ryan White AIDS Act. I named that bill right here on the \nfloor with Mrs. White sitting in the audience. We worked together, \nalong with Senator Harkin, to craft and pass the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. There was also the Orphan Drug Act, as well as the \nFDA Modernization Act, and a whole raft of other bills that would take \ntoo much time to speak about, all of which bear the Hatch-Kennedy, \nKennedy-Hatch name.\n  Our final collaboration came just this year in the form of the Edward \nM. Kennedy Serve America Act, which I was pleased to name after Senator \nKennedy right here on the floor. He came up afterward, and we hugged \neach other. Then we went back to the President's Room, and he had \npictures, even though he was not feeling well. He had so many pictures \nwith so many people who were involved.\n  All of our bills passed because of the willingness of Senator Kennedy \nand myself to put consensus ahead of partisanship--something we see far \ntoo infrequently in Washington.\n  It is axiomatic in politics that timing is crucial. No one understood \nor practiced that principle better than Senator Kennedy. He had a sixth \nsense and an open mind to notice when the time was ripe for the key \ncompromise. He knew when to let events sift and when it was time to \nclose the deal. More importantly, he knew when he should stick to his \nguns and when he needed to reach across the aisle to get the help of \nhis Republican colleagues. He was always able to recognize and work \nwith those who shared his goals, even if they had different ideas on \nhow to achieve them.\n  I will never forget, after I had made the deciding vote on civil \nrights for institutionalized persons--it was a Birch Bayh-Hatch bill, \nand Birch had led the fight on the floor, and so did I.\n  Later came the Voting Rights Act. I felt very strongly about not \nputting the effects test in section 2. I had no problem with it in \nsection 5, but I did not want it in section 2 so that it applied to all \nthe other States. I lost in committee. I voted for the bill out of \ncommittee because I considered the Voting Rights Act the most important \ncivil rights bill in history.\n  The day they were going to have the bill signed at the White House, \nhe caught me right inside the Russell Building where we both had \noffices, and he said: You are coming with us, aren't you?\n  I said: Well, I was against the change in section 2.\n  He said: You voted for it and were very helpful in getting that bill \npassed, and I know how deeply you feel about it.\n  I did go down with him. I would not have gone without Senator Kennedy \nrecognizing I did feel deeply about the Voting Rights Act. And even \nthough I lost on what I thought was a pivotal constitutional right, the \nfact is I voted for the bill.\n  At the risk of riling my more liberal colleagues in the Senate, I \nwould like to point out that Senator Kennedy shared an utterly \noptimistic view of the American experiment with President Ronald \nReagan. They both deeply believed that whatever the current trials or \nchallenges we must face as a nation, America's best days were ahead of \nher. That is something many people do not appreciate well enough about \nSenator Kennedy.\n  Because of his optimism and hope for our Nation's future, Senator \nKennedy was, throughout his career in the Senate, a great practitioner \nof the Latin motto ``carpe diem,'' ``seize the day.'' Few worked harder \nday-in and day-out than Senator Kennedy. As a result, every Senator had \nto work a little bit harder, either to follow his lead if you were on \nthe same side of the issue or to stand in his way if you were the \nopposition. I have been in both positions. I am not saying it was \ninherently difficult to work with Senator Kennedy. But as anyone who \nhas negotiated a tough piece of legislation can tell you, it can be \nsheer drudgery, even when you agree on most issues. But Senator Kennedy \nbrought a sense of joy even to the most contentious negotiating \nsessions. And when you were working with Senator Kennedy, you knew he \nwould keep his word. If after these long sessions an agreement was \nreached, he would stick by it no matter how much heat he would have to \ntake.\n  All this was no doubt the result of his love for this great \ninstitution and his commitment to the American people. Political \ndifferences notwithstanding, there can never be any doubt about Senator \nKennedy's patriotism.\n  Few had a presence in the Senate as large as Senator Kennedy's. More \noften than not, you could hear him coming down the hall--a mini-\nhurricane with a bevy of aides in tow, a batch of amendments in one \nhand and a stack of talking points in the other. He was almost always \neffective but seldom very quiet.\n  I also want to share a few thoughts about his staff. While at the end \nof the day the full responsibility of the Senate falls squarely on the \nshoulders of each Senator, it is also true that during the day and \noften long into the night and on many weekends much of the work of the \nSenate is conducted by a group of the most committed team of staff \nmembers of any institution anywhere. Throughout his career, it was \nknown that the Kennedy staff was comprised of one of the most \nformidable and dedicated collections of individuals of the Senate. Many \nof them have gone on to have distinguished careers, including now-\nJustice Stephen Breyer; Dr. Larry Horowitz, who managed his health care \nright up to the end and loved Ted Kennedy deeply; Nick Littlefield, who \nran the Labor Committee for Senator Kennedy and was an adviser right up \nto the time Senator Kennedy passed away; and, of course, Michael \nMyers--just to name four, with no intention of leaving out the others. \nSenator Kennedy would be the first to recognize how their efforts \ncontributed to his success. I salute them for their hard work over the \nyears. I cannot exactly say I have always been totally pleased with all \nof the Kennedy staff all of the time, but, as was true of their boss, \nwhile we might have been frequent adversaries, we were never enemies.\n  I am saddened by the loss of my dear friend Senator Kennedy. I will \nmiss\n\n[[Page S9208]]\n\nhim personally. I will miss the fights in public. I will miss his sense \nof humor in private and public. And perhaps more significantly, I \nbelieve this Chamber will miss his talents as a legislator and, most of \nall, his leadership.\n  While I cannot say I hope more of my colleagues will adopt his views \non policy, I hope more of us can adopt his approach to the legislative \nprocess.\n  I was in California giving a speech at a fundraiser when they came in \nwith a cell phone and said: Senator Kennedy is on the line, and he \nsounds very agitated.\n  So I went out on the plaza and I said: Ted, what is the matter?\n  He said: Oh, I have great news for you.\n  I said: What is that?\n  He said: I am going to get married again.\n  I said: Do I know her?\n  He said: No, but you would love her. She is a wonderful, wonderful \nperson, and she has two wonderful children. I am going to adopt them \nand treat them as my own. And I am so happy.\n  I said: Ted, why would you call me in California?\n  He said: Well, her daughter was bragging to her elementary school \nteacher at that time that her mother was going to marry Ted Kennedy.\n  The elementary school teacher was married to a Washington Post \nreporter.\n  So he said: I wanted you to become one of the first to know. I am \nvery happy. I am going to marry Vicki Reggie.\n  I have come to know Vicki very well. She has made such a difference \nin his life and in his family's life. She is a tremendous human being, \nas are his children. They are terrific.\n  I was happy to be in the Catholic church where Teddy went to pray for \nhis daughter every day he could when she was suffering from cancer. I \nknow how deeply he feels about Patrick and Teddy, Jr. I thought they \ndid a terrific job at the mass at his funeral. He has to be very proud \nof them. I am very proud of them.\n  I think Vicki Kennedy deserves an awful lot of credit for all of the \nlater happy years of my friend Ted Kennedy. I want her to know that I \nlove her dearly for what she did and as an individual herself.\n  I love Ted Kennedy's entire family. A number of them have come to me \nat times where I was able to help them because he could not as a member \nof the family. I have to say that I was close to a great number of the \nmembers of his family, and I really appreciate them as well and the \ninfluence they had on him and he had on them.\n  He had a great influence on me as well. I want to personally thank \nhim for it and say to my dear friend and colleague, as I look at his \ndesk over there with the flowers and the drape, rest in peace, dear \nTed, and just know that a lot of us will try to carry on, and \nhopefully, with some of the things you taught us and helped us to \nunderstand, we can do it better than we have in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to speak about Senator Ted \nKennedy. Clearly, I would have been proud to be on my feet to give such \na testimonial, but as many of my colleagues know, I had a fall a few \nweeks ago coming out of church. I am ready to be at my duty station, \nbut I can't quite stand to be 4 foot 11 and give these remarks.\n  I do wish to speak and speak from my heart, speak from my memory, and \nspeak with my affection. I have known Ted Kennedy a very long time. He \nhas been my friend, my pal, my comrade in arms. I have enjoyed \neverything from working with him on big policy issues to sailing off \nthe coast of Hyannis. I have been with him in his hideaway while we \nstrategized on how to move an agenda of empowerment, and I have danced \nat his famous birthday parties. We have had a good time together.\n  I remember one of the first parties was the theme from the 1960s, and \nI came with a big wig, hoping I would look like Jackie Kennedy. Ted was \na chunky Rhett Butler because Vicki and he were coming as Rhett Butler \nand Scarlett O'Hara. As we jitterbugged, I said: Do you think I look \nlike Jackie? He said: Well, nice try.\n  The last party we went to was a movie theme, and I came with one of \nthose big bouffants. It was to be a movie theme, as I say, and I looked \nlike something out of ``Hair Spray.'' I will not tell you his comments, \nbut, again, he said: Your hair gets bigger with every one. I can't wait \nuntil my 80th.\n  Well, unfortunately, there will not be an 80th birthday party, but we \nwill always carry with us the joy of friendship with Ted Kennedy.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I give this salute to him. I first met \nhim as a young social worker. I testified before his committee. As a \nyoung social worker, I was there to talk about a brandnew program \ncalled Medicare, about what was working, what were the lessons \nlearned--once again from being on the ground; what was happening in the \nstreets and neighborhoods--and how to help people get the medical and \nsocial services they needed. He listened, he was intent, and he asked \nmany questions. Little did I know I would join him in the Senate to \nfight for Medicare, to fight for health care, and to fight for those \nsenior citizens.\n  Similar to so many others of my generation, I was inspired by the \nKennedys to pursue a life in public service. I chose the field of \nsocial work and then went into politics because I saw politics as \nsocial work with power. As a Congresswoman, I was on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee. That was a counterpart to what Ted was doing in the \nSenate. We got to know each other at conferences working together. \nThose were the great days of bipartisanship. As we would come in from \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee, there would be Ted Kennedy and Jacob \nJavits working to make sure we could pass good legislation. I saw there \nthat good legislation came from good ideas that could be pursued with \ngood humor in an atmosphere of civility.\n  As we got to know each other, I admired his verve, his tenacity, and \nhe admired me because I could dish it out with the best of them as \nwell. When he ran for President in 1980, he asked me to nominate him at \nthe Democratic Convention. I was thrilled and honored to do so. \nRemember the drama of that. Jimmy Carter was an incumbent President. \nTed Kennedy was an upstart. I backed Kennedy. Well, it didn't work out \nand Ted called me and said: I am withdrawing from the race. We are \ngoing to support President Carter 100 percent. But though you are not \ngoing to nominate me for President, I hope you will still introduce me \nat the convention. I said: Absolutely. But one day I hope to be able to \nnominate you.\n  That night, as I took the podium, it was the famous speech that \neveryone remembers Ted Kennedy giving about the work going on, the \ncause enduring, the hope still living, and the dream never dying. What \nwas amazing about that speech was the way Ted Kennedy used a moment in \nhis life--which some viewed as a defeat--as a time to redefine himself \nin public service and to claim the mantle of being one of the best \nSenators America has ever seen. He used that speech not as a retreat \nbut as a reaffirmation and a recommitment of what he would do.\n  That night I did introduce him. While all my colleagues were in \nBoston, and I watched the funeral from my rehabilitation room, mourning \nhis death and feeling sad that I could not join with my colleagues \nthere, I had that speech and I read it then and, as I looked at it, I \nrealized I could give it again and again. Because when I took the floor \nof the 1980 convention, I first said: I am not here for Barb Mikulski. \nAnd I am here today for all those people who would like to say what \nthey knew about Teddy Kennedy, and I am going to say some of those \nwords I said then that would be appropriate for now.\n  I said:\n\n       I am here on behalf of a lot of people who want to be here \n     but can't: Old women desperately trying to use their Social \n     Security checks to pay for food and medicine and yet \n     frightened about their energy bills. Students whose tuition \n     has gone up so much they are going to have to work two jobs \n     just to stay in school.\n\n  I spoke of small businesspeople trying to just keep their doors open \nand the returning war vet who is unemployed, and that while his brother \nhas signed up for a tour of duty, he is standing in the unemployment \nline.\n  I said during that speech that, day after day, Edward Kennedy has \nspoken out for those people; that he has been there talking about the \neconomy, energy policy, and jobs, long before many\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\nothers. I talked about how Edward Kennedy said that when Black freedom \nriders were being attacked and beaten, he was the one who fought for \nracial justice and helped to get the Voting Rights Act through. I said \nthat as a young social worker, working in the neighborhoods during the \ndark Nixon years, and wondering how old people were going to get the \nservices they needed, Ted Kennedy introduced the first nutrition \nprogram for the elderly--a program that guaranteed senior citizens at \nleast one hot meal a day. It was Ted Kennedy, I said, who won the \npassage of programs such as neighborhood health centers, who fought the \nwar on cancer, who led the fight to save nurses' scholarships and save \nthem he did. In his fight for legislation, he was always there.\n  In my fight to help battered women, Senator Kennedy was one of the \nfirst to be a strong and active ally. He said he knew very early on \nthat all American women work but that too many women work for too \nlittle or are paid unequal pay for their work. I said then, and I say \nagain, Ted Kennedy wanted to change Social Security to make it fairer \nfor women and to extend the Equal Rights Amendment so we would be \nincluded in the Constitution.\n  It was amazing the issues he fought for then and that he continued to \nfight for all his life. In the time I knew him, I knew him not just as \na news clip, but I found him to be truly gallant in public and in \nprivate--caring about others and modest about himself, always about \ngrace, courage, and valor.\n\n  When I came to the Senate, I was the only Democratic woman, and he \nwas there for me, but I saw how he was there for so many other people. \nIn 2004, when we were in Boston, Ted Kennedy and I had lunch in the \nNorth End. It was one of our favorite things, to get together for a \nmeal and for conversation. What I realized then--as we enjoyed \nourselves with big plates of antipasto; always vowing that we would eat \nmore of the salad and less of the pasta--as we got up and left and \nwalked around the North End, is that his best ideas came from the \npeople. It was his passion for people. I knew he represented those \nbrainy people in Cambridge who went to Harvard and who often came up \nthrough the Kennedy School with those great ideas. But as I walked \naround the neighborhoods with him, I saw he actually listened to \npeople, trailed by a staff person who was actually taking notes.\n  As we walked down the street, there was the man who came up and who \ntalked about his mother's problem with Social Security. Take it down, \nhe said. Let's see what we can do. We walked down a few feet more. Oh, \nmy grandson wants to go to West Point; how does he apply? He said: He \nis going to love it and he is going to love my process. Let's see how \nwe can do that. A few feet on down, the small business guy said: Keep \non fighting, Ted. You know I can't buy this health insurance. Can I \ncall you? Always call me, he said. And by the way, don't forget to call \nBarbara--the legendary Barbara Souliotis. And all of us know Ted \nKennedy had an outstanding staff, whether it was the staff in \nMassachusetts, who took care of casework and projects and day-to-day \nneeds, or the staff in Washington who helped Ted Kennedy take the ideas \nthat came from the people, their day-to-day struggles, and converted \nthem into national policy. That is what it was--people, people, people.\n  When I came to the Senate, it was only Nancy Kassebaum and I. We were \nthe only two women. He was a great friend, along with Senator Sarbanes. \nThey were people I called my Galahads--people who helped me get on the \nright committees, show me the inner workings of the Senate. Ted was \ndetermined I would be on his Committee on Health and Education to get \nthe ideas passed, but he also was determined I would get on the \nAppropriations Committee to make sure we put those ideas into the \nFederal checkbook. He was my advocate.\n  One of the things that was clear is, he was the champion for women. \nHe was a champion for this woman in helping me get on those committees. \nAnd during those sometimes rough days getting started, he would take me \nto La Colline with Senator Dodd, and while he drank orange juice with a \nlittle vodka--so no one would know he had a little vodka--he was giving \nme shooters of Chardonnay to boost my spirits. He and Chris would give \nme a pep talk, and I felt like I was Rocky. They would say: Get out \nthere, fight; don't let it get you down. Pick yourself up. I felt like \nI was going to spit in the bucket and get back on the floor. He lifted \nmy spirits, just like he lifted the spirits of so many.\n  The story I wish to conclude with--because there are so many issues \nwe worked on together--is when I went to him and said: Ted, did you \nknow that women are not included in the protocols at NIH? He said: What \ndo you mean? I said: In all the research we do, women are not included \nin the protocols. They just finished a famous study which said to take \nan aspirin a day, keep a heart attack away. It included 10,000 male \nmedical students and not one woman. I said: I want to change that. \nTeaming up with Nancy and Pat Schroeder and Olympia Snowe and Connie \nMorella, who were in the House, he helped me create the Office of \nWomen's Health at NIH so women would always be included in those \nprotocols.\n  Then we spoke out and said: Ted, the health care research for breast \ncancer is low. That is why they are racing for the cure. He helped us, \nworking with Tom Harkin, to boost the money for research and to also \nget mammogram quality standards through so that when a woman would get \nher mammogram, it would be safe.\n  But here is one of the most profound things we did, again working on \na bipartisan basis. Dr. Bernadine Healy, who was the head of NIH, \nwanted to do a study on the consequences of hormone therapy. Ted and I \nand Tom did not believe we should earmark NIH--and I believe that \ntoday--but we made sure we put money and a legislative framework in \nplace so Dr. Healy could institute the famous hormone therapy study. \nWell, let me tell you the consequences of that. That study has changed \nmedical practice. That study has resulted in breast cancer rates going \ndown 15 percent.\n  So when someone says: What did Ted Kennedy do to help women? What did \nTeddy Kennedy do to work with Barbara Mikulski? Tell them we worked \ntogether and we worked to save the lives of women, one million at a \ntime. This is my final salute to Senator Kennedy on the floor, but I \nwill always salute him every day in the Senate to make sure we continue \nwhat he said about how the dream will continue on.\n  I ended my speech at the Democratic Convention in 1980 when I said \nthis--and I end my remarks today by saying this: Edward Kennedy has \nkept his faith with the American people. He hasn't waited for a crisis \nto emerge or a constituency to develop. He always led, he always acted, \nhe always inspires.\n  God bless you, Ted. And God bless the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to join \nwith my colleagues, and I see quite a number on the Senate floor now, \nto pay tribute to Ted Kennedy. He was a truly remarkable force in the \nSenate, a champion of liberalism--perhaps the Nation's leading champion \nof liberalism. He believed government could serve the people, and it \nought to do more to serve people. On that we sometimes disagreed, but \nhe believed it with a sincerity and he battled for it with a \nconsistency that is remarkable. He constantly sought to utilize the \nability of government to do good for the American people, and that is \nadmirable.\n  He also was a champion of civil rights. He was a force during the \ncivil rights movement, and his activities, his personal leadership, \ntruly made a difference in making this a better country. Without his \nleadership, things would have been much more difficult for sure.\n  I have a vivid memory of him--presiding as I did when I first came to \nthe Senate, a duty given to the younger, newer Members--in the night, \nTed Kennedy, alone on the Senate floor, roaring away for the values he \nbelieved in. It was just something to behold, in my view. I saw nothing \nlike it from, maybe, any other Member. He had served so many years in \nthe Senate--and I learned today from our chairman on Judiciary, Senator \nLeahy, that he served on the Senate Judiciary Committee longer than any \nother Senator in history. But even as his years went by, many years in \nthe Senate, he did\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\nnot lose the drive, the will, the energy, the commitment to give of \nhimself for the values he believed in.\n  As I told one reporter after his death, I would just hope to be \nsomewhat as effective in promoting the values I believed in as he was \nin promoting those values. If we disagreed, and sometimes we certainly \ndid, people continued to admire him, I think, to a unique degree. There \nwere no hard feelings. You would battle away, and then afterwards it \nwould be a respectful relationship between Senators. I think that is \npretty unusual and something that is worthy of commenting on.\n  He talked to me about being a cosponsor, his prime cosponsor on a \nbill. He said he wanted to work with me on something important. It was \na bill we commonly referred to as the prison rape bill. There was a lot \nof concern that in prisons, people who are arrested were subjected to \nsexual abuse. That, in my view, is not acceptable. I know the Presiding \nOfficer, a prosecutor, knows people deserve to do their time in jail, \nbut they should never be subjected to those kinds of abuses. So we \npassed a pretty comprehensive bill. I was proud of it and proud to be \nwith him at the signing ceremony.\n  I also talked to him and we met and talked at some length about a \nmajor piece of legislation to increase savings in America, savings for \nthe average working American who had not been able to share in the \ngrowth of wealth that so many have been blessed with in this country. I \nthought we had some pretty good ideas. Savings at that time had fallen \nbelow zero--actually 1 percent negative use of people's savings which \nwere going away. I guess now we are at 5 or 6 percent savings rate \nafter this turmoil we have had economically. I do not think the idea \nshould go away. Maybe it lost a little steam in the fact that we have \nseen a resurgence of savings today, but I was very impressed with his \ncommitment to it, the work of his fine staff, and his personal \nknowledge of the issue.\n  I see my other colleagues. I will join with them in expressing my \nsincere sympathy to Vicki and their entire family for their great loss. \nThe Senate has lost a great warrior and a great champion of American \nvalues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the period of \nmorning business be extended to 2:30 p.m., with Senators permitted to \nspeak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I look around this Chamber, I see men \nand women of remarkable talents and abilities. I also have a strong \nsense, we all do, that there is a tremendous void now in our midst. A \nvery special Senator, a very special friend, a Member who played a \nunique role within this body for nearly a half century is no longer \nwith us.\n  We have had many glowing and richly earned tributes to Senator Ted \nKennedy over these last couple of weeks. He was not only the most \naccomplished and effective Senator of the last 50 years, he was truly \none of the towering figures in the entire history of the Senate. Yet \nfor all his accomplishments, for all the historic bills he authored and \nshepherded into law, for all the titanic battles he fought, I will \nremember Ted Kennedy first and foremost as just a good and decent human \nbeing.\n  I remember his extraordinary generosity, his courage, his passion, \nhis capacity for friendship and caring, and, of course, that great \nsense of humor. I remember one time I was in my office and we had a \nphone conversation. It was about a disagreement we had. It was right at \nSt. Patrick's Day so we were having this discussion on the phone and \ntempers got a little heated. I think I was holding the phone out about \nlike this. He probably was too. I think our voices got raised to a very \nhigh decibel level, sort of yelling at each other, and pretty soon we \njust hung up on each other.\n  I felt very badly; I know he did too. So several hours later, when I \ncame on the Senate floor and I saw Ted at his desk, I went up to him, I \npulled up a chair next to him. He would get that kind of pixie smile on \nhis face, have a twinkle in his eye.\n  I said: Ted, I'm sorry about that conversation we had. I should not \nhave lost my temper as I did. I said: My staff is a little concerned \nabout our relationship.\n  He sort of got that great smile and chuckled. Well, he said, forget \nabout it. I just told my staff that is just the way two Irish men \ncelebrate St. Patrick's Day.\n  That is just the way he was. He could disarm you immediately and you \nwould move on. He had a great disarming sense of humor.\n  Ted came from a remarkable family--so many tough breaks, so many \ntriumphs, so many contributions to our Nation--both in war and in \npeace. Ted and his siblings were born into great wealth. They could \nhave lived lives of luxury and leisure, but they chose instead to \ndevote themselves to public service. They devoted themselves to making \nthe world a better place for others, especially those in the shadows of \nlife.\n  There are so many things I could focus on this morning in my brief \nremarks, but I want to focus on just one aspect of Ted Kennedy: all \nthat he did to improve the lives of people with disabilities in our \ncountry. I thought about this: With the death of Eunice Kennedy Shriver \non August 11, and all she did to found the Special Olympics now being \ncarried on by her son Tim, then the death of Ted on August 25, people \nwith disabilities in this country lost two great champions.\n  Their sister Rosemary lived her entire life with a severe \nintellectual disability. The entire Kennedy family is well acquainted \nwith the joys and struggles of those with disabilities. Those of us who \nwere in the church in Boston at the funeral--and those probably \nwatching on television--heard the very eloquent speech by Teddy Jr. \nabout his battle with cancer at a young age, losing his leg and his \nconfronting his disabilities, and how Ted helped him get through that.\n\n  In 1975, Senator Kennedy helped to pass what is now called the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA. In 1978 he passed \nlegislation expanding the jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Commission \nto protect people from discrimination on the basis of disability. In \n1980 he introduced the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, \nprotecting the rights of people in government institutions, including \nthe elderly and people with intellectual and mental disabilities.\n  Nineteen years ago he was one of my most important leaders and \npartners in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act--1990. I will \nnever forget, after I had been in the Senate for 2 years, Republicans \nwere in charge, and then in 1986 Democrats came back, took charge, and \nSenator Kennedy wanted me on his education and health committee. I sort \nof played a little hard to get.\n  I said: Well, maybe, but I am really interested in disability issues. \nHe knew about that. He knew about my work on some of the stuff I had \ndone in the House before I came here, especially for people with \nhearing problems. I said I would like to come on his committee, but I \nsaid I would be interested in working on disability issues.\n  He got back to me and said: Tell you what, I have the Disability \nPolicy Subcommittee and you can chair it.\n  I am a freshman Senator. He didn't have to do that for me. I was \nastounded at his great generosity. So I have always appreciated that. \nHe had already had this great, extensive record on disability issues. \nYet he let me take the lead. Then when the Americans with Disabilities \nAct came up, he could have taken that himself. He was the chairman of \nthe committee.\n  As I said, he had this long history of championing the causes of \npeople with disabilities. Yet he knew how passionately I felt about it, \nand he let me author the bill. He let me take it on the floor. He let \nme be the floor manager of it and put my name on it. He didn't have to \ndo that. He was the chairman. He could have had his name on it. He \ncould have floor-managed it. But he let me do it in spite of the fact \nthat I was just a freshman Senator.\n  He was an indispensable leader in bringing disparate groups together \nto get the Americans with Disabilities Act passed. I will never forget \nthat great act of generosity on his part in letting me take the lead.\n  Ted always insisted that our focus should be not on disability but on \nability; that people with disabilities must be fully included in our \nAmerican family. Americans with disabilities had no\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nbetter friend, no tougher fighter, no more relentless champion than Ted \nKennedy.\n  Yesterday I accepted the chairmanship of the Senate HELP Committee, \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. It is a great \nhonor and a great challenge and, I must add, somewhat daunting to carry \non the legacy of Senator Ted Kennedy. He dedicated his life to making \nour economy work for all Americans, to secure a quality education for \nevery child and, of course, securing quality, affordable health care \nfor every citizen as a right and not a privilege.\n  In the Democratic cloakroom, there is a page from the Cape Cod Times \nwith a wonderful picture of Ted and a quote from him. Here is the \nquote:\n\n       Since I was a boy I have known the joy of sailing the \n     waters of Cape Cod and for all my years in public life I have \n     believed that America must sail toward the shores of liberty \n     and justice for all. There is no end to that journey, only \n     the next great voyage.\n\n  We have heard many eloquent tributes to Senator Kennedy. But the \ntribute that would matter most for him would be for his colleagues to \ncome together, on a bipartisan basis, to pass a strong, comprehensive \nhealth reform bill this year.\n\n  It is time for us to sail ahead on this next great voyage to a better \nand more just and more caring America. So as we sadly contemplate the \nempty desk draped in black, we say farewell to a beloved colleague. He \nis no longer with us, but his work continues. His spirit is here. And \nas he said, the cause endures.\n  May Ted Kennedy rest in peace. But may we not rest until we have \ncompleted the cause of his life, the cause he fought for until his last \nbreath, ensuring quality, affordable health care for every American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are going \nback and forth. If Senator Lautenberg will let me go, I will not talk \nlong, if that is appropriate.\n  Today is a day to remember a colleague, a friend, someone whom it was \na challenge to oppose and a joy to work with, and I wish we were not \nhere today talking about the passing of Senator Kennedy.\n  We disagreed on most things but found common ground on big things. \nAnd everyone has a story about Senator Kennedy. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion about his life, the legacy, his human failings, which we all \nhave, his self-inflicted wounds, and his contribution to the country. \nBut I want to talk about what will be missing in the Senate.\n  We had a giant of a man who was very principled but understood the \nSenate as well as anyone I have ever met; he understood the need to \ngive and take to move the country forward.\n  My experience with Senator Kennedy was, I used his image in my \ncampaign to get elected, like every other Republican did. We do not \nwant another person up to help Ted Kennedy. And he loved it. He got \nmore air time than the candidates themselves. He loved it.\n  I remember him telling me a story about Senator Hollings. The \ntradition in the Senate is when you get reelected, you have your fellow \nSenator from that State follow you down to the well. He went over to \nSenator Hollings and said: I want you to come down and escort me.\n  He said: Why? I am from South Carolina.\n  He said: In my campaign you were. You were the other Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Ted got a lot of fun out of that. I think he appreciated the role he \nplayed, and Republicans, almost to a person, would use Senator Kennedy \nin their campaigns.\n  But when they got here, they understood Senator Kennedy was someone \nyou wanted to do business with. If you had a bill that you thought \nwould need some bipartisan support, Senator Kennedy is the first person \nyou would think of. And you had to understand the limitations on what \nhe could help you with. He was not going to help you with certain \nthings, because it ran counter to what he believe in. But where you \ncould find common grounds on the big issues, you had no better ally \nthan Senator Kennedy.\n  We met in the President's Room every morning during the immigration \ndebate, and at night he would call me up and say: Lindsey, tomorrow in \nour meeting you need to yell at me because you need to get something. I \nunderstand that. I will fight back. But you will get it.\n  The next day he would say: I need to yell at you. It was sort of like \nall-star wrestling, to be honest with you, and that was fun. Because he \nunderstood how far I could go, and he challenged me to go as far as I \ncould. But he never asked me to go farther than I was capable of going. \nAnd, in return, he would walk the plank for you.\n  We had votes on the floor of the Senate on emotion-driven amendments \ndesigned to break the bill apart from the right and the left. I walked \nthe plank on the right because I knew he would walk the plank on the \nleft. He voted against amendments he probably agreed with, but he \nunderstood that the deal would come unraveled.\n  The only thing I can tell you about Senator Kennedy, without any \nhesitation is if he told you he would do something, that is all you \nneeded to hear. A handshake from him was better than a video deposition \nfrom most people. I do not how to say it any more directly than that.\n  Opposing him was a lot of fun because he understood that a give-and-\ntake to move a ball forward was part of democracy, but standing your \nground and planting your feet and telling the other side, in a \nrespectful way, to go to hell, was also part of democracy. And he could \ndo it with the best of them. But he could also take a punch as well as \ngive one.\n  So what we are missing today in the Senate is the spirit of Ted \nKennedy when it comes to standing up for what you believe and being \nable to work with somebody who you disagree with on an issue very \nimportant to the country.\n  If he were alive today, the health care debate would be different. \nThat is not a slam on anybody involved, because this is hard. I do not \nknow if he could deliver, but I think it would be different and I think \nit would be more hopeful.\n  The immigration bill failed. But he told me: I have been through this \na lot. Hard things are hard for a reason, and it will take a long time. \nHe indicated to me that the immigration debate had all the emotion of \nthe civil rights debate. And that was not something he said lightly.\n  We sat in that room with Senator Kyl and Senator Salazar and a group \nof Senators who came and went, and the administration officials, \nHomeland Security Secretary Chertoff, and Commerce Secretary Gutierrez, \nand we wrote it line by line with our staffs sitting on the wall.\n  It was what I thought the government was supposed to be like in ninth \ngrade civics. It was one of the highlights of my political life to be \nable to sit in that room with Senator Kennedy and other Senators and \nliterally try to write a bill that was difficult.\n  We failed for the moment. But we are going to reform our immigration \nsystem. And the guts of that bill, the balance we have achieved, will \nbe the starting point for a new debate. Most of it will become law one \nday, because it is the ultimate give and take and it made a lot of \nsense.\n  I say his wife Vicki, I got to know Ted later in his life. Through \nhim I got to know you. I know you are hurting now. But I hope that all \nof the things being said by his colleagues and the people at large are \nreassuring to you, and that as we move forward as a Senate, when you \nlook at the history of this body, which is long and distinguished, \naround here there are all kinds of busts of people who have done great \nthings during challenging times.\n  I will bet everything I own that Senator Kennedy, when the history of \nthis body is written, will be at the top echelon of Senators who have \never served. The point is that you can be liberal as you want to be, \nyou can be as conservative as you want to be, and you can be as \neffective as you want to be. If you want to be liberal and effective, \nyou can be. If you want to be liberal and ineffective, you can choose \nthat route too. The same for being conservative. You do not have to \nchoose. That is what Senator Kennedy taught this body, and I think what \nhe demonstrated to anybody who wants to come and be a Senator. So if \nyou are a left-of-center politician looking for a\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\nrole model, pick Ted Kennedy. You could be liberal, proudly so, but you \nalso could be effective.\n  What I am going to try to do with my time up here is be a \nconservative who can be effective. That is the best tribute I can give \nto Senator Kennedy--being somebody on the right who will meet in the \nmiddle for the good of the country.\n  Ted will be missed but he will not be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this corner of the Senate has become a \nlonely place. I sat next to Ted Kennedy here for a number of years. We \nmiss him. We miss his camaraderie, his humor, his candor, most of all \nhis courage. And though he will not be here to join us in the future, \nthe things he did will last for decades because they were so powerful. \nHe was a constant presence here. It is hard to imagine the Senate \nwithout Ted Kennedy's vibrant voice resounding throughout this floor or \nhis roaring laughter spilling out of the cloakroom.\n  Without doubt he was one of the finest legislators ever in this \nChamber's history. Throughout his more than 46 years of service, Ted \nintroduced 2,500 bills and shepherded more than 550 of those into law. \nHe was a man of many gifts, but his greatest had to be his remarkable \naffinity for ordinary people.\n  I saw that gift firsthand in 1982 when I was making my first run for \nthe Senate. A rally was being held for me in Newark, NJ, and it drew a \ncrowd of thousands. I wanted to think that they were there for me, but \nit was obvious that they were there for Ted Kennedy.\n  The warmth, the affection with which he was received in this city far \nfrom the borders of Massachusetts, far from the halls of power in \nWashington, was amazing to witness. It was fitting that Ted came to \nNewark to help me campaign because he inspired me to devote myself to \npublic service. He encouraged my entry into the Senate.\n  As soon as I joined the Senate, Ted Kennedy became a source of \nknowledge, and information, and wisdom. He was a seatmate of mine here \nin the Senate, and freely offered ideas on creating and moving \nlegislation that I thought of or sponsored.\n  Even though he was born into privilege and was part of a powerful \npolitical family, his fight was always for the workers, for justice, \nand for those often forgotten. He was never shy to chase one down and \ndemand your vote or to call you on the phone and insist on your \nsupport. Sometimes he would try to bring you to his side through \nreason, other times it was through righteous fury. Ted was such a \ntenacious fighter for a cause in which he believed that he would often \nput on the gloves no matter who the opponent might be.\n  But he never let disagreement turn into a personal vendetta. No \nmatter how bitter the fight, when it was done, he could walk across the \nChamber ready to shake hands with his opponents, and was received with \naffection and respect.\n  Despite his reputation as a divisive figure, he was at the top of the \nlist of popular Senators beloved by both Republicans and Democrats. He \ncarried a great sense of humor. He liked to play pranks, one of which I \nsaw up close and personal. One Thursday night after a long series of \nvotes, we chartered an airplane to take Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, \nSenator Claiborne Pell, and me north to join our vacationing families \nin the area.\n  A week later we were here in the Chamber, and Claiborne Pell came \nover to me, hands shaking, with a letter in his hand. I looked at the \nletter. It was my stationery. On that stationery it asked for Claiborne \nPell, a frugal man, to pay a far greater share of the total than was \noriginally agreed to. I was embarrassed, mortified. I quickly declared \nthat it was wrong and apologized profusely. And then I went to Ted to \nassure him that if he got a letter such as that, the letter was \nincorrect. Ted turned belligerent. He reminded me of the help he \nprovided in my first election and asked: How could I nickel and dime \nhim after all of that help. He turned on his heel, walked away red-\nfaced, and then I realized it was part of the creation of a plot to \nembarrass me. The two of us broke into laughter so loud, so \nboisterously, that the Presiding Officer demanded that we leave the \nChamber.\n  Ted Kennedy's love of life was always obvious in the Senate. Even \nthough he could rise above partisan division, his life's work was \ndeeply personal. It was Ted Kennedy who inherited the family legacy \nwhen two brothers were slain by assassins' bullets. He met that \nchallenge by battling the powerful special interests to pass the Gun \nControl Act of 1968, which made it illegal for criminals and the \nmentally ill to buy guns.\n  Together Ted and I joined the fight to keep our streets safe from the \nscourge of gun violence. For decades, he was a force that shaped the \nnational political landscape. He crafted life-changing legislation year \nafter year, always fighting to shape public opinion toward his causes. \nHe believed public service was a sacred mission and the role of a \nleader was to make progress. No matter how hard, no matter how long the \njourney, he persisted.\n  In fact, Ted Kennedy's signature talent was his precise, unmatched \nability to get legislation passed. And he did that through the timeless \nrequirements of this profession: preparation, integrity, fairness, \npatience, hard work, a little bit of table pounding and a profound \nrespect for his colleagues and his constituents.\n  I had the privilege of working with Ted Kennedy on many pieces of \ngroundbreaking legislation. We worked closely on fighting big tobacco \nand their attempts to seduce children into a lifetime of addiction. We \nreached the high watermark in that struggle earlier this year, when a \nlaw was passed that gives the FDA the power to regulate tobacco. It was \nsomething we worked on together for a long time. We stood together on \nother struggles, from the creation of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram to the Ryan White Act, to the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  Think about it: Without Ted Kennedy, nearly 7 million children would \nnot have health insurance. Think about it: Without Ted Kennedy, half a \nmillion Americans suffering with HIV would not be receiving vital \nservices to cope with their disease. Think about it: Without Ted \nKennedy, more than 60 million workers would not have the right to take \ntime off from their job to care for a baby or a loved one or even \nreceive personal medical treatment.\n  And he did more. He gave people assurance that the government was on \ntheir side.\n  Ted Kennedy was the guardian of opportunity. Look at his decades-long \ncampaign to increase the minimum wage.\n  He will forever be remembered as a leader who persevered despite some \nfrailties, who remained a tower of strength despite crippling personal \ntragedy.\n  Nothing symbolized his fortitude more than his first major speech on \nthe Senate floor, which came on the heels of President Kennedy's \nassassination.\n  Then, despite all he was facing personally, he fought for passage of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 to outlaw discrimination in employment, \neducation and public accommodations.\n  From there, Ted Kennedy became inextricably tied to the struggle for \nequal rights.\n  He was the chief sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n  Ted Kennedy was also a leader in the passage of the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965.\n  This law abolished literacy tests at the polls and guaranteed the \nprotection of all Americans' right to vote.\n  In 1982, he was the chief sponsor of the Voting Rights Amendments Act \nwhich led the way to greater minority representation in Congress and \nstate legislatures.\n  That law, in no small way, made it more likely that Barack Obama \nwould become President of the United States. We are grateful the last \nKennedy brother had a chance to see America rise above racism, above \nprejudice. He had a chance, the last of the Kennedy brothers in office, \nto see President Obama take that oath. It was a proud moment for him \nand for all of us.\n  As his life came to an end, Ted said he saw a new wave of change all \naround us. He promised us that if we kept our compass true, we could \nreach our destination. In the days and the weeks and the months to \ncome, the years to come, decades to come, we have to keep Ted Kennedy's \ncause alive. It is the cause\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\nof breaking gridlock to get things done. It is the cause of expanding \nhealth care as a right and not a privilege. It is the cause of bringing \nhope and justice and prosperity to all.\n  We are likely never to see the likes of a Ted Kennedy again. But I am \nconfident we can rise to the challenge the people's Senator set for us \nand carry on for those who remember him, for those, yes, who miss him, \nfor those who loved him, and for those who will always need a champion \nlike Ted Kennedy.\n  Finally, if there was a demonstration of his humanity, the funeral \ntribute was one of enormous love and respect. It was enunciated \nparticularly, because I road with other Senators on the bus, by the \nhoards of people standing by the curbside with signs of gratitude for \nhis contribution to the life and well-being of America. We are thankful \nfor that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, on August 25, a towering figure on our national \npolitical landscape left us. Edward Moore Kennedy succumbed to a \nmalignant brain tumor after an 18-month battle for his life. As I look \nnow at his desk, draped with black cloth and covered with flowers, I \nstill have difficulty believing that he is gone. My ebullient Irish-to-\nthe-core friend has departed this life forever. How bleakly somber. How \nutterly final. How totally unlike Ted Kennedy in life.\n  Ted Kennedy in life was a force of nature--a cheerful, inquisitive, \ncaring man, who never accepted somberness for long or the finality of \nanything. His energetic adherence to perseverance, his plain dogged \ndetermination, his ability to rise from the ashes of whatever new \nhorrific event accosted him, always with grace, and usually with a \nliberal dose of humor, were his trademarks. It was almost as if Ted \nKennedy were at the top of his form when coping with adversity. Life \nitself inspired him. He believed that life was a contact sport, but \nthat it should never be played without joy in the game itself. That is \nhow he saw politics as well.\n  Ted Kennedy and I were friends and, yet, we were the oddest of odd \ncouples. He was the scion of a wealthy and storied family. I am a coal \nminer's son who had no bottom rungs in my ladder. In earlier years we \nwere rivals.\n  What Ted and I discovered, though, was that somehow we had many \nthings in common--a love of history; an affection for poetry; a \nfondness for dogs; a commitment to the less fortunate in our society. \nMany will speak of Ted's stunning Senate career, his huge and lasting \nimpact on our culture, his domination of the political scene for so \nmany, many decades. By all means, let us never forget Ted Kennedy's \nextraordinary contribution to this great country. It is largely \nunmatched.\n  But I will especially cherish the personal side of this big man, with \nhis infectious laugh, his booming voice, and his passion for the things \nand the people that he cared about. I will remember the dog lover who \nbrought Sunny and Splash to my office to visit. I will recall a \nconsiderate friend who sent dozens of roses to mark my wedding \nanniversary or a special birthday. I will again enjoy a very special \nrecitation of the ``Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.'' By habit, I shall \nimmediately look for Ted Kennedy whenever I enter this Chamber. In a \nthousand ways large and small he will simply be deeply, deeply missed.\n  My heart goes out to his steadfast wife Vickie and to his wonderful \nfamily. His spirit surely lives on in all of you.\n  Not long ago, I picked up a book of poetry which Ted Kennedy had \ngiven to me in July of 1996. It bore this inscription:\n  ``To Bob, the master of our legislative poetry who has already left \nso many extraordinary Footprints on the Sands of Time.'' After that, \nTed had written, ``See page 371.''\n  I close with a few stanzas from ``a Psalm of Life'' on page 371 of \nTed's gift to me:\n\n     Life is real! Life is earnest!\n     And the grave is not its goal;\n     Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\n     Was not spoken of the soul.\n\n     . . . .\n\n     Lives of great men all remind us\n     We can make our lives sublime,\n     And, departing, leave behind us\n     Footprints on the sands of time;\n\n     Footprints, that perhaps another,\n     Sailing o'er life's solemn main,\n     A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\n     Seeing, shall take heart again.\n\n     Let us, then, be up and doing,\n     With a heart for any fate;\n     Still achieving, still pursuing,\n     Learn to labor and to wait.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I have been very fortunate in my life \nin public service to witness a lot of historical events, but none \nparallels the tribute that was just paid by one icon of the U.S. Senate \nto another Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  I rise to pay my respects to the late Senator Ted Kennedy. As one of \nmy colleagues said earlier, it is a little bit ironic, when you come to \nthe Senate you find out that those with whom you have significant \npolitical disagreements are folks you get to know well and you have the \nopportunity to work with.\n  I am sure during my political campaign for the U.S. Senate Ted \nKennedy raised me a lot of money by virtue of the fact that I would \ncite him in my fundraising mailouts because, coming from a very \nconservative part of the country, it was popular to cite the liberal \nMembers of the Senate and say you needed to be there to counteract \nthem. But when I came to the Senate--and certainly Senator Kennedy and \nI do come from opposite ends of the political spectrum--I learned very \nquickly from Senator Kennedy what the Senate is all about.\n  I was here about, gee, it could not have been but a couple of days--\nsomething less than 48 hours--when I was notified that I was going to \nbe on the Judiciary Committee and that I would be the chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee on Judiciary and my ranking member would be \nTed Kennedy.\n  Senator Kennedy came to me on the floor, within a few hours of me \nbeing notified of that, and he said: Saxby, you and I need to sit down. \nLet's discuss some immigration issues that we want to accomplish during \nthe next 2 years. I just want to talk with you about it, get your \nthoughts and give you my thoughts.\n  I said: Well, sure, Ted, that will be great. I will be happy to come \nto your office and sit down with you.\n  He said no. He said: Saxby, that is not the way the Senate works. You \nare the chairman. I will come to your office.\n  So the next day, a Senator who had been in office for well over 40 \nyears came to the office of a Member of the Senate who had been here a \nlittle over 40 hours and sat down and had a conversation. That was a \nlesson about the way the Senate works that I will never forget.\n  We began working together on the Immigration Subcommittee, and we \nworked for about a year--it was in excess of a year, I guess--on an \nissue we talked about the very first day in my office. It involved the \nexpansion of the L-1/H-1B visas. At that time, our economy was booming \nand businesses across our country needed access to more employees who \nhad a specialized expertise.\n  We were successful in ultimately striking a compromise. It was \ndifficult for Ted because the leftwing of his party was very much in \nopposition to what we were doing, and it was somewhat, although a \nlittle bit less, difficult for me because the rightwing of my party was \nin opposition to what we were doing.\n  Ted called me up one day after we had finished our negotiations, and \nhe was laughing, and he said: Saxby, I have to tell you, we have \nentered into an agreement on this, and I am going to do exactly what I \ntold you I would do, but, boy, am I ever getting beat up by the far \nleft in my party. They are just killing me. He said: It is to the point \nwhere I am up for reelection next year, and you may have to come to \nMassachusetts and campaign for me.\n  We kind of laughed about that.\n  Well, 2 days later, I had been besieged with phone calls from \nultraconservative folks from my State, and I called Ted up, and I said: \nWell, Ted, you will not believe this, but I am getting beat up over \nthat same issue by ultraconservatives in my party. But don't worry, I \ndon't need you to come to Georgia to campaign for me.\n  Well, he laughed about that like I had never heard him laugh. The \nvery last conversation I had with him to\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\nany extent was when he was here for President Obama's inauguration, and \nhe reminded me of that story. He never forgot that.\n  I also have a very fond memory of Ted by virtue of the fact that my \ngrandchildren were 8 and 6 years old when I first came to the Senate, \nand we had this ice cream social out in the park across from the \nRussell building where his office was and my office is. In fact, his \noffice was directly below mine. I am walking back from the ice cream \nsocial with my grandchildren--who were here for that because it happens \nat the same time as the White House picnic--and Ted is driving off in \nhis car, and he sees me coming across with my grandchildren. He stops \nthe car, gets out, and he says: Saxby, these must be your \ngrandchildren.\n  I said: They are.\n  He said: Well, I want my dogs to see them and them have a chance to \nmeet my dogs.\n  So he got out of the car and got the dogs out, and my grandchildren \njust loved playing with those dogs.\n  Every year after that--I never called him--he called me because he \nknew that when the White House picnic was going on, my grandchildren \nwould be here, and he would insist on bringing the dogs up when the \ngrandchildren were here so they would have a chance to play with them. \nThat is just the kind of guy Ted was. It was a much softer side than \nwhat we have seen so many times with Ted with his passionate debates \nand whatnot.\n  Lastly, let me mention another anecdote I will always remember. I was \ngoing down to speak to the Hibernian Society in Savannah, which has the \nsecond largest St. Patrick's Day parade in the United States. It is a \nbig deal. We have about 1,000 folks who are at the Hibernian Society \ndinner that I was going to speak to. All you do is you go in and you \ntell jokes.\n  Well, I needed a bunch of Irish jokes, so I called up Ted and I told \nhim what I was doing, and I said: I know you must have a book of Irish \njokes.\n  He said: I do. I am going to send it to you. And he said: I will tell \nyou something else you need to do. I know Savannah is a very \nconservative part of the world, and you are going to see in these jokes \nthat you will have an opportunity to point out somebody to kind of poke \nfun at. He said: Every time you have an opportunity in telling these \njokes, you use my name.\n  Well, I took him at his word, and I did. And, boy, did I ever get a \nrousing welcome from all those Irish men in Savannah, GA.\n  So I have very great and fond memories of a man who certainly came \nfrom a different part of the country than where I come from, who came \nfrom a very different political background than where I come from, and \nsomebody who certainly had much more political experience than I will \never have. But the thing I appreciated in Ted Kennedy was--and I have \nsaid this often--he was the best legislator in this body. When Ted \nKennedy told you something, you could take it to the bank. You never \nhad to worry about it thereafter.\n  While we disagreed on many things, we agreed on some things and were \nable to work together in a very unusual way. Even when we disagreed, we \nwere able to walk out of this Chamber and still be friends.\n  To Vicki and Patrick and the children, Ted was a great American, a \ngreat guy, and he is going to be missed in this body. He was a true \ninspiration to a lot of us, and we are going to miss that compromising \naspect of Ted Kennedy that will not be here even though someone else \nwill take up the mantle.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as I sit here and listen to the \nremarks of my colleagues and I look over at that black velvet-draped \ndesk, with the pristine white roses, and the poem by Robert Frost, and \nI think about the past 17 years I have been here and have looked up--\nand perhaps it is late at night, perhaps it is in the morning, perhaps \nit is in the afternoon--and Senator Kennedy is at his desk and he is \ntalking about a bill he cares a great deal about--and, as Senator \nLautenberg had said earlier, he introduced 550 bills that became law. \nAround here, you can introduce a bill, and maybe it goes somewhere and \nmaybe it does not. You can introduce a bill, and maybe it is a small \nbill, but introducing a big bill that goes somewhere, that passes the \nHouse and is signed by the President of the United States, is not a \nsmall feat.\n  I listened to Senator Byrd, and in the past he has spoken about lions \nof the Senate. Ted Kennedy was a lion of the Senate.\n  During 47 years--and this morning in the Judiciary Committee, we \nlearned he had been the longest serving member--during 47 years, if you \nlook at the big bills: the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, which \nenabled people with mental illnesses to live in their communities with \nminimal hospital care; the Children's Health Insurance Program, which \nhas been spoken about, which provided health insurance to uninsured \nchildren of low-income families; the commitment to health care reform \nthat did not diminish even as he suffered through terminal illness; his \ndedication to education, he was a leader in the landmark Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which established the Federal Government's \ncommitment to fund school for poor children in public schools; No Child \nLeft Behind, widely hailed as the greatest example of bipartisan \ncooperation during the Bush administration; the bill he did with Orrin \nHatch, the Serve America Act, the greatest expansion of national \nservice since the New Deal--it goes on and on and on, big bills, bills \nthat changed people's lives, not just in a county or a city but all \nacross this great land.\n  In civil rights, as you look across at that desk, he had no peers. He \nwould stand up, and I would watch: The lower jaw would quiver slightly, \nand he would begin, and there would be the thunderous tones, either in \nthe Judiciary Committee or here on the floor, that would fill the room, \nfilled with passion, filled with conviction, filled with determination.\n  He played a major role in every civil rights battle in this Congress \nfor 40 years. Who else can say that? He fought for people of color, for \nwomen, for gays and lesbians, for those seeking religious liberty. His \namendments to the Voting Rights Act in 1982 led to significant \nincreases in minority representation in elective office. He was a major \nsponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act to ensure that millions \nof disabled Americans could live productive lives. These are not small \nbills; these are big bills--the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which \nstrengthened civil rights protections against discrimination and \nharassment in the workplace; again, a big bill which became law.\n  I was part of that small group of Senators who met on immigration \nreform hour after hour in small hot rooms. I watched Senator Kennedy \nwith his sleeves rolled back, when he would sit back and wait for just \nthe right time to move or change the tenor of the discussion. True, \nthat was one that was not successful, but it wasn't because he did not \ntry.\n  Seventeen years ago, Joe Biden asked me if I would be the first woman \non the Senate Judiciary Committee. I had the honor of doing it. Ted \nKennedy was No. 2 in seniority sitting on that committee. I saw his \ncommitment firsthand. It was very special. You see, I was a volunteer \nin the campaign for John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I was a full-time \nvolunteer for Bobby Kennedy for his campaign. I saw the Nation ripped \napart by these double assassinations. I saw Senator Kennedy, in \naddition to being a lion in the Senate, become a surrogate father to \nnieces and nephews. I saw him accept this mantle with great enthusiasm, \nwith great love, and with a commitment that spanned the decades. That \nis very special. It is a very special human dimension of a great \nindividual.\n  I lost my husband Bert to cancer, and I know well what the end is \nlike. I know the good times that grow less and less and the bad times \nthat become more and more. Ted Kennedy's life was enriched by a very \nspecial woman, and her name is Vicki Kennedy. For me, she is a mentor \nof what a wife should be. I have watched her sitting with him, writing \nspeeches. I have watched her at weekend retreats. I have watched her \nfill his life with love, companionship, understanding.\n  I know a little bit about what the last months of a cancer victim are \nlike. I can only say to her that we will do everything we can in this \nbody to end cancer in our lifetime.\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\n  Yes, Ted Kennedy leaves very big shoes, shoes that probably will \nnever be filled in quite the same way, from a family that will probably \nnever be replicated.\n  I wish to end my remarks with a passage in the Prayer Book of the \nHigh Holy Day services for Reform Judaism. It was written when I was a \nteenager by a young rabbi I very much admired, and I wish to share it \nat this time:\n\n     Birth is a beginning and death a destination.\n     And life is a journey:\n     From childhood to eternity and youth to age;\n     From innocence to awareness and ignorance to knowing;\n     From foolishness to discretion, and then, perhaps, to wisdom;\n     From weakness to strength or strength to weakness\n     --and, often, back again;\n     From health to sickness and back, we pray, to health again;\n     From offense to forgiveness, from loneliness to love, from \n           joy to gratitude, from pain to compassion, and grief to \n           understanding--\n     From fear to faith; from defeat to defeat to defeat--\n     Until, looking backward or ahead, we see that victory lies \n           not in some high place along the way, but in having \n           made the journey, stage by stage, a sacred pilgrimage.\n     Birth is a beginning and death a destination.\n     And life is a journey, a sacred pilgrimage--\n     To life everlasting.\n\n  Ted Kennedy leaves a giant legacy in this body and we should not \nforsake it.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, following the passing of President John F. \nKennedy, Senator Mike Mansfield said: ``He gave us of his love that we, \ntoo, in turn, might give.''\n  These words ring true today as we remember the life of our late \ncolleague, Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  So much of this country's history in the past half century can be \nattributed to this one man. But Ted Kennedy was also a modest man, and \nhe would not have put it that way.\n  Speaking almost 30 years ago at the 1980 Democratic National \nConvention, he quoted Tennyson:\n\n     I am a part of all that I have met . . .\n     Tho much is taken, much abides.\n     That which we are,\n     we are one equal temper of heroic hearts\n     Strong in will\n     To strive, to see, to find\n     and not to yield.\n\n  In the more than 46 years that Senator Kennedy served this body, he \ndid not yield and, in turn, he affected each and every American.\n  During his career in the Senate, Senator Kennedy authored thousands \nof bills, and hundreds of them became law. From championing civil \nrights to advocating equal opportunity and higher education, to \nfighting for access to affordable health care for all Americans, \nSenator Kennedy's work has quite simply improved the quality of life \nfor millions of Americans. Over the past 2 weeks we have heard many \nspeak of his accomplishments.\n  It didn't take long for me to realize when I came to this body, and \nmore and more as each year passed, that Ted Kennedy was probably the \ngreatest legislator in modern American political history. The guy was \namazing, absolutely amazing; an inspiration for me personally to try to \nbe a very good legislator. Many people have also said that. I am not \nthe only one who has recognized his talents and that he is probably the \nbest legislator in modern American political history.\n  Let me just say why that was true for me. First of all, it was the \npassion of his convictions. His moral compass was set so true: for the \naverage person, the little guy, the person who didn't have \nrepresentation, health care, the poor, civil rights. He just believed \nso passionately, so steadfastly. His moral compass was just so firmly \nset. There is no question of what Ted Kennedy was and what he believed \nin, and it made him alive. It was his dream to fulfill the lives of the \npeople he worked so hard for.\n  All of us remember Ted Kennedy working so hard to fulfill his dreams. \nFrom his desk over here, he would stand up and he would thunder, red-\nfaced. He would get so involved, so passionate, speaking so loudly, \nalmost shouting what he believed in. You couldn't help but know that \nhere was a guy who believed what he said and, by gosh, let's listen to \nhim. He also had terrific staff. Ted Kennedy's staff had him so well \nprepared. All of these briefing books--I will never forget the briefing \nbooks Ted took, and he read them. He studied them. He was so well \nprepared. Along with his passion was his preparation, and his staff \njust helped him prepare because they were all one team. They were \nworking so closely together for the causes they believed in.\n  I also was impressed and found him to be such a great legislator \nbecause after the speeches he believed in so thoroughly and \npassionately, he would sit down with you and start to negotiate, try to \nwork out an agreement, try to work out some solution that made sense \nfor him and made sense for you if you happened to be on the other side. \nIt was amazing to sit and watch him work, a different demeanor, a \ndifferent temperament. He would sit there and cajole, talk, tell jokes, \nall in good spirit, all in an attempt to try to get to the solution.\n  On the one hand he would be here in the Chamber and he would be \nthundering, but in the conference room he would be saying: OK, let's \nfigure out how to do this. How do we get this done? It was amazing. It \nwas such a lesson to learn just watching him legislate.\n  I think he is also one of the best legislators in modern American \npolitical history because he had such a light touch. He really cared \nindividually for people, not just groups but individually. We have \nheard references to a book he gave Senator Byrd, a poetry book, and how \nSenator Kennedy would bring his dogs over to Senator Byrd's office; and \nlistening to Senator Chambliss, how Senator Kennedy made sure he knew \nwhen Senator Chambliss's grandchildren would be here so the \ngrandchildren could see his dogs. He loved his dogs and he had that \nvery light touch.\n  I remember not too long ago--and Senator Byrd referred to it--I think \nit was Senator Byrd's 67th wedding anniversary, and Senator Kennedy had \nthe foresight and the caring to send 67 roses to Robert Byrd and Erma \nByrd. It was one of the things he just did, as well as all the letters \nhe wrote, the handwritten letters he wrote.\n\n  Here is this wonderful guy who probably never used a BlackBerry; \ndidn't know what they were. We know what they were. We use them. He \nwrote notes, hundreds of notes, thousands of handwritten notes, tens of \nthousands of handwritten notes. It was incredible. He would write a \nnote to anybody at any time--just a light touch--on their birthday or \ncall them on their birthday or call somebody who was in the hospital. \nHe would just do that, more than any other Senator here I can think of, \nand I would venture to say probably more than most Senators combined. \nHe was just that way.\n  Let me give one small example. Several years ago, in my hometown of \nHelena, MT, I was at a meeting and came back late at night after the \nmeeting, and my mother said: Max, Ted Kennedy called.\n  Really?\n  Yes, Mom said. Well, I told him you were out, but we had a nice chat, \nTed Kennedy and I.\n  What did you talk about?\n  We talked about the Miles City bucking horse sale. It is an event in \nMontana that comes up every year. Ted came and rode a horse at the \nMiles City bucking horse sale back in 1960.\n  A few days later I was back on the floor of the Senate, and I walked \nup to Ted and I said: Ted, I understand you talked to my mother.\n  Oh, he said. Sometimes on the telephone you are talking to somebody, \nyou can tell who the person is. Your mother, she is such a wonderful \nperson, so gracious, on and on talking about my mother and the \nconversation the two of them had.\n  They had never met before. My mother is a staunch Republican, and \nhere is Ted Kennedy.\n  So I went back home a few days later, and I told my mother, I said: \nMom, Ted was sure impressed with the telephone call you had.\n  Oh, gee, that is great. That is wonderful.\n  My mom wrote Ted a note thanking him for being so--for praising her \nso much to me, her son, just a few days earlier.\n  Well, the next thing I knew, my mother and Ted were pen pals. Ted\n\n[[Page S9216]]\n\nwrote a letter back to my mother, and they were back and forth and back \nand forth. I would be at a committee hearing someplace and Ted would \nsay: Hey, Max, look. Here is the letter I am writing your mother. Just \nout of the blue. Basically, they were just reminiscing about Montana \nand again about the bucking horse sale, which is another reason Ted was \nsuch a great guy.\n  He lived life so fully. He just loved life. He embraced life in all \nof the ways that life is available to a man. He was just wonderful that \nway.\n  Back in 1960 when his brother was running for President, Ted was \nassigned the Western States in the 1960 Presidential campaign. So Ted \nwas out in Montana, and they went to a Democratic gathering. There \nwasn't anybody there, so he went to the Miles City bucking horse sale. \nWe in Miles City, MT, have this bucking event. We take these horses off \nthe prairie and buck them. You bid on the horses and, obviously, the \nbest bucking horses get the highest bid and go off with the rodeo \noperators and they use them.\n  Anyway, the long and the short of it is, Ted was there and he went to \nthe bucking horse sale and got in the booth because he wanted to speak \non behalf of his brother. The announcer said: Well, young man, if you \nwant to speak, first you have to ride a horse.\n  Ted said: Why not.\n  So Ted got on a horse and there is this wonderful photo of Ted at the \nMiles City bucking horse sale in Montana that somebody took. So there \nis Ted on his bronco. I don't think he made the full 8 seconds, but he \nsure had a great time on that horse.\n  The long and short of it is, he is a great man for so many reasons, \nand we love Ted for all he was. Again, I think he was the greatest \nlegislator I think, in modern American political history.\n  I am touched by what a family man he was. As the years went by, after \nhis brothers were tragically lost and all that happened in the Kennedy \nfamily, Ted was a rock to others in the family. He experienced so much \nand he went through so much tragedy and it has built so much character.\n  Ted was more than a Senate icon who fought for causes, more than a \nvoice for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. As I mentioned, he was a \nloving son, brother, husband, father, uncle, grandfather, and friend. \nWorking with him for the past 30 years is one of the greatest honors I \nhave had as a Senator.\n  Ted, as far as I am concerned, we are going to take up your last \ngreat cause, health care reform. We are, in the Senate, doing all we \ncan to get it passed. I, personally, pledge every ounce of energy at my \ncommand to help get health care reform passed for all the American \npeople and for Ted Kennedy.\n  He was a wonderful man, and he will be sorely missed. I don't think \nthere is going to be another man or woman in the Senate who will be a \ngiant such as Ted Kennedy. He was that great a guy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to join \nin the celebration of the life of Ted Kennedy. His loss was deeply \npersonal to all of us because he was a strong and vital presence not \nonly in the day-to-day work of the Senate but in our day-to-day lives \nas well. He was interested and concerned not only about his colleagues \nbut our staffs and all those with whom he worked on a long list of \nissues that will continue to have an impact on our Nation for many \ngenerations to come. That was the kind of individual Ted was--active \nand completely involved in all things that had to do with the work of \nthe Senate.\n  For my part, I have lost a Senate colleague who was willing to work \nwith me and with Senators on both sides of the aisle. He was my \ncommittee chairman and my good friend.\n  For those across the country who mourn his passing, they have lost a \ntrusted and treasured voice in the Senate, a champion who fought for \nthem for almost 50 years.\n  The political landscape of our country has now been permanently \nchanged. I think we all sensed what his loss would mean to the country \nas we heard the news of his passing. Now we take this time to look back \nto the past and remember our favorite stories and instant replay \nmemories of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  In the more than 12 years I have had the privilege of serving Wyoming \nin the Senate, I had the good fortune to come to know Ted on a number \nof levels. As a Senator, he was a tremendous force to be dealt with on \nthe floor. If you were on his side, you knew you had a warrior fighting \nalongside you who went to battle without the slightest fear of failure \nor defeat. If you had to face him from the other side of the arena, you \nknew you had a tremendous battle on your hands because, when it came to \nthe principles he believed in, no one said it better or with more \npassion or more depth of understanding of the issues involved. As a \nresult, he was able to notch an impressive list of legislative \nvictories.\n  During his long and remarkable career, there were few initiatives \nthat didn't attract his attention and his unique spirited touch that \noften turned them from faint hopes for change to dreams at long last \ncome true. Whether it was an increase in the minimum wage, equal rights \nfor all Americans or the effort to reform our Nation's health care \nsystem, which was his greatest dream, Ted operated at one speed and one \ndirection--full speed ahead--and it always found him making progress on \nthe task at hand.\n  Over the years, I was fortunate to have an opportunity to work with \nhim on a number of issues of great importance to us both. He knew what \nhe had to have in a bill to get his side to agree on it, and I was \nfortunate to have a sense of what it would take to get votes from my \nside. So, together, we were able to craft several bills that we were \nable to move through committee and to the Senate floor.\n  When I served as the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, the partnership we had forged over the years helped \nus to compile a record of which we were both very proud. We passed 35 \nbills out of committee, and 27 of them were signed into law by the \nPresident. Most of them passed unanimously. I remember attending a bill \nsigning during which the President remarked, ``You are the only \ncommittee sending me anything.'' We checked, and he was right, and that \nwas due, in large part, to Ted's willingness to work with us to get \nthings done.\n  I will always remember two stories about Ted. One was a time when we \nwere working together on a mine safety law. Nothing had been done in \nthat area for almost 30 years. The average bill takes about 6 years to \npass around here. Thanks to Ted, we got that one done in 6 weeks, and \nit has made a difference.\n  Another had to do with my first legislative initiative after I \narrived as a newly sworn-in freshman Senator. I knew Ted had quite a \ngood working relationship with my predecessor, Alan Simpson. So as I \nbegan to work on an OSHA safety bill, I started to discuss the bill \nwith Ted and other colleagues and go through it section by section. I \nknew Ted's support would be instrumental if my efforts to pass the bill \nwould be successful. So I arranged to meet with him.\n  Ted opened our meeting by presenting me with some press clippings he \nhad collected for me about my mother's award as ``Mother of the Year.'' \nThat impressed me and showed me how he kept up on anything that was of \nimportance to those people he worked with--members and staff.\n  Then he spent a great deal of time going over the bill with me \nsection by section. He helped me to make it a winner. Although the \nbill, as a whole, didn't pass, several sections made it into law. I \nfound out later that this wasn't the way things are usually done around \nhere, and in all the years Ted had been in the Senate, nobody had gone \nover a bill with him a section at a time. I probably didn't need to.\n  That started a friendship and a good working relationship with him we \nboth cherished. I tried to be a good sounding board for him, and he \nalways did the same for me. Our friendship can best be summed up when \nTed came to my office and presented me with a photo of a University of \nWyoming football helmet next to a Harvard football helmet, with the \ninscription, ``The Cowboys and the Crimson make a great team.'' We did, \nand I will always remember his thoughtfulness and kindness in reaching \nout to me.\n  Ted was one of those remarkable individuals who made all those he\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\nworked with more productive. He was a man of exceptional abilities, and \nhe was blessed to have a truly remarkable helpmate by his side. Vicki \nis a woman of great strength, who brought a renewed focus and direction \nto Ted's life. She was his most trusted confidant, his best friend, and \na wellspring of good advice and political counsel. He would have never \nbeen all that he was without her, and she will forever be a special \npart of his life's story.\n  For the Enzis, we will always remember how thoughtful he was when my \ngrandchildren were born. He was almost as excited as I was. He \npresented me with a gift for each of them that will always be a \ncherished reminder that Ted had a great appreciation for all of us, and \nhe treated both Members and staff with the same kindness and concern.\n  Actually, we got Irish Mist training pants for each of them as they \nwere born.\n  When Ted was asked, during an interview, what he wanted to be most \nremembered for, he said he wanted to make a difference for our country. \nHe was able to do that and so much more. He will be missed by us all, \nand he will never be forgotten. All those who knew and loved him will \nalways carry a special memory with them of how he touched their lives \nas he tried to make our Nation and the world a better place.\n  Now he has been taken from us and it will always feel like it all \nhappened too soon. He has a record of achievements and success that \nwill probably not be matched for a long time to come. He was a special \nfriend and a mentor who had a lot to teach about how to get things done \nin the Senate. I know I will miss him and his willingness to sit down \nand visit about how to get something through the Senate and passed into \nlaw. Now he is at peace and with God. May God bless and be with him and \ncontinue to watch over his family for years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, when I was young, Ted Kennedy was larger \nthan life. I was just 12 years old when he was first elected to the \nSenate as the youngest son of a political dynasty that seemed to \ndominate the television each night in my house and the newspapers every \nday.\n  At first, he served in the shadow of his older brothers. But as I \ngrew up, the youngest brother of the Kennedy family did, too--in front \nof the entire Nation.\n  For me and so many others, Ted Kennedy became a symbol of \nperseverance over tragedy--from his walk down Pennsylvania Avenue at \nthe side of Jacqueline Kennedy, to the heart-breaking speech he \ndelivered at his brother Bobby's funeral, to his pledge to carry on the \ncauses of those who had championed his bid for the Presidency.\n  Ted Kennedy routinely appeared before the American people with great \ncourage at the most trying times. And all the while, he was also \nstanding in this Chamber each day with that same grit and determination \nto fight for the people of Massachusetts and the Nation.\n  On issues from protecting the environment, civil rights, increasing \nthe minimum wage, and health care, he was a passionate and unmatched \nadvocate and leader.\n  So it was with a lifetime of watching Senator Kennedy with admiration \nfrom afar that I arrived here as a freshman Senator in 1993. By the \ntime I was elected, Ted was already on his way to becoming one of the \nmost powerful and influential Senators of all time. So I couldn't \nbelieve it when I first walked out onto this floor and he walked over \nto personally welcome me. For me, that would have been enough--the lion \nof the Senate reaching out to a rookie--but to Ted Kennedy it wasn't.\n  Through calls to my office, discussions on the floor, and by taking \nme under his wing on the HELP Committee, he became a friend, a mentor, \nand sooner than I could have ever imagined a courageous partner on \nlegislation that I cared deeply about.\n  As a State senator in Washington, I had worked very hard before I got \nhere to successfully change the State laws in Washington on family and \nmedical leave. It was an issue that was extremely personal to me. My \nfather had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when I was very \nyoung. Since that time, my mother had always been his primary \ncaregiver. But a few years before I ran and became a Senator, my mother \nhad a heart attack and had to undergo bypass surgery.\n  Suddenly, my six brothers and sisters and I were faced with the \nquestion of who was going to take time off to care for the people we \nloved the most, the people who cared for us for so long.\n  A family leave policy would have allowed any of us just a few weeks \nnecessary to see them through their medical crisis. But at the time, \nnone was available.\n  So after running and winning and coming to the Senate, the Family and \nMedical Leave Act was a bill I wanted to stand and fight for. As it \nturned out, it was the first bill we considered.\n  Senator Kennedy was here managing that bill on the Senate floor, and \nI found out that he, too, had a personal connection to that bill.\n  I well remember one day when Senator Kennedy pulled me aside to tell \nme about how he had spent a lot of time with his own son in the \nhospital fighting cancer and how he met so many people at that time who \ncould not afford to take time off to care for their loved ones and how \nsome were forced to quit their jobs to take care of somebody they loved \nbecause they were sick. He told me that, together, we were going to \nwork hard and get this bill passed. Then he showed this rookie how to \ndo it.\n  Week after week, he fought against bad amendments to get the votes we \nneeded to pass it.\n  He blended the right mix of patience and passion. He spoke out loudly \nin speeches when he needed to, and he whispered into the ears of \ncolleagues when that was called for. A few days after Senator Kennedy \npledged to me we would get it done, we did.\n  Through that effort, and many more battles on this floor, I learned \nso much from him and so have all of us because, more than almost \nanyone, Senator Kennedy knew the Senate. He knew how to make personal \nfriends, even with those he didn't agree with politically. He knew how \nto reach out and find ways to work with people to get them to \ncompromise for the greater good. He knew when not to give up. He knew \nwhen to change the pace or turn the page to get things done. He knew \nwhen to go sit down next to you or pick up the phone and call you. He \nknew how to legislate. Because of that, he built an incredible legacy.\n  It is a legacy that will not only live on in the Senate Chamber, \nwhere he was so well loved and respected; it is a legacy that will live \non in the classrooms across America, where kids from Head Start to \ncollege have benefited from his commitment to opportunities in \neducation; on manufacturing floors, where he fought for landmark worker \nsafety protection; in our hospitals, where medical research that he \nchampioned is saving lives every day; in courtrooms, where the legacy \nof discrimination was dealt a blow by his years of service on the \nJudiciary Committee; in voting booths, where he fought for our most \nbasic rights in a democracy to be protected and expanded for decades; \nand in so many other places that were touched by his service, his \npassion and his giant heart.\n  Senator Kennedy fought for and won so many great battles. But for \nmany of us who worked with him every day, it may be the small moments \nthat will be remembered the most--the personal touch he brought, not \nonly to legislating but to life.\n\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, my mom had to take care of my dad for \nmost of his life. His multiple sclerosis confined him to a wheelchair \nand she could not ever leave his side. One of the few and maybe the \nonly time she did leave my dad is when I was elected to the Senate and \nshe flew all the way from Washington State to Washington, DC, to see me \nbe sworn in.\n  To my mom, Ted Kennedy and his family were amazing individuals whom \nshe followed closely throughout their lives, through their triumphs \nand, of course, through tragedy. After I was sworn in, and my mother \nwas up in the gallery watching, we walked back through the Halls of \nCongress to my office. Shortly after that, we had a visitor. Senator \nKennedy unexpectedly came over to my office and gave my mom a huge hug. \nI will never forget the look on her face, the tears in her eyes,\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\nthe clear disbelief that she had met Ted Kennedy, and it was \noverpowering. It was a moment with my mom I will never forget, and it \nis certainly a moment I will never forget with my friend Ted Kennedy.\n  I am going to miss him. I know our country is going to miss him. But \nas he reminded us in his courageous speech that he delivered last \nsummer in Denver, the torch has been passed to a new generation, and \nthe work begins anew.\n  So today, as we honor all of his contributions to the Senate and the \nNation, we must also remember to heed that brave final call and \ncontinue his fight for all of those who cannot fight for themselves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend and colleague \nSenator Murray for her heartfelt words, and all of my colleagues. The \nlove we all felt and feel for Ted Kennedy is genuine. It is person to \nperson because that is how he was.\n  There is so much to say. I know we are limited in time. We could \nspeak forever. I think every one of us could speak forever about Ted \nKennedy because he had so many interactions with each of us. It is \namazing that every person in this body has a long list of stories and \nthousands of people in Massachusetts and thousands more throughout \nAmerica. One would think there were 20 Ted Kennedys. He had so much \ntime for the small gesture that mattered so much, such as the hug, \ngoing out of his way to go to a reception and hug Patty Murray's mom. \nIt happened over and over again. So we could each speak forever.\n  I know time is limited, my colleague from Oregon is waiting. We are \ngoing to shut off debate soon and others want to speak. I will touch on \na few things.\n  I could speak forever about Ted Kennedy. I thought of him every day \nwhile he was alive; I think of him every day that he is gone. I had a \ndream about him the other night where typically he was taking me around \nto various places in Boston and explaining a little bit about each one \nwith a joke, with a smile, with a remembrance.\n  There is also nothing we can say about Ted Kennedy because nothing is \ngoing to replace him. No words can come close to equaling the man.\n  You read about history and you read about the great people in the \nSenate--the Websters, the Clays, the LaFollettes, the Wagners. What a \nprivilege it was for somebody such as myself, a kid from Brooklyn whose \nfather was an exterminator, never graduated from college, to be in the \npresence and was actually a friend to a great man. I don't think I can \nsay that about anyone else. It is amazing.\n  What I want to tell the American people--you all read about him. \nThere were the good times and the bad times and the brickbats that were \nthrown at him, not so much recently but in the early days. But here in \nthe Senate, when you get to know people personally and when you are in \nour walk of life, being a Senator, you get to know a lot of people \npersonally. You get to meet a lot of famous people. Some of them, \nfrankly, are disappointing. The more you see them the less you want to \nknow them. But with Ted Kennedy, the more you got to see him, the \ncloser you got, the better he looked.\n  He had flaws, but he was flawless. He was such a genuine person and \nsuch a caring person and such an honorable and decent man that I wish \nmy children had gotten to know him, that my friends had gotten to know \nhim, that all of my 19 million constituents had gotten to know him a \nlittle bit the way I did.\n  What a guy. There are so many stories and so many memories. One day \nTed and I sat next to each other--I used to sit over there. I think it \nwas one of the vote-aramas, a long session. We occasionally would go up \nto his hideaway to talk. I said: Why don't we bring some of the \nfreshmen. This was a couple of years ago. I regret that you, Mr. \nPresident, and the Senator from Oregon in the class of 2008 did not \nhave that experience. We would go up to his hideaway, and he would \nregale us with stories. He would talk about the pictures on the wall \nand tell each person in caring detail what each picture meant, what \neach replica meant. He would tell jokes and laugh. His caring for each \nperson in that room, each a new freshman, was genuine, and they knew \nit. We would go up regularly. It sort of became a thing, freshman \nMembers of the Senate. Ted didn't need them. He could get whatever he \nhad to get done and they would support him. But he cared about them as \nif they were almost family.\n  Whenever we had a late night, we would sort of gather--I would be the \nemissary and I would go over to Ted and say: Can we go upstairs? Of \ncourse. Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, Claire McCaskill, Bobbie Casey--\ntheir faces would light up, and there we would go to hear more stories \nabout the past, the Senate, the individuals. It is a memory none of us \nwill forget.\n  Ted Kennedy would size people up early on, and he would care about \nthem. He was very kind to me, but he also knew I was the kind of guy \nyou had to put in his place a little bit. I would get hazed by Ted \nKennedy. Jay Rockefeller told me he went through the same thing when he \ngot here. He knew who I was but would deliberately not mention my name. \nHe would be standing there saying: Senator Mikulski, you will do this, \nand Senator Harkin, you will do this; Senator Conrad, you will do \nthis--I was the last one--and the others will do this. It was fun. He \ndid it with a twinkle in his eyes. We loved, he and I, the give and \ntake, Brooklyn-Boston.\n  The first year I was here, the Red Sox were playing the Yankees in \nthe playoffs. Ted and I made a bet. He said: The loser will have to \nhold the pennant of the winning team over his head and recite ``Casey \nat the Bat'' on Capitol Hill. We had a bet. The Yankees won. I went \nover to him--and he was feigning fear, this man who had been through \neverything. When we went out on the steps, he was hiding behind me. I \nhave a picture of it on my wall. We were joking and laughing. And then \nhe did his duty.\n  I was only a freshman Senator, sort of like Patty or anybody else. He \nwent out of his way for all of us. He would tell me to remember the \nbirthdays and the individual happenings in each person's life, in each \nSenator's life, and go over and say something to them. It was his way \nof teaching me. It was done like a father. An amazing person.\n  As I said, the closer you got to him, the better he looked. As a \nlegislator and as a giant in our history--and all the history books \nrecord it--people have referred to all his accomplishments. But I want \nto share with people how it was in person, one on one. You could be a \nSenator or you could be two guys on a street corner. He was fun and he \nwas caring and he was loving. He was a big man, but his heart was much \nbigger than he was.\n  He loved almost everybody. He saw the good in people and brought it \nout. He saw the faults in people, and in a strong but gentle way tried \nto correct them. He was great on the outside, and he was even more \ngreat on the inside.\n  Again, I see my colleagues are waiting. I will part with this little \nmemory that I will never forget. Ted and I became good friends. We \nspent time together in many different ways. When he got sick, I felt \nbad, like we all did. I would call him every so often. This was October \nof last year. He was ill, but he was still in strong health. I called \nhim a couple of days before it was October. I said: We have a DSCC \nevent a couple days from now in Boston. I thought I would call and say \nhello, let him know I was going to be in his State, his territory.\n\n  He said: What are you doing before the event? He said: Why don't you \ncome out to the compound at Hyannis. I did. He picked me up at the \nairport. I flew in on a little plane. I will never forget, he had his \nhat on. He was happy as could be pointing out everything, full of vim \nand vigor.\n  It is obvious why the man was not afraid of death. When you know \nyourself and you know you have done everything as he did on both a \npersonal basis and as a leader, you are not afraid of death. Anyway, he \nwas not at all talking about that.\n  We were supposed to go out sailing, but it was too windy. So we had \nlunch--he, Vicki, and I--clam chowder and all the usual stuff. Then he \nsaid: I want to show you something. He lived in the big house on the \ncompound, the one you see in the pictures. He took me to the house by \nthe side. That was the house where President Kennedy lived because when \nPresident Kennedy was\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\nPresident, Joseph P. Kennedy, Ted's father, lived in the big house.\n  For about 3 hours, he opened all these drawers and closets, things on \nthe walls, and with each one in loving, teaching detail talked to me \nabout the history of the family and of Boston, what happened from Honey \nFitz, the mayor, through his father and Ted growing up in all these \npictures laughing and reminiscing, and then about President Kennedy as \nhe was growing up, and then as President in this little house and \nthrough to Ted. He was sort of passing on the memories. He did it again \nout of generosity, spirit, love, and friendship.\n  As I say, he was a great man and every one of us knows his greatness \nwas not only in the public eye but in the private one on one. A great \nman. The term is overused. There are not many. He was one. I was \nprivileged to get to know him, to get to be his friend, to stand in \nthat large shadow, learn from him, enjoy it, and to love him.\n  So, Ted, you will always be with us. They may take those flowers off \nthat desk and they may take the great black drape off the desk, but you \nwill always be here for me, for all of us, and for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor our \ncolleague Senator Edward Kennedy. I first had the pleasure of hearing \nSenator Kennedy speak in 1976. I wanted to come out to Washington, DC, \nto see how our Nation operated. I had the great privilege of serving as \nan intern for a Senator from my home State, Senator Hatfield. My father \nhad always talked about Senator Kennedy as someone who spoke for the \ndisenfranchised, someone who spoke for the dispossessed, someone who \ncared about the working man. So I was looking forward to possibly \nmeeting him or at least hearing him, when lo and behold, I found out he \nwas scheduled to speak as part of a series of lectures to the interns \nthat summer. So I made sure to get there early, and what followed was \nexactly the type of address you might anticipate--a roaring voice, a \npassionate spirit, a principled presentation of the challenges we face \nto make our society better. I walked out of that lecture and thought: \nThank goodness--thank goodness--we have leaders like Senator Kennedy \nfighting for the working people, the challenged, the dispossessed in \nour society.\n\n  Through that summer, each time I heard Senator Kennedy was on the \nSenate floor I tried to slip over and go up to the staff section so I \ncould sit in and see a little bit of the lion of the Senate in action. \nDuring that time I never anticipated that I would have a chance to come \nback and serve in the Senate with Senator Kennedy. But 33 years later, \nthis last January, when I was sworn in, that unanticipated, miraculous \nevent of serving with him occurred.\n  I wanted to talk to him about the possibility of joining his Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee--a committee where so many \nbattles for working Americans, so many battles for the disenfranchised \nAmericans are waged. So with some trepidation I approached him on the \nSenate floor to speak with him and asked if he thought I might be able \nto serve on that committee, if he might whisper in the ear of our \nesteemed majority leader in that regard, if he thought I might serve \nwell. It was with some pleasure that weeks later I had a message on my \nphone in which he went on at some length welcoming me to that \ncommittee. That was the first committee to which I received an \nassignment here, and I couldn't have been more excited and more \npleased.\n  I didn't have a chance to have a lot of conversations with Senator \nKennedy. I was very struck when a bit more than a month ago his staff \ncontacted me and said, in conversation with Senator Kennedy, they were \nwondering if I might like to carry on the torch on the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act, a civil rights measure he cared a great deal about. \nThey were asking me because it was a battle I had waged in the Oregon \nLegislature. It had been a hard battle, fought over a number of years, \nand a battle we had won.\n  I was more than excited, more than honored to help carry the torch on \nsuch an important civil rights measure, and I hope I will be able to do \nthat in a way he would have been satisfied and pleased.\n  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, talked about the many \nconversations that took place in Senator Kennedy's hideaway with \nfreshmen Senators and the stories that were passed on. I didn't get to \nshare much in those types of conversations, but as we were working on \nhealth care, Senator Kennedy invited a group of us to his hideaway to \nbrainstorm. Through the course of about 2 hours we went through many of \nthe features and many of the challenges and how we might be able to go \nforward and finally realize that dream of affordable, accessible health \ncare for every single American.\n  When the meeting concluded, I had a chance to speak with Senator \nKennedy about the picture he had on his wall of his beautiful yacht--\nthe Maya. Senator Kennedy and I both have a passion for sailing. It \nconnected us across the generation, it connected us from the west coast \nto the east coast, it connected us between the son of a millwright and \nthe son of a U.S. ambassador. It was magic to see the twinkle in his \neye as he started to talk of his love of sailing and some of the \nadventures he had on various boats over time and with family.\n  I asked him if he was familiar with one of my favorite stories--an \nautobiography written by CAPT Joshua Slocum. Joshua Slocum had been \nraised in a large family and, to my recollection, a family of no great \nmeans. He had gone to sea when he was a young boy--as a cabin boy or a \ndeckhand--and he learned to sail the tall sheets. Over time he advanced \nthrough the ranks until eventually he was the captain of a merchant \ntall-masted ship. He had amassed some considerable amount of investment \nand value and loaned to share that ship. When the ship went down, he \nlost everything. He saved his life, but he lost all of his possessions.\n  He was up in New England wrestling with how to overcome this tragedy \nand what to do with his life, and Captain Slocum had a colonel of an \nidea. He was offered the gift of a ship. Not really a ship, a modest \nboat between 20 and 30 feet long, single-masted. He later overhauled it \nand added an after-mast. But he thought: I can rebuild this ship. He \nsaid he rebuilt it, in his story, Captain Slocum. He rebuilt it all but \nthe name. The Spray stayed from the beginning to the end. He rebuilt it \nand went to sea to fish. But it wasn't much to his liking, and so \nCaptain Slocum had an idea that he was going to perhaps sail around the \nworld.\n  He thought: Why not just sail right out across the Atlantic. It was a \nrevolutionary idea because no one had ever tried to sail around the \nworld by themselves, just a single person. But he set off and he went \nto Europe.\n  I tell you this story at some length because Senator Kennedy knew \nthis story well, and we enjoyed sharing pieces of it back and forth.\n  He had gone forth in 1895 and taken 3 years to circumnavigate the \nglobe and came back to New England 3 years later, in 1898. So this was \nwell more than a century ago, and people around the world were \nastounded to see him sail into a harbor all by himself having crossed \nthe broad expanse of an ocean.\n  In some ways, the life of Captain Slocum represents a version of the \nlife of Senator Kennedy--someone who faced great adversity, who faced \ngreat tragedy, but looked at all of it and said: I am going to go \nforward. I am going to go forward and do something bold, something \nimportant. For Senator Kennedy, it wasn't literally sailing around the \nworld but it was sailing through a host of major issues that affect \nvirtually every facet of our lives--certainly the issue of public \nservice, the National Service Act, the issue of mental health and the \nissue of health care and the issue of education.\n  Others who have served with him have spoken in far greater detail and \nmore eloquently than I ever could, but I just want to say to Senator \nKennedy: Thank you for your life of service. Thank you for overcoming \nadversity to undertake a bold journey, a journey that has touched every \none of our lives. Thank you for reaching out to converse with this son \nof a mill worker from Oregon who felt so privileged to be on the\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\nfloor of the Senate and to have had just a few months with this master \nof the Senate and who will hopefully carry forward some of the passion \nand the principle he so embodied.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to remember our colleague, \nSenator Kennedy. There is a newspaper in the cloakroom that has Ted's \npicture, and it has a quote from Ted. It reads this way:\n\n       Since I was a boy, I have known the joy of sailing the \n     waters off of Cape Cod. And for all my years in public life, \n     I have believed that America must sail toward the shores of \n     liberty and justice for all.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       There is no end to that journey, only the next great \n     voyage.\n\n  I like to think that Ted is on that next great voyage now. What a \nman.\n  I remember so well being elected in 1986 to the Senate and being \nsworn in in 1987. I held a reception in a little restaurant close by \nwith friends and family from North Dakota. I will never forget it. It \nwas packed. You couldn't move; so many people had come from North \nDakota to be with me, family members from all over the country, and a \ncousin of mine came up to me, so excited, and he said to me: Senator \nKennedy is here. I hadn't known he was coming. But that was so typical \nof Ted, reaching out to the most junior of us because he knew what his \npresence would mean. My family had been longtime supporters of the \nKennedys, and it meant so much to my family for him to be there that \nday. That was so typical of him, taking time to do things he knew would \nmean a lot to others, even when it was inconvenient for him.\n  The thing I remember and will remember most about Ted is his \nhumanity: that smile, that twinkle in his eye, that kind of mischievous \ngrin that would come over his face when he would be commenting on what \nwas going on here, late at night sometimes--you know this place defies \ndescription. Yet he always maintained that sense of humor, that joy in \nlife. He communicated it. He made all of us feel as if we were part of \nsomething important, something big.\n  When somebody in this Senate family had a problem, had a challenge, \nhad a medical issue, very often Ted was the first to call. I had \nsomeone in my family who had health issues, and somehow Ted found out \nand kind of sidled up to me one day on the floor and said: You know, I \nheard you have somebody who has a serious health issue. I suppose you \nalready have doctors, but if you are looking for additional assistance \nor a second opinion and you want to find people who are experts in this \narea, I would be glad to help. That was Ted Kennedy, over and over \nreaching out to others, trying to help, trying to provide \nencouragement, trying to provide the lift. That was Ted.\n  I remember so well about a decade ago when we were engaged in \nlegislation on tobacco, we had a circumstance in which there was an \nimportant court decision and there had to be laws passed to deal with \nit. I was asked to lead a task force here in the Senate to try to bring \ntogether different sides to deal with that legislation. Of course, for \na long time Ted Kennedy had been a leader on those issues, as was \nSenator Frank Lautenberg, and there were others as well. Ted far \noutstripped me in seniority. Yet I was asked to lead this task force. \nHe came to me and said: Sign me up as a soldier in your effort. We had \ndozens of meetings, and Ted was always there, pitching in, helping to \nmake a difference even when he was not the person leading the effort--\nit was somebody much more junior. Of course, he had many other \nresponsibilities, but over and over, coming up, stepping up, helping \nout.\n  There was nothing small about Ted Kennedy. He had big plans, big \nambitions, big hopes, and a big spirit. He was always reaching out to \neven the most junior of us, to help out, to connect, to be supportive, \nand to show how much he cared about what we were doing and to give us a \nsense of how we were fitting into making history. Ted also had a big \nview, a big view of the importance of the role of the Senate in making \nhistory and a sense of how critically important the decisions were that \nwere being made in this Chamber. There was nothing small about Ted \nKennedy.\n  When he was engaged in negotiations--I will never forget him saying \nto me: Keep your eye on what is possible. Keep your eye on what is \npossible. You know, we might want to accomplish more, but take what you \ncan get to advance the cause, to make progress, to improve the human \ncondition, to make this a better place. That is what Ted Kennedy had in \nmind.\n  I want to close. I see colleagues who are here wishing to speak as \nwell.\n  My favorite lines from a speech by Ted Kennedy are from the 1980 \nconvention, when he closed with these words:\n\n       For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work \n     goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the \n     dream shall never die.\n\n  Ted, the dream will never die. You are always in our thoughts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to be here \nwith colleagues, and I so appreciate the words of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and those of the Senator from New York and all of our \nother colleagues who have been here, talking about our friend and \ncolleague, the great Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I think for me, being in my second term and still a relative newcomer \nhere, one of the greatest honors of my life was the opportunity to work \nand become friends with Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  I often have been asked what was the most surprising or exciting \nthing about being in the Senate. I always referred to Ted Kennedy, not \nonly knowing him and the larger-than-life way he has been described, \nwhich was also true, but for me the images are of sitting in a small \nroom going over amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights when I was \nin my first term and having the great Ted Kennedy--not his staff but \nTed Kennedy--sitting in a room with advocates talking about how we \nneeded to mobilize and get people involved and what we needed to do to \nget votes or how to write something--doing the work behind the scenes.\n  Ted Kennedy, because of who he was--his family, his certainly great \nleadership and knowledge, and his length of time here--could have \nsimply stood on the floor and made eloquent speeches, which he always \ndid--the booming voice in the back that would get louder and louder as \nhe became more involved in what he was talking about--he could have \njust done that, and that would have been an incredible contribution to \nthe Senate. But that is not what he did. He was as involved behind the \nscenes in getting things done, more so than in the public eye. He \nworked hard and showed all of us an example of someone who was \ndedicated to the details, to the advocacy as well as to what was \nhappening on the floor of the Senate. It was a very important lesson \nfor all of us.\n  As chair of the Steering and Outreach Committee for our Senate \nmajority, one of my responsibilities is to bring people with various \ninterests together, usually on a weekly basis, to meet with Members on \nissues from education to health care, clean energy, civil rights, \nveterans. People always wanted to have Ted Kennedy in the room. Again, \nas a very senior Member with tremendous responsibilities, chairing the \nHELP Committee and all of the other responsibilities he had, he could \nhave easily said to me: You know, I am just not going to be able to do \nthat. We will have more junior Members come and join in these meetings. \nBut he came, over and over again.\n  One of the things we joked about all the time was that he would see \nme coming and say: I know, there is a meeting tomorrow. I will be \nthere.\n  He was someone who gave his all at every moment. He also understood \nthat people needed and wanted to see him, to hear him, and the \nimportant leadership role he had here. It was important to people. And \nhe treated everyone the same.\n  He was committed to a vision of making America the best it could be, \nwhere every child would have the chance to grow up and be healthy, \nsucceed in life, have a job, at the end of life a pension and \nretirement, and be able to live with dignity. His service\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\nwas great, but his legacy is even greater.\n  I believe his challenge to each of us is even greater. It is true \nthat nearly every major bill that passed in the last 47 years bears \nsome mark from Senator Ted Kennedy--the Civil Rights Act; the Voting \nRights Act; Meals for the Elderly; the Women, Infants and Children \nNutrition Program; the Violence Against Women Act; title IX, which is \ngiving so many women and girls the opportunity to participate and move \nthrough education's highest levels, including the U.S. Supreme Court, \nas well as the wonderful athletic abilities we have seen; the \nChildren's Health Insurance Act; AmeriCorps; the National Health \nService; the American Health Parity Act; legislation to allow the FDA \nto regulate tobacco; the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Act; the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act--it goes on and on. These are just a \nfew of the hundreds of bills Senator Kennedy sponsored or cosponsored \nduring his time in the Senate, and each and every one of those bills \nmade America a little bit better.\n  His commitment to achieve the best for America, for every child, \nevery family, every worker was unmatched. We have lost the lion of the \nSenate, and he will be sorely missed. Personally, I have lost a friend, \nsomeone for whom I had the highest personal respect and someone I cared \ndeeply about as a person.\n  To Vicki, to the family, we give our love and affection and thanks \nfor sharing him with us. In his maiden speech in the Senate, Senator \nKennedy spoke of his brother's legacy. Today, the same words can be \nspoken about him. If his life and death had a meaning, it was that we \nshould not hate but love one another. We should use our powers not to \ncreate the conditions of oppression that lead to violence but \nconditions of freedom that lead to peace.\n  Ted, we will miss you.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I take to \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate today. For each of the past 46 years, this \nChamber has rung with the words of a man who came to be known as the \nlion of the Senate. But today, that familiar voice has fallen silent.\n  For the first time in half a century, this Senate returns to its work \nwithout Edward M. Kennedy. With his passing, our country has lost a \ntrue giant--a compassionate public servant who became a legend in his \nown time, a man whose legacy is bound up in the history of the U.S. \nSenate, whose life and works have touched everyone in America since the \nday he entered public service almost 50 years ago.\n  Over the course of his career, he influenced more legislation than \njust about anyone in history. He argued passionately for voting rights \nand helped extend the promise of our democracy to a new generation. He \nspoke out in defense of our Constitution and the principles of fairness \nwe hold so dear. Time and again, he raised his booming voice on behalf \nof the less fortunate. He protected the rights and interests of the \ndisabled. He extended health insurance coverage to children and fought \nto improve the American health care system, a struggle that would \nbecome the cause of his life. But perhaps his greatest single \nachievement came early in his career when he stepped to the center of \nthe national debate and led the fight against segregation. He became a \nchampion of the civil rights movement, lending his full compassion to a \ndifficult and divisive issue.\n  Today, we live in a nation that is more free, more fair, and more \nequal because of Edward Kennedy. He was the single most effective U.S. \nSenator of our time. He did more good for more people than anyone in \nthe Senate has known before. And it will be a very long time before we \nsee the likes of him again. Ted Kennedy reminded us of the greatness \nthat lives in our highest aspirations. He enjoyed wonderful triumphs \nand endured terrible tragedy. Through it all, he taught us to keep the \nfire burning, to confront every challenge with passion and hope and \nwith undying faith in the country we love so much.\n  He reached across the aisle time and again. When everyone said \ncompromise was impossible, Ted Kennedy did the impossible. When \npartisan politics divided conservatives from liberals and Republicans \nfrom Democrats, Ted Kennedy was always there to bring us together in \nthe service of the American people.\n  I first met Ted Kennedy in 1962 when his brother was President and \nTed was a young man running for the U.S. Senate. I was a legal intern \nat the White House and a second-year law student at Howard University. \nFor me, the chance to serve the Kennedy administration--and meet all \nthree Kennedy brothers--was a remarkable and inspiring part of my early \ncareer in public service.\n  I had the good fortune to meet Senator Kennedy one more time when I \nwas running for reelection as state comptroller of the State of \nIllinois, having become the first African American ever elected \nstatewide to office in my State. I was up for reelection, and I had a \nmajor fundraiser and I needed a big draw to come and help me raise \nfunds.\n  Someone said: Well, there is a Senator from Massachusetts named Ted \nKennedy. He will come and help you.\n  I said: No, no Senator of his caliber would come down to our capital \nfor a fundraiser for a person who is running for State comptroller.\n  Needless to say, I contacted the Senator's office. Without \nhesitation, Senator Ted Kennedy appeared at the fundraiser in our State \ncapital to help me maintain my seat as State comptroller.\n  During that same time, we had a little tragedy taking place that \nevening when our 15-year-old son in Chicago had been admitted to the \nhospital, and it was a question of whether I would be there at the \nfundraiser or go to Chicago to be with my son because my wife, his \nmother, was in Minnesota. So Senator Kennedy understood the dilemma but \nwent on with the fundraiser. We got our son taken care of, but after my \nson was out of the hospital and home, guess who I got a call from days \nlater wondering how my son was doing? It was Ted Kennedy. You just \ndon't see a man of this caliber each and every day in this country.\n  After I came to the U.S. Senate myself, I had the honor to serve with \nTed only briefly. In all the time I knew Senator Kennedy, I came to see \nhim as more than a living legend, more than a senior statesman, more \nthan the lion he had become. For me, and for all who were fortunate \nenough to meet him over the years, he was a genuine human being, a \nremarkable ally, and a compassionate friend. He displayed nothing but \nkindness and respect for everyone he met, from his good friends to his \nbitter opponents.\n  But for his many accomplishments and for all that he accomplished \nover the course of a lifetime in public service, there was at least one \nvictory that eluded him. As I address this Chamber today, we stand on \nthe verge of health care reform only because we are standing on Ted \nKennedy's shoulders.\n  And when the time comes, I plan to honor his legacy and pay tribute \nto his service by casting the vote he did not live long enough to see.\n  When Senator Kennedy departed this life on August 25, he left more \nthan an empty desk in this Senate Chamber. He left a fight for us to \nfinish--a standard for us to bear. Long ago, he picked up the legacy of \nhis fallen brothers and carried it forward into a new century.\n  Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       Many men are great, but few capture the imagination and the \n     spirit of the times. The ones who do are unforgettable.\n\n  He was talking about President Kennedy. But his words ring just as \ntrue when applied to John Kennedy's youngest brother.\n  They speak to Ted's enormous vitality--to his towering impact on the \nlives of so many for so long. He is gone now, but his presence lingers \nin these halls.\n  In the many Senators to whom he has been a friend and mentor, in the \ndedication, faith, and love of country that he inspired, in the wood \nand stone and soul of this Senate Chamber, his legacy is very much \nalive.\n  Now, that legacy has been passed to each of us. And it is time to \ntake up the standard once again. This is a moment to look to the \nfuture, not the past--to meet difficult problems with bold solutions.\n  As the Lion of the Senate told us 1 year ago, at the Democratic \nNational Convention:\n\n       The work begins anew, the hope rises again, and the dream \n     lives on.\n\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, no single voice can fill this Chamber as his once did. \nBut together, we can carry this refrain.\n  Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. I heard the eloquent speeches of Senators Stabenow, \nSchumer, Conrad, and Senator Merkley also about Senator Kennedy.\n  I wish to tell two quick stories about him. I had the pleasure of \nserving on his committee from 2007 on. But early in my first year in \nthe Senate, the Senators, as some know around the country, certainly \nall Members of the Senate know, we choose our desks on the Senate floor \nby seniority. And so in the first month or so of 2007, the freshmen, \nthe other 9 Members of my class, the 10 of us were choosing our seats \non the Senate floor. You can look around the Senate Chamber. There is \nno bad place to sit.\n  I heard from a senior Member that Senators carve their names in their \ndesk drawers; sort of like high school, perhaps. So I began to pull the \ndrawers open in some of the desks that had not yet been chosen. I \npulled open this drawer, and it had Hugo Black of Alabama, who was \nFDR's favorite Southern Senator, who introduced legislation for the 8-\nhour workday, making President Roosevelt's 8-hour workday bill seem a \nlittle less radical, and successfully made its way through the Senate; \nSenator Green from Rhode Island, who came here in the 1960s and served \nmore than two decades; Senator Al Gore, Sr., from Tennessee. And then \nit just said ``Kennedy,'' without a State and without a first name. So \nI asked Ted to come over, and I said: Ted, which brother is this?\n  He said: It's Bobby's desk, I have Jack's desk.\n  And I, of course, fell in love with this desk and got the opportunity \nto have sat here for the last 3 years.\n  The other real quick story about Senator Kennedy; I know Senator Kyl \nis scheduled to speak. I and others were invited, from time to time, to \ngo up to his study just off the Senate floor, one floor above us \noutside the Chamber, and to talk to him and hear him tell stories late \nin the evening as we were voting sometimes until midnight or 1 or 2.\n  What struck me about his study were the photos on the wall. The \nphotos were pictures we all recognized: President Kennedy, Joe Kennedy, \nRose Kennedy, Ethel Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy Shriver; all \nthe people whom we recognized.\n  But Ted Kennedy said to us: These are my family photos.\n  These were people we recognized in the photos, but I had never seen \nthose photos, none of us had. These were not the photos in LIFE \nmagazine; these were the photos of the Kennedy family.\n  But what impressed me about that was they were the Kennedys at \nHyannis Port, the Kennedys sailing, the Kennedys in the Capitol, the \nKennedys at the White House. What impressed me was Ted Kennedy so \neasily could have given up; he could have gone back to a very easy \nlife, particularly after the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968. \nTed had been in the Senate for 6 years. It would have been so easy for \nhim to walk away from this job, from this kind of life, from the danger \nhe faced.\n  Instead, he stayed and he fought. He had everything anybody could \nhope for in life. He had a loving family who cared so much about him. \nHe had all the wealth he needed and the lifestyle so many would have \nbeen so tempted by. But, instead, he stayed and served right up until \nhis death.\n  That says to me everything I love about Ted Kennedy and everything we \nall should need to know about Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I would say to my colleague from Ohio, I commented on the \nsame point. It is pretty obvious Senator Kennedy could have, because of \nwho he was, done just about anything.\n  He certainly would not have had to work as hard as he did. But I have \nnever known a harder working Senator than Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my friend, our \ncolleague, civil rights icon of the Senate, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, \nour lion in the Senate. I have lost someone who has been a mentor, a \nfriend, and one of my heroes. The Nation has lost a great leader. To \nhis family, he was a rock. To his wife Vicki, his children, Kara, \nEdward, Ted, Jr., and Patrick, my former colleague when I was in the \nHouse, and to his sister Jean and the entire Kennedy family, we extend \nour deepest condolences. To his Senate colleagues and his constituents \nin Massachusetts, he was a beacon of hope and perseverance for a better \nday in America.\n  When I came to the Senate in 2007, I was frequently asked during my \nfirst year--I am sure the Presiding Officer has been asked this by \npeople in his State--what is the highlight, what is difference, what \nmakes this place a special place? What did you find different in the \nSenate than you did in the House? The example I gave during my first \nmonth in the Senate, when I was sitting by myself on the floor of the \nSenate, Senator Kennedy came by and sat next to me. He said: Do you \nmind if we talk for a moment? He sat next to me, a new Member of the \nSenate, and he said: Ben, can you tell me what you think we should be \ndoing in health care? He wanted my views. He was looking to find out \nwhat this new Senator from Maryland thought was possible in health care \nreform. That was Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy engaged each Member \nof the Senate to find a common denominator to move forward in solving \nthe major problems of America. It was truly a unique experience for me \nto see one of the most senior Members of the Senate, a person known \ninternationally for his legislative skills, seek out a new Member.\n  I remember one of my constituents asking me during my first year as \nto which Senator I most admire for his or her work ethic. I said \nimmediately: Senator Kennedy. They were taken aback because they didn't \nrealize that this senior Senator, this person who had served for over \n40 years in the Senate, was a person who dedicated every day to doing \nhis very best. Whether it was working with staff or meeting with \nMembers or working his committee or making a speech on the floor of the \nSenate, his work ethic was one of not wasting a single moment in order \nto deal with the Nation's problems.\n  Senator Kennedy served for 46 years in the Senate and had a \ntremendous impact on the issues that have shaped our Nation for almost \na half century. He authored over 2,500 pieces of legislation. All \nAmericans have been touched by Senator Kennedy's work. He dedicated his \nlife to the nameless, the poor, and the minority voices in America, and \nthat dedication is legendary. He has touched the lives of all Americans \nby his work in the Senate, whether it was what he did for voting rights \nor improving educational opportunities, dealing with the rights of \nimmigrants, minimum wage laws, national service, help for the mentally \nill, equality for women, minorities, the disabled, children, the gay \nand lesbian community. The list goes on and on. He was there fighting \nfor those who otherwise would not have had a voice in our government. \nHe did it whether it was popular or not in the State or Nation. He was \ntrue to his principles. The list goes on and on of what he did.\n  I had the great pleasure of serving with him on the Judiciary \nCommittee for 2 years. What a legacy he has created on that committee. \nIt was a great honor for me to be able to serve those 2 years on the \ncommittee with him and to listen to him engage. There has been no \ngreater Senator on the Judiciary Committee to fight on behalf of civil \nrights than Senator Kennedy.\n  He was clearly the conscience of the Senate, to make sure we used \nevery opportunity to advance the rights of all Americans so they could \nachieve their best. He was a legislator's legislator. He had a gift. He \nhad the ability to work across party lines and get work done.\n  He believed in progress and doing the right thing. He had a voice \nthat carried through the halls of the Senate with such passion and yet \nwith such grace.\n  Senator Kennedy once said:\n\n       We know the future will outlast all of us, but I believe \n     that all of us will live in the future we make.\n\n  Senator Kennedy stood for and fought for a better America--even when \nit was not the popular thing to do. Senator Kennedy stayed true to his \nprinciples throughout his entire life.\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\n  With great loss and much sadness, I give much thanks for his service, \nhis friendship, and his dedication. Senator Edward Kennedy will never \nbe forgotten.\n  I thank my dear friend, Senator Kennedy, for the contributions he \nmade to this institution, the U.S. Senate, where I now have the great \nhonor of serving the people of Maryland. Senator Kennedy's legacy will \nlive forever, and we thank him for his service to our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Edward Moore Kennedy, who improved the \nlives of so many people during his 46 years of service in the Senate. \nMy warm aloha and prayers continue to be with Vicki Kennedy, staff \nmembers, the Kennedy family, and his many friends.\n  Senator Kennedy's extraordinary life-long commitment to public \nservice produced a proud legacy that has included expanding access to \nquality of health care and education, protecting and empowering our \nNation's workforce, ensuring civil and voting rights, and protecting \nour Nation's natural and cultural resources.\n  Before outlining several of Senator Kennedy's important achievements, \nI want to share a story that demonstrates our shared commitment to \nhelping working families and his optimistic outlook about the future \ndespite temporary disappointments. A beaming Senator Kennedy flagged me \ndown on the morning of March 2, 2005. He asked me if I had seen the \nWashington Post. In an editorial criticizing the bankruptcy overhaul \nunder consideration in the Senate, the Post indicated the bill could be \nmade more fair by the inclusion of several amendments by Senator \nKennedy intended to protect consumers and my amendment to better inform \nconsumers about the true costs associated with credit card use. After \nmy amendment was defeated, Senator Kennedy was the first member to \napproach me. He complimented me for my work and told me that we would \nwin on the amendment one day. Senator Kennedy was right. It took me \nanother four years, but my credit card minimum payment warning and \ncredit counseling referral legislation was enacted this May as part of \nthe credit card reform law.\n  As an eternal optimist, Senator Kennedy never stopped advocating for \nthe causes so important to working families such as increasing access \nto quality health care. Senator Kennedy helped establish community \nhealth centers, the Children's Health Insurance program, and programs \nthat assist individuals suffering from HIV/AIDS. These are just a few \nof the many health accomplishments that Senator Kennedy helped bring \nabout that improve the quality of life for millions of people in our \ncountry. Despite continuing to battle cancer, Senator Kennedy's passion \nto expand access to quality health care never ceased.\n  Senator Kennedy had an enormous impact on education policy. He \nchampioned early childhood education through his support of Head Start \nand creation of Early Head Start. His work in reauthorizing the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act included improvements such as \nthe Star Schools Program Assistance Act, which improves instruction in \ncritical areas such as mathematics, science, and foreign languages, as \nwell as the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires standards-based \nassessments for elementary and middle school students among other \nreforms. With regard to higher education, Senator Kennedy supported the \ncreation of the Pell Grant program, Direct Lending program, and \nEnsuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act to aid Americans in \npaying for college. Throughout his efforts in education policy, he \nrecognized the needs of underserved populations, and endeavored to make \neducation more affordable. I also appreciated his working with me on \nthe Excellence in Economics Education authorization and subsequent \nfunding requests so that more children could be better prepared for the \nfinancial decisions they will have to make as consumers, investors, and \nheads of households.\n  I also greatly appreciate all of the work done by Senator Kennedy to \nimprove the lives of members of our Nation's workforce. Senator Kennedy \nhelped increase the Federal minimum wage 16 times. He fought for strong \nworkplace health and safety standards, promoted equal pay for equal \nwork, and secure retirement benefits. Senator Kennedy believed the \nright of workers to unionize and bargain collectively was fundamental \nand was always a tireless advocate for this cause. In addition, Senator \nKennedy was a champion of our Federal workers and opposed efforts to \noutsource Federal jobs and erode workers' rights. I recall his staunch \nopposition to weaken the a rights of Department of Defense and \nDepartment of Homeland Security employees and his strong statements in \nsupport of granting Transportation Security Administration Security \nofficers real rights and protections.\n  Senator Kennedy's career-long dedication to ensuring civil and voting \nrights helped bring about numerous changes that have made our country \nstronger, more equitable, and just. He condemned the poll tax, led \nefforts to lower the voting age to 18, and removed voting barriers. His \nfierce and noble opposition to discrimination by race, ethnicity, \ngender, age, disability, sexual orientation, or religion guided much of \nhis work.\n  Senator Kennedy's advocacy for natural and cultural resources helped \nadvance the protection of our environment for our benefit now and into \nthe future. He was an important supporter of energy efficiency \nprograms, including those that aid Americans most in need, and he \nhelped improve fuel economy standards and energy research and \ndevelopment. His work led to the enhanced preservation of numerous \ntreasured resources in Massachusetts including the Minute Man National \nHistoric Park, the Taunton River, the New England Scenic Trail, the \nFreedom's Way National Heritage Corridor, the Boston Harbor Islands, \nthe Quinebaug-Shetucket National Heritage Corridor, Essex National \nHeritage Area, and the Lowell National Historical Park.\n  In addition to his accomplishments and advocacy on behalf of the \npeople of our country, I will remember Ted Kennedy as a true friend, \nalways generous with his assistance and time. For many years, my desk \nwas next to Senator Kennedy's. He welcomed me to the Senate and always \nprovided sound advice and guidance.\n  In 1990, despite the long journey, Senator Kennedy came to Hawaii to \nhelp me during my first Senate campaign. I remember the rally that we \nheld in Honolulu at McKinley High School as being one of the largest \never held in Hawaii. We also had a memorable visit to an early \nchildhood development program. Footage of the event was recently \nreplayed on the news in Hawaii, showing Senator Kennedy and me singing \nItsy, Bitsy, Spider with the children.\n  We toured Kapiolani Children's Hospital where we saw the devastating \neffect that crystal meth was having on families.\n  Senator Kennedy visited the University of Hawaii's John F. Kennedy \nTheatre, where he received an award for his work on health care. He \nspoke eloquently about our Great Country, Congressional debates, civil \nrights, and economic empowerment programs.\n  I, along with every Member of this body, will very much miss our \nfriend from Massachusetts. Senator Kennedy's extraordinary work has \nimproved the quality of life for so many people.\n  We can honor his memory by continuing to work to address the issues \nSenator Kennedy was so passionate about such as meaningful health care \nand immigration reform.\n  I say aloha to my good friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, there are no words to express the sadness \nof the great loss of our dear friend Senator Edward M. Kennedy. America \nhas lost a great patriot and great leader. I have lost a good friend.\n  While it is difficult to say goodbye to a dear friend, I am consoled \nwith the certainty that Ted's spirit and message will continue to \nresonate in the Senate. The solemn but joyful celebration of Ted's life \nreminded one and all that we should remember to help the poor, to heal \nthe sick, to feed the hungry, and to be compassionate with those who \nare less fortunate than us. I will do my best to keep Ted's spirit \nalive.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to the Kennedy family.\n  Mr. President, as America mourns, I ask my colleagues to join me in \npaying tribute to this magnificent Senator.\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the 1955 football season was not a good \none for the Harvard Crimson. With only three victories, it was somewhat \nsurprising that no less a team than the mighty Green Bay Packers \nreached out to a senior end with a professional job offer. ``No \nthanks,'' replied young Ted Kennedy, ``I have plans to go into another \ncontact sport--politics.''\n  Few have played this rough-and-tumble game with as much energy, \ndetermination, and joy as Senator Edward Kennedy. He served the people \nof his State and our Nation through five decades and under 10 \nPresidents. He authored more than 300 bills that became law and \ncosponsored another 550. His remarkable record of legislation has \ntouched the lives of virtually every American, always with a focus on \nimproving lives, bringing justice, and creating opportunity.\n  As we recall what he gave to our Nation, we also reflect upon what we \nhave lost. It is my sincere hope that the Kennedy family will find \ncomfort in the thoughts and prayers offered by so many around the \ncountry and the world. To those who have lost a friend and to his \noutstanding staff, which has lost an inspiring leader, I extend my \ndeepest condolences. I considered him a dear friend as well as an \nesteemed colleague.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1997, I knew Senator Kennedy only \nby reputation. It was a reputation that was not entirely flattering, \nbased upon such labels as ``ultra-liberal'' and ``utterly partisan.'' \nThat was not the Senator Kennedy I came to know and admire. He was easy \nto work with, and his heart was always in the right place. I worked \nclosely with Ted on many education issues, particularly by increasing \nPell grants which help our neediest students. In our work together on \nthe Armed Services Committee, we teamed up to strengthen our Navy as \nmembers of the Seapower Subcommittee.\n  I found him to be a partner who always sought solutions. I saw in him \nthe same traits that drew the attention of the Green Bay Packers--a \ntough competitor and a great teammate.\n  The lion is a symbol of courage. Certainly, Senator Kennedy possessed \ngreat political courage. He fought for his convictions, but he was \nalways willing to reach across party lines. He never, as he often said, \nlet the pursuit of the perfect become the enemy of the good.\n  But he also possessed courage at the most fundamental level--the \nwillingness to face danger. His historic trip to South Africa in 1985, \nconducted against the stern warnings of the pro-apartheid government \nand in defiance of violent demonstrations, helped tear down the wall of \nracial separatism in that country.\n  Senator Kennedy often said that a day never went by that he did not \nthink of his brothers. He did more than merely think of them; he strove \nalways to emulate them. Like Jack, he asked what he could do for his \ncountry. Like Bobby, he dreamed things that never were and said why \nnot.\n  The end of a life so devoted to public service brings to mind the \nParable of the Talents. The master, leaving on a journey, entrusts a \nservant with a portion of his treasure. Upon his return, the master is \ndelighted to find that his wealth has been wisely invested and \nmultiplied.\n  Edward Moore Kennedy was entrusted the great treasure of convictions, \nenergy, and passion. He invested that treasure wisely and multiplied \nits benefits to all. Like the master in the New Testament, to him we \nsay, ``Well done, good and faithful servant.''\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of one \nour Nation's most dedicated public servants. For most Americans, Ted \nKennedy was an icon--part of an esteemed family that raised strong \nleaders and committed patriots. Much has been said since his passing of \nhis contributions to our country and his love for his wife, children, \ngrandchildren, and extended family. Those who eulogized him, at his \nfuneral and on main streets across America, have done so with great \nadmiration and respect.\n  From my position on the opposite side of the aisle in this Chamber, I \nsaw Senator Kennedy as every bit the legendary and tireless advocate \nthat he was portrayed as. I may have been advocating the opposing view \non many issues, but in this country we should always be able to join \ntogether to recognize someone who has--with the best intentions--\ndedicated his life's work to improving opportunities.\n  I had the privilege of working on a very significant piece of \nlegislation with Senator Kennedy a few years ago. It was the America \nCOMPETES Act. I was, and continue to be, passionate about making sure \nthat our children remain competitive in this increasingly global \neconomy. Students in Nevada aren't just competing against students in \nMassachusetts anymore. They are all competing against students in \nIndia, China, and around the world. If we don't give our students the \ntools to compete, the innovative fire and spirit that has always fueled \nAmerica will be lost.\n  Ted Kennedy understood this. We put together bipartisan legislation \nthat was signed into law to increase investment in scientific research; \nstrengthen educational opportunities in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics from kindergarten through graduate school; \nand help develop an innovation infrastructure for the 21st century. I \nam confident that the impact of this law will be felt for generations \nto come.\n  I am also confident that Ted Kennedy's decades of service, his \npassion for health care and education, and his deep love for this \ncountry will inspire a new generation of public servants. When you look \nat the legacy of Ted Kennedy and at how he dedicated his life to \nservice, you can't help but be moved to do more for this country.\n  Senator Kennedy will be missed in this Chamber and in the Halls of \nCongress. God bless you, Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join the chorus of those \ncelebrating the life of our dear friend and colleague, Senator Edward \nM. Kennedy.\n  So much has already been said about him, his life, and his \ncontribution to our Nation, but I would like to take a few minutes to \nreflect upon the legacy he left as a warm individual and an exemplary \nstatesman.\n  His life was, to borrow the words of Robert Frost, ``a gift \noutright.'' Ted Kennedy was ours before we were his.\n  As a young man and a young Senator, history bequeathed to him weighty \nexpectations. He became the accidental shepherd not only to a flock of \nnephews and nieces but also to a storied legacy.\n  An ordinary person would have been daunted by such expectations. But \nTed Kennedy was extraordinary. He confounded them and, in the process, \ndefined his life not by what others had left him to complete but by the \ngoals he set for himself.\n  For all of the rhetoric recently about Kennedy as the Senate's lion, \nwe can never forget that he was also a deeply caring man with a gentle \nspirit. It was this dual nature of his to fight passionately and to \nbefriend heartily that transformed adversaries into admirers and \nendeared him forever to his friends.\n  In February of 1988, I was serving as chief of staff to then-Senator \nJoe Biden when he suffered a serious brain aneurysm. After two \nprecarious surgeries, the doctors said that Senator Biden would need to \navoid work completely for a few months while in that first stage of \nrecovery or risk another aneurysm.\n  When President Reagan called to check up on him, we knew that if he \ntook that call, Senator Biden would be obliged to take all the calls \nthat would follow. It would have been too much for him, so his family \nmade the decision that he would not take any calls, even from the \nPresident.\n  Ted Kennedy kept calling to check on his friend, but our office \nwouldn't put him through. One Sunday, while Senator Biden was resting \nat home in Wilmington, Jill heard a knock on their back door. To her \nsurprise, Kennedy was standing there, holding a framed etching of an \nIrish stag. He had personally taken it upon himself to bring the gift \nin order to lift Senator Biden's spirits. He also had with him a \nbathing suit, ready to relax with his friend and keep him company \nwithout discussing Senate business.\n  We shouldn't have been surprised, though. That was classic Ted \nKennedy.\n  With him there was always a personal touch, especially with those he \nrepresented. In the words of one of his\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\nconstituents, ``Teddy was Massachusetts.''\n  But his constituency was always larger than just the residents of the \nBay State. He felt that it was his responsibility to speak for those \nwho could not. Kennedy was, first and foremost, a representative of the \npoor, the young, the silenced, and the oppressed. He fought tirelessly \nfor the rights of the disabled and those suffering discrimination. \nThroughout decades of public service, he proved to be their faithful \nchampion at every turn.\n  For 47 years, Ted Kennedy was the Senate's steady compass through \nuncertain waters. When others coasted along, satisfied with the status \nquo or set uneasy by the prospect of change, he trimmed his sails and \npushed forward.\n  He pushed forward by building strong, meaningful relationships with \nhis colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He was committed to civility \nin politics.\n  That he so genuinely befriended those who debated vigorously against \nhim on this floor testifies to Kennedy's greatest gift to his \ncolleagues. As his son Teddy Jr. said so eloquently at his father's \nfuneral mass, Kennedy taught us all that all of us who serve in \ngovernment, regardless of party, love this country dearly--that we \nshare a common bond of responsibility and commitment to public service.\n  My hope is that the lessons Ted Kennedy taught his colleagues about \nbipartisanship will guide the Senate today and in the future.\n  Just outside this chamber is the Senate Reception Room, ornately \ndecorated by the 19th century immigrant and master painter of the \nCapitol, Constantino Brumidi. He adorned the ceiling with four \nallegorical scenes depicting what today we would call Justice, \nSecurity, Peace, and Prosperity--four virtues a great Senator should \npromote.\n  It was decided that portraits of the greatest Senators ever to serve \nwould cover its walls. In the 1950s, the Senate established a panel to \nchoose the first five to be so honored. Chaired by a young, energetic \nsenator from Massachusetts, who had authored a Pulitzer Prize winning \nbook on political courage, this ``Kennedy Commission'' selected five \nSenators whose portraits now grace those walls.\n  The commission chose to recognize Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. \nCalhoun, Robert La Follette, and Robert Taft. A few years ago, the \nSenate voted to extend this honor as well to Arthur Vandenberg and \nRobert F. Wagner.\n  All seven earned their place in this pantheon by placing the good of \nthe Nation above political interest. All but one ran unsuccessfully for \nPresident, distinguishing themselves not as commanders-in-chief, but as \nbrilliant legislators and versatile statesmen. Each exemplified a \ncommitment to the four virtues depicted by Brumidi on the reception \nroom's ceiling.\n  Ted Kennedy was a champion of all four of these virtues; indeed, he \nset a new standard by which future Senators will be judged.\n  Whether it was leading the charge for the Civil Rights Act, \nenfranchising young people of military age, or promoting human rights \naround the world, Kennedy pursued justice without relent.\n  Ted Kennedy was committed to ensuring our Nation's security by \nadvocating for nuclear disarmament, leading the way on energy \nconservation, and supporting legislation to punish sponsors of \nterrorism.\n  He worked tirelessly to bring peace to troubled regions, including \nNorthern Ireland.\n  Throughout his career in the Senate, Ted Kennedy did all he could to \nopen the doors of prosperity to millions of Americans seeking fair \nwages, health insurance, or job opportunities.\n  Furthermore, he fought to expand education access, fund scholarships, \nand promote community involvement. Kennedy's efforts have helped invest \nAmerica in a bright future in fields such as science, technology, \nbusiness, and the arts.\n  Even with the seven distinguished senators now immortalized, the \nwalls of the Senate Reception Room remain mostly bare. They await \nfuture Senate commissions, following in the tradition of John F. \nKennedy's panel, to honor those serving from our generation or from \ngenerations yet to come.\n  I am certain that, if I could cast my vote today for the next to be \nso honored, I would proudly and unhesitatingly choose Senator Edward M. \nKennedy.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness to pay \ntribute to my friend, colleague, and great statesman, Senator Ted \nKennedy.\n  As many of my colleagues have noted here today, over his 47 years of \npublic service in the Senate, Ted Kennedy displayed exemplary \nleadership, a commitment to progress, and the vision that by working \ntogether, this body could truly better the lives of Americans.\n  For many years as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I had the \nprivilege to work with and learn from Senator Kennedy. Since 1997, I \nsat just one seat away from him then-Senator Biden to my right and \nSenator Kennedy next to him. Senator Kennedy was always so encouraging. \nA simple ``good job'' or pat on the back might be expected from a busy \nSenator like him, but from time to time, he would take a moment to \nwrite a note and offer encouragement for a bill I was trying to move \nthrough committee or a concern I was expressing about an issue \nimportant to the people of Wisconsin. We have heard so much over the \npast weeks about what he gave to our country throughout his long Senate \ncareer. Just as important, he gave all of us on the committee and in \nthe Senate an example of how to be an effective legislator, a fair \nnegotiator, and a friend to allies and foes alike.\n  As has been noted by many of those who worked alongside him, Senator \nKennedy masterfully negotiated with others in the long process of \nshaping policy but refused to retreat from his principles--or from his \nquest toward equality and social justice for all. His tireless advocacy \non the behalf of those Americans most in need of an advocate--children, \nsenior citizens, the sick, disabled and mentally ill, students, \nworkers, and families--has changed the course of this Nation and \nimpacted millions of lives. Senator Kennedy's many legislative \nbattles--for civil rights, voting rights, and workers rights, among \nothers--illustrated that although we may differ in our politics and our \nideologies, it is still possible work with each other, across the aisle \nand across the political spectrum, toward the common good. Although I \nam sad today to realize that we will never hear another of his fiery \nspeeches, many of them given just a few desks away from mine in the \nback row of this Chamber, he leaves a legacy behind that will endure.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Victoria and to the rest \nof his family during this difficult time. Senator Kennedy's passion, \ndiligence, good humor, and kindness will be greatly missed, by me and \nby many others, in this body and across the Nation.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the passing \nof our dear colleague and friend, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.\n  Our great Nation has lost a true statesman, and the Kennedy family \nhas lost its beloved patriarch. Senator Kennedy's unparalleled \nleadership and decades spent in service to his fellow Americans will be \nmissed by all, especially here in the U.S. Senate. No one can deny that \nTed was a man of convictions, passion and resolve for doing what he \nfelt was best for the country. While I was not always in agreement with \nhim on policy, I always knew he was my friend.\n  His willingness to reach across the aisle and find common ground \nserves as an inspiration to all of us during this pivotal moment in our \nNation's history. Senator Kennedy and I shared a passion for early \nchildhood development, and together with Senator Gregg, we worked on \nlegislation to improve the quality and availability of early education \nfor all children.\n  On a more personal note, Ted was a guiding light for me during my \nlate-nephew's treatment for bone cancer. His uplifting spirit and \nthoughtfulness helped steer my family through a very difficult time, \nand I will never forget the words he shared with us: ``Even when it's \nsometimes stormy one day, the sun always seems to shine the next.''\n  Janet and I will keep Victoria and the entire Kennedy family in our \nthoughts and prayers during this trying time, as they mourn the loss of\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\nboth Ted and his sister Eunice. Senator Kennedy's great shadow of \nleadership which loomed so large across the U.S. Senate will continue \nfor years to come, and I hope the Kennedy family and my colleagues can \nfind solace in the fact that Ted has joined our Heavenly Father.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and \ncelebrate Edward Moore Kennedy.\n  Senator Kennedy passed away, as we know, on August 25. The American \npeople, in more ways than they will ever know--as so often happens in \nhistory with historic figures, people don't know what they had when \nthey had it, and then when they no longer have it, they discover how \ngreat that person really was if one deserves to be so identified, and \nsurely Ted Kennedy did--the American people lost a touchstone. The \ncause of justice lost one of its bravest and boldest champions, and I \nlost a very close friend.\n  I met Ted Kennedy back in about 1961, which is quite a long time ago, \nin Hyannis Port. His family invited me to come there for the weekend. \nHe was still recovering from his back injury. He broke his back in 12 \nplaces. He was in one of those old-fashioned circle things where they \nsort of turned you so you wouldn't get bed sores. We had a nice \nconversation, and he wrote and thanked me with his hand for coming to \nsee him.\n  Obviously, I have and will always be thinking about Vicki, his \nincredible wife, his children, and the entire Kennedy family who \noperates as one unit.\n  Because of Ted, I think all of us are better. I know I am. I think we \nare stronger. We are more inclusive as a nation. He caused us to be \nthat way.\n  For 46 years, he was a legislative lion, as they say, who gave voice \nto the voiceless. That is not a cliche; that is an extraordinary and \npowerful deep fact from the junior Senator from the State of West \nVirginia. The people of West Virginia were given voice, and Ted Kennedy \ngave them that voice. He fought for working families, civil rights, \nwomen's rights, health care for all, and transformed the lives of \nchildren, seniors, Americans of all ages, all colors, all backgrounds. \nEverybody was part of his sphere, part of his responsibility.\n  In his private life he worked tirelessly to touch so many people with \nendless human acts of kindness that came naturally to him. He sort of \nhad--he had to do it. I don't think he chose to do these things; he \njust had to do them and, therefore, did do them. People forget, those \nwho didn't know about what he did, but he never stopped reaching out to \nhelp people at every turn, in sometimes very small ways.\n  Ted and his family reached amazing heights, and they inspired a \nnation. Each and every day of his life he honored the fallen heroes we \nalways cherish.\n  This needs to be said: Ted traveled to West Virginia often. I was \npersonally very grateful for that. It is a small State, not unlike that \nof the Presiding Officer. Our State has always had very close \ncommunication with the Kennedy family. We are them; they are us. You \nknow, we put them over the top, we feel, in the 1960 election, and we \ndid. When President Kennedy returned to West Virginia, he, at the \nState's centennial, said that classic phrase which we have heard so \nmany times in West Virginia: ``The Sun does not always shine in West \nVirginia, but the people always do.''\n  People are still to this day moved by that statement. It is a \nsentiment I have always held near to my heart, that he and his brothers \nfelt the way they did about West Virginia. I remember a picture of \nBobby Kennedy sitting on a slag heap, a sort of pile of coal in \nsouthern West Virginia, just sort of thinking. He wasn't shaking hands, \nhe was doing a typical Bobby Kennedy-type thing: thinking, deep in \nthought; philosophical, wondering about what to do in the world.\n  Over the last four decades, Ted's frequent visits not only \nstrengthened West Virginia's bond with him and the Kennedy family, but \nhe also provided enormous color, interest, and fun. I remember him at \npolitical rallies in West Virginia where some politician was going on \nand on. I have an album of photographs that were taken sequentially of \ndifferent faces, very long and large speeches, and he is this way, he \nis wiping his brow. He enjoyed all of it. He just loved it.\n  Everywhere he went he found common ground. He spoke honestly. People \ncame out to see him. He didn't hesitate to plunge into the crowd or \njump on the back of a pickup truck. Indeed, the American worker knew a \nstrong friend in Ted Kennedy. That much was clear in the tireless work \nhe did as an advocate for our miners, for our seniors, for all of our \npeople.\n  He has been with us in some of our very darkest hours. We had a \nmining tragedy several years ago. Johnny Isakson, who was speaking not \nlong ago, was there as were several members of the HELP Committee, the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We had a cave-in and \na blowup in a mine in Sago in Upshur County. He came down there. He sat \nwith those families and watched them. I watched his hurt resonating \nagainst their hurt, and the words he spoke to them had deep comfort to \nthem. As a result, we had the first major overhaul of mine safety laws \nat the Federal level since 1977. He, obviously, was driving the \ncommittee and driving that, as was Senator Johnny Isakson and Mike \nEnzi.\n  People liked Ted. They were drawn to his energy and his fundamental \nbelief that America's best days were always ahead. I love that attitude \nbecause you can always pick it out. I just did a television thing and \neverybody was asking me about the person who spoke out last night, \ninterrupting the President and saying something rather unusual, and the \nPresident just went right on ahead. He had bigger things to do. Ted was \nthat way.\n  He had hard parts of his personal life and his own family life. He \nwas the father of endless numbers of nieces and nephews, as well as his \nown children. Nothing ever stopped him.\n  People wanted to work with him. He never, ever talked about his own \nachievements. That is the incredible thing about him. As a result of \nthe plane accident, he broke his back in 12 places. That is a lot of \nplaces to break a back. He never spent another day the rest of his \nlife, he once told me fairly recently, without being in pain. You could \nsee him walking across the floor of the Senate. He was always bent, and \nhe walked quickly, sort of subconsciously, to cover up the fact that he \nwas hurting. But he never said anything about it. He never said \nanything about himself. It was always: What is going on in your life? \nWhat is happening with you? What are your thoughts? What do you think \nwe should be doing on such a subject? That was simply the way he was.\n  He refused to be slowed. He brought that iron will to everything he \ndid. He never quit. He never gave up. He was a happy fighter. He loved \nlife. He loved the battle, driven not out of anger but out of passion \nfor people and the individual parts of their lives he wanted to \nimprove. It just drove him. He didn't do it out of duty; he did it \nbecause he had to. It was a natural thing. For Ted, every day was new. \nEverything could be made better through hard work and dedication. \nNearly every piece of legislation that has passed in this body bore his \nimprint or bears his imprint and reflected his commitment to making \nlife better for every American.\n  It has been my honor to lock arms with him in our efforts, including \nthe children's health program. Interestingly--we just found it--Senator \nKennedy called it the most far-reaching step that Congress has ever \ntaken to help the Nation's children and the most far-reaching advance \nin health care since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid a \ngeneration ago. Now, in the Finance Committee we are trying to decide \nwhether we are going to cast them into the melting pot along with all \nthe other plans and take away the defined benefits. I am obviously very \nmuch against that. Eleven million children's health care is at stake.\n  Ted worked on the Higher Education Act of 1965 and to protect Federal \nstudent loans. Again, let me get back to the personal side.\n  I have a daughter. We only have one daughter and three sons. She is a \nteacher, and she is trained in special ed. She teaches--she did teach \nat Jackie Robinson Junior High School in Harlem. Ted was in New York. \nHis chief of staff at that time was my daughter's best friend. She \nsaid: You know, Jay Rockefeller's daughter teaches there.\n  Ted said: Let's go in.\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\n  So here is my daughter teaching class in junior high school and in \nwalks Ted Kennedy. Of course, the whole place just falls apart with \nhappiness. He loved doing it. He does it in the District of Columbia; \nhe does it in Massachusetts. He is always interacting with students. He \ngreets them, talks with them, and learns from them.\n  The principal gave my daughter a very hard time. He said: Don't you \never bring a United States Senator into my school without telling me in \nadvance.\n  Well, of course, that is the beauty of it. There is no way she could \nbecause it was just a natural act of Ted Kennedy.\n  It was that commitment to service that we celebrated just this spring \nwhen the President signed the Serve America Act which inspires young \npeople to serve their country through public service. There are a lot \nof ways to remake America, but I think people, as the Presiding Officer \nhas been in a variety of situations--people going abroad, people \nmeeting other people who are unlike them, living with them, eating with \nthem, sharing with them, coming to know them, coming to have very \nstrong feelings about them--it is that kind of thing which makes people \nwant to get into public service.\n  So he doubled the Peace Corps, he doubled Legal Aid, he doubled \nVista, he doubled all of those programs, a lot of which were run by his \nbrother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, who is one of the great men of America \nwho is never discussed. He is a Kennedy, but he doesn't bear that as a \nlast name.\n  He changed my life--the Kennedy family did. When I went to West \nVirginia as a Vista volunteer, I was trying to figure out what I was \ngoing to do in life, and I kind of wanted to be a Foreign Service \nofficer. Frankly, I wanted to be America's first Ambassador to China. \nThis was back in 1961, so it does really make sense. I had studied \nChinese for a year, so I thought I was on my way. But Vista started and \nSargent Shriver called me and said: Come work for me at the Peace \nCorps. And I did that. Then I went to southern West Virginia as a Vista \nvolunteer and it told me what I wanted to do in life. This part of your \ngut knows when you are doing something that is meaningful to you and is \nsomething that you want to dedicate your life to. That was the effect \nof the Kennedys.\n  Ted Kennedy was a giant. There was not and never will be anyone like \nhim in American history. He shaped this institution for decades by \nhonoring its history and pushing us forward to be a better institution.\n  Now that he is gone, I know his legacy and inspiration make him a \ngiant greater still, moving us to reach across the aisle, hopefully, \nand make a difference in people's lives. He was a great friend. We are \nall forever grateful for his service and his kind heart. We will miss \nhim very dearly. Now he belongs to the ages.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this would be a particularly opportune \nimportant time for me to say a word about our friend, Senator Kennedy. \nI had not planned on doing so at this particular juncture, but someone \nvery important to him, and in a very different way to me, is now in the \ngallery. So I will speak very briefly, but I do want to, as I have said \nbefore, thank Senator Kennedy for his kindness to me.\n  As a very senior and distinguished Senator, a person with a national \nand, indeed, international reputation, a person whose standing in this \nbody was unmatched, a person whose legislative prowess and capability \nwas unmatched, he did not need to pay any attention to a new Senator of \nno particular seniority, clout, or renown from Rhode Island. Yet he \ndid, I think in large part due to the friendship the new Senator from \nRhode Island had with his son, a very talented and able Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, who is senior to me in our Rhode Island \ndelegation and who represents Rhode Island with exceptional distinction \nover in the House of Representatives. For that reason, and for the \nreason of a number of other family friendships, he was particularly \nkind to me. I appreciate that more than he could have imagined.\n  It is a bit daunting to come here as a new Senator not knowing \nwhether you will find your way, not knowing whether you will evince any \nability, not knowing whether you will have any effect, not knowing \nwhether, indeed, you will be very welcome. You have to fight yourself \nthrough that stuff as a new Senator.\n  I can remember when I was presiding, where the distinguished junior \nSenator from Alaska is now sitting, and a colleague of ours who shall \nremain nameless was giving a speech of some length. Senator Kennedy was \nwaiting to speak, and he sent a note up to me inquiring whether I felt \nthat the standards of the speech we were then being treated to met the \nhigh standards of our common alma mater, the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law. I could not help but smile back and return the note, \nsaying: No, I do not think so, but that is okay because I am waiting \nfor a great speech from you.\n  There is one particular kindness I wanted to mention. Senator Kennedy \nwas very important to Rhode Island. He was important to Rhode Island \nnot just because of his son Patrick but because Rhode Island pays a lot \nof attention to Massachusetts, there is a lot of overlap in the \nconstituencies of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and Rhode Islanders \nhave long admired Senator Kennedy. When he came on behalf of \ncandidates, on behalf of his son, on behalf of me, on behalf of others, \nthere was always an atmosphere of celebration around him and around the \nevents he attended. Other speakers have spoken of his ability to rev up \na crowd and get people fired up and enthusiastic, and he was really \nremarkable in that respect. We never tired of his visits, and Rhode \nIsland always welcomed him with open arms.\n  He had a special place for Rhode Island, and in particular he had a \nspecial place for somebody who was very dear to both Congressman \nKennedy and to myself; that is, a predecessor of mine here in the \nSenate from Rhode Island, Senator Claiborne Pell. Senator Pell was a \npolitical legend in Rhode Island, in many ways an improbable candidate.\n  Senator Kennedy's brother, President Kennedy, at one point said, \npublicly enough that it became a matter of sort of common discussion in \nRhode Island, that Claiborne Pell was the least electable candidate he \nhad ever seen. So when Claiborne Pell ran ahead of President Kennedy in \nRhode Island in the election, it was a matter of great pride to \nClaiborne Pell and one that he was fond of reminding all Kennedys \nabout.\n  It was, I guess as they would say in ``Casablanca,'' the beginning of \na beautiful friendship. The friendship began back then. It continued \nlong after Senator Pell had left the Senate. It continued long after \nSenator Pell had lost his ability to walk around and became confined to \na wheelchair. It continued even long after Senator Pell had lost his \nability to speak and could barely speak because of the consequences of \nhis illness.\n  One of the ways it manifested itself is that every year Senator \nKennedy would take the trouble to sail his sailboat, the Maya, from \nwherever it was in New England to Newport, RI, and there take Claiborne \nPell out sailing. I had the pleasure to be on that last sail, and you \ncould just imagine the scene, with the heaving dock and the heaving \nboat and Senator Pell in his wheelchair and a rather hazardous and \nimpromptu loading of Senator Pell into the sailboat. And then, of \ncourse, it got underway. Because Senator Pell was having such trouble \nspeaking, he really could not contribute much to a conversation. But \nSenator Kennedy had the gift of being able to handle both sides of a \nconversation and have everybody feel that a wonderful time was being \nhad. So he carried on in a full, roaring dialog with Senator Pell, \nessentially providing both sides of that dialogue, and Senator Pell was \nsmiling from ear to ear.\n  It said a lot about what I appreciate so much about Senator Kennedy. \nFirst of all, Rhode Island mattered to him, as it matters to Patrick \nKennedy, as it matters to me. Second of all, as powerful as he was and \nas important as he was, friendship mattered more than authority or \nclout or power. There was nothing any longer that Senator Pell could do \nfor Senator Kennedy. There was nothing that could be done to advance \nhis legislative interests or his political interests or his fundraising \ninterests or any other aspirations he may have had. But it mattered to \nhim to do this because he was loyal and because friendship counted.\n  In a body in which opportunism and self-promotion and self-\nadvancement are not unknown, it was remarkable of Senator Kennedy to \ngive so much of his\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\ntime to this particular pursuit, to this particular visit, taking his \nold, now disabled friend, out for a sail and giving him so much \npleasure, with no hope or hint of reward or return to Senator Kennedy \nhimself.\n  So I will conclude with that. I guess I will conclude with one other \nthing. He loved Robert Frost. On his desk here right now is a poem from \nRobert Frost, ``The Road Not Taken.''\n  I know he was fond of Frost's work in particular. I keep a little \nbook of poems and things that matter to me, quotations, and one of them \nis a poem by Robert Frost. It is not ``The Road Not Taken,'' which is \nthe poem on Senator Kennedy's desk. It is a different one. But I will \nclose by reading it. It is called ``Acquainted with the Night.''\n\n     I have been one acquainted with the night.\n     I have walked out in rain--and back in rain.\n     I have outwalked the furthest city light.\n\n     I have looked down the saddest city lane.\n     I have passed by the watchman on his beat.\n     And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\n\n     I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\n     When far away an interrupted cry\n     Came over houses from another street,\n\n     But not to call me back or say good-bye;\n     And further still at an unearthly height,\n     O luminary clock against the sky\n\n     Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\n     I have been one acquainted with the night.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, once again, we mourn another Kennedy, \nthe last brother, a friend, a colleague, a Senator's Senator, larger \nthan life even in death, certainly the most effective legislator of our \ntime and arguably the most effective Member of this body in the whole \nof American history.\n  Across this Nation and across the political divide, we have seen the \nimpact of his life and work in the tearful eyes of millions of \nAmericans. Each face a challenge to continue his long and lasting \nlegacy of hard-fought, hard-won battles for hardworking families \neverywhere. His is a legacy of hope for the unemployed, the \ndispossessed, the downtrodden, the undereducated, the uninsured; a \nlegacy of hope for Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans, all \nAmericans who have come to this country, often with little more than \nthe clothes on their backs and a glorious dream for a better life.\n  Ted Kennedy will be remembered by my generation as more than the last \nbrother, more than the end of an era. He will be remembered as \nAmerica's preeminent leader on fair, responsible, humane immigration \npolicy that always put people first. For all of us, he was the standard \nbearer of headier days, of Camelot, of intellectual vitality, political \nenergy, and a deep and abiding commitment to public service and to this \nbeloved Senate. He taught us through actions and deeds, in times of \ngreat personal pain, the power of the human spirit to endure and \nprevail. He symbolized the best of an era of progressive, compassionate \nleadership in this country and a deep belief that we must always ask \nwhat we can do for the country, a torch unexpectedly passed to him \nwhich he carried with dignity and humility through great tragedy as \nwell as great triumph.\n  He understood our personal struggles, however profound, ``make us \nstronger in the broken places,'' as Hemingway said. For every Hispanic \nAmerican and every American across this Nation whose family came here \nto find a better life, whatever their ethnicity or political views, Ted \nKennedy was a leader. His deep and abiding concern for the struggles of \nhard-working people was not political. It is simply part of the Kennedy \nDNA.\n  I remember the images of his brother, Bobby Kennedy, in 1967, 6,000 \npeople surrounding him on the flatbed truck that held a severely \nweakened Cesar Chavez. Bobby Kennedy shared a piece of samita with \nChavez and the crowd cheered. They grabbed at Bobby to shake his hand \nand thank him. He stood in front of the crowd and said:\n\n       The world must know from this time forward that the migrant \n     farm worker, the Mexican-American, is coming into his own \n     rights . . .\n       You are winning a special kind of citizenship; no one is \n     doing it for you--you are doing it yourselves--and therefore, \n     no one can ever take it away.\n\n  Fast-forward to Washington, DC, in 2006, walking in his brother's \nfootsteps, Ted Kennedy stood in front of hundreds of thousands of \nmarchers on the same ground his brothers had stood upon decades \nearlier. He stood with immigrants and faith leaders and organizers. He \ncalled for comprehensive immigration reform. The crowd of hundreds of \nthousands roared, and he roared back:\n\n       Si se puede. Si se puede.\n\n  Yes, we can.\n  Now he is gone, having fought his last battle with courage and \ndignity, as he fought all others. But the memories remain. I remember \nfirst coming to the Senate, sitting down with him, his presence as \ncommanding as I thought it would be. I looked at him to learn all I \ncould from him about the Senate and, frankly, there was no more patient \nor willing teacher. When I first sought to come to the Senate, the one \nMember of the Senate who gave me the most time and gave me the most \nencouragement and the greatest opportunity to understand how to be \nsuccessful in the Senate was a person I could do the least for. It was \nTed Kennedy. I will never forget his kindness.\n  We worked together to protect the Senate restaurant employees when \ntheir jobs were privatized. I learned what made him such an effective \nlegislator--because even as he was dealing with the most incredible \nissues the country was facing and leading on many of them, he had time \nto remember the importance of that little person, people in the Senate \nrestaurant who might have been unemployed.\n  We all know no one can belt out an Irish ballad quite like Teddy \ncould. One of my favorite memories was of him and I in New Jersey in a \ncampaign where we sang Irish ballads together. I learned then what made \nhim the unique person he is. I will never forget the sound of that \nvoice and the warmth of that heart. Each of us has had our own memories \nof the man. Each of us has had our own deep emotions when we heard of \nhis death.\n  The editorial cartoonist, Lalo Alcaraz, said when his wife heard that \nTed Kennedy had lost his battle with cancer, she pulled out one of her \nold buttons that her mother had worn during the Presidential campaign \nin 1960. That day, Lalo Alcaraz drew a cartoon of a much younger Ted \nKennedy. It is captioned with two simple words on the campaign button: \n``Viva Kennedy.''\n  As I sat in the basilica in Boston with our colleagues last week, I \nthought of all Ted Kennedy did to better the lives of so many \nAmericans, and I thought of those two words over and over again: Viva \nKennedy. He was a man who truly believed in the idea and ideal that is \nAmerica. Although we may have come from different backgrounds, \ndifferent places, different cultures, though we may speak different \nlanguages, we are one Nation, indivisible, forged from shared values \nand common principles, each of us united in our differences working for \nthe betterment of all of us, and no one worked harder for the \nbetterment of all of us than Ted Kennedy.\n  It is my sincere belief that in his passing he has once again worked \nhis magic and given us an opportunity to come together, united in a \ndeep and profound feeling of loss and emptiness as we are even at this \nday. It would be like him to be looking down upon these tributes today, \nnodding his head and smiling, but he would be saying: Don't wait for my \nmemorials to be laid. He would say: Don't wait for my words to be \nchiseled in marble at Arlington. Don't wait for some bronze statue in \nWashington or a bridge named after me in Boston. Stand up, do what is \nright for the American people now. Do what is right for hard-working \nfamilies in your States, for hard-working families in my State--in New \nBedford, Brockton, Fall River, or Worcester. I can see him standing \nover there where he always stood, committed, informed, imposing, \npounding on his desk, shouting at the top of his lungs. You could hear \nit when you were outside of the Chamber when he was in one of those \nmoments.\n  Those families don't have time to wait for a decent job and wages. \nThey don't have time to wait for a better job. They don't have time to \nwait for decent, affordable, quality care that is a right and not a \nprivilege. That booming voice would echo through this Chamber, and I \nthink it will echo through this Chamber for eternity.\n  When it comes down to it, we are his legacy. We in the Senate are his \nmemorial. We are the burning candles, and he would tell us to have them \nburn brightly: Stand against the wind. Stand against the storm. Stand \nagainst\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\nthe odds. For it is up to us now to light the world, as he did.\n  In this past week, I think we have all found new meaning in those \nfamiliar words of Aeschylus, when he said:\n\n       And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget falls drop \n     by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our \n     will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.\n\n  Today, in our despair, let wisdom come. Let us honor the memory of \nSenator Edward Moore Kennedy by not only remembering the man but by \ncontinuing the good work he has done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am honored to be here to add my voice \nto so many of those who today have eloquently remembered Senator Ted \nKennedy. Like so many who have spoken today, I was the beneficiary of \nso many personal kindnesses from Senator Kennedy.\n  I actually first met him on the campaign trail. In 1980, I was \nactually on the other side in New Hampshire when he was running against \nJimmy Carter. Despite the fact that was a very hard-fought campaign and \nwe won and he lost, when I ran a winning campaign 4 years later in the \nNew Hampshire primary, Senator Kennedy was one of the first people to \ncall and congratulate me.\n  After that, I had the opportunity to campaign over the years with \nSenator Kennedy. There was no one who could fire up a crowd as he \ncould. In 2000, I remember he was there for Al Gore when times were \ntough in New Hampshire. He was there for John Kerry in 2004. And I had \nthe opportunity to travel around the country with him in support of \nJohn Kerry, his very good friend.\n  But I really got to see the difference he made in so many lives when \nI worked with him at the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School of \nGovernment at Harvard. I had the opportunity to be chosen to be the \ndirector there, and Senator Kennedy was one of those people who helped \nmake that decision and make that happen for me. What was so impressive \nwas that it did not matter how busy he was with the work in Washington, \nwith what he was doing in Massachusetts, he never missed a meeting. His \nfirst concern was always: What are the students doing? What is going to \nexcite them? What is going to get them involved in politics and public \nservice, because that was the mission of the Institute of Politics. It \nwas one of two memorials that were established by the Kennedy family to \nremember his brother, President John Kennedy. It was always amazing to \nme to see someone who was so busy, so prominent in national life, who \nnever missed an opportunity to talk with the freshman student who was \nthere who wasn't quite sure what they wanted to do, to talk with and \nencourage the young people who were involved at the institute to get \ninvolved in politics, in government, in public service.\n  I know Senator Kennedy will be remembered by so many of the \nkindnesses he provided to people. He will be remembered by the tens of \nthousands of people whose lives he touched. But I think one of his most \nsignificant legacies will be those young people who are encouraged to \nget involved in politics, who appreciate that public service in \ngovernment is an honorable profession because of his leadership and the \nwork he did.\n  I feel very honored and privileged to have worked with him and to \nhave had the opportunity to serve with him, however briefly, in the \nSenate. I know we will all remember for future generations what Senator \nKennedy has done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9229-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n   Ms. STABENOW.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, Professor Cass Sunstein's academic \ncredentials are impressive. He has taught at the University of Chicago \nSchool of Law and at the Harvard School of Law, and has been a prolific \nwriter on a wide variety of topics.\n  He has some fine ideas on cost-benefit analysis, and I hope they will \nbe reflected in his approach as administrator of Office of Information \nand Regulatory Affairs.\n  I do, however, find that some of the arguments he has made, and the \npositions he has taken in his writings and speeches, fall outside the \nmainstream.\n  One theme that has appeared repeatedly in his writings and speeches \nis his strange belief that animals should have legal standing in court. \nProfessor Sunstein wrote in his book Animal Rights: Current Debates and \nNew Directions that, ``We could even grant animals a right to bring a \nsuit without insisting that animals are persons. . . . We could retain \nthe idea of property but also give animals far more protection against \n. . . neglect of their interests.''\n  He goes on: ``It seems possible that before long Congress will grant \nstanding to animals in their own right. . . . Indeed I believe that in \nsome circumstances, Congress should do exactly that, to provide a \nsupplement to limited public enforcement efforts.''\n  In a paper for the University of Chicago School of Law, Professor \nSunstein wrote that, ``Representatives of animals should be able to \nbring private suits to ensure that anticruelty and related laws are \nactually enforced. If, for example, a farm is treating horses cruelly \nand in violation of legal requirements, a suit could be brought, on \nbehalf of those animals.''\n  Of course, no one favors animal cruelty. That is why there are laws \nagainst it. That should go without saying. But there is a big \ndifference between having concerns about the treatment of animals and \ntaking Professor Sunstein's position that an animal deserves a lawyer \nin court.\n  An animal is not a person, and it cannot function as a plaintiff \nduring a trial. Laws and regulations that would give animals legal \nstanding in court could open the door to a flood of ridiculous lawsuits \nthat would wreak havoc on research labs, restaurants, farms, and the \nlike.\n  Imagine what could happen if a group wanted to represent lab rats or \nfarm chickens in a class-action lawsuit. Even if claims were found \nbaseless in courts, someone, farms, laboratories, business owners, \nwould still bear the costs of litigation.\n\n[[Page S9230]]\n\n  There may be room for this kind of thinking in academia. But it has \nno place in the executive branch of the U.S. Government, especially in \nthe top regulatory office of the administration.\n  As the Discovery Institute's Wesley J. Smith has written on Professor \nSunstein's position on animal standing in courts, it ``would do more \nthan just plunge the entire animal industry into chaos . . . the \nperceived exceptional importance of human life would suffer a \nstaggering blow by erasing one of the clear legal boundaries that \ndistinguishes people from animals.''\n  Professor Sunstein was also out of the mainstream when, in a 2003 \npaper, ``Lives, Life Years, and Willingness to Pay,'' he explained his \nviews on a life-valuation system: ``No regulatory program makes people \nimmortal. The only issue is life extension, and, in terms of welfare, a \nprogram that saves 10,000 life years is better than one that saves \n1,000 life years, holding all else constant. In welfare terms, a \nprogram that saves younger people is unquestionably better than one \nthat saves older people.'' That is plainly not true if you believe in \nthe moral equality of all lives.\n  While discussions about the value of an older person's versus a \nyounger person's life may be acceptable inside the cozy confines of \nelite academic settings, they raise serious concerns when written by \nthe person nominated to be America's regulatory czar. This is \nespecially true at a time when we are engaged in a debate over the \nfuture of our healthcare system and as Congress considers several \nproposed bills that call for the administration to act on new \nhealthcare regulations that could end up under the purview of OIRA.\n  Cost-benefit analysis is fine, but not as a means to ration \nhealthcare, e.g., to America's elderly. Professor Sunstein's views call \nto mind the British basis for healthcare rationing: the Quality-\nAdjusted Life Years, (QALY.)\n  I am also troubled by the outcome of a Democratic retreat in which \nProfessor Sunstein participated after the 2000 election. As the New \nYork Times reported in May of 2001, the ``principal topic was forging a \nunified party strategy to combat the White House on judicial \nnominees.''\n  The strategy that resulted from this retreat led to two fundamental, \nand I believe, corrosive, changes in the way judicial nominees are \nconsidered. The first was to encourage filibusters, previously unknown \nfor judges, and the second was that when voting for a judicial nominee, \na Senator should determine the political views of nominees and vote \nagainst those with whom you disagree.\n  As the Times reported, one participant said of the panel discussion \nin which Professor Sunstein's participated, ``They said it was \nimportant for the Senate to change the ground rules and there was no \nobligation to confirm someone just because they are scholarly or \nerudite.''\n  The net result, a very negative result, of these changes was a hyper-\npartisan judicial confirmation process during the Bush administration, \none that tarnished many nominees and in which too many votes were \ndetermined by party affiliation and ideology. Some very worthy \nnominees, such as Miguel Estrada, were filibustered and, therefore, \nwrongly denied a confirmation vote.\n  I see this nomination as part of a broader pattern: One that shows \nthat the Obama administration has repeatedly nominated or hired \nindividuals with overly-partisan or bizarre views. Just last week, the \nfacts came to light about the radical ideology and associations of Van \nJones, President Obama's now-former green jobs czar, who was not \nsubject to a Senate confirmation process.\n  While he has tried to explain away some of his views and assure \nSenators that he won't try to apply his personal opinions as part of \nhis official duties, I believe that Professor Sunstein's nomination \nreflects this administration's pattern of favoring out-of-the-\nmainstream individuals for key jobs. If a Republican judicial nominee \nharbored such views, I have no doubt that the participants at the \nDemocratic retreat in which Professor Sunstein participated would have \nfound justification for a filibuster or negative vote, notwithstanding \nhis fine legal credentials. While I have serious concerns about the \nstandard, Democrats won that debate and now apply the standard. There \ncannot be one standard for Democrats and one standard for Republicans. \nTherefore, I must oppose this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SUNSTEIN TO BE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION AND \n     REGULATORY AFFAIRS, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET--Continued\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the nominee to be Administrator of the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Mr. Cass Sunstein, is \nbefore the body. He will be, if confirmed, a part of the White House \nOffice of Management and Budget. He will have a number of \nresponsibilities. It is certainly a very significant position.\n  This job has the responsibility of renewing all regulations proposed \nby all the Departments and agencies of the government. The regulations \nthey issue are many. Laws are passed in this Congress, sometimes in \nhaste, leaving the details of execution to the various agencies of our \ngovernment--the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Department of Agriculture, all the agencies.\n  They have powers to effectuate the statutes passed by Congress. They \nset forth the details of how it is done. There are thousands of pages \nof regulations enacted every year. They are published in the Federal \nRegister. No Senator or Congressman, to my knowledge, has ever sat down \nand read the Federal Register.\n  Federal regulations have much the same force as law. Indeed, people \ncan go to jail for violating Federal regulations, and some do go to \njail for violations of Federal regulations.\n  Some of this is, in fact, a product of necessity. For example, you \ncreate a park. When does the park open and close? And if people come in \nand litter, or people come in after hours, they can be punished, \narrested, put in jail. Often those regulations and the punishment are \nset forth through regulation and not through the statute that created \nthe park to begin with.\n  But it is a matter of real importance. Persons who produce these \nregulations are nameless and faceless denizens of the bureaucratic \ndeep. They possess enormous power. As a prosecutor, I prosecuted cases. \nAt the DEA, many of the drug regulations enforced by the Drug \nEnforcement Administration are based on regulations they pass, not what \nwas actually required by the Congress of the United States. Major \npolicy decisions are often set forth in that fashion, including \nenvironmental regulations, health care regulations, and reimbursement \nrules and hospital requirements. Financial institutions can be done \nthrough regulations and controlled through them. Truly, there is a \nconcern about the disconnect between the democratic accountability we \nare known for in our country and this process of administrative \nregulations.\n  During President Reagan's time, I believe, Congress passed a law that \ncreated this position: the Administrator for the Office of Information \nand Regulatory Affairs, the idea being to have another unelected \nbureaucrat--and that is what this one is--but to be a central \nclearinghouse for all the proposed regulations and to question the \nlawfulness or the necessity or the cost of these thousands of \nregulations that get promulgated on a yearly basis.\n  It is an important position that can protect and at least somewhat \nensure that our constitutional liberties are not being eroded.\n  Enter Mr. Sunstein. He is a most likable person, a national \nintellectual, always interesting, sometimes taking positions that those \non the left--of which he clearly is a part--disagree. Indisputably, he \nis a man of the left. However, he has taken, over the years, quite a \nnumber of positions, some of which are pretty shocking. So I think he \nis not normally the kind of person you would appoint to this kind of \ngreen-eyeshades position--somebody who would be sitting down on a daily \nbasis reading the regulations and studying them and researching them--\nto be a free spirit, as our nominee is. So I have some concerns about \nit.\n  Over the course of his career in academia, Professor Sunstein has \nclearly advocated a number of positions that are outside--well \noutside--the American mainstream. While much of the criticism of his \nnomination rightly has focused on his animal rights advocacy, where he, \nin effect, and plainly said he thought animals should be able to have \nlawyers appointed to defend their interests--and these are \ncontroversial matters--but he has other legal writings that are \ncontroversial also and do not just deal with the question of animal \nrights. I would like to highlight just a few of those positions.\n  In his 2008 book titled ``Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, \nWealth and Happiness,'' Professor Sunstein advocates an approach to the \nlaw based on economic and behavioral principles which he dubs \n``libertarian paternalism.''\n  Under Professor Sunstein's theory, the government can take steps to \n``nudge'' individuals toward making what he would say are better \ndecisions, and at least what the government considers to be more \ndesirable social behavior.\n  Professor Sunstein argues that the government can achieve these goals \nwhile not being actively, or at least obviously, coercive. His theory \noperates on the assumption that the average person is ``lazy, busy, \nimpulsive, inert, irrational, and highly susceptible to predictable \nbiases and errors.''\n  So the government needs to be a little paternalistic, he suggests, \nand take care of them and issue regulations and pass laws that keep \nthem from doing things that some bureaucrat or some Congressman thinks \nis not socially desirable.\n  As Professor Sunstein argues:\n\n       For too long, the United States has been trapped in a \n     debate between the laissez-faire types who believe markets \n     will solve all our problems and the command-and-control types \n     who believe that if there is a market failure then you need a \n     mandate. The laissez-faire types are right that . . . \n     government can blunder, so opt-outs are important. The \n     mandate types are right that people are fallible, and they \n     make mistakes, and sometimes people who are specialists know \n     better and can steer people in directions that will make \n     their lives better.\n\n  That is what he has said.\n  Presumably, in Professor Sunstein's view, the ``specialists'' who \n``know better'' than ordinary Americans are government bureaucrats. He \nseems to believe Americans are ``lazy'' and ``inert,'' and I think this \nis not a healthy view. So I question whether anyone who thinks \nAmericans are fundamentally lazy can perform his role as the gatekeeper \nof government regulation in the Obama administration.\n  Professor Sunstein's approach is consistent with much of what we have \nseen from this administration, I have to say, which seems to believe \nthat government control of health care, the financial markets, and the \nbusiness community generally is preferable to free market policies. \nAmericans are not comfortable with this.\n  I have been out having townhall meetings. I know they are not \ncomfortable with it. According to recent polling, 52 percent of voters \nworry that the government will do too much to ``help'' the economy.\n  That is from a Rasmussen poll of June 2, 2009. Fifty-nine percent of \nvoters believe the financial bailouts were a ``bad idea.'' The masters \nof the universe thought it was going to be great. We spent $800 \nbillion, the largest expenditure in the history of the American \nRepublic, and every penny of that is going to the national debt because \nwe were already in debt. We borrowed every penny of it. We have had \nvery low stimulative effect from that. The American people are right \nabout that.\n  Only 31 percent of voters believe this stimulus bill has helped the \neconomy. And we do not need a poll to tell us how uncomfortable the \nAmerican people are with the President's effort to overhaul health \ncare.\n  So the American people ought to understand if we confirm Professor \nSunstein, he will be the chief architect and gatekeeper over all of the \nregulations that this administration will be attempting to implement in \na myriad of areas--not just health care and financial markets but \nagriculture, the\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\nenvironment, energy, a host of areas that impact the people of our \ncountry. I think his views make him a person who should not be in this \nposition.\n  Let's take another issue that is important to a lot of people. \nProfessor Sunstein has taken an extremely aggressive position with \nrespect to abortion. Under his views, laws restricting access to \nabortion ``co-opt women's bodies for the protection of fetuses.''\n  According to Professor Sunstein, such laws ``selectively turn women's \nreproductive capacities into something for the use and control of \nothers.'' In his view, ``abortion should be seen not as murder of the \nfetus but instead as a refusal to continue to permit one's body to be \nused to provide assistance to it.'' Failure to accept this view, he \nwrote, is simply a product of one's accepting the preexisting baseline \nof women as child-bearers. The role of involuntary child-bearer, he \nargued, results ``only from government interference limiting the \ncapacity to choose not to bear a child involuntarily.''\n  Well, I think this is a disturbingly far-reaching and excessive view \non this important issue of abortion. It fails to recognize in any way \nthe moral aspect of this debate which has divided America since the \nSupreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. I think his view mocks those who \nhave a different view based on their deep beliefs and analysis of what \nthat life is that is within the mother.\n  What about the question of affirmative action? We talked a good bit \nabout that during the Judge Sotomayor hearings in the firefighters \ncase. Professor Sunstein has taken an extreme view, I think, in these \nissues, arguing that affirmative action programs ``should generally not \nbe thought to raise a serious constitutional issue.'' In his view, \n``the current distribution of benefits and burdens along racial lines \nis an outgrowth of a long history of discrimination.''\n  Professor Sunstein has returned to this theme repeatedly. In 1992, in \nan article, he again argued that existing law depends heavily on \n``existing distributions of wealth and power.'' Specifically, he argued \nthat the conservative objection to affirmative action programs--namely, \nthat discrimination is discrimination regardless of the pretext--simply \ntakes as a given existing distributions of wealth and power without \nconsidering the historical and legal context that led to those \ndistributions.\n  Professor Sunstein further argues that the constitutional text \nimposes no clear ban on affirmative action. Well, the Constitution says \neverybody should be given due process and equal protection of the laws. \nWhen you advantage one person because of their race, you disadvantage \nanother person because of their race. It is not a zero sum game.\n  He goes on to say that there is ``no clear moral argument [that] \nrequires courts to treat affirmative action policies with great \nskepticism.''\n  In 1997, after the Fifth Circuit struck down the University of Texas \nSchool of Law's affirmative action admissions policy as a violation of \nthe equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution, Professor \nSunstein dubbed the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hopwood as hubristic \nand compared it to Dred Scott v. Sanford, stating:\n\n       [A] court opinion outlawing affirmative action is closely \n     analogous to Dred Scott, and defective--abusive, \n     overreaching--for the same reason: It would be an amazing act \n     of hubris.\n\n  As we discussed in some detail during the recent nomination of Judge \nSotomayor, the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in this area requires any \ngovernment discrimination--and that is what happens when you have a \nquota--that any discrimination by the government be subject to strict \nscrutiny of the courts because on its face it seems to be unfair. We \nknow that as a result of long-term systemic discrimination, \nparticularly against African Americans, courts have found that to \nremedy that, it is perfectly all right to remedy this lack of equal \nprotection by fixing it and imposing certain remedies that favor groups \nthat have been discriminated against as a remedial act. But when you \npass the remedial stage and you are in a stage of objectivity, as we \nhave in most of America today, then if you favor one group over \nanother, the Supreme Court says that has to be looked at under strict \nscrutiny. You have to be careful you are not overreaching here. It \nseems Mr. Sunstein has no sympathy for that whatsoever. And that is the \nAdarand decision basically by the Supreme Court. He seems to hold the \nview that such discrimination is not only permissible but that the \nstrict scrutiny standard announced in Adarand and other Supreme Court \ncases is totally inappropriate. I question whether someone who holds \nthese views should be put in a position to make the kinds of decisions \nhe will be making as the regulations czar, some might say.\n  With regard to the nominations of Federal judges, he has taken some \npositions that I think have been unhealthy for the country.\n  Back in 2001, the New York Times had an article. It was a very \nsignificant little article. It wasn't a big article, but it was very \nimportant and significant. It reported that Professor Sunstein, along \nwith Professor Tribe and Marcia Greenburger--lawyers all--attended a \nprivate retreat where they lectured Democratic Senators on how to block \nRepublican judicial nominees by ``changing the ground rules.'' The \ntitle of the article by Neil A. Lewis was ``Democrats Readying for a \nJudicial Fight.'' And, indeed, they did. I think this Senate has been \nless healthy as a result of what they accomplished through the \nfilibuster of judges on a routine basis.\n  Again, according to the New York Times, it was reported that they \nargued at the meeting that:\n\n       It was important for the Senate to change the ground rules \n     and there was no obligation to confirm someone just because \n     they were scholarly or erudite.\n\n  A month later, Professors Sunstein and Tribe, along with Ms. \nGreenburger, were invited to testify before the Judiciary Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts in a hearing titled ``Should \nIdeology Matter? Judicial Nominations 2001.'' They argued at that \nhearing that political ideology of nominees is a legitimate issue for \nMembers to consider in their record. I think that has been an unhealthy \nthing, and we have had a number of debates and hearings on it since.\n  I believe my Democratic colleagues, to their credit, have backed away \nfrom that. In other words, it is all right to dig deeply into a \nnominee's judicial philosophy and whether they are committed to the law \nand how they envision their process of interpreting the Constitution. \nBut it is quite another to say that, if you have this political \nideology or these views, that you can no longer be chosen to be someone \nwho can decide cases fairly, because most judges have some personal \nviews and they have to decide cases every day, setting aside those \npersonal views.\n  At the hearing, I thought he made an odd statement. He said that the \ncurrent Supreme Court ``has no left at all.'' He believes that the \npeople who have been generally reported to be activists or liberals \nwere centrists and that presumably, I guess, the bad folks on the Court \nwere the judges who believe in enforcing the law as written regardless \nof their personal views. Indeed, he testified at that hearing that he \n``can't think of a single nominee by President Clinton to the lower \nFederal courts who genuinely counts as a liberal.''\n  Well, Mr. Sunstein has a lot of ability. He has taken some positions \non animal rights that are clearly shocking and that are troubling in \nlight of how important it is to have a person in this position who has \ngood judgment to render good decisions about the regulations that would \nimpact every American in this country.\n  I don't have anything personal against this nominee. He has many \nfriends. He is a prolific writer and commentator. But I think his views \nare outside the mainstream, and I will be voting against the \nnomination.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is now \nconsidering the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill for the coming year.\n  I will be making my opening remarks here, as I believe Senator Bond \nwill as well, and I know a number of Senators have been talking about \namendments to this bill. I wish to ask our colleagues if they do have \namendments to get them to the floor this afternoon and at least get \nthem filed to help us work with them and to begin to consider them. As \nwe know, we have had the last vote today, but we wish to have some of \nthese amendments offered over Friday and Monday so that we can move \nexpeditiously to this important appropriations bill and be moving \nquickly by Monday afternoon. I do know some Senators on both sides have \nsome amendments, which they have talked to us about. Again, although \nthis is the last vote, I would ask Senators who do have amendments to \nhelp us work through this process by getting your amendments to the \nfloor.\n  As we begin consideration of this important bill, it is important to \nnote\n\n[[Page S9253]]\n\nthat it has already been supported by broad bipartisan majorities. The \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee has 20 Members. That is one-fifth of the Senate. It is one \nof the largest subcommittees in the Senate. But despite the diversity \nof issues of our very large subcommittee, back on July 29 we voted \nunanimously to report the bill to the full Appropriations Committee, \nand the next day, the members of the committee voted unanimously to \nreport the bill to the Senate.\n  This bill does have broad bipartisan support because it addresses the \nvery real housing and transportation needs of American families across \nall regions of the Nation. It has bipartisan support because it touches \nthe lives of all of our constituents in ways that they can appreciate \neach day--whether it is a parent who commutes every day and needs safe \nroads or new public transportation options so they can spend more time \nwith their families, or a young family searching for safe and \naffordable communities to raise their children, or perhaps a recently \nlaid-off worker who needs help to afford their rent or stay off the \nstreet. This bill has real impact on American families that are \nstruggling in these troubling economic times--the hard-working \nAmericans who are not only losing their jobs but also their homes and \ntheir financial security.\n  Six months ago, this Congress passed a recovery package. It is now \ncreating jobs and rebuilding infrastructure and laying a strong \nfoundation for our long-term economic growth. It is a good start. The \nbill before us now builds on that and strengthens that effort. It makes \nneeded and very serious investments in our transportation \ninfrastructure as well as in housing and services to support our \nNation's most vulnerable. It also ensures that the Federal agencies \nthat so many communities count on have the resources they need to keep \nour commuters safe and keep communities moving and prospering.\n  Our bill takes a very balanced approach. It addresses the most \ncritical needs we face in both transportation and housing while \nremaining financially responsible and staying within the constraints of \nour budget resolution.\n  I have been very fortunate to be joined by my ranking member, Senator \nBond, in crafting this package. Senator Bond's very long service on the \nAppropriations Committee, as well as his work on the Public Works \nCommittee, has made him one of our leading experts in the areas of both \ntransportation and housing. Throughout his career, Senator Bond has \ndemonstrated tireless leadership and a commitment to the mission of \nHUD. I couldn't have a better or more experienced partner in this \neffort, and I want to take a moment of time from the Senate to thank \nSenator Bond for his years of partnership and for being here with me on \nthe floor this afternoon as we present our bill to the Senate.\n  This bill provides over $75 billion in budgetary resources for the \nDepartment of Transportation to support continued investment in \ntransportation infrastructure, including our bridges and our ports, our \npublic transportation, our airports, our rail, and the Nation's highway \nsystem. It provides $11 billion to support and expand public transit, \nwhich continues to see record growth in ridership, as well as $1.2 \nbillion to invest in intercity and high-speed rail so that we can \nexpand options for our commuters and ease congestion on our roads and \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  It also includes $1.1 billion to continue the highly competitive \nsurface grants program that was initiated earlier this year as part of \nour recovery package. That program, which provides matching funds to \nprojects making a significant impact on communities and regions, \ngenerated tremendous interest from our State and local authorities.\n  The bill also supports the FAA's efforts to develop its next \ngeneration air transportation system to support projected growth in air \ntravel in the coming year, and it invests $3.5 billion in capital \nimprovements at all of our airports across the country.\n  This bill also includes targeted increases to address critical \nproblems with our transportation safety. It has an increase above the \nPresident's budget to hire 236 more air safety inspectors and 50 more \nair traffic controllers.\n  At present, our FAA inspectors cannot spend enough time out in the \nfield directly observing air carrier operations firsthand. These new \npositions that are in this bill will help correct that problem and \nimprove FAA oversight.\n  The bill also includes $50 million for a new program in railroad \nsafety technology, including Positive Train Control, as well as $150 \nmillion for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to make \nsure tragedies like the one we saw earlier this summer never happen \nagain.\n  In addition to those important investments in transportation, the \nbill we now have before us represents a very firm commitment to \nproviding critical housing and support services to families who have \nbeen affected by this economic crisis. This bill provides nearly $46 \nbillion in budgetary resources for the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, including $100 million for HUD's housing counseling \nprogram to help our families in this country make responsible decisions \nwhen they purchase a home, to help them avoid the scams and aggressive \nlending tactics we have seen, and to help families facing foreclosure \nstay in their homes.\n  These funds are going to be an important tool in our efforts to \ncounter foreclosures. This counseling will help us avoid problems in \nthe future by preparing homeowners for the changing housing market.\n  The bill also provides more than $18 billion for tenant-based rental \nassistance or section 8, including an increase of over $1 billion for \nthe renewal of section 8 vouchers. The bill also provides an increased \nfunding for the operation of public housing for a total level of $4.75 \nbillion. These funds will help ensure our Nation's low-income families, \nwho are always among the hardest hit during tough economic times, \ncontinue to have access to safe and affordable housing.\n  Senator Bond and I are particularly proud that this bill includes $5 \nmillion for vouchers for the joint HUD-Veterans Affairs supportive \nhousing program. That will provide an additional 10,000 homeless \nveterans and their families with housing and supportive services.\n  While this program has helped contribute to an overall reduction in \nhomelessness among our veterans, we have seen disturbing increases over \nthe past several years in the number of homeless female veterans, many \nof whom have children. To me, that is unacceptable. So the new funding \nin this bill will provide help to make sure those who have already \ngiven so much to their country through their military service are now \nnot forced to live on the street.\n  In addition to supporting our Nation's heroes, this bill also \naddresses the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens by \nproviding increased funding to support housing for the elderly, \ndisabled, those suffering from AIDS, youth who are aging out of our \nfoster care, and the Nation's homeless.\n  The bill also focuses on strengthening communities at a time when the \neconomy threatens programs that are at the backbone of many of our \ntowns and cities. We provide almost $4 billion for the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. That will help support investments in \npublic infrastructure, housing rehabilitation, construction, and public \nservices. That is assistance that is very critical to our States and \nour local governments right now.\n  The bill also supports innovative approaches to revitalize the \nNation's public housing. The new Choice Neighborhoods Program included \nin this bill builds on the success of HOPE VI, for which my colleagues, \nSenator Bond and Senator Mikulski, deserve a great deal of credit.\n  In summary, this bill provides assistance to those who need it most, \nand it directs resources in a responsible and fiscally prudent way. It \nis a bill that truly addresses the needs of families in every region of \nthis country. These are families who are looking for us at the Federal \nlevel to step up and provide solutions to everything from congestion to \ntransportation safety to foreclosures to affordable housing. That is \nwhy it is a bill that has attracted widespread bipartisan support. It \nhelps commuters, homeowners, the most vulnerable in our society, and \nour economy, so I urge all Senators to support this bill, and I urge \nthem to help us move it rapidly to final passage.\n  Again, I ask our colleagues, if you have an amendment please get it \nto the\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\nfloor this afternoon, get it filed and help us bring it up so we can \nmove this bill along, get to conference with the House, and get this \nbill to the President so these investments can truly help our families.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor to my partner, Senator \nBond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as ranking member on the HUD, \nTransportation, and related agencies fiscal year appropriations bill, I \nhave been very pleased to be able to work with Chair Murray and her \ngreat staff. It has been a real pleasure. I agree with all she said, \nexcept I cannot do anything but thank her for the very kind and \ngenerous words she had. She mentioned a longtime experience. Normally \nback home we refer to experience as something you get when you are \nexpected to get something else. But working on this committee I have \nfound the experience to be a very pleasant one.\n  Originally I worked with Senator Mikulski. We alternated as chair and \nranking member. I think we did a wonderful job. She was a great \npartner.\n  I couldn't ask for any better partner to have than Senator Murray. \nShe has been very helpful and very gracious to us.\n  I have to say this is a very complicated bill. We could not do it \nwithout excellent staff work. I thank the staff. There are some new \npeople on with big challenges ahead, but it is an excellent staff, and \nI am extremely grateful for all that they have taught me over the \nyears.\n  This is a bill about which everybody can say we could do it better, \nbut I am proud to support it and urge my colleagues to support it. The \nlegislation has a number of extremely important programs which, in \ntoday's economy, are critical to helping families overwhelmed by the \nnational financial crisis. It is especially pleasing that we have been \nable to provide funding for the Nation's most vulnerable--to our \nhomeless, to low-income families and seniors, and to the disabled. Our \ncommittee has increased investment in HUD community development \nprograms to provide assistance needed the most.\n\n  The chair mentioned the VASH Program. This was an idea we had several \nyears ago. It has gained great support from the Veterans' \nAdministration, from HUD, and everybody who has looked at the appalling \nproblem of men and women who risk their lives, make great contributions \nto defend our country, and come home without adequate housing, often \nsupportive housing they need. This program has been able to bring \ntogether the support services along with the housing that enables these \nveterans not just to have a shelter over their heads but to be able to \nget their lives back on track after going through the rigors and \nhorrors of war. It is certainly a program with which I am delighted to \nbe associated, and I thank the chair for her work on it.\n  We have also provided assistance in critical areas such as section 8, \npublic housing, community development block grants, the HOME program \nfor the homeless, housing for seniors, housing for persons with \ndisabilities, the Lead Hazard Reduction Program--which Senator Mikulski \nhas been a champion of--and early childhood development capital \nfunding, among others.\n  As I noted in the committee markup of July 1, our biggest concern \nremains the solvency of the highway trust fund. This is a problem that \nmust be addressed. We hope to work with Chair Boxer of the EPW \nCommittee to deal with the serious problem they have because everybody \nknows--and I think almost everyone in this body has talked to me about \nit--how good roads and bridges are critical to attracting and \nsustaining business, job creation, and economic growth in our \ncommunities. We cannot afford an interruption in providing these much \nneeded funds to the States.\n  Transportation infrastructure work creates jobs, but most importantly \nit makes a long-term investment in our communities as a key component \nin our economic recovery. When I had the pleasure of serving \nMissourians as Governor, one of my top priorities was economic \ndevelopment. So I asked a good team I had there to figure out what \nmakes economic development work, and they got maps out in Missouri and \nstudied everything. The funniest thing we found, the communities that \nwere growing had the best roads available. People have to have \ntransportation if they are going to get to work and if what they \nproduce at work is going to be shipped out. This is a critical element \nfor economic recovery and the strength of our Nation.\n  Another area I think is absolutely important is the FAA safety \ninspectors. I don't think it was planned, but it was certainly \nfortuitous that I attended a local civic club lunch over August where \nthe main speaker was a representative of the FAA in St. Louis. He went \nthrough some of the good safety record but went through the horrendous \ncrash that I think shocked all of us. It happened in Buffalo this past \nwinter. He went through all of the problems.\n  I said: Don't you have safety inspectors?\n  He said: The problem is, we don't have enough of them.\n  Yes, these are things that should have been identified. Think of the \nloss of life in that tragic crash because we didn't have enough safety \ninspectors to blow the whistle on things and people who should not have \nbeen entrusted with the lives of American citizens.\n  As we looked at this, I, once again, became an even stronger believer \nin the need for these safety inspectors. We have to have air traffic \ncontrollers. These people are all critically important to the traveling \npublic, and nobody I know of in this body, except maybe a few friends \nfrom surrounding States, has not flown on a very regular basis. Even \nthey fly, and our families fly. So that is extremely important.\n  Talking about challenges, as I have mentioned on this floor many \ntimes before, I have been very much concerned about the rapid growth of \nthe FAA Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program. FHA's share of the \nmarket has grown dramatically, from 2 percent in 2006 to nearly 24 \npercent at the end of 2008. Before we pat ourselves on the back and say \nwhat a great achievement that is, let's take a look at it.\n  This year the freeze in the private mortgage markets has driven FHA's \nmarket share to 63 percent. As I have said many times before, \nlongstanding management and resource challenges and a substantial \ngrowth in risky lending due to political pressures has turned FHA into \na powder keg, and I fear it is going to explode and leave taxpayers on \nthe hook for another multihundreds of billions of dollars of losses.\n  Given the continuing challenges in the housing market and continuing \njob losses, I believe it is highly likely that the FHA will not meet \nits statutory 2 percent capital reserve when its latest actuarial study \nis released in the coming weeks. That is the safety net that keeps it \nfrom going in the hole and avoiding a bailout. Frankly, I believe this \nis the tip of the iceberg for the FHA. That is why we must address \nFHA's problems now because Americans have been signaling that the \ntaxpayer credit card is maxed out and we don't want to put any more on \nthe Federal debt and thus Americans' credit cards.\n  To address these FHA challenges, I am pleased we were able to include \nin this bill $20 million for FHA antifraud activities, as well as $6 \nmillion in additional funding for the HUD IG to combat predatory \nlending. The legislation also provides funding for HUD to modernize the \nFHA information technology systems in order to track effectively its \nmortgage and associated obligations.\n  Too many times I have gone to them and said: Well, what is your \nportfolio?\n  They say: Well, we do not know.\n  That is scary because we as taxpayers are on the hook for it. If they \ngo bad, that is on us and on future generations. We believe very \nstrongly HUD and the IG must work together and leverage these funds to \nfight mortgage fraud and predatory lending.\n  I have been very much encouraged based on my discussions with HUD \nSecretary Shawn Donovan and HUD IG Ken Donahue. They understood the \nproblem. They are willing to work with us.\n  However, they need more resources and a sustained focus to \neffectively combat predatory lending and mortgage fraud. It can and \nmust be done. We have heard too many stories of people who have been in \nthe business, a very questionable business, of making\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\npredatory loans, of misrepresenting the terms of the loans and the \nimpact on the potential home buyer.\n  These people's handiwork can be seen in the number of home loans \ngoing bad. They pushed the American dream very hard, not telling the \npotential homeowner what the downside was. For too many Americans this \nAmerican dream has turned into the American nightmare. We have to put a \nstop to it.\n  We make a strong contribution in this bill toward giving the able \nleaders in HUD, FHA, and in the IG the resources to deal with it.\n  Again, I thank my chair and her very good staff for all the hard \nwork. While it is not perfect, it is very good legislation. I look \nforward to joining with my partner, Senator Murray, in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond, who has been, as I \nsaid, a good partner working with me on this critical bill.\n  Again, we are on the floor this afternoon. We are ready and able to \ngo to work if our colleagues would come and file their amendments. I \nthink Senator Bond and I would be happy to move to third reading and \npass the bill if nobody comes.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the chair. If somebody has a good amendment, \nwe would sure like to see it and get started on it. Because the sooner \nyou get here, the better consideration and, I might hasten to add, \npossibly the more favorable consideration you will receive.\n  I know there are some potentially good ideas lurking out there. So \nbring the good ideas now. If you have some ideas that are not so good, \nyou can wait to the end and we will see if we can close it out.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I assure my colleagues the Senator gets grouchier the \nlonger he is out here.\n  Mr. BOND. There is a declining level of tolerance, I have noticed, \nsometimes when people are on the floor. So I join and urge the request \nto all our colleagues to come and offer such amendments as they choose \nto offer.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nthe fiscal year 2010 transportation and housing and urban development \nappropriations bill. This bill includes total resources of $122 \nbillion; a level of funding that is $1.2 billion below the \nadministration's request. The programs funded by this bill are critical \nto our ongoing efforts both to support the economic recovery and to \nprovide a safety net to the most vulnerable who have been impacted by \nthe economic downturn. Specifically, this bill provides critical \nfunding to our States and local communities for transportation \ninfrastructure investments and for ensuring the safety of our \ntransportation system. This bill also provides housing and services to \nour most vulnerable constituents and supports the efforts of our local \ncommunities as they continue to address the impacts of the foreclosure \ncrisis.\n  The two managers of this bill, Senators Murray and Bond, have worked \ndiligently to offer a strong bipartisan bill that tackles lingering \nmajor economic issues, and they have succeeded in doing so with limited \nresources. The committee supported their recommendations unanimously, \nand the bill was reported out of the Appropriations Committee on July \n30 by a recorded vote of 30 to 0.\n  Members of the Senate have had the entire month of August to review \nthe committee's recommendations. This bill is the fifth fiscal year \n2010 Appropriations Bill to be considered by the Senate, and while we \nare making steady progress, we have much work ahead of us. Therefore, \ngiven that Members have had the last month to review the bill, if a \nMember has an amendment, I encourage them to come to the floor today \nand offer it. We have seven remaining bills ready for immediate \nconsideration after this one. I therefore encourage my colleagues not \nto delay action on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9255-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, the Senate this week, and the whole \nworld--or at least the United States of America, and I wish the whole \nworld--were remembering back to what happened on 9/11/2001 in the \nUnited States. Yesterday, most appropriately in this Capitol, just \noutside of the Rotunda, the Senate and the House jointly dedicated an \noutstanding memorial to those passengers on United Flight 93, where 33 \npassengers risked and lost their lives but turned what was the worst \nday in American history--in terms of the defeat--into the first victory \nof the war on terror.\n  On that plane were many Americans who at the last minute had changed \ntheir flights. They weren't originally scheduled to take that plane but \nchanged it for various reasons. Maybe it was fate. Don't know what it \nwas. But one of the individuals on that flight was Georgine Corrigan. \nGeorgine Corrigan lived in Honolulu. Georgine Corrigan was really a \nworld renowned antiques dealer. Georgine Corrigan was the sister of \nRobert Marisay. Robert Marisay lives in Woodstock, GA. Yesterday, for \nthe first time in my life, I had the occasion to meet him as he \ntraveled to Washington to see the unveiling of that remarkable marker \nnow hanging in the Capitol.\n  In the few moments I had to share with him, he shared with me his \nlove for his sister but also his profound pride in what those people on \nthat plane had done that day. Many of us who are here today in the \nCapitol may not, in fact, have been here in this Capitol today had they \nnot been able to take that plane down and take it away from the \nterrorists who had hijacked it.\n  So as we remember the tragedy of \n9/11, as we recommit ourselves as Americans to never, ever having an \nincident like that happen again, it is important that we remember each \nand every individual who lost their life in the tragedies of 9/11, \nwhether it was in New York City, at the Pentagon, or in Shanksville, \nPA. It was a tragic day in our country, a day that opened with great \nhope, with blue skies on a warm autumn day with a crisp autumn\n\n[[Page S9256]]\n\nbreeze, and ended as the most tragic day in American history.\n  I am proud of the Senate and the House for the honor they bestowed \nupon Fight 93 yesterday, and I encourage all in this body to never, \never forget the tragedy of that day and to renew our commitment to see \nto it that it never happens again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9256-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MELANIE OUDIN\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, this is a happy tribute to a young lady \nby the name of Melanie Oudin. Melanie is 17 years old. She was born in \nmy hometown of Marietta, GA. She has a pair of tennis shoes that have \nthe word ``believe'' on them. She started competing in tennis years \nago. She was thought to be pretty good, so her parents--from the \nseventh grade on--home schooled her so she would have enough time every \nday to practice.\n  Were they ever correct. As I am sure the President knows, a few weeks \nago, at Wimbledon, this amazing young lady--17 years old, 5-foot-6--\ntook on the world of tennis and moved through the fourth round at \nWimbledon. Along the way, she beat none other than the former world No. \n1, Jelena Jankovic. She made all the newspapers and all the sports \nshows.\n  But was she a flash in the pan? No. What happened this last couple of \nweeks in New York City at the U.S. Open proved this girl is the real \ndeal because she advanced this time to the quarter finals, again \ndefeating top-seeded players and former No. 1 players such as Maria \nSharapova and Elena Dementieva, both outstanding players who lost to \nthis little 5-foot 6-inch powerhouse from Marietta, GA.\n  She did lose in the quarter finals, but she will eventually get to \nthe top because she believes, she is committed, she is dedicated, and \nshe has the support and love of a great family. She leaves soon to play \nin the Bell Challenge in Quebec City. She will probably move from 70th \nin the world to about 45th in the world.\n  Mr. President, I am confident with her dedication and commitment, she \nwill soon rise to No. 1. I pay tribute to the First Lady of my \nhometown, the tennis player of great renown, Ms. Melanie Oudin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9256-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9256-S9257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FINANCIAL MARKETS AND HOUSING\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last night the President of the United \nStates, in the preface to his address on health care, addressed our \neconomy and the current state of affairs. I think he made a very \naccurate assessment that we had hit the bottom and we were on the \nbottom. The question that lies before us is how we move from the bottom \nin this economic time back to a period of prosperity.\n  Although unemployment applications for benefits are down, they are \nstill extraordinarily high. In my State of Georgia, unemployment is \n10.3 percent. In the United States of America, the average home--47 \npercent of them--is worth less than is owed upon the house. That is a \nvery bad situation which over a protracted period of time will continue \nto suppress consumer confidence and keep us at a low point in our \neconomy.\n  There are many ideas about what should be done, but I want to talk \ntonight about two things. One is something that has already been done \nby this Senate and the House and signed by the President and one is \nsomething I hope between now and November 30, the Senate, the House, \nand the President can do.\n  First, in terms of what we have done. Senator Conrad of North Dakota \njoined with me in introducing a piece of legislation known as the \nFinancial Markets Crisis Commission. I enjoyed a lot of support for \nthat, including from the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. The \nappointees have been made. It is a bipartisan commission, has a budget \nof $5 million, has subpoena powers--everything the 9/11 Commission \nhad--and has an unbridled charge to investigate every aspect of the \nfinancial markets, whether it is the rating agencies, the investment \nbankers, the regular bankers and traditional bankers, the GSEs such as \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae, every component, and report back to us by \nthe end of next year, which is right after the midterm elections, on \nwhat it finds happened that caused the economic collapse that began \nlast September and continued to mushroom until late March of this year.\n  There are some who are talking of a rush to judgment in terms of \nfinancial regulation. But I hope we will take a pause, give this \ncommission time to act, and let's find out what a forensic audit tells \nus of what happened in America in our financial markets, and let's \nrespond to that after we have all the facts. I think a rush to \nregulatory judgment under what one might think, for the best of \nintentions, caused the problem could have the unintended consequence of \nhaving a more difficult impact on the economy than it should.\n  I think this body and the House acted wisely. I appreciate the \nPresident having signed it expeditiously, and I commend the majority \nleader, the minority leader, the Banking Committee chairman, the \nranking member, the Speaker of the House, the Republican leader in the \nHouse, and the majority leader in the House for making outstanding \nappointments.\n  The appointees to this commission could not be elected officials and \nthey could not work for the government. They have to be people \nknowledgable in the field of finance. They are 10 of the brightest \nminds in our country. I have my ideas. I am sure the Presiding Officer \nhas his ideas. I think every Member of the Senate has ideas about what \ndid go wrong last year and what we need to do to correct it.\n  But let's get all the facts on the table. Let's get a forensic audit \nso when we move we move with due knowledge and in due course. The \nbiggest mistake in Sarbanes-Oxley a number of years ago was a rush to \njudgment in reaction to Bernie Ebbers and Ken Lay. Sarbanes-Oxley, \nalthough needed and appropriate, reached further probably than it \nshould have in a number of cases. The same potential lies again in \nterms of financial reform if we move too quickly or precipitously or \nwithout all of the information. So in the interest of our economy, \nlet's wait for this report to come back before we rush to judgment.\n  Now, secondly, on the 30th of November, the first-time home buyer tax \ncredit that passed this body last July and was amended in February \nexpires. The first-time home buyer credit is a byproduct of an original \nbill I introduced along with a number of Members of the Senate to \nprovide a $15,000 credit to anybody buying and occupying a home in \nAmerica as their principal residence. It got parsed down and finally, \nin negotiations, became a first-time home buyer credit only, means \ntested for incomes of $150,000 or less. It has had a positive impact on \nthe market.\n  But America does not have a first-time home buyer problem. America \nhas a move-up-crisis problem. Right now, no one who is in a house in \nthe middle of the market, from $200,000 to $600,000, can sell their \nhouse. Transferees from Georgia to the State of Washington or from \nRhode Island to Florida are frozen. They cannot sell in Rhode Island to \nbuy in Florida. They cannot sell in Atlanta to buy in Washington State.\n  The housing market is literally at gridlock. The majority of sales \nbeing made in the last few months are short sales and foreclosures, \nwhich is depressing further the value of housing. The few direct arm's-\nlength sales that are taking place are, in fact, spurred on at the \nlower end of the market by the first-time home buyer credit.\n  So I ask the Senate to think for a second: What happens on December 1 \nof this year when that credit goes away to the housing market? Well, I \nwill tell you. I used to be in that market. The worst month of the year \nis December, to begin with. Housing purchases are seasonal, and in the \nwinter, December, January, and February are always the low months. If \nyou take away the single impetus that exists, what do you have? Nothing \nmore than short sales and foreclosures and a continuing decline in \nequities and values.\n  But if before that expiration date takes place the Senate could take \na legitimate look at what is in the best interest of moving our economy \noff the acknowledged bottom where we are today, it is fixing the one \nthing that led us into our difficulty, and that was the collapse of the \nhousing market.\n  I would submit if we took the $8,000 housing tax credit for first-\ntime home buyers, extended it to $10,000, made it\n\n[[Page S9257]]\n\neligible to anybody who bought and occupied a house as their principal \nresidence, whether it was their first purchase or their tenth purchase, \nwe would move more real estate and move more impetus to the housing \nmarket than it has seen in the past 24 months. As we do that, consumer \nconfidence comes back, equities and values come back, the borrowing \npower of the American public comes back, and our economy comes back. \nFailure to do so and we remain in a quagmire where we are today, which \nis no legitimate sales, declining values, a loss of equity, and a \ncontinuing high unemployment rate and a continued depressed \nmarketplace.\n  So as we come back from our August break, as we begin to look \nforward, as we look at the end of the year, as we look at those things \nthat are terminating, those things that need to be considered, let's \npause for a second and realize the good that the tax credit has done so \nfar, as limited as it was, and let's make it better. Let's extend it to \nJuly 1. Let's make it $10,000. Let's take the means test off. Let's \ngive an impetus to the move-up market. If we do, values will return, \nunemployment will go down, our economy will turn, and consumer price \nconfidence will go up. I would submit it is a part of the main solution \nwe need to take an economy that is on the bottom and move it back \ntoward equilibrium and prosperity for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9257-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING ITEMS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, on August 5, I was pleased to \nintroduce a Senate companion to H.R. 1018, the Restore Our American \nMustang Act that was introduced by my good friend, Representative Nick \nRahall, in February 2009. On July 20, the ROAM Act passed the House of \nRepresentatives and was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources. I hope that Senator Bingaman and Senator Murkowski, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, and Senator Wyden and Senator Barrasso, the chairman and \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, will \nconsider the merits of this bill and move it to the Senate floor.\n  S. 1579 and H.R. 1018 address a dilemma faced by the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Forest Service, which since 1971 have been charged \nwith overseeing the Nation's herds of wild, free-roaming horses and \nburros.\n  In 1971, wild horses and burros roamed across 53.5 million acres of \nlargely Federal lands in the western United States. Since that time, \nthe range available to these wild herds has decreased, dwindling to \nsome 34 million acres, much of it very arid, with sparse vegetation. \nYet the wild herds have not only managed to hold their own in these \nrugged conditions, they have grown. When the populations exceed the \ncarrying capacity of the land, the BLM conducts ``gathers'' or round-\nups, and removes horses and burros from wild. These wild equines are \nthen offered for adoption to the general public.\n  That sounds like a storybook solution to the management of the wild \nherds: save wild horses from starving on the range and place them in \ncaring homes with horse-loving American citizens. The problem is, in \n2009, BLM estimates that more than 10,000 wild horses and burros need \nto be removed from Federal rangelands. That is in addition to the \n31,000 wild horses and burros that have already been pulled from the \nrange and that are being held in short- and long-term holding \nfacilities by the BLM. There are as many wild horses and burros being \nheld off the range as live on the range, according to BLM statistics \ncited by the Government Accountability Office.\n  Even in the best economic times, there are not 10,000 people, let \nalone 30,000 people, willing to take on the challenge, rewarding as it \nmight be, of bringing a wild horse home to live with them. And these \nare not the best economic times. Horse rescues and sanctuaries are \noverwhelmed by horses donated by owners unable to care for them. The \nnews services report regularly on horses that are rescued from starving \nconditions or which have been abandoned by their owners.\n  Adopting a wild horse or burro is not to be undertaken lightly. BLM \nrequirements for housing a newly adopted wild horse call for sturdy \nwood or pole fencing at least 6 feet high. BLM staff or contractors \nwill load the adopted horse into an open stock-type trailer only, \nbecause these are not horses that can be led gently up a ramp into a \ndivided stall type trailer like a domestic show horse. Once they arrive \nhome, adopters must face the challenge of unloading a scared and wild \nanimal from the trailer and into its new enclosure.\n  It may be months before the proud new owner can even put a hand on \nhis new horse to begin its training for a life of pleasure riding. \nMustang adopters who lack the experience to train a wild horse \nthemselves or who lack the resources to pay for expert help may be \noverwhelmed, often to the detriment of the horse. For these reasons, \nolder mustangs, those adult horses that have spent 5 or more years \nliving in the wild, are among the least adoptable of BLM's charges. \nThese adult horses make up the bulk of the 22,000 mustangs in long-term \npasture holding facilities.\n  So what are we to do about these beautiful icons of the American \nWest?\n  The law provides the BLM with the authority to kill those excess \nhorses and burros that are not adopted after three attempts or which \nare older than 10 years old. The BLM also has the authority to sell \nthose animals ``without limitation,'' meaning without restrictions on \nthose horses being sent to slaughter plants in Mexico or Canada. The \nBLM has hesitated to use these authorities because of the public's \nrevulsion to the idea of their government killing otherwise healthy and \nbeautiful wild horses. The Government Accountability Office has pointed \nout that this puts BLM out of compliance with the law and raises the \nprogram's costs.\n  I share in the revulsion of the prospect of killing wild horses, as, \nI suspect, many in the BLM do as well. But the consequence of that \nrevulsion is the climbing costs to house and feed what is now a \npopulation of 22,000 wild horses in long-term holding facilities. The \nlong-term holding facilities are already over capacity and the costs \nare consuming most of BLM's funding for the wild horse and burro \nmanagement program, and they are only going to rise. The solution to \npreventing wild horses and burros from overcrowding the open range is \nnot to overcrowd them in fenced-in pastures.\n  S. 1579 and H.R. 1018 would revise the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and \nBurro Act to provide BLM and the Forest Service with additional tools \nto manage the wild horse and burro populations in ways that preserve a \nthriving ecological balance. They also prohibit the killing or sale for \nslaughter of wild horses and burros.\n  The bills give the BLM the authority to restore wild horse and burro \nranges by purchasing or acquiring equivalent land, with a goal of \nreturning rangelands to something approaching the 53 million acres \navailable to the wild herds in 1971. Current law does not allow BLM to \nacquire land for horses and burros that might not be in the same \nlocation occupied by wild horses prior to 1971.\n  Increasing the size of the range available to the herds means that \nfewer animals will need to removed in order to maintain the land in \ngood health. Free-roaming wild horses and burros do not have to be fed \nand maintained in long-term holding facilities. This also would reduce \nthe number of wild horses and burros available for adoption, bringing\n\n[[Page S9258]]\n\nthe supply of wild horses in line with the more limited number of homes \navailable to them.\n  S. 1579 and H.R. 1018 also provide BLM managers with enhanced \nmanagement tools and greater emphasis on emerging medical controls like \nlong-term contraception to help keep herd sizes proportionate to the \navailable grazing. It also puts greater emphasis on the adoption \nprogram by encouraging greater involvement from private, not-for-profit \norganizations that specialize in equine adoption and therapy programs.\n  Most Americans value our Nation's great Western heritage. Our idea of \nthe wild, wild West is synonymous with wild horses thundering through \ngreat open spaces. Our images of dusty, scruffy prospectors are not \ncomplete without the requisite patient burro at his side. A hundred \nyears ago, 2 million wild horses lived on the range--now, there are \nfewer than 35,000. We want to preserve our wild herds and to keep them \nforever wild. We can achieve that goal, but we need to provide BLM and \nthe Forest Service with a more robust toolkit for long-term sustainable \nherd management.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1579 and move to ensure the long-\nterm future of America's wild horses and burros.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9258-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Lieutenant Colonel Mark Stratton\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nwonderful Alabamian and American, LTC Mark Stratton, 39, of Foley, AL, \nwho was killed in Afghanistan on Memorial Day this year and laid to \nrest among the heroes at Arlington National Cemetery in June. \nLieutenant Colonel Stratton was serving as commander of a Provincial \nReconstruction Team, PRT, and was killed when an improvised explosive \ndevice, IED, detonated as his convoy was passing.\n  Having had the privilege of attending Lieutenant Colonel Stratton's \nfuneral and hearing the stories told by his family members and those \nwho had worked with him, it is clear that Lieutenant Colonel Stratton \nwas a man of honor who took great pride in his service to our Nation.\n  In my conversations with his mother, Mrs. Jan York, she described her \nson as ``good, determined, focused and he loved God, he loved America \nand loved the Air Force. He accomplished so much.'' She also described \nhow proud he was, as a leader of his PRT, to have completed an \nimportant road project. He was proud because he knew it was a project \nof permanence that would benefit the lives of the people of the area. \nThis is so typical of the patriotic selfless attitude of our \nmagnificent military personnel.\n  His colleague and friend, Lieutenant Colonel Risner said of him, ``He \nput the airmen that he was supervising or leading first, every step of \nthe way.'' This is the sign of a true leader who was dedicated both to \nthe mission and to the development of his subordinates.\n  In admiration of his committed service and ultimate sacrifice, his \ncolleagues on the Joint Staff in the Pentagon will pay tribute to him \nlater this month by naming a conference room in his honor. I believe \nthat it is a fitting homage to an individual who represented the best \nof what an airman and officer should be. It is good that our military \nleaders in the Pentagon will remember the sacrifice this great American \nmade for his country and strive to honor his commitment in the way our \nmilitary operations are carried out.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Jennifer; their three young \nchildren Delaney, Jake, and A.J.; his mother Jan York and her husband \nBuddy; his brothers, Michael Stratton and Frankie Little; as well as \nhis many friends and fellow warriors as they continue to grieve the \nloss of this great man. This is an incalculable loss for them, but I \nknow that they will be able to take wonderful lessons from the way he \nlead his life both publicly and privately. They will also be able to \ntake comfort from the great heritage he leaves to his family and to his \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9258-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MEL MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak about my friend and \ncolleague, Mel Martinez, who is leaving the Senate this week.\n  Senator Martinez has a story unlike that of any of us who serve in \nthis body. He came to this country from Cuba without his parents at age \n15 as part of a humanitarian effort. And as the first Cuban-American \nSenator, he has always maintained a thoughtful and unique perspective \non Cuba policy, one that I have always enjoyed hearing and considering.\n  As chairman of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, I \nwas pleased to have Senator Martinez as part of that panel. It is not \noften you get a Secretary of Housing and Urban Development sharing his \nexpertise in a Senate committee.\n  He worked tirelessly to address the crisis of homelessness, and I \nhave been proud to work alongside him on some of the housing measures \nwe have passed over the past couple of years. He has been enormously \nhelpful and cooperative as a member of my committee, and we will miss \nhis perspective.\n  Senator Martinez and I didn't agree on every issue, or even most \nissues. What we shared was a deep love for this amazing country, a deep \nrespect for this institution, and a strong working relationship. \nWherever Senator Martinez's remarkable life takes him next, I know that \nthe citizens of his beloved Florida are grateful for his service and \nwill join me in wishing him and his family nothing but the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9258-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9258-S9259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EMPOWERING THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if information is power, then an informed \npublic is certainly an ingredient that helps make government work \nbetter and more responsively for the people.\n  I have always had a keen interest in technology and the Internet, so \nit has been encouraging to see the commitment and skill that the Obama \nadministration has invested in applying information technology to the \nfunctions of government. One of the clearest examples of this has been \nin the innovative release of data about funds appropriated under the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act--the so-called economic stimulus \npackage. It is all the more encouraging to see the way these efforts \nhave spawned complementary initiatives by private foundations and \nentrepreneurs.\n  As a Vermonter I am especially proud that a project called \nThisWeKnow.org became a top-three finalist in the Apps for America 2: \nThe Data.gov Challenge, sponsored by The Sunlight Foundation, which \nasked contestants to produce Web applications to showcase the benefits \nof sharing Federal Government data with the public. ThisWeKnow.org, \nalong with the other two finalists, showcased their Web sites this week \nin the Nation's Capital, at the Gov 2.0 Expo Showcase.\n  ThisWeKnow.org was selected as one of the three finalists out of 47 \napplications submitted. ThisWeKnow.org was built by GreenRiver.org and \nIntellidimension of Brattleboro, VT, to empower citizens to enter in \ntheir locations and to explore data related to their communities from \nacross Federal agencies. Their site offers citizens one-stop shopping \nfor information available to them about their own towns, States and \ncommunities.\n  The public's right to know is a cornerstone of our democracy. By \nusing technology, a site such as this can provide citizens with access \nto data that is relevant to them and that can enable and encourage them \nto make informed decisions. This site is designed to make what was once \na difficult and time-consuming process into a faster and more \nstreamlined experience.\n  ThisWeKnow.org was designed and developed by Michael Knapp, managing \ndirector of GreenRiver.org, and Derrish Repchick, vice president of \nProduct Development at Intellidimension, who are in Washington to \nattend the Gov 2.0 events this week. Although they did not win the \ngrand prize, we congratulate them for all of their hard work and their \npublic spirit, and encourage them to continue their efforts to promote \na more accessible and open government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a September 8 article from The \nBrattleboro Reformer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n[[Page S9259]]\n\n             [From the Brattleboro Reformer, Sept. 8, 2009]\n\n                        Your Government, Online!\n\n                        (By Howard Weiss-Tisman)\n\n       Brattleboro.--Michael Knapp thinks the government can do a \n     better job of getting data into the hands of average \n     Americans.\n       Knapp, who is Managing Director of GreenRiver.org, a \n     Brattleboro software development company, believes that \n     social change will come after more citizens learn more about \n     their government and he's got a plan to make that happen.\n       GreenRiver.org, along with Intellidimension, another \n     Brattleboro high tech company, is one of three finalists in a \n     national competition to help the U.S. government revamp how \n     it gets information into the hands of the public.\n       The two Southern Vermont companies joined together to \n     design a Web site that would make it easier for citizens to \n     access the thousands of pages of data that the various \n     government agencies produce every year.\n       And the two small Main Street firms, which went up against \n     46 other mostly larger and more heavily financed companies \n     from all over the United States, now have a chance to meet \n     with some powerful Washington insiders to change how \n     government information is delivered to the public.\n       ``Too much data produces nothing but noise. But if we can \n     get information into people's hands that is presented well \n     and clearly and accurately people will make more informed \n     decisions,'' Knapp said from his office overlooking the \n     Connecticut River. ``We're trying to help people make \n     connections, so they can start to take control of their \n     communities.''\n       Knapp and his cohorts entered the Apps for America contest, \n     which is sponsored by The Sunlight Foundation, a non-partisan \n     Washington group dedicated to increasing government \n     transparency.\n       The Brattleboro companies developed their Web site, \n     ThisWeKnow.org, that allows the user to enter a location in \n     the search engine.\n       Reports from across the government that have recorded \n     information on that location are gathered and the user can \n     compare, for instance, a town's cancer rate with the toxic \n     chemicals released by nearby factories and political \n     contributions to area lawmakers.\n       Knapp said all of the various government agencies issue the \n     reports and put out press releases occasionally on the data, \n     but the Web site ``takes the middleman out of the information \n     presentation. Instead of the agencies controlling the \n     story,'' Knapp said, ``you get to tell the story.''\n       Intellidimension Vice President of Product Development, \n     Derrish Repchick, said the two companies put in weeks worth \n     of work developing the site. They are flying to Washington \n     next week to present their site, and Vivek Kundra, the Obama \n     Administration's Federal Chief Information Officer, is \n     expected to check out the work of the three finalists.\n       ``It was a huge amount of data we had to work with. It was \n     a challenge,'' said Repchick, who was responsible for the \n     back end of the Web site where all of the data is accessed. \n     ``It was also fun and it gets some pretty important eyeballs \n     on you.''\n       Knapp is a big fan of what the Obama Administration has \n     done to make government more transparent but he said there \n     are still countless amounts of information out there that \n     should be more readily available.\n       The winner of the contest will not necessarily win a \n     government contract but Knapp said the contest and his site \n     is one more way to get every citizen in the country to \n     realize that it is their government and the fastest way to \n     implement change is by getting them the information they need \n     to demand it.\n       ``We didn't do this for the money,'' Knapp said about the \n     $10,000 prize that will go to the winner. ``We want to break \n     down all the separate silos of information and have people \n     make connections. We did this because we believe technology \n     can make a better future for everybody.''\n       Voting for the best application is being done online at \n     www.sunlightlabs.com.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9259-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE PEASE GREETERS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Pease \nGreeters for their consistent and unwavering support for our brave men \nand women in uniform passing through New Hampshire on their way to \ncombat assignments in Iraq and Afghanistan or returning home to their \nloved ones. The Pease Greeters provide a loud and welcoming voice not \nonly to servicemembers from New Hampshire but to all of the soldiers, \nsailors, Marines and airmen who pass through the Pease Air Terminal in \nPortsmouth, NH.\n  During the Spring of 2005, when members of the Seacoast Detachment of \nthe Marine Corps League met a flight returning from the Middle East, no \none could have known that this small volunteer group of veterans and \ncitizens would be the nucleus of a group that has met every one of the \nmore than 130 flights landing in New Hampshire, however briefly, with \nsoldiers heading to or returning from combat operations overseas. The \nGreeters, now numbering over 200 members, have helped to ensure that \neach of the thousands of servicemembers has received the welcome home \nand best wishes that they so richly deserve.\n  The Pease Greeters travel from all over New Hampshire to meet every \nmilitary flight in to Pease, at any hour, day or night. Arriving troops \nare met with applause, handshakes, and a boisterous welcome, and if the \nflight is taking them into a combat area, the Pease Greeters assure \nthem that they will be met right there upon their safe return. These \nhonored guests are provided with refreshments and the opportunity to \nmake free phone calls to their loved ones. Each of these events has \nbeen recorded and the photographs line the Pease Air Terminal Hall that \nis known as the ``Heroes Walk.''\n  It is my privilege to recognize the time and energy these men and \nwomen of the Pease Greeters have devoted and continue to devote to \nassuring our Armed Forces that their country and its citizens \nappreciate the sacrifices they and their families are making on our \nbehalf. Thank you to each and every member of the Pease Greeters for \nproviding such a warm welcome home to those returning and a warm memory \nof home to those departing to carry out their missions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9259-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CONGRATULATING CAROLINE FORD\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn of \nthe death of Ken Bacon on August 15. While Ken had distinguished \ncareers in both journalism and public service, it is his tenure as the \nhead of Refugees International that I would like to highlight. In that \ncapacity, Ken became one of the world's leading advocates for refugees \nand displaced persons. By adapting and challenging his own \norganization, he changed the global discussion on refugees and their \nrights, most recently with his focus on those displaced by climate \nchange.\n  Whether focused on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, \nor Iraq, Ken called upon the international community to take seriously \nthe plight of those caught in the midst of conflict--innocent people \nlosing their homes, separated from their families, and sometimes forced \nto forfeit their dignity to save their lives. As recently as June, Ken \ntestified before a committee of the House of Representatives regarding \nthe millions of Pakistanis displaced by fighting in the North West \nFrontier Province. He spoke powerfully:\n\n       This is not merely a question of funding, though the \n     humanitarian assistance and reconstruction efforts will need \n     robust financial commitments. The United States also\n\n[[Page S9260]]\n\n     needs to be seen as rising above military objectives and \n     showing genuine concern for the fate of civilians.\n\n  Under his watch, the alarm was sounded early and repeatedly on the \nsituation in Darfur, and he challenged the global community to act to \nprovide protection, aid and even resettlement in some cases for Iraqis \ndisplaced by war. Drawing on his experience in a refugee camp in the \nBalkans in 1999, Ken humanized masses of people, stressing that while \ndisplaced families need immediate relief, ``in time [they] will require \nrenewed confidence and support to return home in safety and dignity.''\n  Ken will be missed by all those who had the opportunity to know him \nas well as by the millions who have been, and will continue to be, \nimpacted by his work. We pay tribute to him by continuing his work to \nensure that the basic rights of displaced peoples are protected, that \ntheir basic needs are met, and that they have the support to ultimately \nreturn home in safety and dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9260-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THIRTEEN YARDS TO VICTORY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, throughout American history, music \nhas always been a harbinger of social change. I experienced it first \nhand during the 1960s and early 1970s when a generation of Americans \nbegan marching--marching for civil rights, social justice, and an end \nto the Vietnam war. For many Americans, that period of our country's \nhistory comes with its own soundtrack.\n  That is why it is so encouraging to me to see what is happening with \nthe Thirteen Yards To Victory, a band from my home State of \nMassachusetts. This remarkable group of young people is dedicated to \nhelping others. They are donating all the profits from their upcoming \nrelease of American Dreamers to benefit arts and music education \nprograms across the country. They are setting a wonderful example for \ntheir peers--showing them that everybody has the capacity to make a \npositive difference in their very own way. Because of what they are \ndoing, more of our youth will be able to enjoy and learn about the arts \nand develop their own skills.\n  This, really, is nothing new for the members of Thirteen Yards To \nVictory--Anthony DiPerri, Vinny Prezioso, Thomas Iannello, Ryan \nPassariello, and Dave Rossi. This is only the latest occasion in which \nthey have been recognized for their dedication to others and their \nunique approaches which makes their projects so successful.\n  They are not alone in such efforts, however. Volunteers in our \ncommunity play an invaluable role in helping those in need and \nstrengthening the foundation of our society. In fact, nearly 62 million \nAmericans volunteered at some point last year. I am particularly \nencouraged by the increase in the number of young people who are \nconnecting with their communities and volunteering their time. Thirteen \nYards To Victory is just one example of what is happening all across \nthe country.\n  I wish Anthony, Vinny, Thomas, Ryan, and Dave all the best with \nAmerican Dreamers. I hope it makes American Dreamers out of us all. And \nI hope their music will be a part of the soundtrack of the social \nchange taking place in America today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9260-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9260-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9260-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \nRESPECT TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES OF SEPTEMBER 11, \n                              2001--PM 30\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to establish the Council on Healthy Housing, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I introduce with my colleague Senator \nJohanns, the Healthy Housing Council Act. I thank Senators Boxer, \nMerkley, and Franken for joining us as original cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  This legislation would establish an independent interagency Council \non Healthy Housing in the executive branch in order to improve the \ncoordination of existing but fragmented programs, thereby enhancing the \nabilities of families to access Government programs and services in a \nmore efficient and effective manner.\n\n[[Page S9266]]\n\n  Many factors impact our health; however, our environment can be one \nof the most critical determinants to our overall health and well-being. \nThat is why the issue of healthy housing is so important.\n  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there \nare more than 5.7 million households living in conditions with moderate \nor severe hazards such as incomplete cooking facilities, inadequate \nplumbing, the presence of mice and rats, and crumbling roofs and \nfoundations. This count of moderate or severe physical problems does \nnot even include significant lead-based paint hazards, which persist in \n23 million, or approximately four times as many, households. Sadly, \nhousing-related health hazards take a heavy toll on Americans, \nresulting in 11,000 unintentional injury deaths, 3,000 deaths in house \nfires, and 21,000 radon-associated lung cancer deaths each year.\n  Low-income and minority individuals and families are \ndisproportionately affected by housing-related health hazards. We know \nthat residents of poorly designed, constructed, or maintained housing \nare at greater risk for serious illnesses and injuries, including \ncancer, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns, falls, rodent bites, \nchildhood lead poisoning, and asthma. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican-\nAmericans are three times as likely to have elevated blood-lead levels, \ncompared to non-Hispanic whites. About 1.2 million housing units with \nsignificant lead-based paint hazards house low-income families with \nchildren under 6 years of age.\n  If the disease and injury toll on our Nation's individuals and \nfamilies, particularly our children, is not enough to demonstrate the \nneed for coordinated Federal Government action on housing-related \nhealth hazards, consider some of the annual costs.\n  According to research at the Mount Sinai Children's Environmental \nHealth Center, annual costs for environmentally attributable childhood \ndiseases in the U.S. total an estimated $54.9 billion. That number is \napproximately 3 percent of total health care costs. Indeed, as our \nhousing deteriorates, our health care system bears the brunt of the \nassociated injuries and illnesses.\n  The good news is that low-cost preventative measures can have \ndramatic effects. For example, properly installing and maintaining a \nsmoke alarm can cut the risk of deaths due to fire in half. The Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention estimates that providing healthy \nhousing to American families will help prevent 20 million asthma cases, \n240,000 incidents of elevated blood-lead levels in young children, \n14,000 burn injuries, and 21,000 radon-associated lung cancer deaths.\n  While there are many programs in place to address housing-related \nhealth hazards, these programs are fragmented and spread across many \nagencies, making it difficult for at-risk families to access assistance \nor to receive the comprehensive information they need.\n  To address this situation, our bill authorizes $750,000 for each of \nfiscal years 2010 to 2014 for an independent Council on Healthy \nHousing, which would bring Federal, State, and local government \nrepresentatives, as well as industry and nonprofit representatives, to \nthe table at least once a year.\n  The council would review, monitor, and evaluate existing housing, \nhealth, energy, and environmental programs. The council would then make \nrecommendations to reduce duplication, ensure collaboration, identify \nbest practices, and develop a comprehensive healthy housing research \nagenda.\n  In order to ensure that members of the public are informed of and \nbenefit from the council's activities, the council would hold biannual \nstakeholder meetings, maintain an updated website, and work to unify \nhealthy housing data collection and maintenance.\n  While there is a growing consensus on ways to help communities make \nhousing healthier, the lack of coordination has made it difficult for \nthe public to access this information and related research and data. By \ncreating this council, we can provide a useful forum for health and \nhousing experts, whether in the Government, private, or nonprofit \nsector, to share their experiences, successes, and lessons for the \nfuture.\n  The Healthy Housing Council Act will help us embark on a path to \nassure that affordable and decent homes are also healthy. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me and Senator Johanns, Boxer, Merkley, and \nFranken in supporting this bipartisan bill and other healthy housing \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1658\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Housing Council Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the United States--\n       (A) 5,700,000 households live in homes with moderate or \n     severe physical hazards;\n       (B) 23,000,000 homes have significant lead-based paint \n     hazards;\n       (C) 8,700,000 homes have had leaks in the last 12 months;\n       (D) 6,000,000 homes have had signs of mice in the last 3 \n     months; and\n       (E) 1 in 15 homes have dangerous levels of radon.\n       (2) Residents of housing that is poorly designed, \n     constructed, or maintained are at risk for cancer, carbon \n     monoxide poisoning, burns, falls, rodent bites, childhood \n     lead poisoning, asthma, and other illnesses and injuries. \n     Vulnerable subpopulations, such as children and the elderly, \n     are at elevated risk for housing-related illnesses and \n     injuries.\n       (3) Because substandard housing typically poses the \n     greatest risks, the disparities in the distribution of \n     housing-related health hazards are striking. 1,200,000 \n     housing units with significant lead-based paint hazards house \n     low-income families with children under 6 years of age.\n       (4) Housing-related illnesses, including asthma and lead \n     poisoning, disproportionately affect children from lower-\n     income families and from specific racial and ethnic groups. \n     In 2005, 13 percent of black children were reported to have \n     asthma, as compared with 9 percent of both Hispanic and white \n     children. Black children are twice as likely to die from \n     residential injuries as white children, and 3 percent of \n     black children and 2 percent of Mexican American children \n     have elevated blood lead levels, as compared to only 1.3 \n     percent of white children.\n       (5) The annual costs for environmentally attributable \n     childhood diseases in the United States, including lead \n     poisoning, asthma, and cancer, total $54,900,000,000. This \n     amount is approximately 3 percent of total health care costs.\n       (6) Appropriate housing design, construction, and \n     maintenance, timely correction of deficiencies, planning \n     efforts, and low-cost preventative measures can reduce the \n     incidence of serious injury or death, improve the ability of \n     residents to survive in the event of a major catastrophe, and \n     contribute to overall well-being and mental health. Housing \n     units that are kept lead-safe are approximately 25 percent \n     less likely to have another child with elevated blood lead \n     levels. Properly installed and maintained smoke alarms reduce \n     the risk of fire deaths by 50 percent.\n       (7) Providing healthy housing to families and individuals \n     in the United States will help prevent an estimated 240,000 \n     elevated blood lead levels in young children, 11,000 \n     unintentional injury deaths, 12,000,000 nonfatal injuries, \n     3,000 deaths in house fires, 14,000 burn injuries, and 21,000 \n     radon-associated lung cancer deaths that occur in United \n     States housing each year, as well as 20,000,000 asthma cases \n     and 14,000,000 missed school days.\n       (8) While there are many programs in place to address \n     housing-related health hazards, these programs are fragmented \n     and spread across many agencies, making it difficult for at-\n     risk families and individuals to access assistance or to \n     receive comprehensive information.\n       (9) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, \n     as is better coordination at State and local levels, to \n     ensure that families and individuals can access government \n     programs and services in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to enhance penalties for violations of securities \nprotections that involve targeting seniors; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senators Kohl, \nGillibrand and Shaheen to introduce the Senior Investor Protections \nEnhancement Act of 2009.\n  This important legislation would increase the fines imposed on those \nwho commit securities violations against seniors and thereby provide \nadditional security to a group who relies on their savings for \nsurvival.\n  Seniors increasingly rely on private investments for their \nretirement. Over the last 30 years, traditional employer sponsored \npension plans, known as defined benefit plans, have been on the \ndecline. In 1975, 88 percent of private-sector workers were covered by \ndefined benefit plans; by 2005, that number had shrunk to 33 percent of \nthe private-sector workforce.\n  Today, seniors control nearly $15 billion in assets. These \nindividuals face complicated decisions about how to best stretch their \nhard earned savings throughout their retirement.\n  Unfortunately, these assets are at risk from traditional fraud and \nPonzi schemes. Seniors are often offered complicated investment tools \nsuch as reverse mortgages and various annuity products. While these \nproducts can be very valuable to Americans generally and seniors \nspecifically, they can also be abused by unscrupulous actors.\n  In fact, research shows that senior citizens face serious risks from \nfraudulent salesmen. A MetLife study found that seniors incur an \nestimated $2.6 billion in losses due to financial abuse each year. In \ntotal, seniors account for more than half of all investor complaints \nreceived by state securities regulators.\n  During the last Congress, under the leadership of Senator Kohl, the \nAging Committee held a hearing to examine some of the questionable \npractices that so-called senior financial investment specialists use to \ngain access to the retirement savings of older Americans. A report by \nthe Committee revealed that many seniors have lost their life savings \nbecause they followed investment advice ill-suited to their retirement \nneeds and life expectancy.\n  The Senior Investor Protections Enhancement Act will address these \nissues by increasing the penalties for existing securities violations \nby an additional $50,000 for financial crimes committed by those 62 and \nhigher, the age at which many orient their investments to be in \nconjunction with social security eligibility. Violations could include \nselling them products that are unsuitable for their age, failing to \ndisclose fees, charging large penalty fees, or switching the investment \nproduct actually sold from the one that was marketed.\n  We need to enhance the protections afforded to seniors. Please join \nus in support of the Senior Investor Protections Enhancement Act of \n2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9268-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9268-S9269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 258--COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                   UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-LA CROSSE\n\n  Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 258\n\n       Whereas La Crosse is located on the western border of \n     middle-Wisconsin, on the east side of the Mississippi River;\n       Whereas the first Europeans to see the site of La Crosse \n     were French fur traders who traveled the Mississippi River in \n     the late 17th century;\n       Whereas La Crosse was incorporated as a city in 1856;\n       Whereas Thomas Morris sponsored a bill in the Wisconsin \n     State Senate that led to the creation of the current-day \n     University of Wisconsin-La Crosse;\n       Whereas the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse was founded \n     in 1909 as the La Crosse State Normal School for the purpose \n     of teacher preparation;\n       Whereas the philosophy of Fassett A.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the University of \nWisconsin-La Crosse on the 100th anniversary of its founding. As the \nuniversity celebrates 100 years of service to the people of Wisconsin, \nI am reminded of the excellent tradition of higher education championed \nnot only by the state of Wisconsin, but by our entire Nation. Education \nis the driving force behind the prosperity of this nation, and \ninstitutions such as the University of Wisconsin--La Crosse have helped \nprepare our most influential leaders and scholars throughout our \nNation's history. I applaud UW--La Crosse for its contributions to the \nstate of Wisconsin and the U.S. over the past 100 years of its rich \nhistory.\n  One hundred years ago, Wisconsin State Senator Thomas Morris \nsponsored a bill that would eventually create the University of \nWisconsin--La Crosse, which was founded in 1909 as the La Crosse State \nNormal School. The honorable Fassett A. Cotton, the university's first \npresident, insisted that the education provided at his school would \nshape the whole person. The university's motto, emblazoned on its \nofficial seal, reads ``mens corpusque'', Latin for ``mind and body''. \nAt the university's 50th anniversary in 1959, presidential candidate \nJohn F. Kennedy spoke to the students in the Graff Main Hall \nauditorium. Today, the university is recognized as a premier Midwestern \npublic university by U.S. News & World Report. The University of \nWisconsin--La Crosse offers 88 undergraduate programs in 44 \ndisciplines, along with 26 graduate programs. Its athletics programs \ncomplement its superb academic reputation, having won 59 National \nCollegiate Athletic Association Division III titles in nine different \nsports.\n  Therefore, in this centennial anniversary year for the reputable \nUniversity of Wisconsin--La Crosse, I would recommend that educational \ninstitutions across the Nation look to La Crosse as an example of great \nacademic achievement. I would also like to express my gratitude to this \nuniversity for providing 100 years of outstanding service to the people \nof Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9269-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 259--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 13, 2009, AS ``NATIONAL \n                     CELIAC DISEASE AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 245\n\n       Whereas, on September 11, 2001, terrorists ruthlessly \n     attacked the United States, leading to the tragic deaths and \n     injuries of thousands of innocent United States citizens and \n     other citizens from more than 90 different countries and \n     territories;\n       Whereas in response to the attacks in New York City, \n     Washington, DC, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, firefighters, \n     police officers, emergency medical technicians, physicians, \n     nurses, military personnel, and other first responders \n     immediately and without concern for their own well-being rose \n     to service, in a heroic attempt to protect the lives of those \n     still at risk, consequently saving thousands of men and \n     women;\n       Whereas in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, \n     thousands of recovery workers, including trades personnel, \n     iron workers, equipment operators, and many others, joined \n     with firemen, police officers, and military personnel to help \n     to search for and recover victims lost in the terrorist \n     attacks;\n       Whereas in the days, weeks, and months following the \n     attacks, thousands of people in the United States and others \n     spontaneously volunteered to help support the rescue and \n     recovery efforts, braving both physical and emotional \n     hardship;\n       Whereas many first responders, rescue and recovery workers, \n     and volunteers, as well as survivors of the 9/11 terrorist \n     attacks, continue to suffer from serious medical illnesses \n     and emotional distress related to the physical and mental \n     trauma of the 9/11 tragedy;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of brave men and women \n     continue to serve every day, having answered the call to duty \n     as members of the United States Armed Forces, with thousands \n     having given their lives or suffered injury to defend our \n     Nation's security and prevent future terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the entire Nation witnessed and shared in the \n     tragedy of September 11, 2001, and in the immediate aftermath \n     of the attacks became unified under a remarkable spirit of \n     service and compassion that inspired and helped heal the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas in the years immediately following the attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \n     documented a marked increase in volunteerism among the people \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas families of 9/11 victims, survivors, first \n     responders, rescue and recovery workers, and volunteers \n     called for Congress to pass legislation to formally authorize \n     the establishment of September 11 as an annually recognized \n     ``National Day of Service and Remembrance'', and for the \n     President of the United States to proclaim the day as such;\n       Whereas, in 2004, Congress unanimously passed H.

Res. 247\n\n       Whereas the estuary regions of the United States comprise a \n     significant share of the national economy, with 43 percent of \n     the population, 40 percent of employment, and 49 percent of \n     economic output located in such regions;\n       Whereas coasts and estuaries contribute more than \n     $800,000,000,000 annually in trade and commerce to the \n     Nation's economy;\n       Whereas more than 43 percent of all adults in the United \n     States visit a sea coast or estuary at least once a year to \n     participate in some form of recreation, generating \n     $8,000,000,000 to $12,000,000,000 in revenue annually;\n       Whereas more than 28,000,000 jobs in the United States are \n     supported through commercial and recreational fishing, \n     boating, tourism, and other coastal industries that rely on \n     healthy estuaries;\n       Whereas estuaries provide vital habitat for countless \n     species of fish and wildlife, including many that are listed \n     as threatened or endangered;\n       Whereas estuaries provide critical ecosystem services that \n     protect human health and public safety, including water \n     filtration, flood control, shoreline stabilization and \n     erosion prevention, and protection of coastal communities \n     during extreme weather events;\n       Whereas 55,000,000 acres of estuarine habitat have been \n     destroyed over the last 100 years;\n       Whereas bays once filled with fish and oysters have become \n     dead zones filled with excess nutrients, chemical wastes, and \n     harmful algae;\n       Whereas sea level rise is accelerating the degradation of \n     estuaries by submerging low-lying lands, eroding beaches, \n     converting wetlands to open water, exacerbating coastal \n     flooding, and increasing the salinity of estuaries and \n     freshwater aquifers;\n       Whereas in the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1451 et seq.), Congress found and declared that it is \n     national policy to preserve, protect, develop, and where \n     possible, to restore or enhance, the resources of the \n     Nation's coastal zone, including estuaries, for current and \n     future generations;\n       Whereas estuary restoration efforts cost-effectively \n     restore natural infrastructure in local communities, helping \n     to create jobs and reestablish the natural functions of \n     estuaries that yield countless benefits; and\n       Whereas September 26, 2009, has been designated ``National \n     Estuaries Day'' to increase awareness among all citizens, \n     including local, State, and Federal officials, about the \n     importance of healthy estuaries and the need to protect them: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 26, 2009, as ``National Estuaries \n     Day'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Estuaries \n     Day'';\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of estuaries to the \n     Nation's economic well-being and productivity;\n       (4) recognizes the persistent threats that undermine the \n     health of the Nation's estuaries;\n       (5) applauds the work of national and community \n     organizations and public partners to promote public \n     awareness, protection, and restoration of estuaries; and\n       (6) reaffirms its support for estuaries, including the \n     preservation, protection, and restoration thereof, and \n     expresses its intent to continue working to protect and \n     restore the estuaries of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9273-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9273-S9274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL CELIAC DISEASE AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Res. 259\n\n       Whereas celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 130 \n     people in the United States, for a total of 3,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet \n     to be diagnosed;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder \n     that is classified as both an autoimmune condition and a \n     genetic condition;\n       Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the \n     small intestine, which results in overall malnutrition;\n       Whereas when a person with celiac disease consumes foods \n     that contain certain protein fractions, that person suffers a \n     cell-mediated immune response that damages the villi of the \n     small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients \n     in food and the effectiveness of medications;\n       Whereas such problematic protein fractions are found in \n     wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are used to produce many \n     foods, medications, and vitamins;\n       Whereas because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there \n     is an increased incidence of celiac disease in families with \n     a known history of celiac disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the \n     symptoms can be attributed to other conditions and are easily \n     overlooked by doctors and patients;\n       Whereas as recently as 2000, the average person with celiac \n     disease waited 11 years for a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas \\1/2\\ of all people with celiac disease do not show \n     symptoms of the disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-\n     endomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease can be treated only by implementing \n     a diet free of wheat, barley, rye, and oats, often called a \n     ``gluten-free diet'';\n       Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can \n     result in damage to the small intestine, which leads to an \n     increased risk for malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma, \n     adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage, congenital \n     malformation, short stature, and disorders of skin and other \n     organs;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the \n     patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet'';\n       Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2009, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Celiac Disease Awareness Day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society and the Celiac \n     Disease Foundation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9274-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9274-S9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE AMERICAN LEGION DAY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 260, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 260) designating September 16, 2009, \n     as ``The American Legion Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to support this legislation I \nintroduced with Senator Lincoln, Senator Collins, and Senator \nChambliss, which would officially recognize this Nation's largest \nveterans' service organization, The American Legion, and its vital role \nin communities across the Nation, by designating September 16, 2009, as \n``The American Legion Day.''\n  Nothing describes the role of The American Legion more beautifully \nthan its preamble to its constitution which is recited by its members \nat the beginning of every official meeting.\n\n       For God and Country, we associated ourselves together for \n     the following purposes: To uphold and defend the Constitution \n     of the United States of America; to maintain law and order; \n     to foster and perpetuate a one hundred percent Americanism; \n     to preserve the memories and incidents of our associations in \n     the Great Wars; to inculcate a sense of individual obligation \n     to the community, state and nation; to combat the autocracy \n     of both the classes and the masses; to make right the Master \n     of Might; to promote peace and good will on earth; to \n     safeguard and transmit to Posterity the principles of \n     justice, freedom and democracy; to consecrate and sanctify \n     our comradeship by our devotion to mutual helpfulness.\n\n  I think we all would agree that these are extremely lofty goals for \nany organization, but amazingly The American Legion continues to work \ntowards these objectives--not for themselves, but for America.\n  Most people are surprised to learn that The American Legion was \nactually founded in Paris, France. You see World War I veterans \nremembered the challenges facing other wartime veterans from previous \ngenerations and vowed not to let their fellow comrades face the same \nhardships, especially those with service-connected disabilities. They \nwere concerned with employment opportunities for returning combat \nveterans. They were concerned about the survivors of combat veterans \nwho had paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. They \nwere concerned about medical care for the wounded and ill returning \nservice members.\n  Now, as at its founding, The American Legion remains focused on \nsupporting military service members and their families. Since December, \nThe American Legion's Operation Comfort Warrior raised over $170,000 to \nbuy merchandise for Wounded Warriors in military treatment centers \naround the country. The American Legion also established the ``Heroes \nto Hometowns'' program which helps local communities prepare ``welcome \nhome'' events when wounded warriors are finally released from military \nor veterans' affairs medical centers. Since the first Gulf War, The \nAmerican Legion has maintained its Family Support Network which assists \ndeployed service members and their families, especially members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves. Some requests are for financial \nassistance, but other requests are simply for household chores, such as \nlawn work or car maintenance, that would normally be done by the \nsoldier, sailor, airmen, Marine, were they not deployed. No request is \ntoo large or too small.\n  Many Legionnaires can be found in public schools on Veterans' Day or \nMemorial Day talking about their military service in periods of armed \nconflict to make sure the next generation of Americans understands the \nsacrifices and hardships of previous generations of wartime veterans. \nLegionnaires also teach students about the proper display and care of \nthe Flag of the United States.\n  The American Legion works closely with the American Red Cross--the \nlargest organization of blood donors and a working partner in disaster \nassistance. Many American Legion Posts serve as Red Cross and FEMA work \ncenters in areas hit by natural disasters.\n  The American Legion is also proud of its membership's spirit of \nvolunteerism. Each year, Legionnaires volunteer over a million hours of \nservices in VA and military medical facilities, State veterans' homes, \nand other such community volunteer opportunities.\n  And one of the most solemn of functions is providing burial details \nfor fallen comrades of every generation. The American Legion Color \nGuards, Buglers and Rifle Squads perform thousands of burials in \nveterans' and private cemeteries around the Nation.\n  As all of us in this chamber know, The American Legion remains today \nan active and vigorous advocate for service members, veterans and their \nfamilies here on Capitol Hill. Among its greatest legislative \nachievements was the enactment of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of \n1944, the GI Bill of\n\n[[Page S9275]]\n\nRights. The initial draft of the GI Bill was written by Legionnaires at \nthe Mayflower Hotel here in Washington, DC. Many consider the GI Bill \nas one of the greatest pieces of legislation ever enacted.\n  Congress presented The American Legion its Federal charter on \nSeptember 16, 1919; therefore, I think it only fitting that we proclaim \nSeptember 16, 2009, ``The American Legion Day.'' I sincerely hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this well-earned measure, \ndemonstrating our mutual esteem and reverence for this outstanding \norganization.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 260) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, on this day, the day after the President's \nspeech to the joint session, and on a day when so many of our \ncolleagues have given so many moving tributes to Senator Kennedy, I \ncome to the floor tonight to talk a little bit about health care. What \nI want to do is share a presentation I have given in every corner of my \nState--all across Colorado, in rural Colorado, urban Colorado.\n  I am extremely proud that over the course of the entire recess--\nthough we had townhall meetings all across our State, and though there \nwere lots of different feelings about whether the reform we have been \npursuing is a good idea--every one of the conversations we had was a \nsubstantive conversation, a serious conversation, about what our \nworking families and small businesses are facing as a consequence of \nthe status quo and also the fiscal problems we are facing as a country \nand how health care reform, done right, is an important part to fixing \nour financial health.\n  So tonight what I want to do is go through some of those slides. I \nwill try to be pretty brief because the hour is late. But I want to \ngive a context of the kinds of conversations we had in our State. I \nthink the overarching feeling people had when we were done was that we \ndo need to change the status quo. The status quo is absolutely \nintolerable for our working families and small businesses. But there is \na deep concern that we have the capacity to make it even worse. I left \nevery meeting saying I think that is too low a standard for the \nCongress. We need to do much better than that. We need to get this \nhealth care reform done. But we need to get it done right, and we need \nto take the time that is required to get it right.\n  The first thought I always started with was just to explain to people \nwhat the difference was between our deficit and our debt. Our deficit, \nas this slide shows, is the annual gap between our revenues and our \nexpenses. And debt, which we have far too much of in this country, is \nwhat adds up year after year after year if we continue to have our \ndeficits.\n  The second slide shows that over the years we have actually done a \npretty good job of managing our deficit. Anything over 3 percent of GDP \nis a problem because it is not sustainable. Our borrowing costs will \noutstrip our ability to catch up to our deficits if we are above 3 \npercent GDP. This slide shows, over the years, except for in wartime, \nexcept in World War II--and more recently during the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--we have not gone far above the 3 percent of GDP.\n  This slide just shows us how we have stacked up debt so quickly over \nthe last decade or so. We had about $5 trillion of debt on the country, \non the Nation when the last President assumed the Presidency. We are \nnow at $12 trillion. As we can see, there has been an enormous spike \nbetween 2000 and today.\n  This is just a slide that shows how much debt this really is. Our \nentire economy, our entire GDP, gross domestic product, is $14 \ntrillion. Our debt is $12 trillion today. We can see that these other \ncountries all have a much smaller GDP than we do. That is good news.\n  Unfortunately, some of these folks, particularly China, own an awful \nlot of our debt.\n  We also took the time to say to people: How did this happen? How did \nwe let this happen to the American people and to our kids and our \ngrandkids? How is it possible that in virtually the blink of an eye we \nwent from having $5 trillion of debt on the country to having $12 \ntrillion of national debt?\n  As we can see here, both parties bear responsibility for where we \nare. The tax cuts in the early 2000s are responsible for $1.4 trillion \nof the debt passed on to our kids and our grandkids; $900 billion for \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which we did not pay for--we did not \nmake the choices we needed to pay for it; we put it on our kids and our \ngrandkids--the Recovery Act funding, which is roughly $780 billion--40 \npercent or so in tax cuts, the rest in spending--the bank bailout, half \nin the last administration, half in this administration, $600 billion, \nand Medicare Part D, the drug program for seniors, which, again, may be \na very legitimate program. It may be a program people would like to \nhave. We did not pay for it. We said to our kids and our grandkids: You \npay for it.\n  These are just CBO numbers that show our steady state. If we do not \ndo anything to change course, the amount of debt will just continue to \ngrow.\n  Then, finally--and this is going to take us into the health care \ndiscussion we had in Colorado over the recess--if we look at the \nbiggest drivers of our future deficits, what we see on this slide is \nthat here is our tax revenue line, and we can see it is pretty flat \nover time, from 2008 to 2039. But the biggest drivers are our interest \non the debt that we are putting on the backs of our kids and our \ngrandkids, and the spiraling cost--or maybe a better word is the \nskyrocketing cost, given the direction of this line--of Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  The President talked about this last night. The biggest driver, other \nthan interest, is rising Medicare and Medicaid costs. Obviously, the \nbiggest driver of rising Medicare and Medicaid costs is rising health \ncare costs.\n  So, in my judgment, no matter what one thinks about the health care \nreform discussion, if you are somebody who takes seriously the idea \nthat we have to get hold of our deficit, we have to get hold of this \nnational debt before it so constrains the choices of our kids and our \ngrandkids that we are not providing them with the kind of choices or \nopportunities they ought to have, we need to do something about the \ntrajectory of those Medicare and Medicaid lines, and that means health \ncare reform.\n  This slide shows there is no way we can cut ourselves out of the \nproblem with just discretionary spending cuts. This slide shows if we \ndo not do anything differently now, we are all going to be talking \nabout tax cuts in the future that none of us would ever reasonably \nsupport.\n  So my view is we do face a very significant fiscal challenge in this \ncountry and that health care reform is not sufficient to solve that \nproblem, but it is an important step, and, in fact, the problem cannot \nbe solved without addressing health care.\n  As this slide says, we need to urgently address health care reform to\n\n[[Page S9277]]\n\nhelp solve our Nation's fiscal crisis and also provide greater access \nto quality, affordable health coverage.\n  There are a lot of questions in my State about whether we are up to \nmaking the tough choices that need to be made to be able to create a \npiece of legislation that can produce meaningful reform and can do it \nin a way that changes the cost curve for Medicare and Medicaid. I, \nfrankly, do not think we have a choice. I do not think we have a choice \nbecause our working families and small businesses cannot endure another \ndecade like the last one.\n  These numbers apply to my State but are very similar in States all \nacross the United States. In Colorado, if we look over the last 10 \nyears, our median family income has actually gone down by about $800. \nBy the way, that was before we entered the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression. So that number is probably even worse today. Most \ncertainly it is worse.\n  This, by the way, is an important issue for our working families, our \nfamilies in our State, because it implies something about how well our \neconomy is working or not working for middle-class families. It is very \nworrisome to see that our income is down $800. The national number, I \nbelieve, over the same period is that it is down $300.\n  But at the same time our families' revenues were flat, the health \ncare cost premiums in Colorado went up by 97 percent--almost double. \nMr. President, I can tell you, I have now visited every one of the 64 \ncounties in Colorado and had conversations in every place. I can find \npeople who disagree on everything. But I can also tell you there is not \na single person in a single one of those counties who has said to me: \nMy health care insurance is 97 percent better today than it was at the \nbeginning of the decade or my health care coverage is 97 percent better \nthan it was at the beginning of the decade. Thank you, Michael Bennet, \nfor making sure my costs went up by 97 percent. Nobody is saying that. \nIn fact, the reverse is true. The quality of the coverage is actually \ngoing down.\n  In my State, also, over the same period of time, the cost of higher \neducation has gone up by 50 percent. So here is what we are saying to \nour working families: You are going to have to make due with less. Your \nincome in real dollars is going to be lower at the end of the decade \nthan it was at the beginning of the decade. And, at the same time, you \nare going to have to assume dramatically increased health care premium \ncosts and a dramatically increased cost for sending your child to one \nof our institutions of higher education.\n  It is no wonder that given the circumstances where household revenue \nis flat, the costs of things that are not nice to have--they are \nessential for the stability of our working families and our small \nbusinesses--that as our revenues have been flat, these costs have \nskyrocketed absolutely out of control. It is no wonder why, in my State \nand in States all across the United States, that the last decade saw a \ntime when families were saving not what they usually saved--which is 7 \npercent of their net income--but zero, and going into debt with credit \ncards and home equity loans in order to try to bridge this \nextraordinary gap between their revenues and their costs.\n\n  This is the second slide I showed on this subject in my State. This \njust makes the point that today in the United States, we are spending \nroughly 18 percent of our gross domestic product on health care. That \nis going to 20 percent in the blink of an eye if we don't do something \ndifferent. What I believe and what I said out there is that we can't \nhope to compete in this global economy if we are spending a fifth of \nour economy on health care and every other industrialized country in \nthe world is spending less than half that, or at least if we can find a \nway to spend less than that on health care, we should so that we can \ncompete.\n  It is no different than if you had two small businesses--and the \nPresiding Officer is a small business owner--two small businesses \nacross the street from each other that did the exact same thing and one \nwas spending a fifth of its revenue on its light bill and the small \nbusiness across the street was spending less than half that. You don't \nneed an MBA to know which of those two companies is going to be able to \ninvest in its business plan and grow for the future. So if we are going \nto compete in the way I know this country can compete, we have to do \nbetter than spending more than twice what all of our competition is \nspending on health care.\n  This is another slide that shows just how tough this has become for \nour middle-class families in Colorado. What we see here is that this is \nbetween 2000 and 2007. Again, this is before we entered the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. The numbers would be worse today. \nBut what this shows is the rate of increase of insurance premiums--that \nis the red line--and the rate of increase in wages, which is the blue \nline.\n  When I was in these meetings, I would ask: Are there any small \nbusiness people here?\n  And they would say: Yes, we are here.\n  I would say: Is this related? Are these two curves related to each \nother?\n  And they said: Of course, they are related to each other, because we \nare doing everything we can to try to continue to offer health \ninsurance to our employees, but one of the effects that is having is we \ncan't pay people the salary increases to which they are entitled.\n  So there is a direct relationship between the cost of insurance and \nthe wage compression that is happening in our State.\n  By the way, I would hazard a guess that one of the reasons median \nfamily income is down is that small businesses are struggling mightily \nto keep insuring their workforce.\n  This is just a slide that shows that if we don't change anything, if \nwe hang on to the status quo, by 2016 a lot of our families are going \nto be spending 40 cents of every one of their household dollars on \nhealth insurance.\n  The current system is bankrupting a lot of our families. Sixty-two \npercent of all bankruptcies are health care related. But the amazing \nthing to me on this slide is that of those health care-related \nbankruptcies, nearly 80 percent of them were folks who had coverage. \nThese are people who bought coverage, they paid into the system to \ncreate security, to create stability, and when they needed that \nprotection, it wasn't there. As a result, their families went bankrupt.\n  By the way, this could happen to anybody. As the President said last \nnight, you could be anybody. Nobody can predict when they are going to \nget sick or when a child of theirs is going to get sick. That is an \nimportant point too.\n  All of these slides, everything up here is not about the folks in our \ncountry who aren't insured or the folks in our country who are insured; \nthis is about 300 million Americans. Everything we have talked about \nshould be of concern to everybody in our country.\n  This slide just shows what the current system means for small \nbusinesses, which, again, have struggled mightily--family-owned \nbusinesses, small businesses--to keep insuring their workforce. The \nslide on the left tells us that our small businesses pay 18 percent \nmore to cover their employees than large businesses do.\n  While I was on the road, somebody said to me: Well, Michael, don't \nyou know the reason for that is they are small and their pool is \nsmaller and it is harder to spread the insurance risks across a small \ngroup of people?\n  Of course, that is true. But from a business perspective, it is \nabsolutely ridiculous because no small business owner I know would \ninvest 18 percent more for something unless they were making their \nbusiness 18 percent more productive. Of course, the reverse is true \nhere because they are buying the same thing the large company is--\nexcept they are not even buying the same thing. It is not as though \nthey are getting 18 percent better coverage for their employees than \nthe larger employers. The deductibles are higher. The lack of \npredictability is greater. It is a huge problem for small businesses.\n  It is no surprise that in my State, between 2002 and 2007, you can \nsee the drop in the percentage of folks who are insured at work. Most \nof our folks, like the folks in the State of the Presiding Officer, are \nemployed by small businesses, and we can see the effect these cost \nincreases are having. They are just not able to keep up with those \nincreases. The proof is in the pudding. Here we see that over 50 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S9278]]\n\nsmall businesses in 2000 were insuring their workforce, and now we are \nat about 40 percent, and that number is dropping.\n  So in my view, no matter where you are on questions such as a public \noption--which I support and have supported--or not a public option, the \nthing that should find us all together is driving costs down in our \nsystem.\n  I won't bother to go through all of these tonight, but I will say \nthat, in my judgment, a lot of this is pretty commonsense reform that \nwe all ought to be able to support: Changing our incentive structure so \nwe reimburse people based on quality of care, not the quantity of care.\n  Coordinating patient care. We have an incredible example of this in \nColorado with the Rocky Mountain Health Plans on our Western Slope and \nGrand Junction, Mesa County, also at the University of Colorado at \nDenver, also at Denver Health, the public hospital in Denver. But there \nare examples all over this country, such as the Mayo Clinic, a place \nany one of us would be proud to send our kids or send our parents for \ncare, which is delivering a higher quality of care at a lower price. It \nis something we should all be able to support.\n  More focus on money on preventive care.\n  Increased competition so that our families and small businesses have \na broader pool from which to choose. Fifty-three percent of people in \nmy State, the State of Colorado, are insured by just two insurers.\n  This is an important point we haven't talked about enough; that is, \nthe investment in health care IT. When I traveled through the 64 \ncounties, there was not a county that I went to where there wasn't a \nconvenience store. Apart from the loose beef jerky that sits on the \ncounter, everything in that store had a bar code on it. That is 1970s \ntechnology that people have used to manage the inventory of their local \nconvenience store, the business owner has used to manage their \ninventory. Only 3 percent of hospitals in this country use that sort of \ntechnology. One out of 25 doctors in this country uses that technology.\n  I am a parent of three little girls. They are 10, 8, and 5. I can't \ntell you the number of times I have had to take them to the doctor or \ntake them to an emergency room and have to explain again the whole \nstory of why we were there and what the last doctor told us or what the \nlast nurse told us. That is not the fault of the doctors or nurses, but \nit is the fault of having a system of insurance and a medical system \nthat has not invested in technology.\n  I have spent roughly half my career in the private sector. When I \nlook at the complete lack of investment in technology when it comes to \nhealth care and when it comes to electronic medical records, I find it \nbreathtaking, staggering that we could have that kind of inefficiency. \nSo this is an important investment as well.\n  Then, bundling payments to encourage medical professionals to work \ntogether for the benefit of patients.\n  The final slide I wanted to share is just a reminder that there is a \nlot of insurance reform that is part of the proposals that are floating \naround the Congress. This is the whole issue about having people no \nlonger denied insurance because they have a preexisting condition or \nare losing their insurance because they face a lifetime cap of some \nkind that many people don't even know they have in their policy or \nbecause their child gets sick and nobody predicted that and they get \nthrown off their policy or because they lose their job. I think all of \nus can agree that is a good idea.\n  So as we leave this week and we go home again this weekend, as I get \nto go back to Colorado and continue to have conversations with people \nin my State, what I am going to be focused on are the areas of \nagreement that working families, small businesses, Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents, can all agree upon. I think if we could \nfocus our energy there, focus our attention there, what we are going to \nfind is that the areas of disagreement are actually smaller than we \nimagined them to be.\n  Finally, in my view, we have waited far too long to do these \ncommonsense reforms. I know there is a lot of concern about our rushing \ninto something, and I don't think we should rush. But I think we need \nto get this done, and I think we need to get it done right. The \nAmerican people need us to because they cannot endure another 10 years \nof graphs that look like the ones I showed you.\n  I don't want to have to go back to Colorado and explain why only 25 \npercent of people are covered at work or why there has been another 97 \npercent increase in premiums or why, when people buy insurance, there \nis no predictability to that insurance. I have great hope and optimism \nthat, working together, we are going to get that kind of health care \nreform done in a smart, wise, measured way, and in a way that will \nrequire implementation over a period of time. There is no doubt in my \nmind we are going to get this done.\n  With that, I thank the Chair for listening to my remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/10/senate-section/article/S9278-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
