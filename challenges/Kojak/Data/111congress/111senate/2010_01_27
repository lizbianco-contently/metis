For 220 \nyears, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They have done so during \nperiods of prosperity and tranquility. And they have done so in the \nmidst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great \nstruggle.\n  It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our \nprogress was inevitable--that America was always destined to succeed. \nBut when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first \nlanded at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market \ncrashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on \nBloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were times \nthat tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our \nUnion. And despite all our divisions and disagreements; our hesitations \nand our fears; America prevailed because we chose to move forward as \none Nation, and one people.\n  Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.\n  One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by \nsevere recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a \nGovernment deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum \nwarned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we \nacted--immediately and aggressively. And 1 year later, the worst of the \nstorm has passed.\n  But the devastation remains. One in ten Americans still cannot find \nwork. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small \ntowns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. For those \nwho had already known poverty, life became that much harder.\n  This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nhave been dealing with for decades--the burden of working harder and \nlonger for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids \nwith college.\n  So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not \nnew. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These \nstruggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, \nIndiana and Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that \nI read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children--\nasking why they have to move from their home, or when their mom or dad \nwill be able to go back to work.\n  For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast \nenough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why \nit seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded but hard work on \nMain Street isn't; or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to \nsolve any of our problems. They are tired of the partisanship and the \nshouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.\n  So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people \nhope--what they deserve--is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, \nto work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our \npolitics. For while the people who sent us here have different \nbackgrounds, different stories and different beliefs, the anxieties \nthey face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared. A job \nthat pays the bills. A chance to get ahead. Most of all, the ability to \ngive their children a better life.\n  You know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in \nthe face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our \nhistory, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids; starting \nbusinesses and going back to school. They're coaching little league and \nhelping their neighbors. As one woman wrote me, ``We are strained but \nhopeful, struggling but encouraged.''\n  It is because of this spirit--this great decency and great strength--\nthat I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am \ntonight. Despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. \nWe do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. \nIn this new decade, it's time the American people get a Government that \nmatches their decency; that embodies their strength. And tonight, I'd \nlike to talk about how together, we can deliver on that promise.\n  It begins with our economy.\n  Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same \nbanks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if \nthere's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, it's that \nwe all hated the bank bailout. I hated it. You hated it. It was about \nas popular as a root canal.\n  But when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was \npopular--I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the \nmeltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it \nis today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would \nhave surely been lost.\n  So I supported the last Administration's efforts to create the \nfinancial rescue program. And when we took the program over, we made it \nmore transparent and accountable. As a result, the markets are now \nstabilized, and we have recovered most of the money we spent on the \nbanks.\n  To recover the rest, I have proposed a fee on the biggest banks. I \nknow Wall Street isn't keen on this idea, but if these firms can afford \nto hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back \nthe taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.\n  As we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our \neconomy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help \nAmericans who had become unemployed.\n  That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more \nthan 18 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for \nfamilies who get their coverage through COBRA; and passed 25 different \ntax cuts.\n  Let me repeat: we cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working \nfamilies. We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-\ntime homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their \nchildren. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college. As a \nresult, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas, and food, and \nother necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. \nAnd we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person. \nNot a single dime.\n  Because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans \nworking right now who would otherwise be unemployed. Two hundred \nthousand work in construction and clean energy. Three hundred thousand \nare teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, \nfirefighters, correctional officers, and first responders. And we are \non track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by \nthe end of the year.\n  The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the \njobs, is the Recovery Act. That's right--the Recovery Act, also known \nas the Stimulus Bill. Economists on the left and the right say that \nthis bill has helped saved jobs and avert disaster. But you don't have \nto take their word for it.\n  Talk to the small business in Phoenix that's about to triple its \nworkforce because of the Recovery Act.\n  Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to \nbe skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work \nshifts just because of the business it created.\n  Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her \nprincipal on the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, \nshe wouldn't be laid off after all.\n  There are stories like this all across America. And after 2 years of \nrecession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started \nto gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest \nagain, and slowly some are starting to hire again.\n  But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, \nof men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where \ntheir next paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after \nweek and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must continue to be \nour number one focus in 2010. And that is why I am calling for a new \njobs bill tonight.\n  Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be \nAmerica's businesses. But Government can create the conditions \nnecessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers.\n  We should start where most new jobs do--in small businesses, \ncompanies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or \na worker decides it's time she became her own boss.\n  Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered \nthe recession and are ready to grow. But when you talk to small \nbusiness owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania or Elyria, Ohio, \nyou find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, \nthey are mostly lending to bigger companies. But financing remains \ndifficult for small business owners across the country.\n  So tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall \nStreet banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small \nbusinesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I am also proposing a \nnew small business tax credit--one that will go to over 1 million small \nbusinesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, \nlet's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business \ninvestment; and provide a tax incentive for all businesses, large and \nsmall, to invest in new plants and equipment.\n  Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure \nof tomorrow. From the first railroads to the interstate highway system, \nour Nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe \nor China should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that \nmanufacture clean energy products.\n  Tomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break \nground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There \nare projects like that all across this country that will create jobs \nand help our Nation move goods, services, and information. We should \nput more Americans to work building clean energy facilities, and give \nrebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which \nsupports clean energy jobs. And\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\nto encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, \nit's time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our \njobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs \nin the United States of America.\n  The House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. \nAs the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the \nsame. People are out of work. They are hurting. They need our help. And \nI want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.\n  But the truth is, these steps still won't make up for the seven \nmillion jobs we've lost over the last 2 years. The only way to move to \nfull employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic \ngrowth, and finally address the problems that America's families have \nconfronted for years.\n  We cannot afford another so-called economic ``expansion'' like the \none from last decade--what some call the ``lost decade''--where jobs \ngrew more slowly than during any prior expansion; where the income of \nthe average American household declined while the cost of health care \nand tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a \nhousing bubble and financial speculation.\n  From the day I took office, I have been told that addressing our \nlarger challenges is too ambitious--that such efforts would be too \ncontentious, that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we \nshould just put things on hold for awhile.\n  For those who make these claims, I have one simple question:\n  How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on \nhold?\n  You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as \nthe problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp \nits economy. Germany's not waiting. India's not waiting. These nations \naren't standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. \nThey're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding \ntheir infrastructure. They are making serious investments in clean \nenergy because they want those jobs.\n  I do not accept second-place for the United States of America. As \nhard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may \nbe, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are \nhampering our growth.\n  One place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not \ninterested in punishing banks, I'm interested in protecting our \neconomy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for \nbusinesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the \nsavings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can \nonly happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly \nbrought down our entire economy.\n  We need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the \ninformation they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow \nfinancial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to \ntake risks that threaten the whole economy.\n  The House has already passed financial reform with many of these \nchanges. And the lobbyists are already trying to kill it. Well, we \ncannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk \ndoes not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back.\n  Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made \nthe largest investment in basic research funding in history--an \ninvestment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or \ntreatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched. \nAnd no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can \nalready see the results of last year's investment in clean energy--in \nthe North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs making advanced \nbatteries; or in the California business that's putting thousands to \nwork making solar panels.\n  But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more \nproduction, more efficiency, more incentives. That means building a new \ngeneration of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It \nmeans making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil \nand gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels \nand clean coal technologies. And yes, it means passing a comprehensive \nenergy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean \nenergy the profitable kind of energy in America.\n  I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. This \nyear, I am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. I \nknow there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes \nin a tough economy; and I know that there are those who disagree with \nthe overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But even if you \nare a doubter, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean \nenergy are the right thing to do for our future--because the nation \nthat leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the \nglobal economy. And America must be that Nation.\n  Third, we need to export more of our goods. Because the more products \nwe make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support here in \nAmerica. So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over \nthe next 5 years, an increase that will support two million jobs in \nAmerica. To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export \nInitiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their \nexports, and reform export controls consistent with national security.\n  We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors \nare. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade \ndeals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. But \nrealizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our \ntrading partners play by the rules. And that's why we will continue to \nshape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will \nstrengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South \nKorea, Panama, and Colombia.\n  Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.\n  This year, we have broken through the stalemate between left and \nright by launching a national competition to improve our schools. The \nidea here is simple: instead of rewarding failure, we only reward \nsuccess. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform--\nreform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in \nmath and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the \nfuture of too many young Americans, from rural communities to inner-\ncities. In the 21st century, one of the best anti-poverty programs is a \nworld-class education. We cannot settle for an America where the \nsuccess of our children depends more on their zip code than their \npotential. And when we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 \nstates.\n  Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a \ngood job. I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that \nwill revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to \nthe children of so many working families. To make college more \naffordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer-\nsubsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that \nmoney and give families $10,000 for 4 years of college and increase \nPell Grants. And let's tell another one million students that when they \ngraduate, they will be required to pay only ten percent of their income \non student loans. Because in the United States of America, no one \nshould go broke because they chose to go to college. And it's time for \ncolleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own \ncosts--because they too have a responsibility to help solve this \nproblem.\n  Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing \nthe middle-class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to \nchair a task force on Middle-Class Families. That's why we're nearly \ndoubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for \nretirement by giving every worker access to a retirement account and \nexpanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why \nwe're working to lift the value of a family's single largest \ninvestment--their home. The steps we took last year to shore up the \nhousing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans \nand save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we will \nstep up re-financing so that homeowners can move into more affordable \nmortgages.\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\n  And that's why we still need health insurance reform--because there \nis no greater long-term burden on middle-class families.\n  Now let's be clear--I did not choose to tackle this issue to get some \nlegislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly \nobvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics.\n  I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from \nAmericans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting \ncoverage; patients who've been denied coverage; and families--even \nthose with insurance--who are just one illness away from financial \nruin.\n  After nearly a century of trying, we are closer than ever to bringing \nmore security to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we've \ntaken would protect every American from the worst practices of the \ninsurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured \nAmericans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a \ncompetitive market. It would require every insurance plan to cover \npreventive care. And I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle \nObama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the \nepidemic of childhood obesity and make our kids healthier.\n\n  Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance \nto keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums \nfor families and businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice--the independent organization that both parties have cited as \nthe official scorekeeper for Congress--our approach would bring down \nthe deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.\n  Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the \nmore skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not \nexplaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with \nall the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most Americans \nwondering what's in it for them.\n  But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm \nfinished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health \ninsurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. \nPremiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small \nbusiness owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.\n  I will not walk away from these Americans. And neither should the \npeople in this chamber. As temperatures cool, I want everyone to take a \nsecond look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many \ndoctors, nurses, and health care experts across the country consider \nthis approach a vast improvement over the status quo. But if anyone \nfrom either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, \nbring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for \nseniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. Here's what I \nask of Congress, though: Do not walk away from reform. Not now. Not \nwhen we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the \njob for the American people.\n  Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not \nenough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find \nourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to \nsolve, and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing.\n  So let me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the \nrecord straight. At the beginning of the last decade, America had a \nbudget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had \na 1 year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 \ntrillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not \npaying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug \nprogram. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion \nhole in our budget. That was before I walked in the door.\n  Now if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked \nnothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took \noffice amid a crisis, and our efforts to prevent a second Depression \nhave added another $1 trillion to our national debt.\n  I am absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But \nfamilies across the country are tightening their belts and making tough \ndecisions. The Federal Government should do the same. So tonight, I'm \nproposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion that it took to \nrescue the economy last year.\n  Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for 3 \nyears. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary \nGovernment programs will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work \nwithin a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. \nAnd if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.\n  We will continue to go through the budget line by line to eliminate \nprograms that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified \n$20 billion in savings for next year. To help working families, we will \nextend our middle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we \nwill not continue tax cuts for oil companies, investment fund managers, \nand those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.\n  Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we will still \nface the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, \nthe cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to \nskyrocket. That's why I've called for a bipartisan, Fiscal Commission, \nmodeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent \nConrad. This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us \npretend we solved a problem. The Commission will have to provide a \nspecific set of solutions by a certain deadline. Yesterday, the Senate \nblocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I will issue \nan executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse \nto pass this problem on to another generation of Americans. And when \nthe vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go \nlaw that was a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.\n\n  I know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address \nthe deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still \nhurting. I agree, which is why this freeze will not take effect until \nnext year, when the economy is stronger. But understand--if we do not \ntake meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our fragile \nmarkets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery--\nall of which could have an even worse effect on our job growth and \nfamily incomes.\n  From the right, I expect we'll hear that we should make fewer \ninvestments in our people, extend tax cuts for wealthier Americans, \neliminate more regulations, and maintain the status quo on health care. \nThe problem is, that's what we did for 8 years. That's what helped lead \nus into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. And we \ncannot do it again.\n  Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated \nWashington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in \nour people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our \nresponsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common \nsense.\n  To do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of \ndollars right now. We face a deficit of trust--deep and corrosive \ndoubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years. To \nclose that credibility gap we must take action on both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do \nour work openly; and to give our people the Government they deserve.\n  That's what I came to Washington to do. That's why--for the first \ntime in history--my Administration posts our White House visitors \nonline. And that's why we've excluded lobbyists from policy-making jobs \nor seats on Federal boards and commissions.\n  But we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose \neach contact they make on behalf of a client with my Administration or \nCongress. And it's time to put strict limits on the contributions that \nlobbyists give to candidates for Federal office. Last week, the Supreme \nCourt reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special \ninterests--including foreign corporations--to spend without limit in \nour elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be \nbankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign \nentities. They should be decided by the American people, and that's why \nI'm urging\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\nDemocrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this \nwrong.\n  I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark \nreform. You have trimmed some of this spending and embraced some \nmeaningful change. But restoring the public trust demands more. For \nexample, some members of Congress post some earmark requests online. \nTonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a \nsingle website before there's a vote so that the American people can \nsee how their money is being spent.\n  Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also \nreform how we work with one another.\n  I am not naive. I never thought the mere fact of my election would \nusher in peace, harmony, and some post-partisan era. I knew that both \nparties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some \nissues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always \ncause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of \nGovernment in our lives, about our national priorities and our national \nsecurity, have been taking place for over 200 years. They are the very \nessence of our democracy.\n  But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every \nday is Election Day. We cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only \ngoal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about their \nopponent--a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay \nor obstruct every single bill just because they can. The confirmation \nof well-qualified public servants should not be held hostage to the pet \nprojects or grudges of a few individual Senators. Washington may think \nthat the vitriol spilled out on cable and talk radio is just part of \nthe game; that saying anything about the other side, no matter how \nfalse, is what it takes to get power. But it is precisely such politics \nthat has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse \nyet, it is sowing further division among our citizens and further \ndistrust in our Government.\n  So no, I will not give up on changing the tone of our politics. I \nknow it's an election year. And after last week, it is clear that \ncampaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to \ngovern. To Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest \nmajority in decades, and the people expect us to solve some problems, \nnot run for the hills. And if the Republican leadership is going to \ninsist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at \nall in this town, then the responsibility to govern is now yours as \nwell. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but \nit's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our \nambitions. So let's show the American people that we can do it \ntogether. This week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House \nRepublicans. And I would like to begin monthly meetings with both the \nDemocratic and Republican leadership. I know you can't wait.\n\n  Throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than \nour security. Sadly, the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. We \ncan argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I am not \ninterested in re-litigating the past. I know that all of us love this \ncountry. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the \nschoolyard taunts about who is tough. Let's reject the false choice \nbetween protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's leave \nbehind the fear and division, and do what it takes to defend our Nation \nand forge a more hopeful future--for America and the world.\n  That is the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we \nhave renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our Nation. We \nhave made substantial investments in our homeland security and \ndisrupted plots that threatened to take American lives. We are filling \nunacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better \nairline security, and swifter action on our intelligence. We have \nprohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to \nSouth Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of \nal Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have \nbeen captured or killed--far more than in 2008.\n  In Afghanistan, we are increasing our troops and training Afghan \nSecurity Forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011, and \nour troops can begin to come home. We will reward good governance, \nreduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans--men and women \nalike. We are joined by allies and partners who have increased their \nown commitment, and who will come together tomorrow in London to \nreaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead. But I \nam confident we will succeed.\n  As we take the fight to al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to \nits people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and \nthat is what I am doing as President. We will have all of our combat \ntroops out of Iraq by the end of this August. We will support the Iraqi \ngovernment as they hold elections, and continue to partner with the \nIraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity. But make no \nmistake: this war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.\n  Tonight, all of our men and women in uniform--in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand around the world--must know that they have our respect, our \ngratitude, and our full support. And just as they must have the \nresources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support \nthem when they come home. That is why we made the largest increase in \ninvestments for veterans in decades. That is why we are building a 21st \ncentury VA. And that is why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to \nforge a national commitment to support military families.\n  Even as we prosecute two wars, we are also confronting the greatest \ndanger to the American people--the threat of nuclear weapons. I have \nembraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a \nstrategy that reverses the spread of these weapons, and seeks a world \nwithout them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring \nour deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations \non the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. And \nat April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together \nbehind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around \nthe world in 4 years, so that they never fall into the hands of \nterrorists.\n  These diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing \nwith those nations that insist on violating international agreements in \npursuit of these weapons. That is why North Korea now faces increased \nisolation, and stronger sanctions--sanctions that are being vigorously \nenforced. That is why the international community is more united, and \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders \ncontinue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: they, \ntoo, will face growing consequences.\n  That is the leadership that we are providing--engagement that \nadvances the common security and prosperity of all people. We are \nworking through the G-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We are \nworking with Muslim communities around the world to promote science, \neducation, and innovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in \nthe fight against climate change. We are helping developing countries \nto feed themselves, and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we \nare launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to \nrespond faster and more effectively to bio-terrorism or an infectious \ndisease--a plan that will counter threats at home, and strengthen \npublic health abroad.\n  As we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our \ndestiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it \nbecause it is right. That is why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 \nAmericans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti \nrecover and rebuild. That is why we stand with the girl who yearns to \ngo to school in Afghanistan; we support the human rights of the women \nmarching through the streets of Iran; and we advocate for the young man \ndenied a job by corruption in Guinea. For America must stand on the \nside of freedom and human dignity.\n  Abroad, America's greatest source of strength is our ideals. The same \nis true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on \nthe promise enshrined in our Constitution: that no matter who you are \nor what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected \nby it; if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no \ndifferent than anyone else.\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\n  We must carry this promise forward. My Administration has a Civil \nRights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations \nand employment discrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to \nprotect against crimes driven by hate. This year, I will work with \nCongress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay \nAmericans the right to serve the country they love because of who they \nare. We are going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws--so \nthat women get equal pay for an equal day's work. And we should \ncontinue the work of fixing our broken immigration system--to secure \nour borders and enforce our laws so that everyone plays by the rules.\n  In the end, it is our ideals, our values that built America--values \nthat allowed us to forge a Nation made up of immigrants from every \ncorner of the globe; values that drive our citizens still. Every day, \nthey meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. \nTime and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to \ntheir country. They take pride in their labor, and are generous in \nspirit. These aren't Republican values or Democratic values they're \nliving by; business values or labor values. They are American values.\n  Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our \nbiggest institutions--our corporations, our media, and yes, our \nGovernment--still reflect these same values. Each of these institutions \nare full of honorable men and women doing important work for the \ncountry. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker \nputs the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts \ngrow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each \nother down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith. The more \nthat TV pundits reduce serious debates into silly arguments, and big \nissues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.\n  No wonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so \nmuch disappointment.\n  I campaigned on the promise of change--change we can believe in, the \nslogan went. And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren't \nsure if they still believe we can change.\n  But remember this--I never suggested that change would be easy. \nDemocracy in a Nation of three hundred million people can be noisy and \nmessy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big \nchanges, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.\n\n  Of course, those of us in public office can respond to this reality \nby playing it safe and keeping our poll numbers high. We can avoid \ntelling hard truths. We can kick hard problems down the road. We can do \nwhat's necessary to get through the next election instead of what's \nbest for the next generation.\n  But I also know this: if people had made that decision 50 years ago \nor 100 years ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The \nonly reason we are is because generations of Americans were unafraid to \ndo what was hard; to do what was needed even when success was \nuncertain; to do what it took to keep the dream of this Nation alive \nfor their children and grandchildren.\n  Our Administration has had some political setbacks this year, and \nsome of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they \nare nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this \ncountry have faced this year. And what keeps me going--what keeps me \nfighting--is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of \ndetermination and optimism--that fundamental decency that has always \nbeen at the core of the American people--lives on.\n  It lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of \nhis company, ``None of us,'' he said, `` . . . are willing to consider, \neven slightly, that we might fail.''\n  It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her \nneighbors have felt the pain of recession, ``We are strong. We are \nresilient. We are American.''\n  It lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana, who just sent me his \nallowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti. And it \nlives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go some \nplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from \nrubble, prompting chants of ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A!'' when another \nlife was saved.\n  The spirit that has sustained this Nation for more than two centuries \nlives on in you, its people. We have finished a difficult year. We have \ncome through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade \nstretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this \nmoment--to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen \nour Union once more.\n  Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless the United States of America.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 27, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/27/senate-section/article/S268-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on January 26, 2009, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2949.
