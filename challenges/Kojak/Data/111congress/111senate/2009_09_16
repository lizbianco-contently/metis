Senators will be \npermitted during the time until 11 o'clock to speak for up to 10 \nminutes each.

There will be 30 \nminutes for Senator Coburn and 10 minutes for Senator Murray to debate \nthe pending Coburn amendments. Upon the use or yielding back of that \ntime, the Senate will proceed to a series of up to five rollcall votes. \nTherefore, Senators should expect votes beginning around 11:30 a.m. \nSenator Coburn may not use all of his time. If that is the case, when \nhe completes his remarks, Senator Murray or someone she chooses will \nspeak and then we will start the votes.\n  Last night, I filed cloture on the committee amendment and the \nunderlying bill. I am confident and hopeful that is not going to be \nnecessary, as I am told we should be able to complete action on this \nbill today. As a result, there will be a 1 p.m. filing deadline for \nfirst-degree amendments to this Transportation bill. We hope we can \nmove immediately to the Interior appropriations bill. We should be able \nto wrap that up fairly quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9391-7", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the debate over health care continues \nto be a top concern for most Americans, but it is important to realize \nthat this debate is not taking place in a vacuum. It is taking place in \nthe context of a nation that is increasingly concerned about the size \nand the scope of government.\n  Over the past year, Americans have seen the government take over \nautomakers and insurance companies. They have seen government spend \nhundreds of billions of dollars to bail out banks and other financial \ninstitutions. They have seen government run up unprecedented debt. And \nnow they are seeing the government trying to take over health care.\n  If the White House wants an explanation for all the unrest it is \nwitnessing across the country, all the worry and concerns Americans \nhave about their health care plans, this is a crucial piece. Democrats \nin Washington may see all these government\n\n[[Page S9392]]\n\nprograms and interventions as separate, individual events. But to most \nAmericans who are weathering a recession, it seems as if every time \nthey pick up a newspaper or turn on the television, Democrats in \nWashington are pushing another trillion-dollar bill, calling for more \nspending, more taxes, and more debt. That is why people are becoming \nmore vocal, and that is why they have been delivering a consistent \nmessage for weeks: no more government takeovers, no more spending money \nwe do not have, no more tax increases, and no more debt. Americans are \nconcerned about government running their lives and ruining their \nlivelihoods, and they do not get the sense that either the \nadministration or Democrats on Capitol Hill are listening.\n  Nowhere is this disconnect between the people and the politicians in \nWashington more apparent than in the debate over health care. Americans \ndo not think a bigger role for government in health care would improve \nthe system. Yet despite this, every single proposal we have seen would \nlead to a vast expansion of the government's role in the health care \nsystem.\n  It is not that the Democrats in Congress do not sense the public's \nunease about a new government plan for health care. I think they do. It \nis the primary reason some of them are backing away from proposals that \ninclude it. What some Americans do not realize, however, is that even \nwithout a government plan, the health care plans Democrats are \nproposing would still vastly expand the government's role in our health \ncare. That is what I would like to discuss in a little more detail this \nmorning.\n  Let me list just a few examples of how government's role in health \ncare would expand even without a government-run plan.\n  Even without a government plan, the proposals we have seen would \nforce employers to pay a tax if they cannot afford insurance for their \nemployees. Employers have warned that this provision would kill jobs. \nAt a time when the Nation's unemployment rate stands at a 25-year high \nof 9.7 percent, we should help businesses create jobs not kill them.\n  Even without a government plan, these proposals would require all \nAmericans to choose only from health insurance plans with standards set \nby the government and would let government bureaucrats dictate what \nbenefits are available to families. On this point, Americans have been \nequally clear. People want more choice and competition in the health \ncare market so they can pick a plan that will work for their family, \nnot one dictated by politicians in Washington. Yet even without a \ngovernment plan, that is what they would get under the proposals we \nhave seen. Anyone who saw any of the townhall meetings last month knows \nthis idea is about as popular as chicken pox.\n\n  Even without a government plan, these health care proposals would \nrequire States to expand their Medicaid Programs, something the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, who is here on the floor, has spoken about frequently. \nGovernors from both political parties have expressed serious concerns \nabout the effect this particular proposal would have on their State \nbudgets. They think these kinds of decisions should be left up to them, \nthe States, not the Federal Government, and, frankly, so do most \nAmericans.\n  Even without a government plan, these health care proposals would \nimpose new taxes on small businesses and on individuals. Under the \nHouse bill, for example, taxes on some small businesses could rise as \nhigh as roughly 45 percent, a rate that is approximately 30 percent \nhigher than the rate for big corporations. Under the same House bill, \nthe average combined Federal and State top tax rate for some \nindividuals would be about 52 percent--more than half of their \npaychecks.\n  Finally, the President has said his plan will not require any \nAmericans to give up the health insurance they have and like. But what \nabout the 11 million seniors who are currently enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage? Nearly 90 percent of them say they are satisfied with it. \nThis program has given seniors more options and more choices when it \ncomes to their health care. Yet under the administration's plan the \ngovernment would make massive cuts to Medicare Advantage, forcing some \nseniors off this plan that so many of them have and like. When it comes \nto Medicare Advantage, Democratic rhetoric just does not square with \nreality.\n  Let me sum it up. While getting rid of the government plan would be a \ngood start, the Democratic bills we have seen would still grant the \ngovernment far too much control over the health care system.\n  Over the past few months, Americans have been saying they have had \nenough of spending, enough of debt, and enough of government expansion. \nHow are the Democrats in Washington responding? By trying to rush \nthrough another trillion-dollar bill Americans do not even want and \ncannot afford.\n  The American people do want health care reform--not with more \ngovernment but with less. They do not want a new government-run system; \nthey want us to repair the system we have.\n  On all of these points, the American people are sending a clear and \npersistent message. It is time we in Congress started to listen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9392-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I congratulate the Republican leader, \nthe Senator from Kentucky, on his remarks. He made it very clear that \nwe on the Republican side of the aisle want health care reform, but our \ndefinition of that is a little different from that on the other side of \nthe aisle. We want health care reform that reduces costs--costs to the \nAmerican people when they buy health insurance and the costs of the \ngovernment of the American people. We do not want more debt and another \nWashington takeover, which we are seeing so much of these days.\n  President Obama said in his address to us that he ``will not sign a \nplan that adds one dime to our deficits--either now or in the future. \nPeriod.'' That is good.\n  As David Brooks wrote in the New York Times this past Friday:\n\n       This sound bite [of the President] kills the House health \n     care bill.\n\n  It kills the House health care bill, because it would add $220 \nbillion to the deficit over the first 10 years of its operation and \nanother $1 trillion over the next 10 years after that.\n  The President's sound bite about the deficit would effectively knock \nout the bill passed by the Senate HELP Committee as well. According to \na recent letter from the Congressional Budget Office to the ranking \nmember of the Senate HELP Committee, Senator Enzi of Wyoming:\n\n       The 10-year cost of the coverage expansion [of that bill] \n     to the Federal Government, including such a change in \n     Medicaid eligibility, would probably exceed $1 trillion.\n\n  So that is off the table.\n  There appears to be growing bipartisan concern about a health care \nbill that might add to the debt. Senator Warner of Virginia said on \nMonday:\n\n       My feeling is, [health care reform] can't just be paid for \n     in a 10-year window. It has to be paid for in the out years \n     as well.\n\n  That is Washington-speak for over the long term. He says:\n\n       This is so much bigger than health care. It goes to the \n     deficit. It goes right to the heart of our competitiveness.\n\n  That is Senator Warner of Virginia. I couldn't agree more. All of the \nhealth care reform bills produced so far by the Democratic Congress--\neither in the Senate or in the House--flunk the first test, which is \nreducing cost--cost to the American people and cost to the American \ngovernment.\n  In July, the Congressional Budget Office Director, Douglas Elmendorf, \nsaid\n\n[[Page S9393]]\n\nthat the House bill and the Senate HELP bill did not propose ``the \nfundamental changes that would be necessary to reduce the trajectory of \nFederal health spending by a significant amount.''\n  Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has indicated that the \nHouse bill would result in a ``net increase in the Federal budget \ndeficit of $239 billion'' over 10 years. This is likely a low-ball \nestimate, because it assumes that Congress will increase taxes by $583 \nbillion over the next 10 years.\n  So if we are going to implement health care reform without increasing \nour debt, how are we going to pay for it? Who is going to pay for it is \nthe more precise question. Here are some of the answers that have been \nproposed so far by the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  No. 1, grandma's Medicare is going to pay for it. The bills--and the \nPresident's own plan, which we have yet to see the details of--propose \n``Medicare savings.'' Nice words for Medicare cuts. If there is $500 \nbillion in savings to be found in Medicare, we should use it to keep \nMedicare solvent, because the trustees of Medicare say that we are now \nspending at such a rapid rate that we will run out of money for \nMedicare by 2017. We should not use Medicare cuts to pay for a new \ngovernment program. We should use any Medicare savings to make Medicare \nstronger.\n  No. 2, the way to pay for these bills we have been seeing in the \nHouse and the Senate is to shift the costs to the States. This is done \nby expanding Medicaid, which is the largest government-run program we \nhave today. Almost 60 million low-income Americans have their health \ncare from Medicaid, which the Federal Government pays about 60 percent \nof and the States 40 percent. The plans we have been hearing about have \nthe Federal Government expanding Medicaid coverage--this is the State \nplan I was talking about--from 60 million to 80 million or 90 million \npeople and, after a few years, asking the States to pick up their \nadditional share of the cost of that expansion.\n  According to the National Governors Association, expanding Medicaid \nto 133 percent of the Federal poverty level would cost the States an \nadditional $31 billion per year. Although details are still lacking--\nand we may find out more today about the proposals from the Senate \nFinance Committee--the Democratic Governor of Tennessee, Governor \nBredesen, said on Friday that he is concerned about the plan being \nproposed by Senator Baucus and that his guess was it might cost our \nState as much as $600 million to $700 million per year.\n  In Washington that doesn't sound like a lot of money, but to \nTennessee that is a lot of money. We had a big fight a few years ago \nover whether to have a new State income tax. We don't now have one, and \nour former Governor didn't succeed on that. People got very upset about \nthat. That would only have raised $400 million. But this is an increase \nof $600 million or $700 million that would, after a few years, be \nshifted to the States.\n  That is not all. Since States only reimburse doctors and hospitals \nfor about 60 percent of their cost of serving the 60 million patients \non Medicaid, these expansion proposals of Medicaid usually also require \nStates to increase reimbursements to doctors and hospitals. Increasing \nreimbursements to doctors and hospitals would basically double the \nincreased cost to States. So you can see why earlier in the debate many \nof the Governors--including many of the Democratic Governors of this \ncountry--objected to this proposal. Governor Bredesen called those \nproposals ``the mother of all unfunded mandates.'' We know where \nunfunded mandates lead in our State, and that is higher State taxes.\n  No. 3, in addition to cutting Medicare and increasing State taxes by \nexpanding Medicaid, the bills we have seen ask small businesses to help \npay for the bills through employer mandates and fines. Under the Senate \nHELP Committee bill, for example, firms with more than 25 workers would \nhave to pay the new tax, with penalties equal to $750 per year per \nfull-time employee and $375 for part-time employees. The Congressional \nBudget Office estimated that this would raise $52 billion over 10 \nyears. The House bill would impose over $200 billion in fines on \nbusinesses who cannot afford to finance their workers' health coverage.\n  There is another consequence to that. We have often heard the \nPresident say: Well, if you like your health care plan, you can keep \nit. But, what he doesn't go on to say is that if we create this \ngovernment plan and if we require employers to pay $750 per full-time \nemployee and $375 for a part-time employee, many employers are going to \nlook at that and decide it is much cheaper to pay the $750 or the $375 \nfor an employee. So they will just pay the government a fine and let \nthe government plan offer health care to their employees. It is \nestimated by most groups that have looked at the plans we have seen \nthat the combination of a government plan and an employer tax will \nresult in millions of Americans losing their employer-provided health \ninsurance.\n  Then there is one other way of paying for the bill: to tax people who \nhave health care insurance. That is why the Democratic Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, is quoted as saying today that the bill \ncoming out of the Finance Committee--which we haven't seen yet--has a \nbig tax on coal miners, on the middle class. That is according to \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  So we are barking up the wrong tree. This debate about health care \nshould be about reducing costs. That should be the first goal of what \nwe mean when we say the words ``health care reform''--reducing the cost \nto individuals and families and small businesses that are buying health \ncare plans and paying for insurance--that is 250 million individuals in \nthe country today--reducing the cost to the government in higher health \ncare spending.\n  That is why Republicans have suggested we should start over. A lot of \ngood work has been done. A great many of us understand much better this \ncomplex subject we are dealing with. There is no embarrassment in \nsaying we have gotten to this point; we are headed in the wrong \ndirection. The Mayo Clinic, the Democratic Governors, the Congressional \nBudget Office, millions of Americans in town meetings are saying: You \nare heading in the wrong direction. You say: Ok, fine. We hear you. \nLet's start over.\n  How should we start over? Instead of passing 1,000-page bills that \nadd to the debt and increase costs, we should work step by step to re-\nearn the trust of the American people. The era of 1,000-page bills is \nover. Smaller steps in the right direction are still a very good way to \nget where we want to go. There are some steps we can take, some things \nwe can do today to move step by step in the right direction and to \nlower costs.\n  No. 1, allowing small businesses to pool and reduce health care costs \nby putting their resources together would increase accessibility for \nsmall business owners, unions, associations and their workers, members \nand families to health care. This legislation has already been \nconsidered in the Senate and in the House. It is nearly ready to pass. \nEstimates are that passing a small business health insurance plan would \npermit small businesses to offer coverage to one million more \nAmericans.\n  No. 2, reform medical malpractice laws so runaway junk lawsuits don't \ncontinue to drive up the cost of health care. The President mentioned \nthat the other night in his remarks. I congratulate him for that. But, \nwe should do even more than he suggested. We have 95 counties in \nTennessee, and in 60 of them we don't have an OB/GYN doctor because \nthey will not practice there anymore. Their medical malpractice \ninsurances premiums are too high--over $100,000. So pregnant women have \nto drive a long way--to Memphis or to Nashville or to other large \ncities--for their prenatal health care or to have their babies. That is \na way to lower costs--reduce junk lawsuits.\n  There is some disagreement about how much that would save, but there \nis no disagreement that junk lawsuits contribute to higher medical \ncosts.\n  No. 3, allow individual Americans the ability to purchase health \ninsurance across State lines. As a former Governor, I jealously protect \nStates rights. I like States to have responsibilities. But, I think, in \nterms of health care, we should allow more purchasing of policies \nacross State lines, as people do with their car insurance today. That \nis a third way to take a step toward\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\nhealth care reform that actually begins to lower costs.\n  No. 4, we don't have to pass a new bill in order to insure more \nAmericans. About 20 percent of the uninsured Americans--maybe 10 \nmillion or 11 million--are already eligible for existing programs, such \nas Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. They are not \nenrolled. We should sign them up.\n  No. 5, we could create health insurance exchanges. I hear that from \nthe Democratic side; I hear it from the Republican side. These are \nmarketplaces in each State so individuals and businesses can shop \naround and find a cheaper and a better source of health insurance.\n  No. 6, all of us have talked about encouraging health information \ntechnology, which the Government Accountability Office has said ``can \nimprove the efficiency and quality of medical care and result in costs \nsavings.''\n  I have suggested six areas we could work on together to reduce cost. \nWe have forgotten, in this health care debate, what we set out to do. \nThe first goal of health care reform is to reduce cost--the cost of \nhealth care to Americans, to American businesses, and the cost to \nAmericans of their government, which is spiraling out of control in \ndebt because of the cost of health care. We are spending 17 percent of \neverything we produce in this country--and we produce 25 percent of all \nthe wealth in the world year in and year out--on health care; twice as \nmuch on health care as a percentage as most industrialized countries. \nIf we don't reduce costs, we will bankrupt the government and make \nhealth care unaffordable for most Americans.\n  The President of the United States was right to say he will not sign \na bill that increases the deficit. Since that eliminates all the \nlegislation the Democratic Congress has produced so far, I hope we will \nnow take Republican advice and start over and get it right. A good way \nto begin would be for the President to send us a health care reform \nbill that not only doesn't add to the debt but that begins step by step \nto reduce costs to the American people and to the American Government. \nAnd by taking those steps, we can re-earn the trust of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask that the time I use be \nallocated on the Democratic time and that the Republican time be \nreserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9394-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9394-S9396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am here to talk about health \ncare and health care reform today. A lot is happening today. The \nchairman of our Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, is, as we speak, \nmaking his chairman's mark become available publicly. Then later on \ntoday, around noon, he is going to have a public statement about it.\n  Clearly this is one of the most pressing issues. Throughout this long \nhot summer we have had, people across the country have debated this \nissue, discussed it. It has helped lay the groundwork for where we are \nright now on this historic issue. I personally believe the President of \nthe United States is committed that we are going to pass health care \nreform legislation.\n  I believe the President of the United States back in the early 1990s \nwas equally committed, but it did not happen. I think the big \ndifference between then, in 1993, and now is that in fact it is going \nto happen. I want you to know this Senator is optimistic that when it \ngets around to 60 votes in this Chamber in order to shut off debate, I \nthink we will get those 60 votes, and I think we will get them in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  Of course, right now all the commentary you hear is what is this \nproblem and what is happening on this fight and who is not on board, \nand so forth. That is all natural. That is natural kind of talk. But \nwhen the moment of truth comes in casting yea or nay on this floor, I \nthink people are seeing, day by day, examples of why we have to have \nhealth care reform.\n  This happened just this past week in my own State of Florida. A woman \nundergoing cancer treatments has a reasonable degree of success by \nvirtue of the enormous advances in cancer treatment. As the research \ndoctors will tell you, people can live with cancer now. This lady was \ntold by her insurance company they were disapproving the payments for \nthe continuation of her treatments for cancer. That is the kind of \nstuff we cannot tolerate. It is another example of how insurance is not \navailable even if an American citizen can afford it.\n  I will give another example. One of the prominent citizens in a big \ncity in Florida told me, for her corporation the health insurance is \nbeing jacked up 47 percent. This is for a major telecommunications \ncompany that has thousands of lives they can spread the health risk \nover, and it is being jacked up 47 percent. She said they negotiated \nthat down from 55 percent. The question of affordability is there as \nwell as the availability. In other words, the American people need \nstability when it comes to them knowing that health insurance and \nhealth care are going to be there for them. That is what we do not have \nand that is why this Senator is optimistic that when the moment of \ntruth comes that we have to indicate to the President of the Senate if \nour vote is yea or nay, we are going to have 60 votes to cut off debate \nto get to the bill to start the amendatory process.\n  We are going to start that amendatory process in the Finance \nCommittee of the Senate next week. The chairman is going to come out \nwith a mark--the chairman's suggestion, called the chairman's mark--\ntoday. There is a bunch of stuff in there this Senator doesn't agree \nwith. But we are going to have an opportunity to change it.\n  Every one of us has received a lot of commentary about this from our \nconstituents. In our office, just in the last few weeks, just on this \nissue we have received 56,000 calls or e-mails or letters. I happen to \nthink this is good. It is bringing out passions. Unfortunately, it is \nbringing out, sometimes, hot passions.\n  During August I was inside giving a speech to the greater Miami \nChamber of Commerce while outside on the road were demonstrators with \nsigns. Along came a pickup truck, a fellow got out, got into an \nargument, and he hauled off and knocked out a 65-year-old demonstrator. \nOf course, the TV cameras arrive when the poor 65-year-old is just \ncoming to consciousness.\n  There is no place for that, but that indicates some of the hot \npassions this has brought out. Remember what President Lincoln said:\n\n       With public sentiment, nothing can fail. Without it, \n     nothing can succeed.\n\n  He was specifically talking about the way we do government and the \nway we make law in this country.\n  Recall also what President Kennedy said about 50 years ago. He said \nspecifically about health care:\n\n       The consent of the citizens of this country is essential if \n     this or any other piece of progressive legislation is going \n     to be passed.\n\n  He was specifically talking about health care. So every one of us \nSenators can say, from the personal meetings, the calls, the letters, \nthe e-mails--we can tell you there are a lot of folks out there who do \nnot have access to affordable health care or in many cases to quality \nhealth care. We can tell you the stories we have heard about people \nbeing systematically excluded by some of the Nation's major managed \ncare insurance companies and/or just insurance companies. \nUnfortunately, those are not rare cases. That is why we are here, to do \nsomething about it.\n  Regardless of where you stand on the specifics of the issue, I think \nwe can agree the current system, if continued, would be unfair, too \ncostly, and as a result it needs to be fixed. It affects every one of \nus. It is also a truth that sooner or later every American, 9 out of 10 \ntimes, 9 out of 10 of us are going to end up in the hospital at some \npoint.\n  What do we do? I think the President laid down a good marker. His \nspeech before the joint session was excellent. It gave some clear \nanswers about his views on reform. It is true he has been more hands-\noff and is letting it be done by the Senate and the House. But, \ninterestingly, when he got more specific,\n\n[[Page S9395]]\n\nas he did in his speech to the joint session, he described or tracked \npretty close to what is coming out in Senator Baucus's mark that the \nFinance Committee is going to take up next week.\n  This legislation is going to let folks who are happy with their \ninsurance keep it, including our senior citizens who are on Medicare \nand our veterans who have their health care. But it is also going to \ncreate a marketplace, a marketplace called the health insurance \nexchange, for those who do not have insurance. And in the case of the \nState of Florida, I will give you a percentage. That is 21 percent of \nour people who do not have insurance in Florida.\n  That number is a little less nationwide, but if you take Florida as a \nbellwether, it is 21 percent who do not have insurance. This \nlegislation is going to create an exchange, a health insurance \nexchange, for those who do not have it, cannot get it, or those who are \nunhappy with their coverage. They can go get it at an affordable price.\n  It is a private sector solution of insurance companies competing with \nan insurance co-op, which is owned by the policyholders, not a \ngovernment-insurance company, where in that competition of the free \nmarketplace, they can offer insurance at lower prices. And for those \npoor souls who all they can get is not a group policy because they do \nnot get insurance through an employer, the only way they can get it is \nto buy an individual policy, and, therefore, because it is an \nindividual policy their rates are through the Moon--they are going to \nhave an opportunity also to go into this health insurance exchange \nwhere they can get good coverage at a lower price. So what the \nlegislation is going to do, in the creation of this health insurance \nexchange, it is going to hold the insurance companies' feet to the fire \nto require them to cover everyone and prevent them from dropping people \nwhen they get sick. That is called ``guaranteed coverage'' without any \nexemption from preexisting medical conditions.\n  That is why a lot of people cannot get insurance. They have had a \nheart attack before or they had some malady or you have heard the \nhorror cases that they had a skin rash previously 3 years ago, and the \ninsurance company will not cover them because they said that is a \npreexisting condition.\n  We are going to stop all of that with this legislation that I think \nwill ultimately become law. It is going to contain several additional \nmeasures aimed at reducing other medical and prescription drug costs, \nand it is going to go right at the waste and the fraud in the system.\n  This is a starting point. This is not the end all to be all. This is \nthe starting point. We are going to do the amendments probably for 2 \nweeks in the Finance Committee. Then it is going to come out here, and \nit is going to get amended here. Then it is going to go to a conference \ncommittee, and it is going to get amended more.\n  There are some concerns I want to share with the Senate and anybody \nwho is listening through the lens of that TV camera. We have emphasized \nthe importance of making sure that the insurance available on that \nhealth insurance exchange is affordable. We emphasized the importance \nof addressing the high health care costs of retirees who are not yet \nready, because they are not eligible, for Medicare.\n  We have urged and expressed our concerns about how small business is \ntreated under this bill. Then, when it comes to senior citizens, those \nwho are on Medicare, who generally are very favorable about their \nMedicare coverage, it is certainly a concern of this Senator who has a \nsubstantial population in my State of Florida of senior citizens on \nMedicare that they not have something taken away from them they have \ncome to expect and to rely on in Medicare.\n  That particularly is so with regard to a program called Medicare \nAdvantage, which is a fancy term for a Medicare HMO, a health \nmaintenance organization. The way the system was set up in a bill that \npassed 5 years ago, which this Senator did not vote for because it was \nseverely flawed--nevertheless, it is the law and it has been the law \nfor the last 5 years. It set up a system whereby Medicare HMOs, called \nMedicare Advantage, bid for senior citizens by offering them attractive \npremiums that are below what the standard Medicare fee-for-service is \nin a community. The law requires whatever that differential is between \nwhat the Medicare HMO has bid and what the fee for service is, that a \nquarter of that has to be given back to Medicare, but 75 percent of \nthat differential is given to the senior citizen's Medicare \nbeneficiary, through either lower premiums or no copays, or through \nextra benefits, such as hearing devices, or eye glasses or maybe even a \nmembership in a fitness club.\n  Needless to say, the senior citizens who have this do not want it \ntaken away from them. Although people will say these high subsidies to \nMedicare Advantage, to those insurance companies need to be adjusted, I \nthink it would be intolerable to ask the senior citizens on Medicare \nwho have it to give up substantial health benefits they are enjoying \nunder Medicare.\n  For hundreds of thousands of seniors who did not conceive of Medicare \nAdvantage but who have come to rely on it, this Senator is going to \noffer an amendment that will shield them from those benefit cuts on \nexisting senior citizens on Medicare. I do not think we can punish \nsenior citizens who signed up, and if changes need to be made for the \nfuture solvency of Medicare, then the senior citizens currently with \nMedicare Advantage should be grandfathered in. That is what my \namendment is going to be. It is going to say that on the date of the \nbill, once it is signed into law, those who have that benefit should \nnot have it taken away, and that a competitive arrangement for Medicare \nAdvantage in the future would be done on a going-forward basis.\n  I have another reason I am offering that amendment, because Senator \nClaude Pepper was one of the people who nurtured me along as a young \nCongressman in the House of Representatives. A lot of young people \ntoday do not remember who Senator, then Congressman, Claude Pepper was. \nHe had been a Senator back when Roosevelt was President. He came back \ninto the Congress after a 12-year hiatus out of office as a new \nCongressman from South Florida. He became the champion of the seniors \nof America, first, chairman of the Aging Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives, and then as chairman of the Rules Committee of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  What Claude Pepper said everybody listened to, because he spoke with \ngreat credibility and he spoke with great passion and eloquence. He \nspoke for a good cause, and that was standing up for the rights of \nsenior citizens. He had been there at the outset. He had been a Senator \nwhen Social Security came into being in the midst of the Great \nDepression. Claude Pepper, who died in office at about age 87, on many \nprivate talks would say: Bill, I want you to look out for our seniors. \nSomeone has to look out for them.\n  I have never forgotten those admonitions, those instructions that \nwere done with such love and compassion. So I feel it is my duty to try \nto protect our seniors as we get into the midst of this debate.\n  There are other areas where we can certainly improve what is expected \nto come out today at noon. Another amendment would require the \npharmaceutical companies to provide rebates to Medicare, as they have \nbeen doing for years, for decades, to Medicaid.\n  Medicaid has roughly 49 million people in this country. Medicare has \nroughly 44 million people in this country. We give big discounts \nbecause we are buying for 49 million Medicaid recipients. The drug \ncompanies give those discounts back in the form of a rebate to the \ngovernments, the Federal and State governments.\n  Why shouldn't they do that with regard to the 44 million Medicare \nrecipients? If it is good enough for Medicaid, and it makes drugs a lot \ncheaper, why not do it for Medicare recipients? By the way, it would \nsave Medicare a ton of money.\n  There are serious issues to be resolved. This Senator is optimistic, \nand I believe we are going to be able to achieve this goal of expanding \naffordable health care to nearly all Americans. We must do so without \nraising taxes on the middle class or upending their coverage. And we \nmust do so without lowering the quality of health care for any \nAmerican, including our senior citizens.\n  I am, by nature, an optimist. In the midst of everything that is \nwrong about this health care bill, I remain an optimist. The moment of \ntruth is coming when we cast that vote yea or nay.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet.)

Mr. President, this afternoon I am chairing a \nhearing of our Science and Space Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee \non the future of NASA. The National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration is at a crossroads. There is only one person who can \nlead America's space program, and that is the President. The direction \nour country's space program, both manned and unmanned, is going to take \nwill be square in the lap of the President. I discussed this with him \non several occasions when he was Senator and when he was a candidate. I \nhave discussed it with his staff, I am sure from their standpoint, ad \ninfinitum.\n  This afternoon, we have the Chairman of the blue ribbon panel created \nby the President to look at the future of human spaceflight for America \nand to report to the President. The Chairman, former aerospace CEO \nNorman Augustine, is testifying in front of our committee.\n  It is the contention of this Senator's, who loves the space program, \nboth manned and unmanned, and wants to see it continue as a part of our \nAmerican character as explorers and adventurers, that if we ever give \nit up, we become a second-rate power because we give up a part of \nourselves. We have always been pioneers, adventurers, and explorers. We \nused to go westward when this country was discovered and built. Now we \ngo upward. Clearly, it is no secret where this Senator comes from.\n  What I would like to get Dr. Augustine to bring forth, out of this \nextensive deliberation and extensive and detailed and very good report \nhe has come forth with, is just how important it is that you can't do a \nhuman space program on the cheap and that NASA has been underfunded for \nthe last decade. We see the results, that we are going to be shutting \ndown the space shuttle in the near future when we have completed \nconstruction of the international space station. And because NASA has \nbeen underfunded, we don't have the next rocket ready. We have to go \nand hire rides to our own space station that we have bought and paid \nfor and built. We have to buy rides from the Russians to get there. \nThat is inexcusable, but that is what happened. It happened over the \nlast decade. NASA was underfunded.\n  The Augustine Commission has come out in early reports--and I want to \nhear this directly from him, I want the committee to hear this directly \nfrom Dr. Augustine--indicating that if we are going to fund a human \nspaceflight program that gets us out of low Earth orbit where our space \nstation is and allows us to explore other worlds, be it the Moon, be it \nMars, be it asteroids, whatever it is, NASA needs an additional $3 \nbillion a year for the next decade. I want to hear Dr. Augustine say \nthat, in fact, we do need to get out of low Earth orbit, because that \nis what we need to do as discoverers, as adventurers.\n  Finally, I want to hear him say that because NASA has been \nunderfunded and mismanaged, in fact, we have a huge personnel problem \nin that suddenly there is not going to be work for that personnel. \nThose people who are space pioneers, who have lived it and breathed it \nand dedicated their lives to it, need to be taken into consideration \ninstead of summarily dismissed and laid off. That is what I am looking \nto.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes this morning \non some amendments I have offered. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment 2373.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will spend some time discussing the \namendments we have. There is some opposition to our amendment to allow \nthe States to opt out of being required to fund transportation \nenhancements. This does not eliminate the enhancements. What it simply \ndoes is give the State of Colorado or the State of Oklahoma the \nopportunity to say, with roads in such disrepair and 138,000 bridges in \ndisrepair, that we have the ability, if we so choose, to take all of \nthe money, instead of 90 percent, and apply it to solve the problems we \nhave.\n  So it will not force California to not do enhancements. It will not \nforce any State to not do them. It will give them the privilege of \nelecting whether they want to do those enhancements when, in fact, we \nhave such a critical need in terms of roads, highways, and bridges.\n  So the goal of this--and it is important to know where the money \ncomes from. The money is taxes that are collected from individuals in \nColorado and Oklahoma and every other State that are then sent here and \nthen sent back. In my State--I do not know about Colorado--we have \nnever gotten more than 93 percent of what we have sent here. We used to \naverage about 74 percent. But now, as to the money that does come back, \n10 percent has to be spent on enhancements, whether that is sound \nbarriers or walking paths or bicycle paths or numerous other \nenhancements, as under the SAFETEA-LU bill.\n  So what this amendment does, it does not force anybody to not, but it \ngives them the option to fix the problems in their State.\n  I would note that the National Transportation Safety Board notified \nus that last year 13,000 people died on our highways, not because they \nmade a driving error, not because someone else made a driving error, \nnot because they had a problem with their automobile or with their \ntruck, they had the accident because the roads were substandard. \nThirteen thousand people lost their lives.\n  So the question of priority, of whether my department of \ntransportation in Oklahoma ought to have the ability to fix roads and \nbridges instead of building sound barriers ought to be left to us.\n  This amendment is for this year only. It does not eliminate, does not \nchange the law. It just says: We are going to give you the option this \nyear with this money, if your State has needs--and Oklahoma has \nsignificant needs; I know Colorado does because I am there a lot--that \nwe do not necessarily spend it on sound barriers, that we can actually \nspend it on something that is going to save somebody's life. So it does \nnot force anybody to not do enhancements but gives them the right to \nchoose the priority of saving lives over enhancements, if they so \ndesire.\n  The Senator from California made a statement yesterday about what \nthis amendment would do. There is no force in this amendment other than \nto allow. It allows the States the freedom to do what is best for their \ncitizens rather than saying 10 percent of the money they get back has \nto be spent on things that are not going to save lives, are not going \nto enhance safety, but, in fact, are going to enhance aesthetics.\n  So I think it is a commonsense amendment. There is no force; that if \nCalifornia wants to continue to spend 10 percent of their money on \nenhancements, they can. There will be nothing that will keep them from \ndoing that. It will be what the State decides to do rather than what we \ndecide to do.\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\nSince it is money taken from those States, it would seem we would want \nto give the States the option to make the best priority choice for \nthose dollars for their individual citizens.\n  I am very appreciative of Senator Murray's agreement to take two of \nour amendments that are based on transparency to the American public. \nOne requires HUD to report to Congress on homes that are owned and the \ncost to taxpayers so the American people see what the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development is doing. The other is an amendment to \nmake available to the public all the reports--and there are numerous \nreports required in this bill of the Transportation Department--to make \nthose available to the public as well so it is in the light of \ntransparency. I am very thankful for Senator Murray's agreement on \nthose two amendments.\n  I have two other amendments I will talk about when Senator Murray \ngets to the floor. Otherwise, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nare now here on our fifth day of considering the transportation and \nhousing appropriations bill. We do have a number of amendments that \nhave been offered. The Senator from Oklahoma is here. He has the first \n30 minutes under the previous order. I have the following 10 minutes. I \nwould like all Senators to know that if all time is not used, we intend \nto yield back and we expect that these votes may occur as early as \n11:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the Senator from \nWashington, in saying please let's get on with it. This will fill out a \nfull week now. This will be Thursday through Wednesday we have been on \nthe floor. We want to bring these amendments forward. I understand we \nmay not need 40 minutes, and we certainly would like to get these votes \nstarted so we can wrap them up before we break for the scheduled \nlunches.\n  Again, if the Senators could be ready for a vote, we hope as early as \n11:30, no later than 11:40, and we will have a series of votes. We look \nforward to dealing with these amendments and moving on to others.\n  I thank our colleagues for their attention and let's get on with it. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2370, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I believe the desk has a modification to \namendment No. 2370, and I ask unanimous consent for that modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2370), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used for any purpose described in subsection (b) until \n     the date on which the Secretary of Transportation certifies, \n     based on the estimates made under section 9503(d)(1) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of unfunded highway \n     authorizations in relation to net highway receipts (as those \n     terms are defined in that section) for the period of fiscal \n     years 2010 through 2013, that the Highway Trust Fund contains \n     or will contain amounts sufficient to cover all such unfunded \n     highway authorizations for those fiscal years.\n       (b) The purposes referred to in subsection (a) are----\n       (1) transportation museums;\n       (2) scenic beautification projects; and\n       (3) pedestrian or bicycle facility projects.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2371\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about all three of the \namendments I plan on getting votes on. I will give a little summary on \namendment No. 2371.\n  The way the highway trust fund spending is set up now is that if we \nsend your State $100 million, $10 million of that $100 million has to \nbe spent on enhancement projects, regardless of the condition of your \nroads, regardless of the condition of your highways, regardless of the \ncondition of the bridges in your State. All this does is allow States \nto not have to follow that in this, No. 1, tough economic time; No. 2, \nwhen we know highway deaths related to roads and bridges alone account \nfor 13,000 deaths a year. So we will intend to ask for a vote on that. \nIt does not prohibit the States from doing these enhancements, much as \nwas claimed in debate yesterday but, rather, gives an opportunity for \nthe States to make good value judgments about what is in the best \ninterests of their State in terms of highways, roads, and bridges.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2372\n\n  Amendment No. 2372 is an amendment which requires us to prioritize. \nUnbeknownst to most Americans, money that is collected from the \npurchase of your gasoline has been used--$28 million of it, as a matter \nof fact--to fund transportation museums. That may be a great use in a \ntime when we are not in the economic situation and circumstances we \nfind ourselves in today. What this amendment does is say, until we get \nout of the trouble we are in and until the trust fund gets back to \nwhere it needs to be, we shouldn't be prioritizing and we shouldn't be \nearmarking money for transportation museums. It goes back to common \nsense. The money we are collecting in gas taxes ought to be used to \nrepair and build highways and bridges and roads, not fund museums.\n  As a matter of fact, several of the museums that have been funded in \nthe last 5 years are already closed. They came through earmarks. We \nspent millions of dollars. Nobody had any interest in them; \nconsequently, they were closed. In this one bill we have one that has \nbeen earmarked. It may be the right thing to do, but now is not the \nright time to do it.\n  So what this amendment simply does is say that for this year--this \nyear only--we are not going to allow lower priority items such as a \ntransportation museum to displace money that could be used to enhance \nsomebody's safety or protect their life. I don't know what the outcome \non this will be, but I think it will be a telling statement for the \nCongress that if we decide museums\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\nare more important than somebody's life--more important--the priority \nis there--it will show a disconnect in this Congress as to whether we \nare willing to make good priorities with Americans' taxpayer dollars or \ndo we continue to ignore common sense and spend the money the way some \nor one or many individuals would like to do it, without regard to what \nthe original intended purpose for the money was and without regard to \nthe very serious situation we find with our roads, highways, and \nbridges.\n  Senator McCain and I asked the Government Accountability Office to \nlook at where the money was spent over the last 4 years prior to this \nyear, and $3.7 billion of highway money went for transportation \nenhancements, of which museums are one. Granted, it wasn't a lot of \nmoney, but when you take $38 million and apply it to defective bridges \nin Oklahoma, what you can do is fix 75 of our defective bridges--\nbridges that are putting people's lives at risk and money that \nOklahomans paid out that ought to come back and take care of the \nproblems we have. The same for Colorado. The same for Missouri. The \nsame for all these States. We are behind.\n  We have 137,000 or so bridges that are suspect in this country. We \nrecently had an individual in Tulsa, OK, who was seriously injured when \na chunk of concrete fell from a bridge through his windshield. So it \nwasn't the people driving over the bridge; it is the people going under \nthe bridge who are put at risk, simply because we have focused money on \nthings other than highways, bridges, and roads. So it is by law right \nnow that we have to spend 10 percent of that money, and some of it goes \nto museums.\n  All this amendment says is, right now, let's not spend money on \nmuseums and let's fix roads and highways and bridges. We authorized \n$4.1 billion over the last 5 years for transportation enhancement set-\nasides. All of that comes out of the 10 percent mandatory--and I have \nthe other amendment I talked about before.\n  Let me go through what the GAO report said: $850 million had to be \nspent on scenic beautification and landscaping projects. Well, $850 \nmillion could have built a lot of highways in this country. It could \nhave repaired a lot of those 137,000 bridges. Yet we mandated that the \nmoney got spent on something other than roads, highways, and bridges. \nWe allocated $488 million for behavioral research. There is no question \nthat some of that is absolutely necessary in terms of us making \ndecisions. We allocated $224 million for 366 projects to rehabilitate \nor operate historic transportation buildings--$224 million. That is \nhalf of what Oklahoma spends a year on what they get from the trust \nfund, and we did it to preserve historic buildings and transportation \nnovelties rather than spend it on highways, roads, and bridges. We \nallocated $84 million for road-kill prevention, wildlife habitat \nconnectivity; $28 million, as I said, to establish 55 transportation \nmuseums; $19 million to control outdoor advertising.\n  What this GAO report says is we refuse to make the hard choices about \npriorities. All this museum amendment says is not now. For 1 year, \nlet's spend the money we were going to spend on museums and put it into \nreal infrastructure, real highways, real bridges.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2370\n\n  I have one other amendment I wish to discuss--and then I will reserve \nthe remainder of my time and give the chairman her time--and that is \namendment No. 2370. We know, because of the increased price of \ngasoline, and we know because of the economic recession we find \nourselves in, that dollars going into the highway trust fund have been \nadded. As a matter of fact, twice in the last 2 years, we have borrowed \nmoney from our children and grandchildren to keep the trust fund viable \nbecause the taxes coming in off the trust fund have not kept up with \nthe pace of spending we have authorized and subsequently obligated to \nbe spent. We know the highway trust fund is on the brink of insolvency. \nWithin a year, if we don't get the 18-month extension which I think is \nbeing planned, we will go back and steal another $7 billion or $8 \nbillion from our kids to keep this system viable.\n  What this amendment says is, if we are going to do that or until it \nbecomes viable on its own, we should preclude the transportation \nenhancement program. We know we don't have enough money to take care of \nthe very serious problems we have on our roads, on our highways, and \nwith our bridges. Yet we continue to force the States to spend 10 \npercent of their money not on highways, roads or bridges. That doesn't \nmake any sense. So this is a much stronger amendment than my earlier \namendment that says, until the highway trust fund becomes solvent, \nuntil we quit stealing money from our kids and our grandkids and \nactually pay as we go, pay for what we are wanting to do, at least that \n10 percent of the money is going to get spent on real roads, real \nbridges, and real highways, not on enhancements.\n  I know many do not agree, and I am readily perceptive of their \ndisagreement. The fact is, if you go out and poll the American people \nand you ask them: Should we fix the highways that allow 13,000 people a \nyear to die because of the quality of the highway or should we build a \nwalking trail or a sound barrier, they will all say: Fix the highways \nfirst.\n  Come back and do these other things later. Should we build a museum \nwhen we have roads in disrepair? No. They will all say that--unless \nthey are the ones benefiting directly from the money going to an \nearmarked project for a museum.\n  So it is not a question of common sense, and it is not a question of \npriority; it is a question of whether we will break the chain of how \nthings are done here and, in fact, say: American taxpayers, you are \npaying this money every time you pump a gallon of gas, and we are going \nto make sure that goes for roads, bridges, and highways first; and when \nwe get extra money, we will then enhance the areas around or \nsurrounding the highways.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from California will be here \nshortly to respond to a number of these amendments, since they fall \ninto the jurisdiction of her full committee.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has offered three amendments to this bill \nthat are related to transportation. Each of those amendments would \nlimit the ability of States and local governments to spend their \nhighway grants on activities that are eligible for funding under the \nFederal aid highway program.\n  Those limitations would not only apply to funds that have been \nearmarked in this bill. I think Senators should understand they would \nalso apply to the formula grants that go to our States and local \ngovernments, which plan their own transportation investments.\n  The Senator's amendments would take away funding from transportation \nenhancement, especially streetscaping, bike and pedestrian paths, and \nthe mitigation of highway runoff pollution.\n  Today, all of these activities are eligible for funding under the \ncurrent highway authorization law, the SAFETEA-LU Act. Under that act, \ncommunities are required to prepare and provide comprehensive \ntransportation plans in order to receive their Federal highway and \ntransit grants. Those plans have to include the communities' plans for \nbike and pedestrian pathways, because those transportation plans are \nmeant to be comprehensive, and our national policy, which has been \ndebated on the floor of the Senate and the House, has been to recognize \nbike and pedestrian paths as one component of a complete transportation \nsystem. They cannot constitute the largest part of the system but a \nplan that ignores that element is incomplete.\n  When we provide bike paths and walkways, we help keep our families \nand our neighbors safe. Without these paths, many more bicyclists, \npedestrians, people who commute to work that way would compete with \nvehicle traffic. Everybody on a bike or footpath is vulnerable when \nthey are mixed in with heavy traffic. But school-age children are the \nmost vulnerable.\n  When we debated this policy under SAFETEA-LU, we determined that \nbikeways and walkways are an important part and are components of our \ntransportation system for people who cannot afford a car and have to \nwalk to work. People who walk to school are impacted by the Senator's \namendment.\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\n  I don't believe that this bill--the current transportation \nappropriations bill--is an appropriate time that we should be debating \nand changing our highway policy, which is so important to all of our \ncommunities across the country.\n  The chairman of the appropriate committee is on the floor. I know she \nwants to respond. I yield the floor to her at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order right now? How much time \nremains before we vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six-and-a-half minutes remain.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee \nfor setting aside some time for me because, as the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I am concerned about the Coburn \namendment. I want to discuss why.\n  The particular program that the Senator is going after is the \ntransportation enhancements program, created in 1991, in a very \nbipartisan way in the transportation bill. The purpose of the program \nis to encourage investment in some very important priorities for the \nNation. I want to talk about that.\n  I particularly want to say that, on average, this program provided \n$650 million for these important activities each year. I want to point \nout that if you relate that $650 million to jobs, we are talking about \nmany jobs, because $11.5 billion was made available since 1992, and \nthat translates to 400,000 jobs--good-paying jobs, jobs that do \nimportant things, jobs that can't be shipped overseas. And of all the \ntimes to come to the floor and go after a program that is a job creator \nand, in addition, does many important things that actually save lives, \nI don't think this is the time. Frankly, I don't think there is any \ntime for that.\n  For example, one of the uses of these funds is that we try to stop \nhighway runoff--runoff that has very harmful chemicals and pollution in \nit, and it goes right into waterways. That is something we should not \nstop. That is something we owe to our children, to protect them from \npollution.\n  We also use the funds to reduce vehicle-caused wildlife mortality. \nAnybody who has seen the result of a collision with a deer or other \nlarge animal, as I have in the county where I have lived for 40 years, \nknows you are dealing with danger for all the parties involved. Why on \nEarth would we come down here and strike the funding for a program that \nprotects our kids from pollution and saves lives by making sure that \nour local people do the right thing and make sure these animals don't \nhave ready access or easy access to our freeways?\n  Let me put this into exact numbers. I know my friend is an exacting \ndebater, and he is a great debater. A study under the National \nCooperative Highway Research Program estimated that each year wildlife \ncollisions are responsible for 200 human deaths, 29,000 injuries, and \nmore than $1 billion in property damage. So even with the funding that \nwe have, this is an issue, and we don't want to make matters worse.\n  I am going to be specific. In Washington State, $75,000 in TE funds, \nwhich my friend wants to strike, provided in 1999 for radio collars for \nelk and an alert system for motorists to reduce elk-vehicle collisions \non Highway 101 in the Sequim Valley. As a result of the project, elk-\nvehicle collisions have dropped from an average of 2.5 every year to \nonly 1 in the past 7 years. Why on Earth do we want to pull money from \na fund that saves lives?\n  In Colorado, $108,000 in TE funds were provided in 2007 to remove \nbroken one-way deer gates and replace them with escape ramps and extend \nthe fencing, which was first set up in 1980, to guide wildlife off of \nU.S. 550. So those funds certainly are improving safety and saving \nlives.\n  Bicycle paths, pedestrian facilities are provided, and the chairman \nspoke about that. In Georgia, TE funds helped transform the 5th Street \nbridge span over Atlanta's I-75/I-85 into a pedestrian/bicycle-friendly \npark, hovering 17 feet above the highway that safely connects buildings \nof Georgia Tech's campus. The bridge was widened to incorporate bicycle \npaths, landscaping, lamp posts, trellises, and benches.\n  I guess there is a different view of what is essential. I think \nsaving lives is essential. These funds are used to save lives. Also, if \nI could say it, because I know my friend doesn't think it should be a \npriority to beautify our highways, freeways and roads, I point out that \nthe taxpayers of this country care about their communities, care about \nhow their highways and freeways and their roads look. It is a big \ndifference when you have a highway and a freeway that is taken care of, \njust as we take care of our homes. That is our job.\n  In Illinois, a tunnel was constructed beneath the busy Center Grove \nRoad that will provide safer passage for students walking between their \nschool and a nearby sports complex. The tunnel was constructed with the \nhelp of TE funds--the very funds my friend wants to cut.\n  In Plymouth, IN, they can now enjoy 2.2 miles of paved trails that \nmeander throughout the community, connecting schools, parks, rivers, \nand neighborhoods. And a TE award of $1.2 million helped fund the \ntrail. It was matched by local dollars.\n  In Minneapolis, TE funds helped construct the Midtown Greenway \nproject that provides a safe bicycle commuter freeway for up to 4,500 \ncyclists a day.\n  In Oklahoma, new and existing businesses and shops are thriving after \na streetscaping project in downtown Norman. TE funds helped to renovate \nthe downtown area, which included improvements in historical lighting.\n  I hope we will vote against the series of Coburn amendments. I think \nthey hurt, they will stop creation of jobs, and they will make us less \nsafe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think, first, the Senator doesn't understand amendment \n2371. It doesn't eliminate any money. It allows the States to opt out \nof the enhancement if, in fact, it is better.\n  The Senator talks about life. With 13,000 people killed on bad roads \nlast year, that didn't have anything to do with driving skills or the \ncars or anything else, other than we didn't put good roads into place. \nIt is a question about priorities.\n  There will be no job loss at all. There will be no decrease in \nspending under amendment No. 2371. What it simply says is that you \ndon't have to take 10 percent of your funds anymore and spend it on \nenhancements, if you know you have people who are going to die because \nyou don't fix a road.\n  She talks about 200 deaths versus 13,000 deaths. There are 137,000 \ndeficient bridges. Should we fix the roads or build a sound barrier? \nWhich one is important? Should we fix the roads or build another \nmuseum? Should we fix the roads or enhance walkways? It is not as if we \ndon't have walkways and trails. The question is, where is the greatest \nneed? And will we make prudent judgments about giving freedom back to \nthe States and say if, in fact, they don't want to enhance in this \ntough economic time, they don't have to? It doesn't preclude California \nor Washington State from doing enhancements. They still can. It just \nsays that in those States that have significant critical infrastructure \nneeds and roads that are at high risk, under amendment No. 2371, they \nget a chance to opt out and do what is best for their citizens and \ntheir State, and to fix some of the bridges, instead of building a \nwalkway or a bicycle trail. They will be able to fix a bridge or fix a \nroad and take a curve out where people are dying, instead of building a \nmuseum. It is not onerous. The arguments are specious.\n  The fact is, we are giving back to the States and saying they can \nprioritize this. If you think enhancements are not as important as the \nrisks you have on your highways, you can opt out--this year only--and \nput it into roads, bridges, and highways.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to finish my point. The Department of \nTransportation in every State is not run by idiots. Their No. 1 goal is \nfor the protection and enhancement of their citizens. We are now saying \nto Oklahoma or Colorado or Delaware, you don't get to make the decision \nabout what the priority is because 10 percent of the money you get has \nto be spent this way.\n  All this is saying is for this year alone--for this year alone--you \ncan opt out of certain provisions. Some you\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\nmay want to do, some you may not want to do. But if you choose to put \n$7 million in to take a curve out of a road that is killing people \nversus building a bike trail or a sound barrier, you can do it. You are \nactually going to save more lives. It will make no difference in the \nnumber of jobs created or saved. It has no effect on that whatsoever. \nThe exact same amount of money is going to be spent, and it is all \ngoing to be spent on construction of what the highway trust fund was--I \nam not saying these are not good ideas. I am saying it is the priority \nof placing them ahead of safety and improving roads, improving bridges. \nHow do we explain to the family of the person who was injured in Tulsa, \nOK, that we are going to build a sound barrier rather than the bridge \nwhere a piece of concrete fell through his windshield and critically \ninjured him? That noise is more important than that individual's life?\n  I say give the freedom back to the States for this one year to not \nrequire a mandatory 10-percent allocation to enhancements. Most of the \nStates probably will not take that. But I can tell you, in my State, \nwhere we have the second or third largest number of deficient bridges, \nwe are going to build bridges, we are going to fix the broken bridges, \nwe are going to save people's lives, and we are going to save more \npeople's lives.\n  By the way, our taxpayers put the money into the highway trust fund \nfor this with every gallon of gas. Oklahoma has never gotten more than \n94 percent back and over the last 20 years has averaged less than 80 \npercent of what we send here. So it is highly insulting in this year of \ntough, difficult times for us to get less than what we send up, one, \nand then say: 10 percent of it you cannot spend on the greatest need in \nyour State; that we know better, Washington knows better. Washington \ndoes not know better.\n  We do not preclude any of the enhancements anywhere else. If the \nState departments of transportation want to do every enhancement and go \nto the 10 percent, they can go to it. What we are saying is, if your \nState has a need that is critical to saving people's lives, maybe you \ndon't build a sound barrier right now but, in fact, you fix the road or \nyou repair the bridge. It is common sense.\n  The question will be, Do we do what is best for the American people \nor do we stand with the dogma that says we know better? Can we trust \nGovernors and State departments of transportation to make good \ndecisions for the safety of their individual citizens in their States? \nI think we can.\n  I am not excited about what will be the outcome of this vote, but I \ntell you that this kind of common sense--it does not eliminate it. It \njust says we should do that.\n  To save the Chamber time, I will ask unanimous consent to withdraw--\nMr. President, I want Chairman Murray to hear this, if she will. I \nwould ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 2370 which puts a \nlimit until the trust fund is stable. I will stop that. I will withdraw \nit, if I can have unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. We will spend the time voting on something I don't think \nwill be adopted anyway.\n  On amendment No. 2371, none of the claims the Senator from California \nmade are accurate. They are not accurate. There will be no decrease in \njobs. There will actually be the opposite of what she said--enhancement \nand saving lives. There will be a real ability for the States to make \nthe best decisions for their citizens.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 2374, offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2374 and 2377\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have talked with the Senator from \nOklahoma, and two of the amendments he has offered, No. 2374 and No. \n2377, are amendments the committee agrees to. I ask unanimous consent \nthat both of these amendments be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2374 and 2377) were agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2371\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is No. 2371, and there \nwill be 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we just had the debate. All it does is \nallow States to opt out, if they find critical infrastructure needs, \nfrom the mandatory 10-percent enhancement rule.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senator does not describe his \namendment properly. I ask colleagues to read it. The amendment says:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     implement section 133(d)(2) of title 23, United States Code.\n\n  That means none of the funds could be used for this very important \npart of our transportation program which has created 400,000 jobs since \n1992. This is not the time to cut these good jobs. This is not the time \nto say to the States: In your purpose, you can do whatever you want, \nbut then in the real amendment they cannot get any Federal funds \nanymore to keep wildlife off the freeways, they cannot get funds \nanymore to do highway beautification, they cannot get funds anymore to \nstop runoff from highways that will pollute our waterways.\n  I say the purpose may be what the Senator says, but because he is \nforced into doing this on an appropriations bill, he says none of the \nfunds can be used for these TE programs, and that will cause injuries \nand death.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the amendment is very carefully written so \nit will not allow the enforcement of administration of funds. If you \nwill carefully read public law--that is how we got it germane--it does \nnot allow the enforcement. It doesn't mean they can't do it. The money \ncan still go out. If you still want to do the enhancements, you can. It \nsimply says you may not have to if you don't want to.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 13,000 people died on American roads last \nyear because of the quality of the roads and bridges. We have spent $48 \nmillion in the last 4 years on museums, some of which are already \nclosed. The money we collect from taxpayers should be prioritized to \nbuild roads, bridges, and highways. This amendment is a simple \namendment. It says we should be spending right now, this next year \nonly, no money for museums until we get the roads back.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield my 1 minute to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, when you take the train up the Northeast \ncorridor and the train stops in Wilmington, DE, you are in the middle \nof what was, 60 years ago, a vibrant shipbuilding area. We built ships \nto help win World War II. When the war was over, what had been a \nvibrant shipbuilding industry turned into an industrial wasteland.\n  Fifteen years ago we began transforming it, and today it is river \nwalks, it is places for people to live, work, recreate, we have parks--\nit is a beautiful place, an urban wildlife refuge. We are going to \nbuild a children's science museum there as well. It costs $11 million. \nWe raised the money from our local sources.\n  In this bill is the HUD funding, $190,000, to help us complete the \npackage. It is a small amount of money for a great payoff for a lot of \nkids, tens of thousands of kids who will visit that science museum, who \nwill be excited about science and, hopefully, will go on to have \ncareers as scientists, inventors, and engineers. I ask you to help me \ndefeat this amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on amendment No. 2366 offered by \nthe Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would let all fellow Senators know, we \nhave two more votes remaining. If the Senators would allow the speakers \nto speak, we will be able to move through these expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remaining amendment votes be 10 \nminutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would urge all Members to stay around and \nvote and we can get on with the business and anybody who wants to have \nlunch can have lunch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, very simply, this amendment would allow \nlaw-abiding Amtrak passengers to securely transport firearms in their \nchecked baggage. Under current practices, all the American domestic \nairlines permit firearms in their checked luggage. Other American \npassenger railroads also allow checked firearms.\n  Only the federally subsidized Amtrak prohibits law-abiding American \ncitizens from exercising their second amendment right in checked \nbaggage. On April 2 of this year, the Senate passed a similar amendment \nto the budget with 63 votes in favor of the Wicker Amendment and only \n35 against.\n  During the time since then, Amtrak has made no efforts to respond to \nthis overwhelming bipartisan vote. It is my hope that we get a similar \noverwhelming bipartisan vote today which results in Amtrak ending this \nunfair practice. I urge a vote in favor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would ask all our Senators to pay attention to what we \nare being asked to vote on. We did vote on a similar amendment during \nthe budget debate. But these amendments are very different. The \namendment to the budget resolution never put Amtrak's funding at risk. \nThat amendment would have only prohibited an extra reserve fund from \ngoing to Amtrak if it did not allow firearms.\n  The amendment we are now considering does something much more \ndrastic, it will put at risk Amtrak's appropriations. In order to \nreceive any Federal funding under this amendment, Amtrak would have 6 \nmonths to build a process for checking and tracking firearms, it would \nhave to find the manpower necessary to screen and guard firearms, and \nwould have to purchase the equipment necessary.\n  There is nothing in the underlying appropriations to pay for any of \nthat. So this amendment is going to put a severe burden on them, and if \nthey do not comply, Amtrak will shut down.\n  I think it is very important that we be careful what we are voting \non. I ask my colleagues to oppose the Wicker amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Wicker \namendment.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, this should be a noncontroversial \namendment. It simply retains in present law the current community \nservice requirement which Congress passed into law for public housing \ntenants who are able-bodied over a decade ago. The House has tried to \ntake out this requirement. It is a very modest 8 hours per month of \ncommunity service for able-bodied tenants. Automatically exempted are \nfolks over 62, folks who have a disability, caretakers, folks who meet \nthe TANF work requirements, et cetera. It is a modest, reasonable work \nrequirement which has been in the law for years. I urge all Members to \nretain it through this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Louisiana is offering an amendment that \nwould require continued enforcement of public service for people who \nlive in public housing. I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First, \nit is current law.

Madam President, we have made great progress on the \ntransportation and housing appropriations bill, and I thank all \nSenators for working with us. We have several amendments left to do.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that Senator Landrieu be given 5 minutes \nto speak on amendment No. 2365, followed by Senator Gregg with 20 \nminutes equally divided on amendment No. 2361.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, at this time, then, we will move to \nthose two amendments. We have several other Senators who have notified \nus they wish to offer amendments.\n  For the information of all Members, we hope to have votes on at least \nthe two amendments I have just spoken of, the Landrieu and Gregg \namendments, at 2:30. If there are other amendments we are able to move \nat that time, we will then vote on those as well. But, again, we are \nmaking great progress. We have a few amendments left, and I urge any \nSenator who has an amendment, you have a few hours left to get it to us \nso we can work it out.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2365\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I appreciate the chairman allowing me \nthe opportunity to offer this amendment, and also working with Senator \nBond, who I understand supports this amendment as well.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf not only of myself but Senator \nHarkin, Senator Hutchison, Senator Grassley, and Senator Cornyn. So we \nhave a strong bipartisan group of Senators who are coming to the floor \nto ask our colleagues to approve an amendment that has to do with a \nchange and modification in the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram that has been put in place to help communities prepare for and \nrecover from disasters. This amendment is going to affect all \ncommunities in a positive way across the country that received \ncommunity development block grant funding and in a very significant \nway. If this amendment is passed by this body today and continues in \nthis bill, the communities that have received special allocations of \ncommunity development block grant money will be able to use those funds \nto match other Federal funds available.\n\n  This is the way the normal Community Development Block Grant Program \nhas operated, I understand, since its inception. As my colleagues can \nsee from this chart, in every single situation, except for two, in the \nlast 17 years, that has been the case. So my amendment is basically \nallowing the floods and natural disasters of 2008 to be included in \nthis effort; in other words, to say, if you received community \ndevelopment block grant funding, you can use those funds as a local and \nState match for other Federal funding.\n  This is important for two reasons. One, it has been done in that way \nthe\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\nlast 17 years for good reason. For good reason because these \ncommunities, you could argue, have even greater challenges than normal, \nconsidering that in any time it is tough to provide housing or to build \nroads or to help their small businesses get back on their feet, but \nafter a catastrophic disaster it is sometimes 5, if not 10, times \nharder. So why restrict their money at a time when they need the \ngreatest flexibility? That is all this amendment does.\n  Again, this is the way it has been done in general community \ndevelopment block grants since the beginning of the program. It is the \nway it was done with disaster community development in every case. Our \namendment would simply make that uniform policy for the States affected \nby the 2008 disasters.\n  This will be a great help to Texas that is still recovering from the \nstorms of Ike. I will be visiting and having a field hearing through my \nCommittee on Small Business as well as Disaster. Senator Hutchison will \nbe attending that field hearing to visit Galveston just on Friday. So \napproval of this amendment would bring a lot of hope and encouragement \nto the people on the Gulf Coast, not just in Louisiana but, as I said, \nin Texas as well. California will be benefited as well as Iowa and some \nof the States that were affected by the floods.\n  So, again, this is amendment No. 2365. I think my explanation is \nsufficient about what this amendment does and what a great help it will \nbe to mayors and parish officials and county officials struggling to \nrebuild and what a smart way to use and to leverage moneys to get these \ncommunities rebuilt quickly in these very difficult economic times.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the CDBG allocation chart to which I \nreferred to be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            CDBG Allocations\n\n                       (Prepared by Ben Billings)\n\n                                                 FUNDING SUMMARY\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                            Total CDBG     First        Second\n                   Rank                                 State                received    allocation   allocation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.........................................

Madam President, I see my good friend, Senator Gregg. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator offered the amendment?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I believe I have, but if I have not, let me submit \nit at this time. It is amendment No. 2365.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana, [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Cornyn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2365.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with. I suggest we don't have to \nread the whole amendment and we will leave it lying until we can vote \non it later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Disaster Relief and Recovery Supplemental \n                       Appropriations Act, 2008)\n\n       On page 318, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 234.  The matter under the heading ``community \n     development fund'', under the heading ``Community Planning \n     and Development'', under the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING \n     AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT'' in chapter 10 of title I of division \n     B of the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and \n     Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (Public Law 110-329; 122 \n     Stat. 3601) is amended by striking ``: Provided further, That \n     none of the funds provided under this heading may be used by \n     a State or locality as a matching requirement, share, or \n     contribution for any other Federal program''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2361\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2361.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. Coburn, and Mr. Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2361.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of stimulus funds for self-congratulatory \n  signage that allows lawmakers to promote their spending of taxpayer \n                     dollars on stimulus projects)\n\n       On page 194, after line 23, add the following:\n       Sec. 1___. (a) This section may be cited as the ``Axe the \n     Stimulus Plaques Act''.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the \n     funds made available under the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) may be used for \n     physical signage to indicate that a project is being funded \n     by that Act.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, this is an amendment that shouldn't have \nto be offered, to be very honest with you. Today there are a lot of \nprojects being pursued under the stimulus package, and every one of \nthose projects that is a road project, unfortunately, finds itself \nhaving to put up a sign that says this is a good project being paid for \nwith tax dollars. These are self-congratulatory signs. They are \npolitical signs. They are there so lawmakers can pat themselves on the \nback and say: Wow, look at this project we are doing.\n  But these signs cost money. Actually, when you add them all up, they \ncost a lot of money. They are a total waste of money. There is no \nreason to have these signs by every project that occurs in America. It \nis projected there will be somewhere around 20,000 to 22,000 projects. \nThe signs cost about $400 in New Hampshire, and they cost as much as--I \nthink it was around $3,000 in New Jersey for each sign. New Hampshire \nis a little more efficient. I suspect in North Carolina they probably \ndon't cost much more than $400, but if you add that up, we are talking \nabout a cost of somewhere between $6 million and $15 million being \nspent on signs. That is an inexcusable waste of money. That money could \nbe used for something valuable, for example, rather than a sign.\n  The practical effect of this is, the signs should say ``Wasting \ntaxpayers' dollars; project funded by the future generations of \nAmericans,'' if they are going to be honest signs. But I am not asking \nfor any signs. There shouldn't be any signs.\n  Instead, the highway departments across this country are being \nbasically required to put up these signs as the projects are built. In \nfact, there was one example in New Hampshire--there were lots of \nexamples in New Hampshire, but there was one community in New Hampshire \nwhere the leadership of that community said: We don't want to put the \nsigns up because we think they are a waste of money, and they were \ntold, if they didn't put up the signs, they wouldn't get the money. \nThat is happening all across the country.\n  So this amendment should be unnecessary. It should be obvious--\nobvious--that we don't have to put these signs up; that we shouldn't be \nspending money in this way. If we are going to spend $6 million to $18 \nmillion to $20 million on something, let's spend it on what actually \nproduces some value rather than creates a self-congratulatory event for \nthe local political leaders and for the Congress. We do enough self-\ncongratulating around here. We shouldn't have to make the taxpayers pay \nfor it. Instead, we should be a little more responsible with the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  It is a very simple amendment. That is why I am not going to spend a \nlot of time on it, because I think it is so obvious it should be \naccepted and passed, that it should occur. It is one of those \namendments where you sort of scratch\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\nyour head and say: Why did we even have to offer this? Why should we \nhave to offer this amendment saying you don't put up signs spending \ntaxpayers' dollars to congratulate yourself for a project the taxpayers \npaid for. But we do, of course, in this instance because the Department \nhas insisted on these signs across America.\n  That is what the amendment does. I reserve the remainder of my time, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise in opposition to Senator Gregg's \namendment and I wish to say why I think there are many reasons not to \nsupport it. I started off my political career as a county supervisor. \nIt is through that agency that when we are undertaking a major road \nproject, we put up a sign first of all to let people know work is \nunderway and what it is about because a lot of times people don't know \nif it is going to be a month-long project or a day-long project. We \nwould put up a sign to let people know who is funding the program, to \nlet people know whether it is a State project, a local project. No big \ndeal. We did this--and we do this--under Republican leadership, under \nDemocratic leadership. It is information.\n  I think the true source of this amendment is a frustration. This is \nmy own opinion. I am sure my friend absolutely would not agree with me, \nbut it is my sense that there is a frustration by the people who voted \nno on the Economic Recovery Act, the stimulus bill; there is a \nfrustration that it is working. They predicted gloom and doom.\n  Let me tell you what is happening in this great Nation of ours. We \nhave a long way to go to get jobs up and running, there is no question \nabout it, but the stimulus bill has already saved or created a million \njobs. Let me tell you what else. We are looking at growth for the first \ntime in this economy. When we were faced with the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression--and I know it because the Presiding Officer had \nthe same issue as she looked at what to do--we had to decide whether it \nmade sense to do some job creation here, and we didn't get many \nRepublican votes, but thank goodness we got three. Thanks to those good \npeople for joining us because I can tell you this: In my home State, we \nare starting to see it happen. We are going to get tens of billions of \ndollars.\n  So now I think the issue is a frustration with the fact that we won \nthat vote and we got that done and those jobs are being created as we \nspeak. Slowly but surely we are being lifted out of this darkness.\n  Here we have a small amendment, I agree. You know what. If it passes, \nno harm. But I have to say, why on Earth would you want to hide from \nthe American people the fact that the recovery package we passed is \nputting people to work? People want to know. Not everybody has a \ncomputer. Not everybody is going to follow up on the transparency this \nadministration has put in place. They are showing that every day it is \nworking, where it is happening, and so on and so forth--not by name but \nhow many jobs are created and the like.\n  It seems to me, if you are improving our highways, our transit \nsystems, our water infrastructure, our government buildings, and the \nsource of funding is the stimulus program, the Economic Recovery Act, \nlet people know. Why would we prohibit funds under this act from being \nused for these signs that simply inform taxpayers that a project is \nbeing made possible by taxpayer dollars from the stimulus program? I \nthink it is a question of making our people more informed, giving them \ninformation.\n  My friend says it costs money to do a sign. I couldn't agree more. \nEverything costs money. It costs money to do a sign. Guess what. People \nwork in those places where those signs are made. People proudly work on \nthose jobs and get paid a good amount and can support their families. \nSo this is a jobs program. Part of it is to tell the people, yes, the \nfunding for this project is paid for by the stimulus program, the \neconomic recovery program, and, yes, people were paid to work in places \nthat make these signs. I don't think it is logical to keep this \ninformation from the people. What purpose is served? It is going to \nsave a little bit of money, but the fact is, the purpose of the \nstimulus bill was to create jobs, and you are going to take away jobs \nfrom people who are making those signs. I think this is an antijobs \namendment we have before us.\n  Look, the Recovery Act is working. I think it is frustrating those \nwho predicted it would never work, and they will predict it will never \nwork until they have their last breath because that is the nature of \npolitics; you have to spin it one way or another. But we know the \neconomy is turning around. We also know we need to create many more \njobs, and this amendment will not create one more job. I don't believe \nit will. The fact that we are doing some good things with this funding, \nincluding making buildings more energy efficient, upgrading flood \nprotection, let the American people know that their funds are being \nspent well. I think that is money spent well.\n  Some people may see a program, by the way, I say to my good friend, \nand they don't like it. They say: Why on Earth are they using my money \nto do this particular project? Let them know. Let them know. So if they \nlike what they see, they understand where it came from. If they don't \nlike what they see, they understand where it came from.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gregg amendment. I agree with my \nfriend, it is not a major amendment, but I think it speaks to the point \nthat the American people should have an easy way of knowing where these \nfunds are going and the projects they are building. We certainly had a \nbig enough battle on the floor of the Senate--oh, boy, did we have a \nbattle--trying to find those three votes. So it passed. It was \ncontroversial. Some in America don't support it; others in America do. \nI think they should have a right to know if a project is being brought \nto them by way of this important bill that I think is helping turn our \neconomy around.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the issue isn't the stimulus package, \nalthough I have reservations about that. I would be happy to debate \nthat with the Senator from California at some length because I think \nadding almost three-quarters of a trillion dollars of new debt to our \nchildren's backs on a package that will spend out through 2019 is \nhardly stimulus, especially when we see only 20 percent of that package \nwill spend out by the end of this year, and maybe 50 percent next year.\n  We had Chairman Bernanke saying, essentially, that we are out of the \nrecession. That all comes from borrowing that our children will have to \npay. In my opinion, it is not fair to pass that debt on to our \nchildren, that $787 billion. That is not the debate. This debate is \nabout whether we should be congratulating ourselves with tax dollars. \nIt is self-aggrandizement at the expense of the taxpayer. This is going \nout and buying advertising to promote ourselves and having the taxpayer \npay for it.\n  We can clearly spend these dollars more efficiently doing something \nelse. Sure, it is not a lot of dollars, but when we add it all up, $18 \nmillion is a lot of money. We can do something more constructive \nbesides putting up a sign that says we are wonderful because we are \nspending their money. If we want to say we are doing great things for \nthem, we can say here is a sign telling them that. But rather than \nhaving the people pay for that sign and telling them they are going to \nhave to pay for it, let's have the Democratic Senatorial Committee or \nthe Republican Senatorial Committee pay for that sign. Let's do that if \nwe think it is that important as a piece of political promotion. But it \nis not. I don't think the Democratic Senatorial Committee would pay for \nthat sign because they would see it as a waste of money. I don't speak \nfor them, but I don't think the Republican Senatorial Committee would \npay for this either. I would recommend that they not do it.\n  These signs are a waste of money. Do they create jobs? Well, actually \nthe signs in New Hampshire are made in prisons. They cost money because \nthe materials cost money. I guess that is why we get them for $300. In \nNew York,\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\nit is $3,000 a sign. As a practical matter, I don't think we can argue \nthat making these signs is somehow stimulating the economy. All it is \ndoing is saying: Hey, we are wonderful; we are going to take your money \nand use it to tell you what a wonderful job we are doing with your \nmoney. It is not fair or appropriate.\n  I hope people will support the amendment. As has been mentioned by \nthe Senator from California, this is not a major amendment, but it is \none that states an attitude toward how we spend money. I think it is \nimportant in that context.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I will have a motion momentarily. I will \nwait for the manager of the bill to come on the floor.\n  I will be offering a motion to recommit the bill back to the \nAppropriations Committee at last year's spending level. On the front of \nthis bill, it says that last year's spending level was at a level which \nincluded last year's spending, plus the stimulus money. So when they \nsay this year's spending level, it looks as if there is a huge cut, \nwhen in fact, there is actually a 23-percent increase in this year's \nspending bill over last year's.\n  So the motion I am about to make is asking to report the bill back to \nthe committee, where the committee can make whatever specific \nrecommendations within that level but to do that at last year's \nspending level.\n  I have heard the rhetoric from politicians in the House, Senate, and \nthe President talking about how serious a problem we have with the \ndeficit and how serious a problem we have with the debt in our country. \nThat is one of the reasons you saw hundreds of thousands of people on \nthe Mall here this last weekend. People are really concerned about the \ndirection of our country. We have heard economic experts talking about \nAmerica actually approaching its borrowing capacity. If our country \never reaches its borrowing capacity, it will be an economic disaster. \nIt would be like a business having many expenses and no cash in the \nbank. The bank and all its lenders saying: Sorry, we are not giving you \nany more money.\n  Well, we owe people from all over the world. We owe sovereign wealth \nfunds. We owe China, Japan, European countries and other sovereign \nwealth funds all over the world. They hold a lot of our debt. The more \nwe continue to borrow, the more we become beholden to these other \ncountries. And when the next trillion dollars needs to be borrowed, \nwhat if these other countries say to us: No, we are not going to do it. \nThe other thing they could also say is: Yes, we will give you that next \ntrillion dollars. We will loan the money to you, but it is going to be \nat a higher interest than you want to pay. And by the way, the other \ndebt we also hold that you owe us, we are going to raise the interest \non that.\n  You see, we are not going to be in a position to say: No, that is not \nexactly what we want to do. The more debt we run up, the less of a \nposition we will be in as a country to be able to bargain. We literally \ncannot sustain the level of debt we are developing here in the United \nStates.\n  I see the pages down in front of us here--this younger generation. \nThe younger generations across our country are being saddled with the \ndebt this Congress, this President, the past President, and past \nCongresses have run up. Unfortunately, instead of slowing that \nborrowing down, we are increasing it at a faster and faster rate.\n  So this is a very simple motion. This just says: Let's start taking \nthese appropriations bills and let's at least start freezing spending. \nThat is basically what this motion suggests. It just says: Freeze \nspending.\n  By the way, a lot of the programs that are in this bill were already \ndramatically increased in the stimulus bill. So not only did we \nincrease last year over the previous year with the regular \nappropriations process, we then added money to the stimulus bill on top \nof that.\n  So what did they do this year? Instead of being fiscally responsible \nand saying: Let's at least freeze spending--which I will bet the \nAmerican people would even suggest since we are in tough economic \ntimes, that maybe we should do a little haircut and cut spending a \nlittle bit--no, no, the majority has said we are actually going to \nincrease the level of spending in this bill by 23 percent, way above \ninflation, and this is at a time in our country when we cannot afford \nit. So I think this is a place to start showing some fiscal \nresponsibility, and there will be other opportunities where we can as \nwell.\n  We all know entitlement spending is out of control in this country. \nWe all know that needs to be addressed. Medicare and Medicaid alone can \nbankrupt the country. The President talked about that the other night. \nThat is one of the reasons we need to actually get entitlements under \ncontrol in our health care bill--which, by the way, none of the health \ncare bills do.\n  We need to get entitlement spending under control, but we also need \nto get what is called discretionary spending, or these annual \nappropriations bills, under control as well. We are not talking about \nsmall amounts of money anymore. Even though the entitlements are the \nbiggest part of the budget, the discretionary or the annual spending \nbills are a very significant amount of money these days.\n  As I mentioned before, this year's bill is a 23-percent increase over \nlast year's. The committee report says it isn't, that it is actually a \ncut from last year. But let me explain exactly how they do that. They \ntook last year's bill and added on the money we spent in the stimulus \nbill to last year's bill. They say that is what we spent last year, so \nthat this year we are going to spend less than we did in the \ncombination of those two bills. They call that a cut in spending. Well, \nthat is phony Washington math. That is how we end up with the kinds of \ndeficits and the debt we have in this country. People claim a cut in \nspending when it is actually, if you compare apples with apples, a 23-\npercent increase over last year.\n  So I think it is time. It really is time. Republicans and Democrats \nshould join together in thinking about not even the next generation, \nbut let's think about today. Let's think about what we are doing to \nthis country today. Let's start showing some fiscal responsibility \naround here. Let's start joining together as Americans in not running \nup this massive amount of government debt. Let's start saying no to \nsome of the special interests that come into our office. Let's start by \nsaying that.\n  So, Madam President, I have a motion at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] moves to recommit the \n     bill (H.R. 3288) to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate with \n     changes that reduce the aggregate level of appropriations \n     in the Act for fiscal year 2010 by $12,713,000,000 from \n     the level currently in the Act.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. So just to summarize, this is a motion to recommit the \nbill back to the Appropriations Committee. It does not take away the \npower of the Appropriations Committee. It does not say that it cuts any \none individual program. The Appropriations Committee would have the \nauthority to be able to put its priorities within the bill. But it does \nsay we are not going to spend more money than we spent last year. That \nis, very simply, what it says. We are going to freeze the level of \nspending to last year instead of having a 23-percent increase over last \nyear.\n  To reiterate, in the stimulus bill last year, tens of billions of \ndollars were added to these very same programs that are in this \nspending bill. So I believe the responsible thing to do is for us to \nvote on this motion and to show we are really serious about controlling \nthe debt and the deficit in the United States of America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2403\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness before the Senate be set aside in order to consider amendment \nNo. 2403.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2403.\n\n       Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \n     further reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out the Brownfields \nEconomic Development Initiative program administered by the Department \n                   of Housing and Urban Development)\n\n       On page 318, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 2___.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used to carry out the Brownfields Economic Development \n     Initiative program administered by the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment is very simple. It \nprohibits, as recommended by the President, the use of funds under this \nact to carry out the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative grant \nprogram that is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  In May of this year, President Obama released a list of 121 programs \nthat he recommended be terminated or reduced. One of the programs the \nPresident recommended for termination is the Brownfields Economic \nDevelopment Initiative.\n  The administration stated specifically that this grant program is \nextremely small relative to other programs that address this need. They \nadded that local governments have access to other public and private \nfunds that can address this same purpose.\n  In justification for the termination, the administration wrote--and I \nquote from the document ``Terminations, Reductions and Savings, Budget \nof the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2010,'' that is issued by the \nOffice of Management and Budget. In other words, it is a number of \nterminations and reductions that the administration wants carried out, \nwith justification for doing so.\n  So far I have had amendments on several of these and they have all \nbeen overridden. Our amendments have not carried and I imagine I will \nlose this also. The moral is why didn't OMB stop this? Because clearly \nit is being totally disregarded by the appropriators. The American \npeople pay attention to the President's recommendations. But now I have \nhad a number of amendments that have been in keeping with the \nPresident's request--the same President who said we will go line by \nline in the appropriations bills and eliminate those that are \nunnecessary.\n  Again, the Office of Management and Budget has said:\n\n       The Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) is a \n     competitive grant program whose purposes are served through \n     much larger and more flexible Federal programs. BEDI is \n     designed to assist cities with the redevelopment of \n     abandoned, idled, and under-used industrial and commercial \n     facilities where expansion and redevelopment is burdened by \n     real or potential environmental contamination. These funds \n     are targeted for redevelopment of brownfield sites for the \n     purposes of economic development and job creation. While \n     these are very important objectives, the program is very \n     small, and local governments have access to other public and \n     private funds, including the much larger Community \n     Development Block Grant (CDBG). The 2010 Budget funds CDBG as \n     $4.5 billion, or 14 percent above the 2009 enacted level.\n\n  We are talking about trying to reduce spending and the CDBG program \nis now 14 percent, $4.5 billion, above 2009-enacted levels.\n\n       A 1999 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report (RCED-\n     99-86) found that about $469 million was planned and $413 \n     million in Federal funds were obligated for brownfields \n     activities in 1997 and 1998. Of the planned total, BEDI \n     appropriations ($25 million) contributed just five percent of \n     the planned expenditure.\n       By terminating this program, the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development is also able to reduce the administrative \n     workload associated with managing a small and duplicative \n     program. Focusing staff on higher impact and higher return \n     activities is a priority for the agency.\n\n  I am sure that the opponents of my amendment will argue that the \nSenate did not include funding for this program in the underlying bill. \nThe committee report states that ``The Committee does not recommend an \nappropriation for the Brownfield Redevelopment program, consistent with \nthe budget request. The Committee notes that other Federal \nappropriations are available for the same purpose through the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Communities may also use CDBG funds to \nredevelop Brownfield's sites''\n  If that is the case, and the committee agrees with the President that \nBrownfield Redevelopment under HUD is duplicative, then why does the \ncommittee report also contain three specific earmarks totaling $1.3 \nmillion for the redevelopment of Brownfields properties as Economic \nDevelopment Initiatives? It makes no sense. In here, despite the \ncommittee saying they are eliminating the program, we have $600,000 for \nthe redevelopment of Brownfields property into a business park in \nCincinnati, OH; $500,000 for the redevelopment of Brownfields \nproperties in Waterbury, CT; $200,000 for Brownfield redevelopment in \nPittsburgh, PA.\n  Americans are hurting. The Nation's unemployment rate is nearly 10 \npercent, the deficit for this year is estimated to be $1.6 trillion, \nthe projected 10-year deficit jumped from $7.1 trillion to $9.1 \ntrillion, our public debt is expected to reach $12.1 trillion by mid-\nOctober. When is it going to stop?\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to listen to the American people. The \nAmerican people are rising up everywhere. Although it is a bit derided \nand underestimated, at the TEA parties and demonstrations and the \nmarches last weekend, at conservative estimates 70,000 people came from \nall over the country to march. In Yuma, AZ 1,000 to 2,000 people \ndecided to demonstrate and it is still pretty warm in Yuma, AZ this \ntime of the year and all over my State.\n  So what did we do? We say we are going to terminate a program in the \ncommittee report and then of course we cannot resist earmarks and \nporkbarrel spending which has led to corruption.\n  There is a trial going on right now of a lobbyist who some years ago \nengaged in paying off legislators for earmarks. That person, if \nconvicted, will be the 23rd person convicted or who pled guilty in the \nAbramoff scandal. I would like to tell the American people that things \nhave improved, that things have improved since the Abramoff scandal \nbroke and people pled guilty and went to prison, but I can't. I can't \ntell them there has been any improvement. I can't tell them that \ncorruption doesn't go on here in Washington. I can't tell them that \nthere are no more Duke Cunninghams out there who are residing in \nFederal prison.\n  You know what, they are sick and tired of it. This is only $1.3 \nmillion. That is less than chickenfeed around this place. But we have \nto start somewhere and we might start with implementing the \nrecommendations of the President of the United States and the Office of \nManagement and Budget and get rid of a program that is obviously \nunneeded.\n  I don't want to take too much more time of the body, except to again \nsay there is a peaceful revolution going on out there. It is not just \nover health care reform. It is over the out-of-control spending and the \ntrillions and trillions of dollars of debt we are laying on future \ngenerations. Our children and our grandchildren are inheriting an \nunsustainable situation while we do business as usual here in the \nSenate.\n  I could go back to Coast Guard vessels that the Coast Guard and the \nNavy never needed. I could go back to museums that were funded that are \nnow closed all over America, and a lot of other abuses that have taken \nplace. But I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of this amendment. \nThose who do not, I hope people at home will pay attention, will pay \nattention to the out-of-control spending that continues here and the \nmortgaging of our children's futures and what we are doing in the \ncommission of generational theft.\n\n[[Page S9407]]\n\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2410\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the use of funds for the John Murtha Johnstown-\n                        Cambria County Airport)\n\n       On page 179, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 118. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR JOHN MURTHA \n                   JOHNSTOWN-CAMBRIA COUNTY AIRPORT.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this title (including funds derived from the Airport and \n     Airway Trust Fund) may be obligated or expended by the \n     Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Federal \n     Aviation Administration, or any other officer or employee of \n     the Department of Transportation for use at, or in connection \n     with operations (other than air traffic control operations) \n     at, the John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport, \n     including to provide subsidized air service to or from that \n     Airport.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about \nthis amendment to the transportation-HUD bill we are on this week. I \nthink if there is one expenditure by the Federal Government over the \nlast 10 years that has drawn the attention of the American people more \nthan the ``bridge to nowhere,'' it is probably the $200 million that \nhas gone to the John Murtha Airport in Johnstown, PA.\n  Americans are greatly concerned about the level of spending and debt, \nparticularly the spending they consider wasteful or maybe even corrupt. \nThere have been a number of media documentaries on the John Murtha \nAirport.\n  I would like to talk about it a little bit today because my amendment \nwould disallow the use of any funds in this bill to be used to \nadminister any additional subsidies or grants to this particular \nairport.\n  We disagree a lot on Federal spending; here and there are different \nthings, different priorities we can debate about. But if there is any \nsuch thing as waste, it is this airport. I will tell you why. Over the \nlast 10 years, or actually 20 years, this little airport in Johnstown, \nPA, has received about $200 million in Federal funds, $150 million of \nthat was steered directly by Congressman Murtha himself, who uses the \nairport to come back and forth to Washington and for campaign stops.\n  It only has three commercial flights a day to one destination and \nthat is to Washington, DC. Only an average of about 20 passengers a day \nuse this airport. The American taxpayers are on the hook for about $1.5 \nmillion a year in Federal subsidies. Every ticket to Washington and \nback is subsidized for about $100, which means the American taxpayers \npay almost as much for the ticket as the passenger does, not just for \none trip or two but continually year after year.\n  In spite of the fact that major media outlets for a number of months \nhave used this as an example of the fleecing of America, this continues \nto go on. In effect, when the stimulus bill was passed with all the \npromises of transparency and priority use, $800,000 of funds went to \nthis airport to repave an alternate runway which is seldom, if ever, \nused.\n  A lot of us in the Congress and the Senate have worked for years on \nsmall rural airports to try to get some money to extend a runway so \ncorporate aircraft could come in, so maybe businesses could locate in \nareas where there was not commercial air traffic. Getting $100,000 for \nan airport is a major accomplishment sometimes, but $200 million for an \nairport that averages 20 passengers a day, that many times there are \nmore people handling security at this airport than there are people \ngoing through the lines, is something we need to stop.\n  If we cannot stop it, we cannot stop anything. Last Saturday in front \nof the Capitol, hundreds of thousands of people gathered. It was not a \nRepublican gathering, I can tell you that because I was there. It was \naverage Americans, moms and dads with their children, grandmas, \ngrandpas, people who had never been involved in politics before who \nwere very concerned about the level of spending, not just this \nadministration.\n  This is not a criticism of this administration. We are talking about \nthe last 15 or 20 years. People are concerned about the level of \nspending and borrowing and debt, taxes and government takeovers in all \nareas of our economy.\n  Health care is certainly something that brought it to a head, but \nthese people are here concerned by the fact that they believe our \ncountry is on the edge of the cliff. They would like to see us in the \nCongress begin to move back away from the cliff and take some of the \nthings that are not necessary here in Washington and begin to trim them \nback.\n  But I think we can say here, if we cannot cut the funding for this \nlittle airport in Pennsylvania named after the Congressman who has \nhelped to get $200 million, if we cannot stop funding it, stop \nsubsidizing tickets, if we cannot look at the facts in this particular \ncase and decide as a Congress to stop this, then there is nothing we \ncan cut. Then there is no such thing as waste, and there is no such \nthing as fraud and corruption throughout this Federal Government. If we \ncannot agree, as Members of the Senate, to stop this--we are not taking \naway the $200 million they have already gotten, the $800,000 for the \nalternative runway which they have there, which did not need repaving \nin the first place, we are not closing down the airport or stopping any \nair travel there. We are just saying: Enough is enough.\n  We have bought equipment there, radar equipment, spent millions of \ndollars that is not even being used. It is not being staffed. It is \ntime we at least focus on one thing and say that we can begin the \nprocess of moving this country away from a cliff of economic and \nfinancial disaster.\n  I hope on this bill, with this amendment, that we can, in a \nbipartisan way, agree this is one thing we do not have to have at the \nFederal level, that we can begin to shift priorities to those things we \nare supposed to do at the Federal level. It is certainly not to fund a \npet project of one Congressman to the tune of $200 million.\n  I encourage all my Senate colleagues, Republican and Democratic, to\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\nsupport an amendment that would simply disallow the use of any funds in \nthis bill to be used to continue the administration of subsidies or \ngrants to this airport.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nare about to set up a series of votes to occur shortly. We will make \nthat unanimous consent agreement in the next few minutes.\n  In the pending time, I will speak against one of the amendments that \nwill be considered; that is, the one that was offered by the Senator \nfrom Nevada. It is a motion to recommit and reduce spending for our \ntransportation and housing bill.\n  I would like to point out to all our colleagues, the funding levels \nthat are contained in this bill are consistent with the budget \nresolution this entire Senate agreed to in the spring and are $1.2 \nbillion below the level of funding that was requested by the President \nin his request.\n  The majority of the funding increases that are contained in our bill \nsupport our Nation's vulnerable citizens and the needs of the \ncommunities. Those increases include funding to support rental \nassistance for low-income families, elderly and disabled tenants who \nuse Section 8 vouchers, living in project-based housing or those who \nlive in public housing.\n  The funding provided ensures that families receiving assistance will \nmaintain that. This is critical because, without assistance, these \nindividuals and families would be at the risk of homelessness, at a \ntime that all of us know that many of our citizens are struggling \ntoday.\n  We have increased funding for homeless programs, which will help \nprevent more families from becoming homeless. Last year we should all \nnote there was an increase of 9 percent in family homelessness in this \nNation.\n  We have increased funding to support our States and our local \ncommunities to address their housing needs and support economic \nactivities ties through the Community Development Block Grant Program. \nWe increased funding in our Nation's infrastructure that will both \nimprove the safety of our Nation's roads and bridges and create and \nsustain critical jobs.\n  We have increased funding for safety inspectors at the Federal \nAviation Administration, as well as funding for a new program to invest \nin railroad safety technologies such as positive train control.\n  In comparison, there are drastic consequences, we should note, to \nfreezing funding for this bill at last year's level. Funding frozen at \nthe fiscal year 2009 level could result in tens of thousands of people \nwho currently hold vouchers to lose their housing. During this economic \ncrisis, we should not be putting our low-income families at risk and \nout on the street.\n  In addition, a funding level frozen at the 2009 level would put at \nrisk our critical funding for air traffic controllers. My colleague \nfrom Missouri has talked about the importance of increasing the air \ntraffic controllers, and we know the Federal Aviation Administration is \nfacing a shortage of experienced air traffic controllers. We cannot \nafford to ignore the safety needs of the aviation system.\n  This subcommittee carefully weighed the merits of all programs before \nus. We cut programs below the President's request and achieved \nadditional savings. Further reductions now requested by this amendment \nwould seriously undermine critical transportation safety activities. I \nask colleagues to reject the amendment when we vote.\n  We should have a unanimous consent agreement shortly to have votes \nbegin in the next several minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the following amendments and motion in \nthe order listed; that no amendments be in order to the amendment or \nthe motion prior to a vote; that prior to the stacked votes in this \nsequence there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form; that after the first vote, the succeeding votes be \nlimited to 10 minutes each: the Gregg amendment, No. 2361, and the \nEnsign motion to recommit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2361\n\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the Gregg amendment.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment does a very simple thing. It \nsays taxpayers don't have to pay for signs which tell them their money \nis being spent well. It makes no sense that taxpayers should be \nspending millions of dollars to put up signs to tell them their money \nis being spent well. It has to be extraordinarily frustrating to \ntaxpayers to see that happening. It certainly is not a good use of \ntheir money. The money can be used on a lot of other things--building a \nroad, repairing bridges, improving buildings that need to be improved, \nimproving parks. Let's not put up signs on every one of these sites \nacross America saying we congratulate ourselves for doing the project. \nIt is self-congratulatory, it is political, and it is inappropriate. \nThese truly are signs to nowhere. A total waste of money. They should \nnot be required. We should reject them as being required. That is what \nthe amendment does.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a most political amendment. I got \nto thinking, after Senator Gregg said we can't show a sign where \neconomic recovery funds are being put to use on a road or a bridge or \nhighway. We should keep it from the people because he says it is self-\ncongratulatory.\n  It is not self-congratulatory. Some people may not like the project; \nsome people may. It is about transparency and openness.\n  I have to say to you, this makes no sense. Where were Senator Gregg \nand his friends on the Republican side when George Bush and the \nRepublican Congress spent $33 million to send out a letter telling \neveryone their Economic Recovery Act was working by way of refunds? I \nnever heard one word out of the Senators from the other side of the \naisle. That cost $33 million.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the tax rebate \nletter that went to every American be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Text of IRS Tax Rebate Letter\n\n\n          Notice of Status and Amount of Immediate Tax Relief\n\n       We are pleased to inform you that the United States \n     Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law \n     the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001, which provides long-term tax relief for all Americans \n     who pay income taxes.\n       The new tax law provides immediate tax relief in 2001 and \n     long-term tax relief for the years to come.\n       As part of the immediate tax relief, you will be receiving \n     a check in the amount of $XXX during the week of XX/XX/01.\n       Your amount is based on information you submitted on your \n     2000 federal tax return and is just the first installment of \n     the long-term tax relief provided by the new law. The amount \n     of the check could be reduced by any outstanding federal debt \n     you owe, such as\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\n     past due child support or federal or state income taxes. You \n     need to take no additional steps. Your check will be mailed \n     to you. You will not be required to report the amount as \n     taxable income on your federal tax return.\n       On the reverse side of this letter is information on how \n     your check amount was calculated. If you need additional \n     information, please visit the IRS web site at www.irs.gov or \n     call 1-800-829-4477. Please keep a copy of this notice with \n     your tax records.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would say to you, this is politics. This is going to \nsave--Senator Gregg's amendment--$4 million. This cost $33 million.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor. I hope we vote ``no.''\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for one point of personal \nclarification.\n  I did not vote for President Bush's stimulus package either.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for a rebuttal.\n  This is not about whether you voted for the stimulus. It is about \nwhether you objected to spending money to tell people what the stimulus \ndoes. It seems to me, under Republican leaders we did not hear \nanything. Now we hear it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, do two wrongs make a right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nGregg amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nhave one more vote right now. We expect to be debating several \namendments over the next hour or so. I believe there are about four or \nfive amendments left. We want to finish this bill this afternoon. If \nyou have any issues, please bring them to the committee during this \nvote or when this vote is over so that later this evening or early this \nevening, I hope, we can move to the final votes on this bill.\n  With that, I believe the motion to recommit by the Senator from \nNevada is in order.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Ensign motion to \nrecommit?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this is a committee report here. It says, \n``2009 appropriations, $117 billion.'' This is the kind of fuzzy math \nwe deal with here in Washington, DC. Last year's appropriations bill \nwas $55 billion, it wasn't $117 billion. It is only $117 billion if you \ncount in the money from the stimulus bill. That looks as if it is being \ncounted here so that they can claim they are actually cutting last \nyear's bill. This bill has a 23-percent increase over last year. What \nthis motion to recommit says is, let's show some fiscal restraint \naround here and let's freeze spending to last year's level.\n  So we want to recommit the bill back to the Appropriations Committee. \nThe Appropriations Committee can determine where it wants the spending \nto go, but it needs to be at last year's level.\n  Every State in our country right now is--they are not freezing their \nbudgets, they are cutting their budgets. Yet here in Washington we have \nan appropriations bill in front of us that increases spending by 23 \npercent. This is outrageous. We need to show some fiscal discipline in \nthis case, so I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, the \nfunding levels contained in the bill are consistent with the budget \nresolution the Senate passed and agreed to this Spring. We are $1.2 \nbillion below the level of funding requested by the President.\n  We worked very hard to balance the important safety, transportation \nand accounting needs of this Nation. We urge you to defeat this \namendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join with my colleague in urging a defeat \nof the amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am concerned that we in this Congress \nare not properly attached to reality. I spent time in my State over the \nrecess, and people talked to me repeatedly about their concerns about \nexcessive government spending. It is a real national issue.\n  We know our national debt, the total debt is on track to double in 5 \nyears and triple in 10. That is the public debt this country owes, and \nwe have to pay interest on it to countries such as China and \nindividuals all over the world. We pay a lot of interest every year. \nThe interest is going to surge over the next 10 years under this \nproposal.\n  I feel as if we are not connected, we are not hearing it. We think it \nis business as usual, and it is not business as usual. States \nthroughout our country, cities throughout our country are cutting \nspending, trimming budgets, finding more ways to be efficient, looking \nfor ways to save money and be within their budgets. Most States have a \nbalanced budget amendment, and they have to stay within their budget. \nWe do not. We came within one vote several years ago passing out of the \nSenate a balanced budget amendment, but it failed. Now we are \nproceeding on a stunningly reckless course of spending.\n  I have always tried to support agriculture. It is a big thing in my \nState. But I could not vote for the last agriculture bill we had. There \nwas a 14-percent increase in agriculture spending. We know the rule of \n7--most people do. If you increase something at the rate of 7 percent a \nyear, it will double in 10 years; at 14 percent, it will double in 5 \nyears. So the entire agriculture bill of the United States is on track \nto double in 5 years at that rate, and that does not include the extra \nmoney that came out of the stimulus bill, which is significant. If you \ninclude that, it would amount to a 67-percent increase in agricultural \nfunding. I just bring that up. This is a bill I care about.\n  The transportation and HUD bill that is before us today is worse. It \nhas a 23-percent increase in spending which is on top of a 13-percent \nincrease in spending in the bill last year. That does not include the \nstimulus package spending. At a 23-percent rate, spending on Housing \nand Urban Development, and Transportation would double in 3 to 4 years. \nIf you include the stimulus package money which we passed in February \nit is a 165-percent increase in spending from fiscal year 2008 to \nfiscal year 2010. That is a stunning increase, at a time when we do not \nhave the money, and the American people know it.\n  That is one of the complaints about health care. It is all part and \nparcel of a concern by the American people. What I understand them to \nsay to me is: Have you guys lost your minds up there? Do you no longer \nfeel a sense of responsibility? You are going to triple the national \ndebt in 10 years? How can you justify that? We have vote after vote and \nthey fail. We need to be containing spending.\n  We had an amendment that was offered to deal with a shortfall in \ntransportation money. We have a problem. We have a real problem. People \nare using less gasoline, and the taxes for our highways primarily come \nfrom people paying a tax per gallon. If they use less gallons, we have \nless money coming into the basic highway fund.\n  I would like to see that number lifted. How can we do it? Senator \nVitter proposed a very commonsense amendment. He said: Let's put up, I \nthink it was $18 billion, out of the stimulus bill--most of which was \npromised for roads anyway, but they have not been fixed--he said take \nthat money and fix the shortfall in the transportation bill. I voted \nfor that. It failed because they preferred to fix the shortfall in \ntransportation by borrowing more on top of the stimulus bill; every \npenny of it is borrowed. We don't have the money. We have to borrow it. \nWe pay interest on it. Somebody has to pay that for the indefinite \nfuture because the 10-year budget the President has submitted to us has \nno hint it will contain spending. In fact, the deficits grow in the out \nyears, which is why we have such a terrible problem.\n  Earlier today we had an amendment by Senator Ensign that said: Let's \nfreeze spending. Let's show some restraint such as our States are \ndoing, such as our families are doing. No. Just flat spending. You see, \ntransportation and these other programs that are in this bill, they are \ngetting stimulus money out of the $800 billion on top of that. So why \ndo they need a baseline increase of 23 percent? Next year, we will be \nhearing: We are only going to do a 15-percent increase on the baseline \nand be proud of that.\n  I don't like the way we are doing this. I don't think we are \nlistening to the American people. It is not the right thing to do.\n  I have a few charts I would like to share that bear repeating because \nI am not making up these numbers. These are numbers by the \nCongressional Budget Office. They are basically a nonpartisan group of \nfine folks who try to give us honest data on which we can make \ndecisions. The chairman of it is selected by the Congress. Of course, \nthe Congress is a Democratic majority, and they were able to select a \nDirector. This is what they scored President Obama's budget. This is \nthe public debt of the United States of America, much of it held by \nChina and other countries around the world, individuals around the \nworld. They buy our T-bills, and we pay them interest.\n  This chart is in trillions. In the entire history of our country up \nthrough 2008, we had accumulated a public debt of $5.8 trillion. A lot \nof people think that is too high. I think that is too high. We are \ncarrying a big debt, and we do not need it to continue. Under the \nbudget that is before us today, that we passed, it looks like we are \nspending at least on that level, if not more, based on the bills we see \ncoming forward. Our spending will double the entire national debt in 5 \nyears to $11.8 trillion, and in 10 years, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, it will be $17.3 trillion.\n  That is a stunning figure. It should put chills through the backbones \nof everybody in this Congress. How can we justify this? States are \ntrimming their budgets, and we had a 14-percent increase in \nagriculture, which we not long ago voted on, and now we have a 23-\npercent increase in HUD. This is not responsible.\n  We came into this year with a deficit. The President said we had to \nrush through a stimulus bill, and they passed it by just a couple of \nvotes--$800 billion, every bit of it borrowed because we did not have \nthe money. We were already in debt. If you spend more money when you \nare in debt, how do you get it? You borrow it. You have to get people \nto buy your Treasury bills. The interest rate on 10-year Treasury bills \nwas over 2 percent in January. In July, they reached 3.6 percent or so \nbecause people are getting worried. They think we might have an \ninflationary spiral. They think interest rates may go up. So they are \nnot so willing to loan money at a low interest rate for 10 years like \nthey were at the beginning of the year. This causes a problem.\n  Let me show this chart, which I think brings the numbers home in a \nway we can comprehend them because it is difficult to comprehend \nnumbers this big. People assume, when I throw these billion-dollar \nfigures around, surely people up there know what they are doing, and, \nSessions, you are just exaggerating. You don't like to spend money, and \nyou are exaggerating.\n  It is not an exaggeration. I am talking about the entire debt of \nAmerica tripling in 10 years.\n  Look at the interest. We spend approximately $100 billion now on \nhighways. I said $40 billion, but I think with the stimulus and the \nspending from gas taxes, we spend about $100 billion on our highways. \nWe spend about $100 billion on education. On September 30, 2009, the \nestimate is that we will pay $170 billion in interest. We get nothing \nfor it. It is just like paying interest on your credit card. The bank \ngets it. You don't get it. They loaned you money. You owe them money--\ninterest--to keep the money they loaned you.\n  As the debt increases and we have a modest adjustment in the interest \nrate--not a big adjustment but one the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects will occur, a raising from the relatively low interest rates \nwe have today--as those go up, the interest we will pay each year, the \nburden we pay first before we can buy anything with the taxpayers' \nmoney is increasing.\n  We see the numbers here. In 2019, 10 years from today, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the U.S. Government will be \npaying out $799 billion\n\n[[Page S9411]]\n\na year in interest. We don't get anything for that. It goes out to \npeople all over the world who bought our Treasury notes, and we send \nout this interest. We send it to some Americans who buy it. They get \nthis interest. It is money we do not have to do things we want to do \nfor our constituents. And, in essence, as a moral matter, we are \nreaching into the future and we are taking money from the future and \nspending it today to meet our desires today, without doing what our \nStates and cities and counties are doing--figuring out how to get by \nwith less in tough times and looking forward to the day they will be \nable to see growth again and be able to not have to be on such a spare \nbudget. But that is life. We are not able to pass a law to reverse life \nand the challenges and difficulties and uncertainties we face every \nyear in our personal lives and in our national lives and in our \neconomic lives.\n\n  So that is the lower number. That is assuming things are going pretty \nwell. Look at the interest rates that the blue chip forecast of \neconomists, who are a good group of people--and they make forecasts \nthat are pretty accurate. They have been more accurate than the \ngovernment over the years. The Blue Chip Forecast says the interest \nrate is going to be more than CBO scores. They say the interest rate in \nthe tenth year would be $865 billion. And interest rates could surge to \nthe level of the 1980s, which would be 10 percent interest rates. If \nyou had that kind of interest rate, we would spend $1.29 trillion on \ninterest before we could do anything to purchase things for our \nconstituents.\n  Remember, the highway money is about $100 billion; education is about \n$100 billion. We will be spending $800 billion on interest--$600 \nbillion plus more than we spent this year, just on interest, because of \nirresponsible spending. So I would say, count me as somebody who is \ngetting the message, both from my own study of what is occurring here, \nbeing on the Budget Committee, and from what I am hearing from my \nconstituents. They say: It is time for you guys to get responsible. We \nare upset. And why shouldn't they be upset? Somebody comes to a town \nmeeting and they are a little hot with their Congressman or their \nSenator. Are we supposed to think this is a threat to democracy, when \nwe have this kind of behavior going on in the Congress? They ought to \nbe hot. There is every reason to be hot. We do not need to be doing \nthis.\n  You may say: Well, we are having a hard time economically, Senator. \nWe have to spend a little money now to get this thing going. The \noutyear budget projection, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, assumes robust growth. In 2012 and 2013 they are projecting \nover 4 percent growth. We may not have 4 percent growth. If we don't \nhave 4 percent growth, we are going to have larger deficits than they \nare projecting. And in the outer years they are projecting a solid 2- \nor 3-percent growth out there. No recession in this. So this is not a \nprojection based on the assumption of a recession putting us in this \nkind of debt.\n  How much do we spend each year? Well, it is about $3.5 trillion. That \nis how much a trillion dollars is. We have $1.8 trillion in debt this \nyear. We will be short this year $1.8 trillion. We will spend $1.8 \ntrillion more than we take in. That is $1,800 billion. And those are \nthings that should cause us to think about what we are doing. We have \ndone nothing like this before, I don't think, except maybe a life-and-\ndeath struggle in World War II, when people all over the country were \ndrafted. I would note that 43 cents out of every dollar we are spending \nthis year is borrowed. That is not acceptable.\n  We have heard from administration officials, from Alan Greenspan and \nother experts, that this whole budget picture is unsustainable. That is \nwhat they say. TV commentators, editorial writers say it is \nunsustainable, the debt cycle we are in. Let me ask this: What does \nunsustainable mean? It means just that. It cannot be allowed to \ncontinue.\n  I had somebody ask me recently in the airport: Well, when are you \ngoing to start paying it down? When are you going to start paying the \ndebt down? The same way I have to do in my house with my credit cards, \nmy mortgage. The answer is: There is no prospect of paying it down. \nLast year was the highest deficit we have had--$450 billion in 1 year. \nThis year it will be $1,800 billion. In the next 10 years, according to \nCBO, the least deficit we will have--and they are projecting 2 or 3 \nyears from now--is $600-plus billion. That is the lowest. Then it \nstarts back up again, and in the tenth year it is over $1 trillion.\n  There is no prospect of a balanced budget anywhere out there, and we \nact as though it is business as usual. We can spend and spend--so 23 \npercent on this bill, 14 percent on that bill on top of the stimulus \nmoney we put in. What we should do is have at least level funding with \nthe stimulus money piling into the economy--the $800 billion there.\n  In closing, I would say we are not getting it. We are not listening \nto the American people. We are not even reading our own budget numbers, \nand we are hurting our country. This $800 billion in interest every \nyear? This will devastate our ability to fund the government. Not only \nthat, it will require either more and more and more borrowing or more \nand more and more taxes, neither one of which is good for this economy. \nIt is not good for America.\n  We do not have to do this. I don't mean to be partisan about it. \nRepublicans' hands are not clean on this either. But the leadership in \nthis Senate needs to understand these fundamental principles and needs \nto send some signals that they understand it and are prepared to do \nsomething about it. And that includes the President of the United \nStates of America. He needs to understand what is happening to this \ncountry as a result of his budget and take some steps that will show in \nreality we are going to bring this ship back on course again.\n  You say: Well, you have this health care bill and that is what is \ndriving it. The health care bill is not in there. This budget analysis \nwas done before health care even came up. It will cost more, of course, \nand make these numbers look even bigger. So we have to grow up and be \nresponsible. Our Republic is depending on us to lead and tell the \ntruth, and the truth is we are on an unsustainable course. The truth is \nthis administration and the leadership in this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives has no plan to get us off this unsustainable course. \nThe American people are the only ones, it looks like, who have sense \nenough to know what is occurring, and I hope they will continue to make \ntheir voices heard.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2359, as Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask that any pending amendment be set \naside and that amendment No. 2359 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask that the modified version of the \namendment be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment (No. 2359) as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for households that include \n  convicted drug dealing or domestic violence offenders or members of \n    violent gangs that occupy rebuilt public housing in New Orleans)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON USING FUNDS FOR CERTAIN HOUSEHOLDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--No funds made available under this Act may \n     be used for or provided to a household that--\n       (1) includes a covered offender; and\n       (2) resides in federally-subsidized housing in New Orleans, \n     Louisiana.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``covered offender'' means an individual \n     that--\n       (A) has been convicted of an offense under Federal, State, \n     or tribal law involved in manufacturing, distributing, or \n     possessing\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\n     with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled \n     substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)); or\n       (B) is a member of a criminal street gang, as defined in \n     section 521 of title 18, United States Code;\n       (2) the term ``federally-subsidized housing'' means any \n     housing for which housing assistance is being provided; and\n       (3) the term ``housing assistance'' means any assistance, \n     loan, loan guarantee, housing, or other housing assistance \n     provided under a housing-related program administered, in \n     whole or in part, by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. This amendment is very straightforward, and it is very \nnarrowly drawn. First of all, it only affects public housing assistance \nin New Orleans, LA, nowhere else, and it prohibits funds in this bill \nfrom going to any housing assistance to benefit drug dealers or members \nof violent gangs, folks who have actually been convicted of these \noffenses--drug dealing, not simple possession, drug dealing, a \nconviction of that--or convicted of crimes that involve a member of a \nviolent gang.\n  After Hurricane Katrina, there was an enormous rebuilding effort in \nNew Orleans that continues. Part of that effort involves public housing \nin New Orleans. Quite frankly, that system has been plagued for many \nyears with tremendous problems, the biggest of which is crime in those \nprojects. There has been an ongoing effort to rid those projects of \nviolent crime. That effort continues and certainly that battle has not \nyet been won because, unfortunately, New Orleans continues to be a \ncapital in the country for violent crime, with very high violent crime \nlevels.\n  As we are rebuilding these projects using a fundamentally different \nmodel--a mixed-income model, less density--certainly one of the changes \nwe need to make is to ensure that drug dealers and members of violent \ngangs do not set up shop once again in those public housing projects \nand do not get other taxpayer assistance.\n  In this bill is $7.25 billion for public housing assistance. Some of \nthat will go to New Orleans. Certainly it is reasonable and productive \nand positive that we simply say we are not going to send this \nassistance to folks who have been convicted of being a violent gang \nmember, have been convicted of drug dealing, not simple possession but \ndrug dealing.\n  This is very important policy, very important for the continued \nrecovery of New Orleans coming out of Hurricane Katrina. I urge my \ncolleagues to accept this amendment and support this amendment and pass \nit into law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               WTO Ruling\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the World Trade Organization \nhanded down a ruling in one of our Nation's most important trade cases \nto date. The ruling was in a case that the U.S. Government, through our \nTrade Representative, brought against the European Union for providing \nmarket-distorting subsidies for the European aerospace company, Airbus. \nIt was a case brought against the EU not because of minor trade \ninfractions or insignificant manipulation of the international market. \nIt was brought because of decades of playing outside the rules, \nbillions in government subsidies, and repeated warnings by the United \nStates to end the unfair practice of providing a damaging subsidy \ncalled launch aid. What the WTO ruled by all accounts is very clear. \nLaunch aid is illegal. It creates an uneven playing field. It has \nharmed American workers and companies. It needs to end.\n  For me, this is an important decision that is long overdue. That is \nbecause in my home State, the State of much of our country's aerospace \nindustry, the consequences of competing with the treasuries of large \nEuropean governments has been very real for a very long time. It has \nbeen felt in communities, in local economies, and in lost jobs. That is \nwhy, as my colleagues know, I have been speaking out against Europe's \nmarket-distorting actions in commercial aerospace for many years. I \nhave raised my concerns with other Senators, with foreign leaders, and \nadministrations of both parties.\n  In 2005, I helped pass a unanimous resolution in the Senate on the \nneed to level the playing field for fair global aerospace competition. \nIn that same year, after the European Union mocked our efforts to \nnegotiate in good faith by continuing to provide launch aid, I urged \nthe Bush administration to move forward with this WTO case. Make no \nmistake about it, I understand the value of healthy competition in the \ninternational marketplace. But I also believe that competitors must \nabide by the same set of rules.\n  One reason I have fought so hard to end illegal subsidies is because \nI know there is a fundamental difference in how our country and Europe \nview the aerospace industry and fair competition. For us in America, \ncommercial aerospace is seen as a private business. Some companies will \nwin; some companies will lose. But we allow the marketplace to decide. \nAmerican aerospace companies, such as Boeing, take tremendous financial \nrisks when they develop and market a new aircraft. Their workers and \ndevelopers and researchers put their jobs and billions of dollars on \nthe line each time. They literally bet the company with each new plane \nthey develop. But in Europe, aerospace is a jobs program. To fund that \nprogram, they use billions of dollars in what is called launch aid. So \nthey are not quite as concerned when Airbus loses money. In fact, they \ndon't even require Airbus to repay that launch aid, if the aircraft \nthey develop is unsuccessful. It is no risk, all reward.\n  But as the WTO has now ruled, it is also a violation of international \ntrade rules and fair competition. The plain truth is that these illegal \nsubsidies have cost American jobs. The commercial aerospace industry \nemploys well over half a million Americans with family-wage salaries. \nBut in the past 20 years, as Airbus has continued to grow, thanks to \nbillions in subsidies, we have lost hundreds of thousands of American \naerospace jobs. These are scientific and technical jobs. They are jobs \nthat keep the economies of communities large and small stable in States \nall throughout the country. They are jobs that support families to pay \nmortgages and create other jobs. They are jobs that are increasingly \nprecious at a time when we are facing double-digit unemployment.\n  American innovation led to the birth of the aerospace industry over \n100 years ago. Since that time, we have made air travel safer and \nbrought growth and innovation to our economy. Although we led in the \nfirst century of flight, unless we recognize the damages these \nsubsidies pose and fight for our workers, we might not have a major \nrole in the next century in aerospace. That is why the WTO ruling is so \nimportant. This ruling is much more than a confirmation that Airbus has \nbeen breaking the rules. It is a victory for American workers who \nproduce the world's best planes and who have been forced to fight an \nuphill battle. It is a warning to other countries considering entering \nthe aerospace marketplace that launch aid is the wrong example to \nfollow. It reaffirms the spirit of free and fair trade in the \ninternational marketplace and reminds us that we have to be vigilant \nbecause this is certainly not the end of this fight.\n  In fact, there are already signs that the EU and Airbus will flaunt \nthe will of the WTO. Already, very publicly, the Governments of France, \nGermany, and the United Kingdom have said they will move forward with \nplans to provide Airbus with nearly $5 billion in launch aid for the \ndevelopment of Airbus's latest generation of airplane, the A350, \ndespite any ruling by the WTO. In other words, in the face of a clear \ncondemnation of their practices, they said they will do as they please. \nThat is why, on Monday, I wrote to President Obama urging him and his \nadministration to take the strongest possible actions to prevent \nEuropean governments from providing Airbus with an additional illegal \ntrade-distorting subsidy. But it will be all of our responsibilities to \nensure that the rules are followed, American jobs are not further \nendangered, and the future of the aerospace industry is protected.\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\n  Unless we wake up to the threat that continued illegal subsidies \npose, we will lose an industry we created that is critical to our \neconomic recovery and will help sustain our Nation's continued growth.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, while we have an opportunity, there are some \nimportant comments I want to make about this bill.\n  We have heard from some people who are concerned about the deficit \nand the national debt. They are tremendous concerns. Any discussion of \nour overall economy must take into consideration the debt we are \nrunning up that will be on the backs of our children and our \ngrandchildren. I have opposed many spending packages that have come \nthrough and many of the things that have gone on.\n  But when we are looking at priorities--which are funding ongoing \nprograms which are within the budget of our committees--then we need to \nfocus on spending that will prove beneficial for the American people \nand the economy.\n  The bill before us, the Transportation and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment appropriations bill, funds infrastructure development for \neverything from roads, to bridges, to airports, which is critical to \nattracting businesses, creating jobs and economic growth in our \ncommunities.\n  The bill also provides funding to help the Nation's most vulnerable \npopulations: the homeless, low-income families and seniors, housing for \nthe disabled, and housing for our returning veterans who have served \noverseas.\n  This bill provides increased investment in the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. The FAA gets money for 200 additional safety \ninspectors. I have spoken on this floor about the need for safety \ninspectors because we have airlines flying with very subpar \nqualifications, and too often they get away with sending out people who \nare not qualified, should not be pilots, have not been properly \ntrained. For all of us who fly and all of our constituents, that is a \nmajor concern. But we need to accelerate programs as well related to \nreducing congestion and increasing safety. That means getting us to the \nnext generation air traffic system.\n  Nobody will claim this is a perfect bill, but it is one that provides \nneeded funds for programs that not only make a difference in the lives \nof everyday Americans but also enables job creation, economic growth, \nand the kind of treatment we wish to provide for those in need, \nespecially in the housing area.\n  I have asked my colleagues, and will continue to ask them, to support \nthis bill. There have also been attacks--and there will be some more \nbefore we get out of here--on earmarks. Every year we have a debate \nabout whether Congress should have a role in setting priorities or \nsimply pass the buck to those in the executive branch of government.\n  Within my State are State and local experts I turn to, as well as \npeople whose lives are inextricably linked to housing, transportation, \nand economic development. Most of these people know a great deal about \nthese issues. They know a lot more about these issues and how they \naffect the people of Missouri than most folks sitting in a bureaucracy \nin Washington, DC, who may never have been there, do not know what the \nchallenges are, do not know where the local people are putting their \npriorities, do not know what their plans are, do not know how they see \ntheir communities grow, their State grow. I think a lot of these people \nknow more about housing, transportation, and economic development than \npeople at OMB and those who ultimately produce budget submissions from \ntheir distant Washington offices.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about bad earmarks. I am opposed to bad \nearmarks, and people who abuse the system, who do so criminally, should \nbe punished and put in jail, as they have been. There is no debate \nthere. The debate is not what is written about, but it is who should \nearmark because every dollar that is spent by the government is \ndirected by somebody. Who is making the decisions?\n  Some argue it should be a mix where Congress earmarks roughly 2 \npercent of discretionary funds, with the balance, roughly 98 percent, \nbeing earmarked by agency employees of the executive branch. I think \nyou could make a good argument that it should be even higher.\n  However, under this scenario, with full disclosure, elected officials \nhave a role in listening to and speaking for the people of their State, \nthe leaders of their communities, the leaders of the institutions. We \ncan make those recommendations, and the full Congress can look at them \nand the President can ratify them. This is reflected in the bills \nbefore us this session.\n  Others argue Congress should have no role; executive branch \nofficials, elected by no one, should have 100 percent monopoly power \nover spending. Their position is people unaccountable to the voters \nshould have this monopoly power. Congress can, however, and does set \ncriteria, but the more criteria we set, the more it becomes a \ncongressional earmark. The less criteria we set, the more it remains an \nexecutive branch earmark.\n  In executive agencies, people have their own agendas and political \nleanings. Their own political bosses--in either the Bush administration \nor the Obama administration--have their own agenda. I do not like \nmonopoly power of the Obama administration on spending and I did not \nsupport it during the Clinton or either Bush administration as well.\n  I have to admit I find it puzzling to hear some of my self-professed \nconservative friends suggesting that the way to reform spending is to \nturn it all over to the Obama administration to earmark. I am not \narguing they should have no role. I am arguing today that Congress \nshould have a role.\n  The Constitution, in article I, section 9, says very clearly that it \ngives the Congress the power of the purse. It states:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in \n     consequence of Appropriations made by law.\n\n  Guess what. That is what we are supposed to do, as stated in article \nI, section 9. I think it would be extreme, probably excessive, to \nsuggest that Congress should earmark all money, just as I believe it \nwould be extreme and wrongheaded to suggest that the Obama \nadministration should earmark all money.\n  A bad earmark is a bad earmark, no matter who does it. Frankly, when \nI left the governorship of my State, one of the reasons I believed it \nwas important to run for the Senate was to be able to exercise the \nvoice and the views of Missourians in the spending process because I \nhad seen too many instances where bureaucrats in Washington made very \nbad decisions.\n  They made bad decisions that absolutely turned the priorities around. \nThey told us we had to spend all of our money for cleaning up \nwastewater, putting tertiary treatment on major metropolitan sewer \nsystems, which would then have to put cleaner water into the Missouri \nand Mississippi Rivers than was already there.\n  The State's priority was to clean up many of the pristine streams in \nour State which had, in too many instances, raw sewage flowing into \nthem--streams which were vital parts of our scenic rivers, our scenic \nwaterways, places for hunters and fishermen, where people would like to \nswim and boat but could not.\n  But we have seen even more instances of bad earmarks. I thought it \nwas a horrible Pentagon earmark to award an Air Force tanker project \nworth billions of dollars to a European company--a process which, under \npressure, has since been subjected to review and will cost thousands of \nMissouri jobs if undertaken.\n  Fundamentally, I see this as a role of Congress and one that should \nbe transparent, self-limiting, and subject to scrutiny. We get that \nscrutiny. I accept it. I am happy to argue with anybody who disagrees \nwith my views, but at least we do so out in the open. When earmarks are \nmade in the executive branch, nobody knows who did them. If you don't \nlike a decision, you don't even know whom to yell at because it is \nsomebody who is not appointed, not accountable, not obvious to the \npeople we are supposed to serve.\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\n  A lot of people criticize me for putting out statements, news \nreleases, when I get some funds for the State, which is another way of \nsaying I was too transparent. I use this process to help empower local \npeople who have local ideas on how best to improve their local \ncommunities after having set their own local priorities.\n  If a Senator doesn't want to request an earmark, that is fine. Some \npeople request earmarks and then vote to strip them out. I think that \nis a little bit self-contradictory, but I will leave that to the \nSenators who choose to request them and then move to strike them. If a \nSenator thinks it is inappropriate or does not trust himself or his \nlocal leaders to establish priorities and petition Congress for \nfunding, that is his or her business. But I do trust local officials \nwho answer to their voters and neighbors, as I do, who invest their \nmoney and the tax money at the local level, and who understand their \nown conditions better than anyone else, over the geniuses at OMB who \nmay or may not have had the privilege of traveling to Missouri, to \nWashington State, to Pennsylvania, to Minnesota, to wherever the \nSenator comes from.\n  In short, someone earmarks discretionary money, and I am glad that a \nsmall fraction of that earmarking is reserved for those who can be \nquestioned and disparaged and voted out of office if people disagree. I \ndisagree that earmarking and making all spending decisions should be a \nresponsibility exclusive to the typically anonymous executive branch \npeople.\n  I ask my colleagues to ensure that bureaucrats and politicians in the \nexecutive branch are not the sole source of power when it comes to \nsetting spending priorities. In this case, local citizens outside of \nWashington who live with the project purposes and who are not agency \nofficials should have a stronger voice in setting local priorities, not \na weaker voice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to oppose efforts to \ntake away from Congress not only our constitutional power and authority \nover the purse but what I view as a high responsibility of someone who \nholds an office and carries out the duties of a U.S. Senator.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2410\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to an amendment \nproposed by my colleague from South Carolina. The amendment is No. \n2410. I believe this amendment sets a dangerous precedent for a number \nof reasons.\n  First of all, it singles out one airport, which happens to be an \nairport in southwestern Pennsylvania, in Cambria County on the \nsouthwestern corner of our State.\n  It is important to note about this particular debate on this \namendment that none of the funds in the underlying bill we are talking \nabout here provide for direct funding to this airport. In my view, the \ndecision as to whether this particular airport should receive funding \nshould be left to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  The Senator from South Carolina noted that the airport received \nfunding under the America Recovery and Reinvestment Act, known as the \nstimulus bill. Let me read something from the spokesperson from the \nU.S. Department of Transportation. This spokesperson said: ``The bottom \nline is it,'' meaning this airport, ``deserved the money based on the \nmerits.'' ``It,'' meaning the funding under the recovery bill, ``is not \nan earmark.''\n  The Essential Air Service Program, which as many here know was \ncreated by Congress in 1978 to help small airports--we have a lot of \nthem in Pennsylvania, and we need them--to survive after airline \nderegulation. That is the primary source of Federal funding for the \nairport in this case, not an earmark, not a congressional earmark.\n  According to Congressional Quarterly, more than 150 airports across \nthe country qualify for this assistance and many of the 150 airports \nhave a higher per-passenger subsidy with lower passenger loads than the \nairport we are talking about here, the Johnstown Airport.\n  Let me say in conclusion, the city of Johnstown, as well as the wider \nCambria County region but especially this county--and so many places \nhave been hit hard in this recession, but historically this particular \ncommunity has been hit very hard. In the 14 labor regions of our State \nwhere they measure unemployment, very often the Johnstown labor market \nhas the highest in the State. If it is not the highest unemployment, it \nis often in the top three. This is a community that has suffered \ntremendously over many decades with job loss.\n  When we consider what happens when people go to an airport, sometimes \nit is not just civilians. A lot of military personnel leave from an \nairport such as this. Johnstown, PA, including Cambria County, PA, has \ntransported on a per capita basis as many or more soldiers in Iraq, for \nexample, than almost anyplace in the country.\n  So this is a community that has contributed mightily to the success \nof this country under adverse economic circumstances. The least we \nshould do is not target this community and target this airport in the \nmidst of a debate on such a significant Transportation appropriations \nbill.\n  So we are grateful for this opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on the \npending amendment relating to the Mount Washington Community \nDevelopment Corporation. There has been an effort to delete an \nappropriation of $200,000 to help the Mount Washington Community \nDevelopment Corporation clean up and remove hazardous waste and prepare \nthe site for future development.\n  In phase I, there will be a cleanup of asbestos and hazardous waste, \nwith a total cost of $1.2 million. On phase II, there will be \nconstruction for a total cost of $90 million to $100 million.\n  The project is a brownfield redevelopment site preparation for the \nfuture construction of One Grandview Avenue in the city of Pittsburgh.\n  The site currently includes a blighted structure in a state of total \ndisrepair. The dilapidated building has been vacant since 1979 and was \nrecently condemned by the city of Pittsburgh.\n  Historically, this property has been the hub of illegal activities \nand has been a public safety hazard for the city. Since 1989, there \nhave been over 30 documented incidents of assault, vandalism, and theft \nat the location.\n  The residents of the area have signed a petition in favor of the \nGrandview apartment development, which cites the chaotic history of \nthis particular locale. Three hundred people have signed on urging that \nthe development take place, and the petition reads in part:\n\n       Since the summer of 2008, the developer and his \n     representatives have attended countless meetings with the \n     MWCDC [the development project].\n\n  It goes on to recite the details of what is needed there. What the \n$200,000 will be designed for is, arguably, a responsibility of the \nFederal Government for failure to take steps to avoid that kind of \ncontamination or, once the contamination occurs, to make remedial \naction to improve it. The total cost is going to be in the neighborhood \nof $1.2 million. The Federal contribution, which we are asking for on \nthis earmark, is, I submit, a very modest matter and a good reason for \nthe Federal Government to undertake greater responsibility than \n$200,000.\n  In addition to the citizens, the request has been made by the mayor \nof the city of Pittsburgh. I ask unanimous consent that the petition \nfrom his chief of staff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Petition in Support of the One Grandview Avenue Development\n\n       We the undersigned hereby support the development at One \n     Grandview Avenue (the location of the former Edge restaurant) \n     proposed by Mr. Steve Beemsterboer.\n       Since the summer of 2008, the developer and his \n     representatives have attended countless meetings with the \n     MWCDC and individual residents concerned about implications \n     of this development. Mr. Beemsterboer\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\n     has had many private meetings with residents who have had the \n     most concerns about this project, and countless times, the \n     developer has responded to concerns of size and scale, storm \n     water runoff, height, traffic flow and property values. The \n     developer has gone out of his way to listen to concerns and \n     make changes to his plans to accomodate a few residents. As \n     an example, the size and scope of the proposed development \n     has changed three (3) times due to the concerns of a few \n     residents.\n       The former Edge restaurant has been vacant for three (3) \n     decades. It has sat condemned by the city of Pittsburgh for \n     over one (1) year. Historically, the property has been a hub \n     for illegal activity and has been a public safety hazard for \n     the City of Pittsburgh for 30 years. Since 1989, there have \n     been over 30 documented incidents of assault, vadalism and \n     theft at the location, not to mention countless accounts of \n     suspicious and illegal activities like drug deals and \n     prostitition.\n       There have been many development plans for the former Edge \n     restaurant over the years, but resident resistance has been \n     strong. In fact, so strong, the community put an end to plans \n     for a Ritz Carlton. That was several years ago, and things \n     are different today.\n       There will be hundreds of City residents upset and outraged \n     if the developer meets all of the city's code and legal \n     requirements and somehow cannot get this project moving \n     forward. Our City leaders have an obligation to support the \n     neighborhoods that are asking for assistance and who are \n     collectively behind a development such as this one. The \n     community asks for your support and assurance that this \n     project will not be derailed due to a few people with \n     personal agendas.\n       Again, we the undersigned wholeheartedly support the \n     development proposed at One Grandview Avenue and expect to \n     see progress at the location.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this has also been supported by Senator \nCasey, Congressman Mike Doyle, in whose district it is, and by \nAllegheny County Executive Dan Onorato, the county council, the Mount \nWashington community, and by two representatives of the Pennsylvania \nGeneral Assembly, Senator Wayne Fontana and Representative Chelsa \nWagner.\n  It is hard to envisage a more appropriate use of $200,000 than is \npresent here. It is a clear-cut matter of looking to the Federal \nGovernment to fulfill its responsibility to an area that has become \nblighted, a waste site that should have been cleaned up a long time ago \nunder Federal law.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2410\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to the considerations on the Mount \nWashington Community Development Corporation, I am opposed to the \namendment No. 2410, which would prohibit the use of funds for the John \nMurtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport.\n  A similar amendment was defeated in the House of Representatives by a \ndecisive vote of 263 to 154. This airport supports 45,000 takeoffs and \nlandings per year.\n  The Cambria County Airport receives Federal funding from the \nEssential Air Service, a program run by the Department of \nTransportation on a formula basis to rural regions. The recently passed \nstimulus also provides funding but on a purely competitive basis.\n  The Johnstown Airport is one of many airports across the United \nStates that receive Essential Air Service annual funding. The current \nsubsidy is $1.4 million or just over $100 per passenger. There are 152 \nsimilar regional airports around the country, including a number in my \nState, in Altoona, Bradford, Dubois, Lancaster, and Oil City. Johnstown \nAirport ranks only 40th in the per-passenger subsidies.\n  The majority of the $150 million that critics cite was funded for \nmilitary purposes.\n  There are over 1,000 Guard and Reserve troops stationed at the \nairport, and they use these facilities daily. These troops have been \ninvolved in over 19 overseas deployments in the last 5 years alone to \nIraq, Afghanistan, and other areas around the world. The upgrades \nfunded in previous years were essential to keep these troops in a \nproper state of readiness to sustain such a high rate of deployment.\n  National Guard LTC Christopher Cleaver had this to say:\n\n       The airport is a vital part of the Guard's strategic \n     deployment plans. In today's climate of warfare, it's \n     extremely prudent to be able to move fast.\n       We have a commitment to mobilize in 96 hours. It's a great \n     advantage to have a runway at your doorstep to quickly move \n     to anywhere in the world.\n\n  On this basis, I think the appropriation is entirely warranted.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2366\n\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss my vote against \nan amendment offered to the fiscal year 2010 Transportation and Housing \nand Urban Development Appropriations bill. the amendment, offered by \nSenator Roger Wicker, would cut off funding for Amtrak unless it amends \nits current policy and allows passengers to transport firearms by March \n31, 2010. It is my understanding that Amtrak implemented the firearm \nban in 2004 after it conducted a review and evaluation of security \nmeasures following the attacks on passenger trains in Madrid on April \n11, 2004.\n  Though Amtrak ought to have authority to set policy that is in its \nbest interest, I am reluctant to support a policy that prohibits law \nabiding citizens from carrying permitted firearms. This policy was the \nsubject of a similar amendment that Senator Wicker introduced on April \n2, 2009, to the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution. The budget \nresolution established a reserve fund for multimodal transportation \nprojects and Senator Wicker's amendment to the budget disqualified \nAmtrak from accessing this proposed reserve fund if it did not allow \npassengers to transport firearms. I supported that amendment and it \npassed 63-35. However, the passage of that amendment did not jeopardize \nAmtrak's regular annual appropriation.\n  On the other hand, Senator Wicker's amendment on September 16, 2009, \nto the Appropriations bill may ultimately result in a complete cutoff \nof Federal funding for Amtrak. The legislation we are considering \nincludes $1.574 billion for Amtrak and this funding is critical to \nmaintaining our national passenger rail system. Amtrak provides a vital \nservice for the entire Nation and I have consistently advocated for \nrobust Federal funding to support its operations. Cutting off Federal \nfunding would cause passenger rail operations to cease and deprive \nmillions of Americans from an important mode of transportation. I am \nnot willing to risk stranding Amtrak users in order to compel Amtrak to \namend its firearm policy.\n  We ought to consider Amtrak's firearm policy independently from the \nappropriations process. Should Congress decide to mandate a revision to \nthis policy, Amtrak ought to be given sufficient time to ensure it has \nproper personnel and infrastructure in place without the threat of \nfunding cuts for not meeting an unrealistic implementation deadline.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to describe an amendment I have introduced \nto the fiscal year 2010 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations bill. This amendment preserves \nfunding which has already been secured for a critical project in \nPennsylvania.\n  The corridor along U.S. route 422 in southeastern Pennsylvania has \nexperienced rapid population growth over the past decade including many \ndaily commuters to Philadelphia. This population expansion has led to \nsignificant congestion along route 422 in Montgomery and Berks \nCounties. Transportation officials and community leaders in the area \nhave for years worked diligently developing proposals to mitigate the \ncongestion and expand mobility options for residents living along the \ncorridor.\n  The community has made considerable progress in this effort over the \npast 2 years, including completion in 2008 of a study to consider the \nfeasibility of extending an existing rail line and commencement in 2009 \nof a study to explore long-term financing options for a commuter rail \nsystem and maintenance of route 422. Additionally, on August 24, 2009, \nTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood joined me for a roundtable meeting \nwith local public officials and transportation leaders to discuss the \nproblem and these recent developments.\n  The amendment I have introduced would simply preserve funding that \nwas included in appropriation bills from previous years to support the \nlocal effort in this important undertaking.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9416]]\n\n Amendment Nos. 2402, as Modified, No. 2405, as Modified, and No. 2415\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have managers' amendments at the \ndesk--amendment No. 2402, as modified; 2405, as modified; and 2415. I \nask unanimous consent that the amendments be considered and agreed to \nen bloc, and the motions to reconsider be considered laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 2402, as modified\n\n    (Purpose: To provide that amounts in the bill provided for the \nTransportation Planning, Research and Development program shall be used \n  for the development, coordination, and analysis of data collection \n             procedures and national performance measures)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___.  Such amounts as are required from amounts \n     provided in this Act to the Office of the Secretary of \n     Transportation for the Transportation Planning, Research and \n     Development program may be used for the development, \n     coordination, and analysis of data collection procedures and \n     national performance measures.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2405, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To provide the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development the \n     authority to use previously appropriated funds to prevent the \n        termination of housing assistance to eligible families)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n               Motion to Recommit with Amendment No. 2421\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment for the purpose of sending a motion to recommit with \ninstructions to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] moves to recommit the \n     act H.R. 3288 to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate forthwith \n     with the following amendment No. 2421.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (1) Any amounts that are unobligated amounts for fiscal \n     year 2010 for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that \n     are available in a non-highway account receiving funds in \n     this Act for fiscal year 2010 are rescinded.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take just a moment to explain what \nthis motion is. It is very simple. Incidentally, I wish to say at the \noutset that because of the way it reads, as the clerk read, \n``forthwith,'' there is no intention in this motion to delay the bill \nwhatsoever. It requires the committee to report back forthwith.\n  Although I believe the discretionary spending increase in this bill, \nwhich is 23 percent above last year's level, excluding the stimulus \nbill, is far too high, my motion does not touch spending in this \nappropriations bill.\n  Let me repeat that. This amendment does not change in any way the \nspending in this appropriations bill. My motion simply instructs that \nthe bill be sent back to the Appropriations Committee so it can be \namended and sent back here forthwith to provide for rescissions of any \namounts that are unobligated for the fiscal year 2010 in the stimulus \nbill that are available in nonhighway spending accounts. In other \nwords, whatever has not been obligated under the stimulus and relates \nto the spending in this appropriations bill that is duplicative of that \nspending and does not relate to highway spending would be rescinded.\n  Why is it necessary? The stimulus, I do not believe, has provided \nwhat was promised--namely, jobs. A report at the end of August issued \nby the President's Chief Economist, Christina Romer, found that only \n$151.4 billion of the original $787 billion had been spent. The real \ntotal cost of the stimulus is over $1.1 trillion when you include \ninterest.\n  That is a mere 19.2 percent--less than a quarter of the total \npackage. In other words, the majority of this funding will be spent \nover the next several years, by which time the recession, hopefully, \nwill be long over.\n  The administration claimed this spending would halt the unemployment \nlevel at 8 percent. Seven months after we passed the stimulus, \nunemployment levels are now at 9.7 percent and growing. We have lost \nover 2 million jobs.\n  I know the administration likes to say the stimulus has saved or \ncreated 1 million jobs, but most people recognize there is no way to \nmeasure saved jobs. In fact, Christina Romer stated recently:\n\n       You know, it's very hard to say exactly what the jobs \n     effect is because you don't know what the baseline is.\n\n  My point is this: This discussion of the wasteful and nonjob-\nproducing stimulus is important to this bill because our Nation is \nabout to hit its debt ceiling of $12.1 trillion in October. This \nCongress will have to, again, raise the debt limit after having done so \nthrough the so-called stimulus. The public debt level is currently at \n$11.8 trillion.\n  This motion will lead to more than $11.6 billion in savings, which is \nless than 1 percent of our Nation's debt level. But we need to start \nsomewhere, sometime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which, to reiterate, \ndoes not take one dime out of this appropriations bill. It simply says \nthe committee should go back and rescind from the stimulus bill any \nfunding in the stimulus bill that is duplicated in this transportation \nand housing bill as long as the money has not yet been obligated and \ndoes not relate to highway spending. We would save about $11 billion. \nThat is a good thing to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion when we are able to call \nit up and vote on it.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, today, this Senate will act on a sweeping \nTransportation appropriations bill. My colleagues have spoken about \nthis measure as an important part of the Federal budget for 2010. And \nthey are right. This is sound fiscal policy that represents an \ninvestment in transportation and infrastructure. But we are also \ntalking about much more than Federal spending over the next year. With \nthis legislation, we are plotting a course for America's future. We are \ninvesting in public transportation projects and laying the groundwork \nfor high-speed rail. We are developing renewable energy sources such as \nbiodiesel and ethanol, which will allow us to keep efficient cars and \ntrucks on America's roads. All of these efforts will help us achieve \nenergy independence and protect the environment. So this bill has \nimplications far beyond the next fiscal year. It is the beginning of a \nmajor step toward our new renewable energy paradigm. Let's talk about \nwhat that means for America.\n  As a Chicagoan, I am fortunate to live in a city with a world-class \npublic transportation system. Millions of people ride the CTA trains \nand buses every year. This reduces traffic on the streets, cuts \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and saves money. Unfortunately, it also \nplaces a strain on the existing infrastructure. That is why we need to \nincrease our support for the CTA and other public transportation \nsystems across the country. We need to help the CTA and similar \nagencies expand service, refurbish aging infrastructure, and continue \nto operate safely. This will make our cities more accessible for \neveryone. It will help usher all urban centers into a new era of \nprosperity.\n  But we should not stop there. It is time to renew our focus on \ntransportation between cities and towns. As just about anyone can tell \nyou, America's highways are heavily congested. Additional roads would \nbe expensive to build, and they wouldn't make it any easier to get \naround. We need a solution that is both affordable and energy\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\nefficient. For me, this means only one thing: high-speed rail.\n  I am proud to be a member of the Midwest High Speed Rail Association. \nAnd I believe it is time to weave this country together, from coast to \ncoast, with a new network of clean, safe high-speed trains. This will \ncreate thousands of jobs, serving as a boon to the national economy. It \nwill also save money. Laying track is four times cheaper than building \nhighways, and railroads can transport up to five times as many people. \nThere is no question that high-speed rail will increase the ease and \naffordability of travel between States. This will bring fresh \nopportunity to every community, large or small, that touches the new \nrail lines.\n  Mr. President, 140 years ago, the great American railway first \nconnected the east coast to the west coast. Rail travel helped give \ndefinition to this country. It is an integral part of America's past. \nAnd it will be just as important to America's future.\n  This Transportation bill funds important projects and initiatives \nlike these, all across the country. But it is about more than public \ntransportation. It also helps to lay the groundwork for a renewable \nenergy paradigm. It is a blueprint to create jobs, protect the \nenvironment, and save money.\n  If we pass this legislation, it will be a significant step in the \nright direction. And if we build upon this progress in the years to \ncome, we can secure a brighter future for ourselves and for our \nchildren, because it's not just a matter of dollars and cents, and it's \nnot just about jobs or the environment. It is about all of that, and it \nis about national security. It is about reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil. It is about renewable energy, safer modes of \ntransportation, and an electric grid that is more secure and more \nefficient. This Transportation bill is a piece of that puzzle. It is a \ngreat start. So I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this \nmeasure. Let's invest in America's future once again.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that except for \nthe amendments provided for in this agreement, no further amendments be \nin order to H.R. 3288; that the following be the only first-degree \namendments and motion to recommit remaining in order to H.R. 3288; that \nsecond-degree amendments which are relevant to the first-degree to \nwhich offered be in order but not prior to a vote in relation to the \nfirst-degree amendment; that the listed Kyl motion to recommit be the \nonly motion to recommit in order, except motions to reconsider votes or \nmotions to waive applicable budget points of order; that a managers' \namendment that has been cleared by the managers and the leaders also be \nin order, and that if the amendment is offered, then it be considered \nand agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table; Landrieu amendment No. 2365, which is pending; Vitter \namendment No. 2359, pending and as modified; DeMint amendment No. 2410, \npending; McCain amendment No. 2403, pending, as modified; Kyl motion to \nrecommit with instructions, pending; that upon disposition of the \namendments and the motion to recommit, the substitute amendment, as \namended, if amended, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; that the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and the Senate then proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand that the subcommittee and Senators Inouye and Cochran be appointed \nas conferees; further, that if a point of order is raised against the \nsubstitute amendment, it be in order for another substitute amendment \nto be offered, minus the offending provisions but including any \namendments which had been agreed to prior to the point of order; that \nno further amendments be in order; that the new substitute amendment, \nas amended, if amended, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; that the remaining provisions \nbeyond adoption of the substitute amendment remain in effect; that on \nThursday, September 17, following a period of morning business, the \nSenate then resume consideration of H.R. 3288 and proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendments and motion as specified above, with 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled prior to each vote, \nand that after the first vote in a sequence, the remaining votes be \nlimited to 10 minutes each; further, that the cloture motion be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But with this \nagreement, all those amendments will be voted on tomorrow morning, as \nwill be announced at the end of the session today.\n  Mr. President, just to let all Senators know, with this agreement, \nthere will be no further rollcall votes tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9417-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I rise--and soon will be joined by \nSenate colleagues, Senators McCain and Graham--to speak about the war \nin Afghanistan.\n  For the first time since 9/11, a national debate is underway about \nthe future of our fight in Afghanistan. This is appropriate. Whenever \nour Nation sends our brave men and women in uniform into harm's way, it \nis both natural and necessary that we should have a vigorous national \nconversation about why we are doing so, whether it is necessary for our \nnational security, and what the right strategy is to achieve our \nobjectives. The truth is, we have not had such a debate since the \ndecision was made unanimously to go into Afghanistan after 9/11 to \noverthrow the Taliban, which had given safe haven to al-Qaida, which \nplanned and trained for the attacks on us in Afghanistan.\n  The most direct answer to the question of why we are fighting in \nAfghanistan and why we must succeed there is exactly that: Afghanistan \nis where the attacks of 9/11 originated, where al-Qaida made its \nsanctuary under the Taliban, and where the same Taliban is on the \noffensive today in Afghanistan and has seized the initiative with the \nclear aim of gaining control of all of Afghanistan, or major parts of \nit, and once again providing sanctuary for al-Qaida. It remains self-\nevident to be a clear and vital national interest of the United States \nto prevent this from happening. It is also because, although \nAfghanistan may seem geographically remote, we found out on September \n11, 2001, in this modern technological world where great spaces are \npassed over quickly, that it is not remote when it comes to the safety \nand security of the American people, and Afghanistan is in the heart of \na region in which we have critical national interests.\n  The fact is, Afghanistan and Pakistan are today at the epicenter of \nglobal Islamist extremism and terrorism, with which we are at war. This \nis the test of our age so far as our security is concerned.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it true that yesterday, when we had the hearing with \nAdmiral Mullen for renomination as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and who I think we would all agree has done an outstanding job \nof serving our\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\ncountry, it was pretty clear that Admiral Mullen felt a sense of \nurgency for us to act in Afghanistan because al-Qaida and the Taliban--\nespecially the Taliban--are making inroads and we, in his words, are \nnot seeing the progress we want, that we are losing, basically, in \nAfghanistan?\n  Didn't he say to you and to Senator Graham such that the important \nthing is that time is not on our side and we need to get troops over \nthere as quickly as possible, in keeping with the strategy that was \ndevised in March of this year and agreed to by the President? That was \nmy understanding.\n  And Senator Graham said: OK, now as to the civilians, I just got back \nfrom a visit. I appreciate all our civilians who are over there from \ndifferent agencies. They are very brave, but, quite honestly, they \ncan't go anywhere.\n  Admiral Mullen said: Right.\n  Senator Graham said: You could send 10,000 lawyers from the State \nDepartment to deal with rural law programs, but they are sitting on the \nbase because if they leave the base, they are going to get shot.\n  Admiral Mullen:\n  Right.\n  Then Graham said:\n\n       The only way to get off the base is if they have a military \n     convoy, is that right?\n\n  Mullen said:\n  Right.\n  Senator Graham said:\n\n       So I just want our colleagues to know the security \n     environment in Afghanistan, from my point of view, will \n     prevent any civilian success until we change the security \n     environment. How long would it take to train enough Afghan \n     troops to change the momentum, in your view, if we did it \n     just with Afghan forces?\n\n  And he said:\n\n       Two or three years.\n\n  Then Senator Graham said:\n\n       What will happen in that two or three year period in terms \n     of the security environment while we are training.\n\n  Mullen said:\n\n       If it's just training?\n\n  Graham said:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  Mullen said:\n\n       I think the security environment will continue to \n     deteriorate.\n\n  I ask my friend, doesn't that lend urgency, which is certainly not \napparent in the President's statement today? After meeting with the \nCanadian Prime Minister, basically saying he is going to go through a \nlong process of evaluation and another strategy, claiming he didn't \nhave one before. That is what is disturbing, is the total lack of \nurgency in the President's statement today.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, I was \nsurprised and puzzled by that statement of the President today, \nparticularly because the President, I think, has been very strong about \nAfghanistan. He has called Afghanistan a war of necessity--for the \nreason that I said, because we cannot allow al-Qaida and the Taliban to \ncome back into control. Forgive the analogy, but anymore than after \nWorld War II if the Nazis had somehow reassembled and attempted to \nretake control of part or all of Germany, we would have sat back? We \nsimply cannot let that happen.\n  We also know if Afghanistan falls, if we accept defeat or for some \nreason retreat from Afghanistan, it will profoundly destabilize \nneighboring nuclear Pakistan and encourage the Islamist extremists \nthroughout that region and the world.\n  My friend from Arizona is right. There is a sense of urgency that he \nand our colleague and friend from South Carolina, Senator Graham, who \nis on the floor, saw when we visited with General McChrystal and \nAdmiral Eikberry and the Afghan national security leadership a month \nago. Admiral Mullen yesterday said we have lost the initiative in \nAfghanistan. It is why President Obama deployed the additional 21,000 \ntroops in March and announced this new strategy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question quickly?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true this is where the contradiction is? It is \nso paradoxical it is hard for me to comprehend. Admiral Mullen--in a \nquestion I said:\n\n       Admiral Mullen, didn't you say ``time is not on your \n     side''?\n\n  Admiral Mullen:\n\n       No, sir, I have a sense of urgency about this. I worry a \n     great deal that the clock is moving very rapidly and there \n     are lots of clocks, as you know. But the sense of urgency--\n     and I, believe me, share that with General McChrystal who, \n     while he is very focused on the change which includes \n     partner--focus on the Afghan people, he is alarmed by the \n     insurgency; he is in a position where he needs to retake the \n     initiative from the insurgents who have grabbed over the last \n     3 years.\n\n  Then to contrast that with the President's statement today he said:\n\n       I am absolutely clear, you have to get the strategy right \n     and then make determinations about resources. You don't make \n     determinations about resources--certainly you don't make \n     determinations about sending young men and women into battle \n     without having absolute clarity about what the strategy is \n     going to be.\n\n  He said:\n\n       My determination is to get this right and that means broad \n     consultation not only inside the U.S. government but also our \n     ISAP partners and our NATO allies, and I am going to take a \n     very deliberate process in making these decisions.\n\n  I don't know what to make of that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I think the statement by our top uniformed military \nofficer, ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nreflects what General McChrystal and everybody on the ground in \nAfghanistan has said, this is an urgent matter. The President \nrecognized that when he sent the 21,000 additional troops.\n  Most everybody in this Chamber and in the House will accept the fact \nthat it would have a devastating effect on America's national security \nand the security of the world if we lost Afghanistan. But then comes \nthe question--incidentally, President Obama himself said this in a \nstatement he made a while ago. He said we cannot muddle through in \nAfghanistan. It requires a decisive commitment to achieve victory.\n  We learned that in Iraq. Counterinsurgency, such as we are involved \nin in Afghanistan, is manpower intensive.\n  That is the question the administration and we here in Congress have. \nIf you agree it is in the vital national security interests of the \nUnited States to succeed in Afghanistan, then you have to decide how we \ncan best do that. To me the answer is clear. We need more troops there, \nAmerican troops, while the Afghans are being trained to take over \nthemselves. They cannot just be trainers. As Admiral Mullen made clear \nyesterday, they need to be combat troops. They need to be combat troops \nbecause, without the security that the American combat troops can \nsingularly and uniquely provide in the short term, there cannot even be \ntraining of the Afghans. There certainly cannot be governance as we \nknow it and there cannot be a prospect for economic development.\n  We need to make this decision soon. Weather has an effect.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will yield to my friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As I understood the situation, in the last couple of \nmonths casualties among American forces are at an all-time high since \nthe invasion. Do you agree with that, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That unfortunately is true.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is also my understanding that IED attacks by the enemy \nhave gone up about 1,000 percent and in reaction to that, Secretary \nGates has sent 3,000 people over to deal with the IED problem. From my \nunderstanding of the testimony yesterday, Admiral Mullen said the force \nstructure we have in place, between the combination of coalition forces \nand Afghan forces, is not enough to reverse the trends and to regain \nlost momentum. I thought it was pretty clear that he was telling us \nsomething has to change beyond training the Afghan Army.\n  Would you agree that the longer we leave people in that environment, \nwhere the momentum is on the enemy's side, we are doing a great \ndisservice to the 68,000 people who are there? And if you are going to \nsend troops, send them while it matters, send them in enough number to \nsave lives and get the job over sooner rather than later? That is what \nI think all three of us are saying.\n  Mr. President, we appreciate your commitment in Afghanistan. Sending \ntroops to get the election conducted\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\nwas a wise move. Understanding that Afghanistan is the central battle \nin the overall war on terror now is a deep understanding on the \nPresident's part. The only thing we are saying, the three of us and I \nthink others, is that our military commanders have told us we have lost \nmomentum and the only way to get it back in the short term is more \ncombat power, and every day that we wait makes it much harder for those \nwho are in theatre, and they are dying at levels and being injured at \nlevels we have not known before. That is what drives our thinking. \nWould you agree with that?\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am totally in agreement with my friend from South \nCarolina. This in fact is the lesson we should have learned and I think \ndid learn in Iraq. When did the number of American casualties in Iraq \nbegin to go down? It was when we sent more American troops there. \nBecause the addition of American troops, and a new strategy--not just \nthe numbers but a new strategy, a strategy quite similar to the new \nstrategy we have in Afghanistan--protects the civilian population, \ngives them the confidence that we are not leaving. When you do that, \nsomething significant happens. It happened in Iraq and it will happen \nin Afghanistan. When we commit more troops, the people in the country \ndecide we are not going to cut and run.\n  The Afghan people despise the Taliban. The progress the Taliban is \nmaking in controlling more land in Afghanistan is totally the result of \nviolence and intimidation. The Afghan people, however, are watching us \nand wondering are we going to begin to pull back? Should they hedge \ntheir bets? Should they be careful not to join the fight against the \nTaliban?\n  If we begin to sound an uncertain trumpet--you remember that phrase \nfrom Scriptures: ``If the sound of the trumpet is uncertain, who will \nfollow into battle?'' I will tell you one group that will not follow \ninto battle if America begins to sound an uncertain trumpet in \nAfghanistan is the people of Afghanistan. We have a desire now that \nmost everybody here shares. Let's break some of the Taliban away, the \nones who are not zealots, the ones who, in a sense are foot soldiers, \nfollowers. They are the comparable group to the Sons of Iraq in Anbar \nProvince. But when did the Sons of Iraq decide they were going to turn \nagainst al-Qaida? When we convinced them we were going to stay in Anbar \nand protect them.\n  In fact, how did we convince them? By sending more troops. It was \nafter that the Iraqi security forces grew in capability, that the \nAmerican casualties went down.\n  I would say to my friend, he has touched a very important point here. \nThe only way we will reduce American casualties, which are now going \nup, and create an environment in which more Afghans will join the war \nagainst the Taliban and al-Qaida is for us to give them the confidence \nwe are not going to leave. The best way we can do that and provide the \nsecurity to do that is by sending more troops.\n  Incidentally, a final word and then I will yield to my friend from \nSouth Carolina. There are those, including my dear friend and respected \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, who are \nfocused on sending more Americans only for training purposes, not \ncombat troops. But here is something else we learned in Iraq. The fact \nis you need more than trainers to train the indigenous forces. One of \nthe great tactical breakthroughs in Iraq that General McChrystal wants \nto put into effect in fact has begun in Afghanistan: There is no better \nway to train the Afghan forces than to partner them with American and \ncoalition forces in Afghanistan. It is not just sending somebody to a \nschool run by Americans to train them; it is having the Afghan units \nout there in the field, side by side, working with, fighting with, \nliving with American soldiers that is the best source of training.\n  I couldn't agree with my friends from South Carolina and Arizona \nmore. The situation in Afghanistan is a vital national interest. \nEverybody agrees with that. You can't listen to ADM Mike Mullen \nyesterday and decide the initiative is ours now. It is not. It is \nslipping away from us. The best way to regain the initiative is to send \nas many troops as we can. Listening to General McChrystal, a lot of \nthem have to be combat troops, and to do so as quickly as possible.\n  I said ``the weather'' a moment ago. The winters are harsh in \nAfghanistan. That is not to say all conflict stops, but there is a \nfighting season in Afghanistan. This year, we did not have adequate \nforces there until the new wave the President, President Obama, \ndeployed got there. They didn't get there until June. We were together \nin Helmut Province with GEN Larry Nickelson, an extraordinary Marine \ngeneral, a patriot, great soldier, great fighter, great leader. Those \nMarines are turning back the tide against the Taliban there because \nthey have the numbers.\n  And that is exactly what we have to do throughout the country. I \nthank my friend. I am glad to yield the floor to him at this time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to pick up where my colleague, Senator \nLieberman, left off. The question to ask is, how did the Taliban regain \nmomentum? How do a bunch of fighters, who do not have one airplane, no \nnavy, no heavy weapons to speak of, how could they have regained \nmomentum and begun to reoccupy parts of Afghanistan?\n  The only answer I can come up with is a vacuum has been created. That \nvacuum has two components to it: the lack of governance and not enough \ntroops to prevent the Taliban from coming back in some areas of \nAfghanistan.\n  I would submit this: If we wait to train the Afghan Army as the only \nway to stabilize Afghanistan, we are going to waste 2 or 3 years. It is \ngoing to get so bad we cannot stand the casualties, and the American \npeople will not tolerate a 2- or 3-year period of where we are just \ntraining the Afghan forces, sending them from the training cycle into \ncombat. They are going to fold, just like they did in Iraq. We cannot \ntrain an army and have them fight at the same time. We need a little \nbit of breathing space.\n  So this idea that we are going to train the Afghan Army, that is the \nway we will regain momentum against the Taliban, quite frankly will not \nwork. I think Admiral Mullen understood that. What will work is to send \nmore combat power to clear the Taliban from the areas that the Taliban \nhave reoccupied. The Marines are telling us in no uncertain terms, with \nthe right mix of troops they are delivering punishing blows to the \nTaliban. But we can send 1 million troops to Afghan and still not deal \nwith the fundamental problems they face and the world faces, the \nlegitimacy of the Afghan Government in the eyes of the Afghan people. \nThat is why the Taliban have come back because the Afghan Government \nhas failed. They have failed in almost every respect to give the Afghan \npeople the governance and the hope they need to stand up to the \nTaliban.\n  So this is one Senator who believes the way to regain lost momentum \nis to add more combat power and, yes, train the Afghan Army and police \nforce with a new strategy which we now have in place.\n  It is labor intensive. It is going to take a lot of time. We have to \nunderstand, if we get the Afghan Army up to 400,000, the whole budget \nof Afghanistan is $800 million a year. It will take $5 billion a year \nto maintain that army. We are going to end up paying. I hope the \nAmerican taxpayer understands that. But it is cheaper for us to do that \nthan it is for us to be the 400,000-person army.\n  So when it comes to cost, it is better to train them and help them \nwith their training and funding than it is for us to stay over there in \nlarge numbers forever. But we are going to have to plus up to regain \nlost momentum. Then we are going to have to focus on the real cause of \nthe deterioration--governance.\n  The Karzai government has failed in many ways. Corruption is rampant. \nIf, in the next 6 months, some major figures in Afghanistan are not \nprosecuted for ripping off the Afghan people, then nothing will ever \nchange over there.\n  I have been a military lawyer serving as a reservist in Afghanistan. \nI can tell you that everyone who has looked at the Rule of Law Programs \nwill tell you that corruption, narcotics corruption,\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\nis rampant in that country. They need a legal system in Afghanistan \nthat can stand up to the corruption. That means we have to protect the \njudges from being assassinated; we have to build capacity.\n  There are less than 500 lawyers in all of Afghanistan. There are \n16,000 people in jail. Most of them went to jail without ever seeing a \nlawyer. We have our work cut out for us. We need benchmarks and \nmeasurements so I can go back to South Carolina and every Senator can \ngo back to their constituents and say: We are not throwing good money \nafter bad. We are going to push the Afghan Government to prosecute \ncorruption, to provide security for judges, to find a way to empower \nthe economy beyond the drug trade, and start making hard decisions \nabout how tribal justice systems can be incorporated into the formal \njustice system.\n  There are so many decisions that politicians in Afghanistan have \nfailed to make that have allowed the Taliban to come back. We need to \nput them on notice that with new resources and new troops, a new \ndynamic will be in place, and they will be making the decisions \nnecessary to provide governance to their people. If they fail to do \nthat, then they will not have our support because, at the end of the \nday, they have to want it more than we do.\n  Senator Lieberman is right about this. The good news amidst all of \nthis bad news is the Taliban is very much reviled and hated in the \ncountry. But put yourselves in one of these villages out in the middle \nof Afghanistan. What would you do, knowing that by night the Taliban \ncomes in and rains terror? We have to replace that dynamic and give the \npeople assurance that we are not only going to provide them security \nbut the Afghan Government is going to provide them schooling and \neducation, health care, and some hope.\n  Finally, I cannot tell you that we will succeed with more troops. I \ncan tell you, we will fail if we do not send more troops. It is so much \nharder in Afghanistan than in many ways it is in Iraq. We are not the \nRussians. We are not the British. This is not Vietnam. This is not \nIraq.\n  This is Afghanistan where 9/11 was planned and executed. We can get \nthis right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield so I can ask a question? I see we \nhave one of our colleagues waiting to speak.\n  I wonder what the Senator thinks. We held a hearing yesterday with \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is highly regarded. He \nconveys to every questioner, no matter which Member it is, a sense of \nurgency because of his belief and that of our military commanders on \nthe ground that we are not winning.\n  In fact, in the words of Admiral Mullen: Time is not on our side.\n  Yet today, the President of the United States came out, after meeting \nwith the Canadian Prime Minister, and basically said he is--after his \nspokesperson said he is going to take weeks and weeks to make a \ndecision, he came out and basically said there is not a sense of \nurgency; that the strategy that was developed in March was not the \noperative strategy, even though Admiral Mullen said the March strategy \nwas the operative strategy, and all we need to do is fill in the \nresources and the strategy.\n  My question to my friend from South Carolina is, how do you account \nfor this apparent contradiction or difference in view about the sense \nof urgency that exists in the conflict in Afghanistan?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, the one thing I can tell you is Admiral Mullen is \ngoing to be reappointed with probably every person in this body voting \nfor him because he has gained our trust, and it speaks well of the \nPresident that he would renominate him. So he has obviously gained the \nPresident's trust.\n  I am not a military commander. But I do not have to be much of a \nmilitary expert to understand his testimony. His testimony was pretty \nclear: We have lost momentum. The Taliban is reemerging, stronger than \never, and the capability of the coalition forces and the Afghan Army \nand security forces combined cannot reverse the momentum. Something new \nhas to happen.\n  When we put on the table training the Afghan Army without additional \ncombat power, how long would it take before they could have enough \nnumbers to change things? Two or three years.\n  What would happen during that training period? It would deteriorate \nfurther.\n  What did he tell us? The pathway forward is that we have a new \nstrategy, it needs to be properly resourced. I think what he was \ntelling us more than anything else is that time is not on our side. \nCasualties in July and August were at an all-time high. We have 68,000 \npeople wearing our uniform in Afghanistan who are getting killed in \nlarger numbers than ever, and the dynamic on the ground will not change \nthe momentum. To do nothing puts them in an environment where they are \ngoing to get killed in higher numbers, and what Admiral Mullen is \ntelling us, and I hope the President will listen, is that time is not \non our side, but, more importantly, it is not on their side.\n\n  This decision about troops, to me, is pretty easy. We need more, but \ntroops alone will not fix Afghanistan. But without more troops in a \nhurry and with a sense of urgency, we are going to let the Taliban get \nstronger, the Afghan people are going to get weaker in their resolve, \nand more Americans are going to die than if we had more troops.\n  That is what I got out of the hearing. I hope the President is \nlistening.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, I also would ask my colleague, have we forgotten \nthe lessons of history? We were there and we assisted the Afghans in \ndriving out the Russians. Our assistance was critical. The Russians \nleft and we left.\n  When we left, it left a vacuum that ended up with the fighting \nbetween warlords, and the Taliban filled the vacuum, the Taliban had an \narrangement with al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden, and the terrorists who \nattacked us on 9/11--which we just commemorated--were able to be \ntrained in Afghanistan.\n  I hope our memories are not so short that we are willing to risk a \nrepetition of that kind of threat, which the President, during the \ncampaign, seemed to recognize very accurately; called it the ``good \nwar.'' He said it ``was a war we had to win,'' ``do what is necessary \nto win.''\n  Now I worry--I wonder if my colleague does--that every day we delay \ndoing what we all know is necessary puts the lives of young Americans \nwho are already there at risk and makes it a longer period of time \nbefore we can prevail.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The last thought about that: I think our memory, the \nevent that we need to remember is even later than 9/11. It is actually \nin Iraq. I remember very well this whole debate, and I would urge this \nadministration not to do what the last administration did. That is \nexactly what is going on in Afghanistan right now. It is as if we have \nlearned nothing.\n  It is clear, just as it was in Iraq, that we did not have enough \ncombat power to secure the country, not enough mentoring programs to \nactually train the Iraqi Army, and only when we changed the strategy of \nadding more troops and gave the Iraqi people and the army some \nbreathing space, the politicians, from the violence did things change. \nIt is exactly the same thing here.\n  But right now we have a dynamic on the ground that is not much \ndifferent from Iraq the first 3 years after the fall of Saddam Hussein. \nIt is clear that Admiral Mullen recognizes that. The new strategy in \nMarch is a counterinsurgency strategy, and Senator McCain, the one \nthing I remember is numbers matter. We need enough troops per \npopulation center to effect change, and we do not have the ratios to \nenact an effective counterinsurgency strategy unless we add more \ntroops, and that means more than just trainers.\n  So my frustration is, as you said yesterday: We have seen this movie \nbefore. We are putting 68,000 troops in harm's way, and unless we \nproperly resource them, give them more assistance, more people to help \nthem fight, they are not going to change the battle momentum, and they \nare going to get killed in the process.\n  There is not enough people to effect the counterinsurgency strategy, \njust like there was not enough in Iraq. Have we learned nothing? So \nlet's act.\n  Mr. President, we will support you to the nth degree to get the \ncombat power and the trainers and the civilians into Afghanistan to \nturn this place around. But the sooner you act, the quicker we\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\ncan do it, and the sooner we will come home and the less lives we will \nlose in the long run. That is our message.\n  We respect you. You are the Commander in Chief. You won the election. \nBut you have an opportunity, and it is clear to me that we are losing \nmomentum. This is not a time to deliberate. This is a time to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9421-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9421-S9422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about \nthree amendments to the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill. I do \nwish to comment on the Afghan discussion and thank my colleagues who \njust spoke so eloquently. All three have been leaders on the issue of \ninternational engagements. I hope the Senators, particularly Senator \nMcCain and Senator Graham, as we contemplate the right moves forward, \nwill think about and be willing to fund nonmilitary programs as well. \nMany such programs have been shown, in front of the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee, through testimony given by \nSecretary Gates himself, as well as many military leaders, to actually \nhelp reduce violence by supporting development in Afghan villages, \nempowering individuals, particularly women in Afghanistan who, with a \nlittle bit of help and a little bit of support, can be the strength and \ncement that holds communities together. Educating girls is an important \nstrategy.\n  One thing we have learned from the failed policies of the previous \nadministration is that we have to use both hard and soft power \ncombined, to make it smarter so we can actually win some of these \nbattles. That is probably what President Obama and his team are \nthinking about: How do we unite the Congress, get past partisan \nrhetoric, and come up with a smart strategy to win in Afghanistan. In \nthat way we might not only protect our troops, but we might be able to \nget them home a little bit sooner. I am sure that is what the President \nis thinking about. I look forward to working with Senators Lieberman, \nMcCain, and Graham as we move forward, hopefully, in a bipartisan \nfashion, to protect our troops and to win in a place that we most \ncertainly need to and keep the Taliban at bay.\n  I came to talk about three amendments. One is an amendment I have \npending. It is amendment No. 2365. I see my colleague, Senator \nHutchison, is in the Chamber. She is a cosponsor of the amendment. \nAlthough we are not going to vote on it tonight, I wished to speak for \na moment about the amendment. Unfortunately, I will be away from the \nSenate tomorrow for a longstanding commitment. Tomorrow I will deliver \na speech that I promised to give on behalf of Senator Domenici in New \nMexico, so I will not be here for the vote. But I know my colleagues \nwho are supporting this amendment will stand in and carry the torch.\n  My amendment will help disaster-stricken communities in Texas, \nLouisiana, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Arkansas, \nTennessee, Florida and California. Congress appropriated $6.5 billion \nin a Community Development Block Grant for the series of disasters that \nafflicted these states in 2008. The problem was, that in this \nparticular allocation, we prohibited these communities from using that \nmoney to match other Federal moneys that might be available, which \nmakes no sense. Congress has appropriated funds using the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant to respond to 19 other disasters, and virtually \nnever resorted to adding such a prohibition.\n  What my amendment will do is revert to the regular language so that \ncommunities, such as Galveston--I see my colleague Senator Hutchison \nhere. She and I will be together in Galveston on Friday to monitor \nrecovery efforts there and she has been such a leader in this effort. \nHowever, there are still many communities in New Orleans and in \nsouthwest Louisiana and other parts of south Louisiana for which this \namendment is crucial. It doesn't add money to the bill. It just allows \nus to use money more intelligently.\n  For communities that are struggling not just because of disasters but \nbecause of the atmosphere of tough economic times, it gives local and \nState leaders a little bit more flexibility to pull down some of the \nFederal money that has already been allocated to communities that need \nit the most. It is amendment No. 2365. Senator Grassley is supportive, \nas are Senator Murray and Senator Bond. I thank them so much. We will \nconsider that amendment tomorrow.\n  Now I want to turn to a new topic and I wish to speak against an \namendment offered by my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter, that \nwill be considered tomorrow. I will not be here to vote against this \namendment but will submit a statement for the Record. I strongly oppose \nthat amendment--amendment number 2359, which will be voted on tomorrow.\n  This is an amendment I oppose for two reasons. No. 1, it is bad \npolicy. The other reason I am against it is because this amendment only \ndeals with public housing residents and other HUD-housing assistance \nrecipients in the city of New Orleans. It doesn't address the problems \nof public housing residents right here in the District of Columbia, nor \npublic housing residents in Chicago or New York, nor Baton Rouge, nor \nLafayette. Only in New Orleans.\n  That is perplexing to me, that it is focused on only one city in our \nState and only one city in the whole country. That is one reason to \nvote against the amendment, no matter what it says, because it does not \ninclude other communities.\n  But the real reason to vote against the amendment is because it is \nmean-spirited and counterproductive. What this amendment basically says \nis that you can be evicted from public housing if anyone in your family \ncommits a crime or gets in trouble with the law.\n  I understand family members. I am one of nine siblings. I am married \nand now have two children. I have many brothers and sisters and 38 \ncousins in our extended family and two wonderful parents. The Presiding \nOfficer has met many members of my family. I like to try to take \nresponsibility for everyone in my family. But parents, no matter how \nhard they try, sometimes somebody in your family does something that is \nwrong. Should the entire family become homeless? That is what the \nVitter amendment will do. It is such poor policy. It is so mean-\nspirited. It is so counterproductive. It will mean an increase in \nhomelessness for a city that has already seen our homeless population \nquadruple.\n  More than that, the nature of this amendment is so punitive. It \npenalizes grandmothers or great aunts or moms and dads, or siblings who \nare trying to do the best they can with very little. Children sometimes \ndo very bad things. Sometimes you will have a family of five children. \nFour are wonderful and straight-A students. Then you have one child who \ngets in trouble with drugs or becomes an alcoholic, and causes trouble \nfor the family. Senator Vitter has put in an amendment which he will \nask this body to support that would do this: when one member of the \nfamily gets in trouble with the law, the whole family gets thrown out \non the street.\n  If this amendment passes, I would like for him to have to go to the \nsister in fourth grade, because, let's say, the teenage son who is 17 \nis the one who is causing the problems. I don't want people to think I \njust pick on boys, but I think people understand we have lots of \ntrouble with this age group of all genders. I would like maybe for my \ncolleague to be the one who has to knock on the front door and tell the \nmother and the fourth grade little girl, who got an A on her test, \nperformed in the band and has straight A's, that she can pack her bags \nand spend the night on the street. If I could modify this amendment to \nmake him have to do that, I would. This is not compassionate \nconservatism. This is mean, and it is nonsense. It needs to be voted \ndown.\n  To repeat the number, for my colleagues, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, it is amendment No. 2359, only for New Orleans and only \nfor people in public housing. I hope Members will vote no.\n  Let me say one other thing about this. Unfortunately, my colleague \nand some people supported tearing down all the public housing units in \nNew Orleans after the storm because some of them were destroyed. Some \npeople took this as an opportunity to say: We never liked them anyway. \nThey\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\nweren't run very well. Which was often true. So let's knock them all \ndown and too bad for the people who used to live there, even though \nmost of those people worked. I am going to remind my colleague and \nothers, they don't live there for free. Under the law, they pay 30 \npercent of their income to live in that housing. He wanted to knock \nthem all down.\n  Some of us fought back and said: OK, we want to reform them. We want \nto build better communities. We will work with you here. So because I \nstepped in and a bunch of others stepped in, Catholic Charities and \nmany activists from all walks of life, including the business \ncommunity, we said: We are going to rebuild these communities. Well \nhere is the most amazing thing about it: it is working. Shawn Donovan, \nour Housing Secretary, was just there. We had standing room only, with \npeople from every different race and walk of life. We are patting \nourselves on the back saying: It was bad 10 years ago. It was bad 5 \nyears ago. But now we are all working together in the spirit of unity \nin a city that has been absolutely brought to its knees by flooding and \nby political bickering and bomb throwing. And we made things better. \nThen this amendment has to hit the floor. It is a disgrace. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on amendment 2359.\n\n  While I am here, I will say a word about another amendment that has \nbeen agreed to this afternoon by 73 votes, unfortunately. It was \nanother Vitter amendment. It was amendment No. 2376. I voted no. There \nwere 26 of us who voted no, but 73 Senators voted yes. I know I am in \nthe minority, but that is what the Senate is about, giving the minority \na voice. I wish to say something about this. This amendment reinstated \na law that says that if you live in public housing, you have to do 8 \nhours of community service. That sounds pretty good. People think, we \nare providing housing for people. They should be grateful. The least \nthey can do is community service.\n  I am a big supporter of community service. I try to do it when I can. \nI support community service and I support calling all of our citizens \nto community service. What I don't support is making poor people and \nmostly minorities do community service, while other people sit on the \nsideline and never are required to do it, even though the largesse they \nreceive from our government is much greater than a resident of public \nhousing could ever hope to get even if they lived there for 50 years.\n  If you lived in public housing for 50 years, you could not possibly \nbenefit as much from the General Treasury as if you would if you were \nthe executive of AIG to whom we gave a gazillion dollars. Did we ask \nthem to do 8 hours of community service? We didn't even ask him to pay \nthe money back. Somebody has to wake up in this Chamber.\n  I am not fussing at my colleagues because I know people have a \ndifferent view about this. But if we want to require law students to do \n8 hours of community service for the loans they get, fine. But don't \njust pick on the poor because they can't fight back, and they don't \nhave any lobbyists up here for them.\n  Those are the two amendments my colleague could come up with today. I \ncan't wait to see what he comes up with tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Senators Lieberman, McCain, and \nGraham took the floor a few minutes ago. I have some concerns about the \ndirection we are heading in Afghanistan as well.\n  Yesterday the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, \ncame before the Senate Armed Services Committee and said that success \nin Afghanistan would probably require more forces and certainly more \ntime. I think all of us who are aware of what is going on there--and \ncertainly I was there last year myself; many of us have gone over there \nto see for ourselves what the conditions are--and I think clearly we \ncan all agree we are going to have more time in Afghanistan.\n  While the Chairman did not specifically ask for more troops, and had \nnot had a request from GEN Stanley McChrystal, who is the senior \nAmerican officer and NATO commander in Afghanistan, he did, however, \nindicate he ``believed--having heard General McChrystal's views--and \nhaving great confidence in his leadership,'' as we all do--``a properly \nresourced counterinsurgency probably means more forces, and, without \nquestion, more time and more commitment to the protection of the Afghan \npeople and to the development of good governance.''\n  There are currently approximately 64,000 American troops in \nAfghanistan. But it is becoming increasingly clear that we cannot \nachieve our goals in Afghanistan unless we add additional troops and \nanticipate a protracted effort.\n  To his credit, President Obama laid out a new strategy in March. It \nproperly put primary emphasis on building the governance capacity of \nAfghanistan and building up Afghan security forces. He also said he \nwould send--and has--21,000 additional U.S. troops. We know now that \nwas probably not enough and more troops will be needed.\n  Just this week, the President said we should ``not expect a sudden \nannouncement of some huge change in strategy,'' and he further pledged \nthat the issue was ``going to be amply debated, not just in Congress, \nbut across the country.''\n  I welcome that debate. We need to agree as a nation on a strategy for \nvictory, on the resources necessary to complete the mission. We need to \nblock attempts by the cut-and-run crowd to limit the deployments and \noperations of U.S. troops or to tie their hands as to what they can do \nwhile they are there. We do need more Afghan forces. It should also be \nabundantly clear that if our strategy is going to work, we must have \nanother resource.\n  I want to call attention to the role of NATO. With the Taliban \nresurgent and casualties rising to levels never seen before in \nAfghanistan, we must have more security forces in Afghanistan, and it \nis well past time for our NATO allies to step up and do their part.\n  The security of the free world is at stake in Afghanistan. Sometimes \nthere has been legitimate argument about whether there is a legitimate \nAmerican interest in some of the places we have gone. It cannot be \nquestioned that in Afghanistan our security interests are at stake. In \nfact, the credibility of the NATO alliance is at stake, and I think \nwhether the NATO alliance proves it can be successful and relevant in \ntoday's world is at stake in Afghanistan.\n  NATO countries need to realize how much it is in all of our interests \nto defeat the Taliban resurgence and prevent a new al-Qaida safe haven \nfrom developing there. We need to prevent ungoverned territory in \nAfghanistan from being used by terrorists with global reach, and the \nonly way to ensure this is through a strong and stable Afghan \nGovernment. But they are not going to get there without the help of the \nNATO alliance. The horrors of September 11 were only a taste of what \nthe terrorists, with global reach, might accomplish if they have \nuncontested territory from which to operate.\n  Our NATO partners need to realize that the credibility and relevance \nof the alliance itself is now being tested in Afghanistan. NATO no \nlonger faces a threat on the continent of Europe or even on the \nperiphery of Europe. For NATO to be relevant, it must have a global \nexpeditionary role in the defense of our common interests, particularly \nagainst the threat of global terrorism. If NATO cannot succeed in \nAfghanistan, where we all agree NATO must succeed, the alliance will be \nweakened to the point that will call into question: Will it succeed \nanywhere?\n  Many NATO countries are present in Afghanistan, but among them only a \nfew are bearing the brunt of combat operations: Great Britain, Canada, \nthe Netherlands, Denmark, and, of course, the United States. But just \nthis week, Canada announced its intention to pull out all forces by \n2011. Other NATO allies have limited operations of their troops through \nrestrictions on their missions--restrictions that I think are a little \nembarrassing, frankly.\n  For example, some nations that have signed up--part of NATO, willing \nto do their part in Afghanistan--refuse to conduct any operations at \nnight. Others refuse to carry Afghan soldiers on their helicopters. \nOthers are prohibited from participating in combat unless\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\nthey are fired on and protecting their own base. In other words, they \nare prohibited from coming to the aid of an ally under attack.\n  Let's be frank. If a NATO member cannot handle the responsibilities \nof alliance membership, they should not enjoy the privileges and \nprestige of membership. Our NATO allies need to remember what was \nagreed to in Bonn in December of 2001. The alliance gave their solemn \nword to help Afghanistan overcome the ravages of terrorism and civil \nwar. The credibility of our allies is at stake.\n  The NATO alliance has a very simple mission. It is: If one is \nattacked, we are all attacked. America has come to the aid of European \nnations well into the last century--throughout the last century. \nAmerica was attacked on 9/11, 2001, and we have not seen the response \nthat would meet the test of the mission of NATO. We have not seen our \nallies on the field in Iraq, with notable exceptions. Great Britain has \nalways been there. Others have been there part time. But America has \ncarried the lion's share. They are carrying, by far, the lion's share \nin Iraq today.\n  Afghanistan is the hotbed in that area, between Afghanistan and \nPakistan, of al-Qaida, which was the attacker of our country on 9/11. \nNATO agreed in December of 2001 that they would be engaged in \nAfghanistan, and yet NATO has not fulfilled its responsibility, even \nthough the lion's share of our troops--our troops who have done an \noutstanding job, our troops who are fatigued from overdeployment have \ndone their jobs--have not had the help of NATO.\n  NATO is supported by the taxpayers of America because we thought it \nwould be an alliance that would come to our aid, as we have come to the \naid of every member of NATO. The United States pays 24 percent of the \noperating costs of NATO.\n  I am the ranking member of the Military Construction Subcommittee of \nAppropriations, and I can tell you that the military enhancements and \nmilitary construction for NATO are in the range of $230 million in this \nyear's bill. It is usually in that range--sometimes a little more, \nsometimes a little less. But basically America is paying a quarter of a \nbillion dollars every year for military construction and enhancements \nfor NATO.\n  There are not NATO bases in America. They are in other places. Yet we \nare having to now put more troops on the line because our NATO allies \nhave restrictions, except for the ones I have named that are in full \ncombat and full partners and doing their jobs, and we appreciate that \nso much.\n  But I think the NATO alliance must step up to the plate. As we are \ndebating more troops, I know we will do what is necessary because \nAmerica always does what is necessary, and I think our NATO allies know \nthat, but sometimes they just sit back and let us do it. They let our \ntaxpayers pay the tab. They let our troops be the ones who lead in the \nfield.\n  We went to Bosnia. Bosnia was in their backyard, but they needed us \nto step in; also in Kosovo. We have been there for them to step in \nbecause when it is necessary America is there. But when we are debating \nthe increase in troop strength in Afghanistan--which everyone who has \nbeen there knows we are going to need--let's not forget to bring in \nanother source that would help America in this time of need, while we \nare continuing to keep our commitments in Iraq with very little help \nfrom the outside, while we still have troops in Bosnia, and while we \nhave 64,000 troops, the lion's share, in Afghanistan.\n  Now we are looking at sending more, and I think now is the time for \nus to put it on the table for our NATO allies, that they have a \ncommitment, if the NATO alliance is relevant. ``If one is attacked, we \nare all attacked'' is a great, simple, clear mission. But it is not \nsimply successful because we have the right mission. It takes every \nmember doing its fair share. And, most certainly, at a time when \nAmerica is doing so much more, this is the time for our allies to take \nthe shackles off, to engage, to be in combat, to put our treasure on \nthe line with their treasure and not just our treasure alone.\n  I think it is time for us--and I call on the President--and fulfill \nthe mission. Terrorism is the enemy of every NATO country. This is not \nan American fight. It is a global fight for freedom. If we lose in \nAfghanistan and give unfettered territory for operations of al-Qaida, \nevery NATO country will be attacked. Don't they see it? Don't they have \nthe commitment and the courage to stand up? Just because it is in \nanother country and seems far away, can they be so naive?\n  When we talk about more American troops, as the President has said we \nwill, I ask the President to look for more troops from other sources as \nwell and to ask our allies to step to the plate and be our partners as \nNATO envisioned.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, I rise once again to recognize the \nservice of one of America's great Federal employees.\n  Last week I spoke about an outstanding public servant who refused to \ngive up when she was faced with life-changing trauma. My friend Vice \nPresident Biden says America's greatest attribute is that when it gets \nknocked down, it gets right back up.\n  Perseverance is one of our national strengths. It has seen us through \nthe lean years and the times of war. It has also seen us through the \nsetbacks of our march of science and discovery. In one such setback a \nfew years ago, NASA experienced a string of failures to land an \nexploratory probe on Mars. After the inspirational voyages of Viking 1 \nand 2, which landed on the red planet of the 1970s, NASA did not send \nspacecraft to the surface of Mars for 20 years. After a brief but \nsuccessful return in 1997 by the Mars Pathfinder, NASA prepared a \nseries of missions aimed at exploring the Martian surface and laying \nthe groundwork for a future astronaut mission.\n  The enthusiasm at NASA and in our Nation's scientific community \nquickly turned to disappointment as two consecutive missions failed to \nreach their destination. Some of my colleagues may remember how \nfrustrating it was to learn that one craft burned up in Mars' \natmosphere because a contractor measured in English units instead of \nthe metric system used by NASA.\n  When Orlando Figueroa took charge of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover \nproject in 2001, he set out to change the mood. Optimism and excitement \nhad long been the driving force behind NASA's successes, and Orlando \nknew that despite recent setbacks, NASA could once again achieve and \ninspire.\n  Less than 3 years later, under Orlando's leadership, NASA's Mars \nExploration Rover project successfully landed some of the most advanced \ntechnology ever created onto the Martian surface.\n  He pushed his team to look forward, not backward, and Orlando's \nleadership was critical as the team faced challenges in advance of a \nrapidly approaching launch date.\n  The Mars Exploration Rovers--called Spirit and Opportunity--\nsuccessfully landed on opposite ends of Mars in January 2004 after a 6-\nmonth journey.\n  Together, they traversed several miles of the planet's surface and \ncaptured over 100,000 high resolution photographs for use by scientists \nstudying the Martian climate and soil.\n  The tests conducted by Spirit and Opportunity have brought our \nresearchers closer to finding evidence of water and possibly past life \non our neighboring planet.\n  The Mars Exploration Rover project also reignited the imaginations of \ncountless students.\n  I have spoken a number of times already about the importance of \nsupporting education in the fields of science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics or ``STEM.'' The success\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\nof Orlando and his team at NASA contributes greatly to our efforts to \nrenew interest in space exploration and scientific discovery among our \nNation's youth. It was this same enthusiasm that first led us to orbit \nthe Earth and reach the Moon.\n  Orlando exemplifies the kind of perseverance endemic to America's \ncivil servants.\n  He and his team demonstrated once again that our Nation, when we get \nknocked down, can get back up and accomplish any task we set for \nourselves.\n  It was for this reason that Orlando was awarded the Service to \nAmerica--Federal Employee of the Year medal in 2005.\n  I hope that all the members of this body will join me in recognizing \nthe important contribution made by Orlando Figueroa and all of the \nhard-working employees of NASA.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as others of my colleagues have done, I \nhave come to the floor periodically--pretty much every day we have been \nin session in the last couple months--and shared letters from people \nfrom Ohio who are in the midst of a personal health care crisis--small \nbusinesspeople who want to cover employees but simply cannot afford to, \nand individual young people who are removed from their parents' \ninsurance when finishing school or who come back from the Army and \ncannot get insurance, and people who have preexisting conditions--all \nkinds of people who, in many cases, thought they had good health care \ninsurance, and they got very sick, it got expensive, and they lost the \ninsurance.\n  I wish to share some letters again tonight. These are new letters and \nstories I have heard. Over the last month or so, I have done townhall \nmeetings in Cincinnati, where 1,500 people showed up, and this is the \nmost conservative part of Ohio. Two-thirds of them supported the \nPresident's health care effort and about a third opposed it. I did a \nlarge townhall meeting also in Columbus, and I did roundtables--135 or \nso--around Ohio in the last couple years, where I have listened to \npeople talk about issues and what we can do to make my State better. I \nhave been in all 88 counties doing that. I did an electronic townhall \nmeeting the other night, where several hundred people were on and I \ntook questions and explained the health care legislation; and I \nespecially tried to answer questions about some of the misinformation.\n  It is important to understand that the insurance industry has a lot \nto lose with this health care bill. They like the system the way it is. \nIt works for them and they are immensely profitable. Their executives \nare making $10 million, $20 million a year. Some of their CEOs and top \nmanagement put out some significant misinformation about this bill to \nprotect their economic interests. That is important to remember.\n  Elizabeth is from Clermont County, along the Ohio River, east of the \nCincinnati, a fast-growing suburban county. She writes:\n\n       I am 25 years old and unemployed. Years ago, I was \n     diagnosed with a blood disorder. Up until I turned 25, I was \n     covered under my father's health insurance through his work.\n       When I turned 25, I had to find my own health insurance, \n     but because of my pre-existing condition, I was denied by \n     most insurances.\n       The best one I could get is of very poor quality and it's \n     very expensive.\n\n  That happens with a lot of young people. They are under their \nparents' insurance and they finish school and move out and the \ninsurance companies drop them when they are 22, 23, 24 years old, even \nwhen they are employed, because people at that age--similar to the \npages in front of us--are probably on their parents' insurance, but \nwhen they finish school and get jobs--and they are probably not going \nto be the kind of jobs, in many cases, that have health insurance--\nexcept that, by that time, we are going to have passed this health \ninsurance bill. But one of the things our bill does is says no \ninsurance company may drop you from their plan until you turn 26. So a \nyoung person who finishes school and is trying to get on their feet or \nwho goes to the Army for 3 years and then comes back out and maybe is \nliving at home trying to get on his or her feet, until he or she turns \n26, he or she can continue to be on their parents' insurance plan. Once \nthey turn 26 and they don't have insurance, they can go into the \ninsurance exchange, which we can talk about later.\n  So this bill will absolutely matter to somebody such as Elizabeth.\n  Sharon is from Portage County. She says:\n\n       My husband will turn 65 at the end of the year. He wants to \n     retire, and after working hard for his company for 30 years, \n     he deserves it.\n       But I'm only 62 and recently lost my job. If my husband \n     retires, I will have no coverage for three years.\n\n  She has to wait until she is 65.\n\n       We will not be able to afford insurance for me based on his \n     retirement savings.\n       Please help us and many others who are struggling.\n\n  Sharon lives east of Akron, the home of Kent State University, near \nRavenna, Aurora, and other communities there. Sharon's situation would \nallow her, regardless of her income, to be able to go into the \ninsurance exchange, which means that if she is fairly low income, she \nwill get subsidies from the government to help pay her premium. With \nthe insurance exchange, she will be able to choose, under the plan we \nhave written so far, whether she wants to go with Aetna, Blue Cross, \nMedical Mutual, a not-for-profit insurance company in Ohio, or perhaps \ninto SummaCare in the Akron area or into the public option. The \nlegislation provides for an option that is not private--a government \noption--that will do several things. First, the public option will keep \nthe private insurance companies honest. They will quit gaming the \nsystem if they have to compete against a public Medicare look-alike \nplan.\n  Second, the public option will help to drive costs down because they \nwill compete against these private insurance companies, and that is so \nvery important.\n  Third, the public option will be available particularly in rural \nareas where there is not a particularly competitive market. In \nsouthwest Ohio, for instance, two insurance companies have 85 percent \nof the market. A public option would inject needed competition where \nthere is not any today.\n  Margaret from Greene County in the Xenia and Jamestown area said:\n\n       My husband works for a small business. Although we have \n     health insurance through his employer, my husband has not \n     been to a doctor for a few years.\n       I believe he is putting off regular checkups because he is \n     afraid the doctor will diagnose one of those conditions, such \n     as diabetes, that blacklists people from health insurance.\n       Small businesses cannot afford to have even one person with \n     a chronic illness on their insurance because it raises the \n     rates so much for the company.\n       I understand that the insurance and drug industries have \n     too much money and political power, but my husband can't \n     afford to lose his job.\n\n  First, about that last point, 5 years ago I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. In those days, when President Bush was in the White \nHouse, he pushed a bill through the Congress to partially privatize \nMedicare. It was a total giveaway to the drug companies and insurance \ncompanies. Those days are over. With the legislation we pass, the drug \ncompanies are going to be unhappy with it and insurance companies are \ngoing to be unhappy with it. I want them to be treated fairly, but I \ndon't want them to have the power in this health care system they have \nhad in the last few years, and they won't under this legislation.\n  Margaret is right about a small business. If you work for a company \nthat has 20 employees--say you own a small business with 10, 15, 20 \nemployees and one of them gets very sick and they have to take \nexpensive biologics or go into the hospital and their costs are high. \nThe insurance company will do one of two things: It will either cut you \nout of the plan or cut the small business out of the plan or it will \nraise rates so high on that small business--because they have 1 or 2 \nreally expensive cases, the insurance companies will raise their rates \nso much for that\n\n[[Page S9425]]\n\nsmall business that the small business won't be able to afford it \nanymore.\n  What Margaret's husband's employer could do, so that Margret's \nhusband could go to the doctor even if he had major health problems to \nbe taken care of, is if he chose to take his employees into this \nexchange, again, they could go to Aetna, Medical Mutual, BlueCross, or \nthe public option. And the small business is going to get tax credits \nthat are not available now to bring down the cost of the insurance.\n  Once a small business goes into a larger pool, the rates come down \nbecause small businesses and individuals always pay more than large \nbusinesses that can spread their risk to a much wider pool.\n  The last one I will share is from Jamie from Fairfield County:\n\n       I am a married 40-year old mother of three sons. I am \n     currently uninsured, but my husband is self-employed and has \n     insurance for him and our children.\n       The insurance companies refuse to insure me due to a \n     preexisting condition. My condition does not require any \n     treatment and I haven't followed up on it since my diagnosis \n     4 years ago.\n       Without insurance, I am nearly 3 years overdue for my \n     mammogram and 4 years overdue for my OB/GYN exam. I have not \n     had any of the preventive testing that begins in your \n     forties.\n       My family is plagued by heart disease, cancer, and \n     diabetes. I fear that without the opportunity for health \n     care, I will not be able to be here for my children and my \n     future grandchildren.\n       I ask that you please give me a voice with those opposed to \n     health care reform.\n\n  Jamie, from Fairfield County, a suburban county southeast of \nColumbus, is in a situation in which far too many people are. She needs \nthe preventive care, but she does not get the preventive care because \nshe cannot get insurance because she has a preexisting condition. \nImagine that: You are 40 years old--people in this body, it is hard for \nus to be as sympathetic as we should be. We make a good income here. We \nhave status in the community. Most Members of this body generally have \npretty good health insurance, but it is pretty hard to empathize. But \nwe need to with people such as Jamie--40 years old, preexisting \ncondition, but she does not go to the doctor to get preventive care. \nShe doesn't get the OB/GYN exams. She does not get the mammogram. She \ndoes not get the preventive testing a 40-year-old woman should get. \nWhat happens? At some point, she may come down with an illness, a \nsignificant, serious expensive illness that will not only compromise \nher health or worse, but it will mean the health care system will spend \na lot more money on Jamie than it would have if she had insurance to \nget preventive care.\n  That is what is so important about this legislation. One of the \nthings our bill does is insurance companies under our bill--the public \noption, Aetna, CIGNA, or any of the insurance providers, public or \nprivate--the legislation we are passing will say to them--they are \ncharged a premium, but they can't make them pay a copay for preventive \ncare. Nobody under our plan who goes to a doctor in the health care \nexchange will pay a preventive care copayment. That means more people \nwill get mammograms, more men tested for prostate cancer, more men and \nwomen will get colonoscopies when they turn 50, women will get OB/GYN \nexams. All these exams will help people live longer and more prosperous \nlives and help prevent them from getting huge medical bills that so \noften lead to all kinds of bankruptcies and other financial problems.\n  I get hundreds of these letters a week--most of us do--from people \nwho simply want a fair shake. With this legislation, as we know, if you \nhave insurance and are happy with it, you can keep your insurance. We \nare building consumer protections around that insurance, so no more \ncutting people off with preexisting conditions and no more annual caps \nor lifetime caps if they get sick, and they can't take their insurance \naway, no more discrimination based on gender, age, geography, or \ndisability. That will be in the past.\n  The second thing the bill does so very well is it provides insurance \nfor people who don't have insurance, decent, affordable, high-quality \ninsurance.\n  Third, it helps small businesses so they can provide insurance for \ntheir employees, because most small businesses I know, whether they are \nin Toledo, Youngstown, Athens, Gallipolis, Dayton, or Springfield, want \nto provide insurance. Most small businesses want to provide insurance \nto their employees, but so many can no longer afford the insurance they \nprovided 10, 20 years ago.\n  The last thing our bill does is it provides a public option. That \nmeans people will have the choice. It is another choice they can make, \nanother choice they can make if they don't want private insurance. They \ncan go with the public option, and they will see the public option keep \nprices down, provide choice, and keep the insurance companies honest.\n  This legislation makes sense. It is time we move this legislation in \nthe next few weeks and get it to the President's desk by Thanksgiving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9425-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9425-S9427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement my colleague, \nSenator Brown from Ohio, just made about health care. It is a \ncritically important issue we all have been working on. He and I were \nfortunate to serve this summer and throughout the year, but especially \nthis summer, working on the bill he spoke of--the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee bill.\n  I rise tonight to talk about another significant challenge we face as \nAmericans; that is, the really grave challenge we face in Afghanistan.\n  I had the opportunity this summer toward the end of August to travel \nto both Afghanistan and Pakistan with Senator Brown of Ohio and his \ncolleague from Ohio, Zack Space, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. They would agree with me, and I believe most Americans \nwould agree, that when we have troops on the ground in harm's way in \nsuch an important part of the world for our security, we must have a \nvery serious debate, a sober deliberation, an objective assessment of \nwhere we are right now.\n  The administration has expressed, and I support, the overall goal in \nAfghanistan to ensure that al-Qaida or any other terrorist group does \nnot gain the sanctuary it requires to plot, plan, or train for another \nterrorist attack on American soil or against our allies.\n  We have seen the direct impact of an unstable Afghanistan right in my \nhome State of Pennsylvania. Last week, I traveled to Shanksville, PA, \nin southwestern Pennsylvania, as the world knows now as the place where \nthe plane went down in September of 2001. That was an unspeakable act \nof terrorism. Thank goodness for this Capitol and for our country that \na group of brave Americans took control as best they could and made \nsure that plane, which was headed for Washington, did not get here. And \nthey gave their lives in that effort. The men responsible for those \nattacks conducted their planning from Afghanistan, not from anywhere \nelse. It is in our national security interest to make sure that \nAfghanistan today never again becomes a safe haven for the likes of \nOsama bin Laden or any other terrorist who may confront us in the \nfuture and continues to confront us today.\n  As of this week, at least 822 members of the U.S. military have died \nin Afghanistan, including 35 from the State of Pennsylvania. Those who \ngave, in Lincoln's words, ``the last full measure of devotion'' to \ntheir country, we are thinking of them and their families tonight, as \nwe do every day.\n  We are also remembering those who have sacrificed time in Afghanistan \nin this effort and some who have been wounded, so many who have been \nwounded--thousands have been wounded in just this conflict itself.\n  We turn again to Lincoln when he talked about ``he who has borne the \nbattle''--in the modern context of that, him or her, fighting men and \nwomen on the ground in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and other places around \nthe world. We are thinking of them tonight, and we pray for them. But \nwe also pray for ourselves that we may be worthy of their valor.\n  I know there have been a lot of reports lately and discussions about \nwhat has been happening in Afghanistan. We have seen recent reports of \nheavy Taliban activity across 80 percent of Afghanistan. That doesn't \nmean they control 80 percent, but there is a lot of activity in 80 \npercent. That number is up from 72 percent in November 2008\n\n[[Page S9426]]\n\nand way up from 54 percent a year before that. That is just their \nactivity. But a substantial Taliban presence, one or more attacks per \nmonth--that is the measurement of this--was seen in another 17 percent \nof the country.\n  It is critical that we have taken measures to recalibrate our efforts \nin Afghanistan. General McChrystal, a great military leader, a great \nmind, with whom we had a chance to spend some time on our trip, was \nconfirmed by the Senate in June to take command of NATO and U.S. \noperations in Afghanistan and arrived in Afghanistan a few weeks later. \nGeneral McChrystal recently submitted his strategic review to the White \nHouse, and we look forward to hearing the results of that review. We \nneed to give General McChrystal and his team an opportunity to \nimplement his strategy and to put it into action. That has just begun \nover the last couple several months.\n  Having spent so much of the last 8 years since September 11, 2001, \nnot focused on Afghanistan, we cannot expect results there overnight. \nThis is why I stand in support of Chairman Carl Levin, the chairman of \nour Armed Services Committee, of his call for an expansion, a rapid \nexpansion of the Afghan national security forces, both the Afghan \nNational Army and the Afghan National Police. I traveled with Chairman \nLevin in May of 2008 to both countries, and I learned on that trip and \nmany days before and after that trip of his leadership, his experience, \nand his understanding of the issues we confront in both Afghanistan and \nPakistan and other places around the world. I believe his understanding \nof these issues is unparalleled. There may be some here who know as \nmuch, but few could make the case they know more. I have confidence in \nCarl Levin's assessment of where we are today and his recommendations \nfor where we should go in the future.\n  In July, General McChrystal assessed that the Afghan Army could \nexpand from 134,000 troops to about 240,000, and the police force could \ngo from 92,000 personnel to about 160,000 personnel by 2013. Chairman \nLevin wishes to see those same numbers but on a shorter timeline, to be \naccomplished in 2012. So that is something we should debate here. But I \nthink any acceleration, any strategy that gets us to a higher number of \nAfghan Army and Afghan national police at a faster rate is what we have \nto be committed to.\n  Because of low levels of literacy and experience, in some cases, it \nwill take time to build a competent Afghan officer corps--the highest \nlevel of training in the Army. This will require that we use every \npossible resource and enhanced U.S. training capacity to get the job \ndone. To get to those numbers will not be easy, but I believe we can do \nit, and so do officials in the Afghan Government. While in Afghanistan \nlast month, I met with Defense Minister Wardak and the Interior \nMinister, Mr. Atmar, who both feel confident they can adequately \naccelerate training of these security forces.\n  There is a growing insistence here in the Congress and across the \ncountry that the Afghan Government begin to assume more responsibility \nfor its own security. In my visit to Afghanistan just after the recent \nAfghan Presidential election, I met with President Karzai and explained \nthat the United States does not plan an open-ended commitment to \nAfghanistan. The Afghan Government, whether led by Hamid Karzai or \nanyone else, needs to recognize the critical need to provide security, \ngoods, and services to the Afghan people. While we certainly are \ncommitted to assistance and development, it is ultimately the \nresponsibility of the Afghan Government--the government itself--to \nreform and rebuild the country. Good governance and the fight against \ncorruption are crucial elements to garnering public support and \nstrengthening the effort against the extremist forces in the country. \nAn Afghan public that can trust its government not to steal from them \nis more likely to support this hard-fought counterinsurgency effort--\nthe effort that General McChrystal has talked about and will continue \nto tell us about.\n  I have to be very candid, though--and I have said this publicly \nalready in different ways--that when I asked President Karzai specific \nquestions about what we can tell the American people about his efforts \ngoing back a number of years, including his efforts at present--on a \nlot of these critical questions, such as, how are you doing on \ndelivering services to your people; how are you doing on anticorruption \nefforts; how are you doing on improving your governance--he had, at \nbest, inadequate answers to those questions. I was much more impressed, \ncandidly, by his ministers--Minister Wardak and Minister Atmar--who are \ncharged with the responsibility for the army and the police. That is \nthe good news, despite the bad news I just reported about President \nKarzai, in my judgment. It is only my opinion, but I have met with him \ntwice and I have read a lot about him.\n  Our challenge in Afghanistan comes not only from a resurgent Taliban \nbut development needs across the country. Farmers grow poppy because \nthey can get a good rate of return and because the Taliban threatens \nthem if they do not. Basic development projects are threatened and \nextorted by Taliban forces. U.S. political relationships with local \nofficials are often tenuous, as these leaders are often the main \ntargets of Taliban attacks--brutal attacks and threats on people's \nlives, on their families, and on their property.\n  That is one reason why the courageous work of the Provincial \nReconstruction Teams--the so-called PRTs--is essential to our success. \nThese teams, composed of able and brave personnel from USAID, the \nDepartment of State, and the Department of Agriculture, supported by \nthe U.S. military, are on the front lines of providing security such \nthat political and development progress can flourish in these places \nacross Afghanistan. These teams are operating in the most difficult \nenvironments in the country, and I want to thank them for their \nremarkable efforts and their sacrifice in contributing to our mission. \nI know General McChrystal not only respects and appreciates but works \nclosely with all of these parts of our government that are doing such a \ngreat job for us. While the enhanced presence of Afghan forces is our \nultimate goal, these Provincial Reconstruction Teams are a substantial \npart of how we are going to get there.\n  This approach is comprehensive and smart, but it does require time. \nThe courageous work performed by the PRTs, combined with an enhanced \neffort by the Afghan national security forces, I believe, can finally \nput us in a position where a stable Afghanistan is achievable.\n  The challenge is not limited to Afghanistan and the Obama \nadministration has adopted the correct holistic approach to include \nPakistan, the neighbor to the east of Afghanistan. We have begun to \nrebuild important ties with the Pakistani Government based on trust and \na common understanding that extremist forces are a serious threat to \nthe Pakistani state, and not an asset to be expended on its other \nnational security interests. In Congress, we have also worked to ensure \nthat our relationship with Pakistan is based on mutual trust and a \ncommitment to build links at all levels of Pakistani and American \nsociety; among governments but also with \nnongovernmental organizations--academics, businessmen and \nbusinesswomen, humanitarian workers, and across the board. We have a \nlot of Pakistani Americans who are helping us do this. While we will \nalso maintain our support for Pakistani's military, this new \nmultitiered approach will be critical to building the solid foundation \nfor a new relationship between our two countries--the United States and \nPakistan.\n  Despite our efforts to deepen our relationship, the news from \nPakistan in recent days has not been encouraging. We are happy that \nthey took the fight into the Swat Valley and had success there. Thank \ngoodness they did that. But when I say the recent days, I mean the last \nseveral days and weeks. Over the weekend, Pakistan's Government \nannounced the sacking of more than 700 police working in the Khyber \ntribal region. These police were fired after not showing up for work \nbecause they were threatened by militant leaders in the region. This is \nnot a new trend in Pakistan. Two years ago, hundreds of police resigned \nunder threat from local Taliban forces in the Swat Valley. So we have \nto monitor this, as we do developments in Afghanistan. Without the \nbasic security provided by the police in these volatile border areas, \nthe\n\n[[Page S9427]]\n\ndifficulty of our efforts is compounded. I hope that the Pakistani \nnational government can do more to properly train and equip these \nimportant front-line defenses against extremist elements in Pakistan \nand/or the border region.\n  Human rights questions have been raised in recent days in news \naccounts. That is also a concern we have. I had the opportunity, as \nwell as Senator Brown and Congressman Space, when we were there, to \nvisit a camp where they are taking care of those who were displaced by \nthe fighting in the Swat Valley--so-called IDP camps, internally \ndisplaced person camps. So far, that effort has met with success, and \nthank goodness the Pashtun tradition in Pakistan has meant as many as \n80 percent of the people displaced were taken into homes and the \ngovernment and military didn't have to help them directly, not until \nthey had to go back to their homes and their communities.\n  We also had a chance to meet with General Kiyani, a very strong and \ncapable military leader, who gave us a briefing on the efforts against \nthe Pakistani Taliban. I believe our national security--literally the \nsafety of our families from another grievous attack here in the United \nStates--depends on our success in South Asia. I applaud Chairman Carl \nLevin for his vision and leadership on this important issue at this \ncritical time, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  We ought to have a full debate in the Senate, in the House, and \nacross America about troop levels. We are not there yet. There has been \nno recommendation made by the administration beyond the 17,000 combat \ntroops and the 4,000 trainers, but it is never too early to start an \nimportant debate about troop levels. We also should debate and continue \nto get more information about evaluating the progress we are making \nthere. President Obama and his administration are committed to doing \nthat. They have presented to the Congress a series of metrics or \nbenchmarks--pick your word--weighing and evaluating how we are doing on \nour progress there. A series of tough questions has to be asked on a \nfrequent basis. They have to be answered by the administration if \nCongress is going to be satisfied with our support, both military and \nnonmilitary.\n  I believe we can get this right if we debate it, if we ask tough \nquestions and demand answers to those tough questions of the \nadministration, of the military, and any other question that Congress \nand the American people want to have asked and answered.\n  Finally, I mentioned the great work General McChrystal and our \nfighting men and women are doing every day of the week across the world \nin places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, but let me also highlight, \nbefore I conclude, three people on the ground there who are leading our \nefforts on the nonmilitary side representing our State Department: \nGeneral Eikenberry, a great military leader who is serving as our \nAmbassador to Afghanistan and who is doing great work there; Ambassador \nPaterson in Pakistan, who has served now in that capacity under two \nadministrations working very hard in a difficult situation in Pakistan; \nand finally, Ambassador Holbrooke, who has served this country in a \nnumber of capacities, now put in charge of monitoring the work and \nbeing a constructive force in both countries--both Afghanistan and \nPakistan. We are grateful for their public service, their commitment to \nour security, the commitment to our troops they have made, and the \ncommitment to getting this right so the American people can have \nconfidence in this policy going forward.\n  We are not there yet. We are just beginning a full debate. But I \nwould urge our colleagues here to pay close attention and to continue \nto ask these questions so we can make sure that Afghanistan is stable--\nas we hope for Pakistan as well--so we can protect our people from \nanother terrorist attack or the threat of that kind of an attack.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9427-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING OUR FALLEN SOLDIERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week, an Illinois family who lost a \nson in Iraq will remember the anniversary of his death. Their son was \n19 when he was killed in a vehicle accident in Baghdad, 1 year ago.\n  Thousands of American men and women have given their lives in the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have not been the first to do so in \nservice to our country. Sadly, we know they will likely not be the \nlast.\n  How do we pay tribute to those lost who have served? The Illinois \npoet Archibald MacLeish asked that we remember them. In his well-known \nwar poem, written during the depths of the Second World War, a young, \ndead soldier speaks. ``We were young,'' the soldier entreats. ``We have \ndied. Remember us.''\n  And so we do. We remember them in our communities, in ways big and \nsmall. We remember them here on the floor of the Senate.\n  And we remember them when we debate issues of national security that \nwill dramatically affect our military forces. The vote to send young \nAmericans to war is the most serious decision any of us will make on \nthis Senate floor. I have written notes to the families of the many \nIllinois servicemembers who have been killed in Afghanistan or Iraq. \nEvery letter makes plain the burden we have placed on--and the trust we \nhave placed in--military members and their families.\n  Finally, we remember them when we consider how to honor their friends \nin service, those in battle today and those who are fortunate to return \nhome. Over the past years, Congress has tried to keep its promise to \nour troops. We have tried to provide them with the equipment and the \nresources they need to complete the work we have asked them to do. We \nhave welcomed them back with new opportunities, like the educational \nbenefits in the new GI Bill, that will help them take the next \nsuccessful step in their lives. And for those who have returned home \nwith injuries, we have worked to provide them with the best medical \ncare available.\n  The young Illinois soldier who died last year has a strong family: \nmother, father, sister, brother, and friends. They will remember him. \nIn this Senate, we do, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9427-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9427-S9428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BURMA'S FORGOTTEN POLITICAL PRISONERS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention a new report by Human Rights Watch entitled \n``Burma's Forgotten Prisoners.''\n  The report offers moving and compelling stories of political \nactivists in Burma who have put their lives and careers on the line to \nraise awareness about the human rights situation in their country.\n  In the face of threats, intimidation and beatings, they have embraced \nnonviolence to put pressure on the ruling military junta to respect the \nlegitimate aspirations of the people of Burma and support a new \ngovernment based on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\n  We all have been inspired by the story of Burma's most famous \npolitical prisoner, Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the \ndemocratic opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  After leading the National League for Democracy to an overwhelming \nwin in the 1990 parliamentary election--a victory quickly annulled by \nthe military junta--she has spent the better part of the past 19 years \nin prison or under house arrest.\n  Recently, a Burmese court sentenced her to an additional 3 years of \nconfinement on trumped up charges of violating the terms of her house \narrest.\n  Yet despite the regime's best efforts, it has failed to stifle her \nwill and her call for free and democratic Burma.\n  And it has failed to stop her from inspiring thousands of her fellow \ncitizens to take up her cause.\n  The report by Human Rights Watch reminds us that while Suu Kyi is the \nmost well-known democracy activist, she is by no means alone. In fact, \nthe report notes that there are now more than 2,100 political prisoners \nin Burma; there are 43 prisons holding political activists in Burma and \n50 labor camps; and beginning in late 2008, closed Burmese courts \nsentenced more than 300 activists to prison terms of, in some cases, \nmore than 100 years for speaking out against the government and forming \norganizations.\n  Among those profiled are Zargana, one of Burma's most famous \ncomedians, actors, and human rights activists, who was arrested and \nsentenced to 59 years in prison for criticizing the\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\ngovernment's response to Cyclone Nargis; U Gambira, a young Buddhist \nmonk who was sentenced to 68 years in prison including 12 years of hard \nlabor for playing a key role in the 2007 demonstrations which became \nknown as the Saffron Revolution; Ma Su Su Nway, a prominent labor \nrights activist who was sentenced to 12\\1/2\\ years in prison for \ncriticizing the government during the 2007 demonstrations; and Min Ko \nKaing, a 46-year-old activist who has spent 17 of the past 20 years in \nprison, most of it in solitary confinement, for his political beliefs.\n  At a time when the regime is intent on moving forward with new \nelections based on a constitution that was drafted behind closed doors \nand would entrench the military as the country's dominant political \nforce, it is important for us to remember that there are those in Burma \nwho have a different vision.\n  These brave activists deserve our admiration and respect. More \nimportantly, they deserve to know that we stand in solidarity with them \nand we will not rest and we will not remain silent until they are free.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the report and to once again call on the \nruling State Peace and Development Council to release all political \nprisoners and begin a true dialogue on national reconciliation in \nBurma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9428-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SAFE STREETS CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 20th \nanniversary of the Safe Streets Campaign of Pierce County, WA.\n  Twenty years ago, Pierce County residents from all walks of life \nbanded together to form the Safe Streets Campaign and to demonstrate \nthe willpower and strength needed to take back their streets from a \nplague of drug- and gang-related violence and to improve the quality of \nlife in Pierce County.\n  Over the next two decades, the Safe Streets Campaign has shown itself \nto be an effective citizen-led initiative to pressing community \nproblems. It has organized over 250,000 residents throughout Pierce \nCounty to fight crime, substance abuse, and youth violence in \npartnership with local law enforcement, State and local government, \ncommunity-based organizations, faith-based groups, businesses, Native \nAmerican Tribes, schools, and youth.\n  For example, Safe Streets established the Youth Leading Change \nInitiative in Pierce County high schools to empower young people to \nlead efforts to address the problems of youth substance abuse and \nviolence. These young people engage their peers and community members \nin a number of valuable ways. They march against violence. They work to \nreduce blight in high-risk communities. They engage in peer education \non the dangers of youth substance abuse. And they work with Washington \nState lawmakers to craft innovative solutions to these social problems. \nI have met with many of these young leaders and been impressed with the \nwork that they do.\n  The proactive community and neighborhood involvement by the Safe \nStreets Campaign and similar organizations improves the quality of life \nfor families and helps provide a safe environment to raise and educate \nour children. Its work has led to lower crime rates, reduced 911 \nemergency calls, helped close thousands of drug houses, sustained \nongoing graffiti removal, supported recovering addicts and healthy \nneighborhoods, and helped youth involved with gangs choose a life of \nhope rather than a life of crime.\n  Safe Streets is a shining example of citizen initiative where \ncommunities stand up for themselves and take their neighborhoods back \nfrom the control of drug pushers, gang members, and associated \nviolence. It has been sustained over the past 20 years through a mix of \nState, Federal, and local government funding and corporate and \nindividual donor support.\n  I commend the staff, founders, board of directors, and volunteers of \nthe Safe Streets Campaign of Pierce County for the dedication that has \nfueled this community initiative from the beginning, and I congratulate \nthem as they celebrate 20 years of commitment to safe communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9428-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION NOMINATIONS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship favorably reported out the President's \nnominations of Dr. Winslow Lorenzo Sargeant to serve as chief counsel \nfor advocacy and Ms. Peggy Elizabeth Gustafson to serve as inspector \ngeneral of the Small Business Administration.\n  I am pleased that President Obama nominated such talented individuals \nto top positions at the SBA. Their confirmation will make the SBA much \ncloser to having an exceptional leadership team in place.\n  As chief counsel for advocacy, Dr. Winslow Sargeant will bring a \nunique background to this very important position. With a Ph.D. from \nthe University of Wisconsin-Madison in electrical engineering and a \nbackground as a very successful small business owner, he is not only \nwell-educated, but well-educated about the challenges facing small \nbusinesses today.\n  He is currently the managing director of Venture Investors, a Midwest \nventure capital company with a concentration on starting up health care \nand technology companies. From 2001 to 2005, he served as a program \nmanager for SBIR in electronics at the National Science Foundation. He \nhas also worked at IBM as a staff engineer, at AT as technical staff, \nand as an associate adjunct professor at the University of \nPennsylvania.\n  As the current general counsel for Senator Claire McCaskill, whose \ninterest in and knowledge of oversight issues is well known and \nrespected in the Senate, Ms. Peggy Gustafson is an excellent nominee \nfor inspector general of the SBA. She received her J.D. at Northwestern \nUniversity and, before working as general counsel for Senator McCaskill \nhere in Washington, Ms. Gustafson worked for her when the Senator was \nthe prosecutor for Jackson County, MO, as well as when she was the \nMissouri State Auditor.\n  With capable leaders like Dr. Sargeant and Ms. Gustafson at the helm, \nwe are hopeful the agency will be more ready than ever to play an \nimportant role in assisting small businesses as they continue to lead \nthis country to an economic recovery. We look forward to working with \nthem and to a new era for the SBA and American small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9428-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9428-S9429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING BELLE ACKERMAN LIPMAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish today to remember the life of an \nextraordinary woman.\n  Belle Ackerman Lipman passed away at her home in Memphis, TN, on Aug. \n17, 2009, in the 100th year of her remarkable life. A beloved wife, \nmother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend, Mrs. Lipman is a \nmodel for all of us who hope to live life fully and for all the years \ngranted us.\n  A daughter of Romanian immigrants, Belle Ackerman was born in 1910 in \nPhiladelphia, where her parents owned a general store. Just five blocks \naway from the store lived young Mark Lipman, who would become the love \nof Belle's life. The businessman and his young wife moved not long \nafter their marriage to Little Rock, AR, where Mark saw new business \nopportunities, and then in 1958 to Memphis, TN. There, Belle Lipman \nbecame a pillar of the community. Her work in civic affairs was \nextensive, including service as a trustee with the Simon Wiesenthal \nCenter. She was president of the Little Rock chapter of Hadassah, the \nworldwide Jewish women's organization, among a host of endeavors in \ncharity, service, and the arts.\n  But it is not those remarkable accomplishments alone that made Belle \nLipman such a special woman. As years passed, her zest for life, for \nnew experience, and to learn of new cultures grew apace. A lifelong \ninterest in travel made her one of the first American citizens to \ntravel to China after diplomatic relations with that Nation were \nreestablished in 1979. Her travels took her to a hot-air balloon over \nthe plains of Kenya, the rivers of the Amazon, and the ancient cities \nof Peru. She rode the Orient Express at the age of 87. At 92, she \ncrossed the Arctic Circle. At 95, she visited the mountains of Tibet \nand a host of other places. At her 95th birthday party, she celebrated \nthe only way she knew how, with verve by dancing the Charleston.\n  Belle Lipman was a model--a model of how to live life to the fullest \nand\n\n[[Page S9429]]\n\nhow a thirst for new experiences can fill a lifetime. My wife Barbara \nand I send our condolences to her beloved children, her son Ira and her \ndaughter Carol, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren. We do \nso with the sure knowledge that the joy of Belle Lipman's life will \nover time ease the pain of her passing, leaving the warmest of memories \nto sustain family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9429-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         COMMENDING GEORGE OTT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a friend of mine, Walt Jacobs, from \nNew England, ND, writes a column in his local newspaper titled ``Around \nThe Pot.'' On August 28, 2009, he wrote a wonderful column about a \ncourageous man named George Ott and his service to our country as an \nAir Force pilot in World War II. I wanted to share it with my \ncolleagues. The column is as follows:\n\n       Today, as I sit with pen in hand, my thoughts are with a \n     good friend, George Ott, who is spending his days at Hawk's \n     Point in retirement in Dickinson. My first recollection of \n     George is when he was in high school at St. Mary's with his \n     sister, Clara in the 30's, a time when there were no crops, \n     low prices, land was blowing and the future was dismal for \n     everyone.\n       Crops were better in 1939, and we experienced good weather \n     and a prosperous economy in the early 40's was enhanced by \n     the war in Europe and the United States entry to the conflict \n     in December of 1941. George interrupted his college and \n     volunteered for duty in the Air Force in 1940 and became a \n     bomber pilot. George bombed a Japanese submarine off the west \n     coast of Washington, one of the first of the war. Stationed \n     in England in 1943, his bomber was chosen to fly a secret \n     mission for the State Department which directed him to fly \n     with a courier to Accru, Africa and from there to Brazil, \n     South America and then to complete the secret mission to \n     Washington, D.C. The three-day trip was met in Washington and \n     the military cover and secrecy convinced the pilot of the \n     mission's urgency and its military importance.\n       He was sent back to England and continued the daylight \n     missions over Europe as squadron commander until Black \n     Friday, the last day of the day-light raids over Germany \n     until the Air Force could provide aerial cover for the \n     bombers. Until that raid on the 14th day of October, the air \n     cover from England had to turn back over Germany when they \n     reached their fuel limit, leaving the bombers to provide \n     their own firepower for defense. As the planes were shot down \n     from their defense formation, the squadrons were left to the \n     mercy of the German planes. On that Friday, George left \n     England, commander of the bomber group to bomb the ball-\n     bearing factory at Schweinfurt. He, in his leading plane, was \n     hit by defensive German antiaircraft fire before he reached \n     the target and fell out of formation. (As were 87 percent of \n     the American bombers shot down on that day on the Schweinfurt \n     raid.) He continued at a slower pace with the loss of motors, \n     but dropped his bombs and turned his plane for home in \n     England. George determined it was best for the crew to bail \n     out of the lumbering air craft over northern Germany, but he \n     continued with one of the four engines running and hoped to \n     make the coast of England. As he flew the plane alone, he \n     spotted a Messerschmitt fighter alongside and gave George a \n     friendly thumbs down sign and George left his plane. As he \n     floated to the earth in his parachute, he saw his bomber shot \n     from the sky.\n       George landed in a potato patch and as he scrambled to bury \n     his chute, he heard a sound behind him and there stood a \n     civilian home-guard with a pointed gun. George said the bore \n     looked big enough to crawl into with the statement, ``For you \n     the krieg bist fertig.'' (For you the war is over.)\n       As George walked around his prison camp he reached through \n     the fence and daily brought the tufts of grass to his stalag \n     and replanted the grass until he had a lawn by his barracks, \n     4x8. As that farm boy spent his time in his prison, the \n     spirit of his farming heritage wanted to lie on the grass \n     while waiting for the war to end.\n       So, today George is waiting once again, but he is not lying \n     on the grass by his stalag in enemy land, but at Hawk's Point \n     with the comfort he deserves so much.\n       So on Wednesday we will honor George on his 90th birthday. \n     Thank you, George, a good and honorable servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9429-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        2009 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE EMPLOYER SUPPORT FREEDOM AWARD\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we focus on improving the \nworkplace and enhancing benefits for employees throughout the Nation, I \nwould like to take this opportunity to highlight an outstanding group \nof law enforcement officers from Louisiana.\n  For the last 8 years, our country has been at war. Thousands of \nAmericans left their usual workplace to honor their commitment to the \narmed services. America's employers have done an outstanding job of \nsupporting our National Guard and Reserve members both in and outside \nthe workplace. Currently, almost one-half of the U.S. military is \ncomprised of National Guard and Reserve members. This support for our \n``Citizen Soldiers'' allows them to continue their invaluable service \nto our country.\n  Each year Guard and Reserve members and their families nominate \nemployers who have gone above and beyond in their support of military \nemployees. This year, Sheriff Andy Brown and the Jackson Parish \nSheriff's Department in Jonesboro, LA, have been selected as one of the \n15 employers to receive the 2009 Secretary of Defense Employer Support \nFreedom Award. This award is the highest recognition given by the U.S. \nGovernment to employers for their outstanding support of employees who \nserve in the National Guard and Reserve. As an added honor, Sheriff \nBrown has been selected as one of the attendees to speak on behalf of \nthese 15 recipients at the 14th Annual Awards Ceremony on September 17.\n  The Jackson Parish Sheriff's Department led by Sheriff Andy Brown was \nselected out of more than 3,200 nominees from across the Nation. \nSheriff Brown and his employees went beyond the call of duty to extend \nemployment support to employees who have volunteered to serve in our \nNation's Armed Forces.\n  The Jackson Parish Sheriff's department employs seven part-time \nservicemembers. Among the benefits that the Jackson Parish Sheriff's \ndepartment provides its National Guard and Reserve employees is full \npay for servicemembers called away on duty for more than 12 months. The \ndepartment also provides continuous health care, dental, and life \ninsurance benefits to ensure coverage and support for servicemembers' \nfamilies while the member is on active duty.\n  Sheriff Brown has fostered a supportive work environment for \nservicemembers by requiring every supervisor and employee in his \ndepartment to thoroughly understand and implement the servicemember \nrights outlined in the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment \nAct. His positive attitude and accommodation for our citizen soldiers \ndemonstrates an unwavering support that exemplifies the spirit of the \nEmployer Support Freedom Award.\n  I offer my heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Sheriff Brown and \nthe entire Jackson Parish Sherriff's Department. The Employer Support \nFreedom Award is a tremendous honor and a fitting recognition of \nSheriff Brown's commitment to our troops and his service to Louisiana \nand our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9429-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9429-S9430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING CAROLE ROPER PARK VAUGHAN\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my \nfriend and former colleague, as well as an outstanding woman of \nservice, Carole Roper Park Vaughan. From 1977 through 1994, Carole \nrepresented the 51st District of Missouri, which includes the home of \nPresident Harry S. Truman, in the Missouri House of Representatives. On \nSeptember 18, Carole will celebrate her 70th birthday, and I just want \nto take a few minutes today to honor her and the contribution she made \nto so many lives in Missouri.\n  Carole was born to Rudy and Rose Roper of Sugar Creek, MO, both \nchildren of Croatian emigrants. Carole's father served as the mayor of \nSugar Creek for 40 years, from 1940 until 1980, so she came by her \npolitical acumen naturally. In fact, while other little girls were \nplaying with dolls, stuffed animals, or having teas, Carole was with \nher father learning the art of making a deal, a skill she would later \ntake with her to the State legislature.\n  Though politics was in her blood, her dedication to public service \ndid not begin with elected office. After graduating from the University \nof Missouri-Kansas City with a bachelor of arts degree in education, \nCarole pursued a teaching career in the Kansas City school district. \nFor 12 years, she taught elementary education in some of the poorest \nschool districts in the Kansas City area. It was here that she fully \nrealized the importance of community involvement. Her students\n\n[[Page S9430]]\n\nwere faced with everyday challenges she had never experienced before, \nand there was a real need for change. As a teacher, however, Carole \nfelt she was limited in how she could effect the meaningful change that \nwas desperately needed in her community.\n  Despite her pedigree and desire to make a difference, Carole's \nascension into public office happened almost by accident. When the \ncurrent legislator in her district suddenly became ill and died, those \nin the community who were impressed by her interest in changing the \nstatus quo encouraged her run. She filed for office on the day of the \nfiling deadline, and in 1976, she was elected to represent the 51st \nDistrict of Missouri. Thankfully, for the people of Missouri, there was \nnothing accidental about her approach to legislating. Hailing from the \nhome of Harry Truman, Carole had a real no-nonsense style about her, \nand she could get things done.\n  During her 18 years as a member of the Missouri House of \nRepresentatives, Carole sponsored 93 bills, many of which became law, \nincluding the largest insurance reform bill in Missouri history. But \nwhat Carole was most known for was her vigorous pursuit to improve the \nway the State of Missouri delivered health and mental health care. In \n1981, she became the first woman in Missouri history to chair a \nstanding appropriations committee, and for 13 years Carole reigned over \nthe Committee on Appropriations for Health and Mental Health. At the \ntime she was appointed to this position, Missouri was headed into a \nrecession, and there was a desperate need to cut health services. Yet \nCarole was able to make the necessary changes without sacrificing \nservices. In fact, throughout her tenure as chair of the committee, \nMissouri reduced overall costs of mental health care programs while \nimproving the services it provided.\n  Carole's dedication to those suffering from mental illness, \ndevelopmental disabilities, head injuries, and substance abuse was \ntruly unparalleled. While her work with community mental health centers \nor substance abuse programs seldom made the front page, she worked \ntirelessly in the pursuit of better treatment for these special \ncitizens. The result of her dedication was the transformation of a \nbadly broken mental health system into a community-based approach that \nprovided real options for some of our most vulnerable.\n  In 1995, Carole retired from the Missouri House of Representatives, \nbut her commitment to her community and the democratic process has \ncontinued. She has remained dedicated to improving services for the \nmentally ill, substance abusers, and victims of domestic violence. She \nhas worked with Thank You Walt Disney Inc. to help restore Walt \nDisney's downtown Kansas City Studio. She has worked tirelessly to \nelect democratic candidates who embody the same steadfast dedication to \neffect change that she had during her time in public service, including \ndevoting countless hours on the phones and going door-to-door for then \nPresidential candidate Barack Obama. Once again, her hard work paid \noff.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in wishing Carole Roper \nPark Vaughan a very happy 70th birthday. She has been a remarkable \nservant to the citizens of the State of Missouri and I am grateful to \ncall her my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9430-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING EDGECOMB POTTERS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Midcoast Maine is a special place \nfor Mainers and tourists alike. With its beautiful harbors and \nquintessential Maine villages, the region is a remarkable cross-section \nof our State. Nestled on route 27 in the heart of this striking area is \nEdgecomb Potters, a veritable gem in Maine's art world. I rise today to \nrecognize this superb Maine company and the innovative spirit of its \nfounders.\n  Located in the town of Edgecomb, Edgecomb Potters was started in a \nsmall one-room schoolhouse by owners Richard and Chris Hilton in 1976. \nBefore starting the business, Richard had been planning on entering the \nbroadcasting industry, while Chris was an art teacher. Since that time, \nEdgecomb Potters has crafted over 1.3 million unique pieces of gorgeous \npottery, and it averages 200,000 pieces each year. Additionally, the \ncompany has expanded to its present day 28-acre complex, where it has \neight kilns, and added satellite retail locations in Freeport and \nPortland. Edgecomb Potters has also grown to a team of more than 30 \nemployees in that time, and over 150,000 people visit the company's \nthree locations each season. Beyond its own pottery, Edgecomb's stores \nshowcase the work of over 400 different artisans, many of them Mainers, \nspecializing in jewelry, sculpture, and glass.\n  The Hiltons work together on each design. Richard Hilton serves as \nEdgecomb's master potter, studying the organic composition and history \nof ceramic glazes from all over the world, and Chris lends her \nextensive art background to the output of beautiful pieces of pottery. \nThey are consistently producing new and creative glazes and patterns \nwhich lend a unique rarity to the company's many pieces. All glazes and \nporcelains are made on site with glazes named by the colors they evoke, \nsuch as Lady Slipper Pink, Apple Green, and Honey Green. In addition to \nthese inventive colors, the potters frequently add golden flecks, \nshimmering crystals, and flowing artistic tones to give a distinctive \nfinish to each piece.\n  During the company's 33-year history, Edgecomb Potters has rightfully \ngained significant national recognition. The Hiltons' passion for glaze \ndevelopment has led them to be considered national leaders in this \nfield, and has propelled their company to be recognized by the Boston \nGlobe, Ceramics Monthly, American Style and numerous other \npublications. Edgecomb Potters also garnered international attention \nwhen trade representatives from Taiwan purchased one of their large \nvases for that country's president in 2001. The vase was made using \nKyoto Forest, a unique glaze Mr. Hilton concocted based on a 17th \ncentury Chinese glaze. The company has also been named one of America's \n``Best of the Road'' companies by Rand McNally. The global atlas \nproducer lists Edgecomb Potters as ``one of the most highly acclaimed \nart potteries in America,'' and cites the ``one-of-a-kind'' pottery as \nan incentive for people to visit this extraordinary facility.\n  Edgecomb Potters continues to expand because of the Hiltons' constant \nand abiding passion for art and pottery, and the number of new \ncustomers they continuously attract worldwide is impressive. Indeed, \nEdgecomb's presence in Maine's art scene has placed our State on the \nnational map as a destination for lovers of stunning and matchless \npottery. I congratulate Richard and Chris Hilton, and everyone at \nEdgecomb Potters, for their pioneering spirit, and offer my best wishes \nfor their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9430-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9430-S9431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:00 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that it has passed \nthe following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 22.

United States, 112 S.Ct. 2408 (1992), that the United \n     States Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative and \n     regulatory processes of the states; and\n       Whereas all states, including Alaska, find themselves \n     regularly facing proposals from the United States Congress \n     that weaken states' rights protected by the Tenth Amendment; \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature hereby claims \n     sovereignty for the state under the Tenth Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States over all powers not \n     otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by \n     the Constitution of the United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution serves as Notice and Demand \n     to the federal government to cease and desist, effective \n     immediately, mandates that are beyond the scope of these \n     constitutionally delegated powers.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and \n     President of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Nancy Pelosi, \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the Honorable \n     Lisa Murkowski and the Honorable Mark Begich, U.S. Senators, \n     and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. Representative, members of \n     the Alaska delegation in Congress; all other members of the \n     111th United States Congress; the presiding officers of the \n     legislatures of each of the other 49 states; and the \n     governors of each of the other 49 states.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-80. A joint resolution adopted by the Alaska State \n     Legislature urging Congress to provide a means for \n     consistently sharing, on an ongoing basis, revenue generated \n     from oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf \n     with all coastal energy-producing states to ensure that those \n     states develop, support, and maintain necessary \n     infrastructure and preserve environmental integrity; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas there are presently 697 active oil and gas leases \n     off Alaska's coast, covering more than 1,500,000 hectares; \n     and\n       Whereas the United States Department of the Interior, \n     Minerals Management Service, estimates there are nearly \n     27,000,000,000 barrels of oil and 132,000,000,000,000 cubic \n     feet of natural gas that are technically recoverable offshore \n     of Alaska; and\n       Whereas responsible oil and gas development in federal \n     waters off Alaska's coast would significantly decrease \n     reliance by the United States on foreign oil and gas, making \n     the United States more energy independent and enhancing our \n     national security; and\n       Whereas, under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, the \n     federal government shares with the states 50 percent of \n     revenue from mineral production on federal land within each \n     state's boundaries; and\n       Whereas the shared mineral production revenue is \n     distributed to the states automatically, outside of the \n     budget process, and is not subject to appropriation; and\n       Whereas, other than in water immediately adjacent to a \n     state's coastline, there is not a similar authority for the \n     federal government to share federal oil and gas revenue \n     generated on the outer continental shelf with adjacent \n     coastal states, despite the vital contribution made by those \n     states to our nation's energy, economic, and national \n     security needs in support of production from the outer \n     continental shelf; and\n       Whereas the states that sustain this critical energy \n     production and development deserve a share of the revenue \n     generated because they provide infrastructure to support \n     offshore operations and because of the environmental effects \n     and other risks associated with oil and gas development on \n     the outer continental shelf; and\n       Whereas, under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of \n     2006, the federal government recognized the contributions \n     made by Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to \n     national security and agreed to give them 37.5 percent of \n     revenue from oil and gas development in newly leased federal \n     waters in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas other coastal states, including Alaska and \n     California, also support and should receive, on a regular and \n     ongoing basis, a fair share of revenue generated through \n     development on the outer continental shelf as compensation \n     and reward for their contributions to the nation's energy \n     supply, security, and economy; and\n       Whereas, since statehood, oil and gas lease sales from the \n     outer continental shelf off Alaska's coast have generated \n     millions of dollars in revenue for the federal government; \n     and\n       Whereas the February 2008 lease sale in the Chukchi Sea \n     generated an additional $2,600,000,000 in revenue for the \n     federal government; be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature supports \n     responsible development of the oil and gas resources in \n     federal waters offshore of Alaska's coast as a means to \n     ensure energy independence, security for the nation, and jobs \n     for Alaskans; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to provide a means for consistently \n     sharing, on an ongoing basis, revenue generated from oil and \n     gas development on the outer continental shelf with all \n     coastal energy-producing states to ensure that those states \n     develop, support, and maintain necessary infrastructure and \n     preserve environmental integrity.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and \n     President of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Ken Salazar, \n     United States Secretary of the Interior; the Honorable Nancy \n     Pelosi, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the \n     Honorable Steny H.

A joint resolution adopted by the Alaska State \n     Legislature urging Congress to pass legislation to open the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil \n     and gas exploration, development, and production, and that \n     the Alaska State Legislature is adamantly opposed to further \n     wilderness or other restrictive designation in the area of \n     the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas in 16 U.S.C. 3142 (sec. 1002 of the Alaska National \n     Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA)), the United States \n     Congress reserved the right to permit further oil and gas \n     exploration, development, and production within the coastal \n     plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas the oil industry, the state, and the United States \n     Department of the Interior consider the coastal plain to have \n     the highest potential for discovery of very large oil and gas \n     accumulations on the continent of North America, estimated to \n     be as much as 10,400,000,000 barrels of recoverable oil; and\n       Whereas the ``1002 study area'' is part of the coastal \n     plain located within the North\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\n     Slope Borough, and many of the residents of the North Slope \n     Borough, who are predominantly Inupiat Eskimo, are supportive \n     of development in the ``1002 study area''; and\n       Whereas oil and gas exploration and development of the \n     coastal plain of the refuge and adjacent land could result in \n     major discoveries that would reduce our nation's future need \n     for imported oil, help balance the nation's trade deficit, \n     and significantly increase the nation's security; and\n       Whereas the state's future energy independence would be \n     enhanced with additional natural gas production from the \n     North Slope of Alaska, including what are expected to be \n     significant gas reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, and the development of those reserves would enhance \n     the economic viability of the proposed Alaska Natural Gas \n     Pipeline; and\n       Whereas domestic demand for oil continues to rise while \n     domestic crude production continues to fall, with the result \n     that the United States imports additional oil from foreign \n     sources; and\n       Whereas development of oil at Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk, \n     Endicott, Lisburne, Ooguruk, and Milne Point has resulted in \n     thousands of jobs throughout the United States, and projected \n     job creation as a result of coastal plain oil development \n     will have a positive effect in all 50 states; and\n       Whereas Prudhoe Bay production is declining; and\n       Whereas the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, a transportation \n     facility that is a national asset and that would cost \n     billions of dollars to replace, would have its useful \n     physical life extended for a substantial period if the \n     additional reserves of recoverable oil from the coastal plain \n     were produced; and\n       Whereas while new oil field developments on the North Slope \n     of Alaska, such as Alpine, Northstar, Lisburne, Ooguruk, and \n     West Sak, may temporarily slow the decline in production, \n     only giant coastal plain fields have the theoretical \n     capability of increasing the production volume of Alaska oil \n     to a significant degree; and\n       Whereas opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge now allows sufficient time for planning \n     environmental safeguards, development, and national security \n     review; and\n       Whereas the 1,500,000-acre coastal plain of the refuge \n     makes up only eight percent of the 19,000,000-acre refuge, \n     and the development of the oil and gas reserves in the \n     refuge's coastal plain would affect an area of 2,000 acres or \n     less, which is less than one-half of one percent of the area \n     of the coastal plain; and\n       Whereas 8,900,000 of the 19,000,000 acres of the refuge \n     have already been set aside as wilderness; and\n       Whereas the oil industry has shown at Prudhoe Bay, as well \n     as at other locations along the Arctic coastal plain, that it \n     is capable of conducting oil and gas activity without \n     adversely affecting the environment or wildlife populations; \n     and\n       Whereas the state will strive to ensure the continued \n     health and productivity of the Porcupine Caribou herd and the \n     protection of land, water, and wildlife resources during the \n     exploration and development of the coastal plain of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas the oil and gas industry is developing directional \n     drilling technology that will allow horizontal drilling in a \n     responsible manner thereby minimizing the development \n     footprint within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and \n     this directional drilling technology may be capable of \n     drilling from outside of the boundaries of the 1002 study \n     area; and\n       Whereas the oil industry is using innovative technology and \n     environmental practices in the new field developments at \n     Alpine and Northstar, and those techniques are directly \n     applicable to operating on the coastal plain and would \n     enhance environmental protection beyond traditionally high \n     standards; and\n       Whereas the continued competitiveness and stability of the \n     state and its economy require that the Alaska State \n     Legislature consider national trends toward renewable energy \n     development; and\n       Whereas the Alaska State Legislature encourages the use of \n     revenue from any development in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge for the development of renewable energy resources in \n     the state; be it\n       Resolved by the Alaska State Legislature, That the United \n     States Congress is urged to pass legislation to open the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil \n     and gas exploration, development, and production, and that \n     the Alaska State Legislature is adamantly opposed to further \n     wilderness or other restrictive designation in the area of \n     the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That that activity be conducted in a manner that \n     protects the environment and the naturally occurring \n     population levels of the Porcupine Caribou herd on which the \n     Gwich'in and other local residents depend, that uses \n     directional drilling and other advances in technology to \n     minimize the development footprint in the 1002 study area, \n     and that uses the state's workforce to the maximum extent \n     possible; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to pass legislation opening the 1002 \n     study area for oil and gas development while continuing to \n     work on measures for increasing the development and use of \n     renewable energy technologies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature opposes any \n     unilateral reduction in royalty revenue from exploration and \n     development of the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge and any attempt to coerce the State of Alaska \n     into accepting less than the 90 percent of the oil, gas, and \n     mineral royalties from the federal land in Alaska that was \n     promised to the state at statehood.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States;

Biden, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and \n     President of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Ken Salazar, \n     United States Secretary of the Interior; the Honorable Nancy \n     Pelosi, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the \n     Honorable John Boehner, Minority Leader of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives; the Honorable Harry Reid, Majority Leader of \n     the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Mitch McConnell, Minority \n     Leader of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Jeff Bingaman, Chair \n     of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee of the U.S. \n     Senate; the Honorable Lisa Murkowski and the Honorable Mark \n     Begich, U.S. Senators, and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. \n     Representative, members of the Alaska delegation in Congress; \n     and all other members of the 111th United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-82. A joint resolution adopted by the Alaska State \n     Legislature urging Congress to preserve its right to enact a \n     law providing for the environmentally responsible exploration \n     and development of oil and gas resources in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge by not passing any legislation that \n     designates land in Area 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge as wilderness; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n       Whereas Area 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \n     considered the most promising onshore oil and gas prospect in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas the United States Department of the Interior \n     estimates that there may be 10,400,000,000 recoverable \n     barrels of oil and significant quantities of natural gas in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas the potentially enormous oil and gas prospects are \n     located in Area 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \n     and Area 1002 comprises only eight percent of the total area \n     of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas the United States Congress, in 16 U.S.C. 3121 (sec. \n     1002, Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act), \n     authorized oil and gas exploratory activity within the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and \n     reserved the right to enact future laws to allow for entry \n     into and development of oil and gas resources in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas Area 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     was excluded from wilderness designation in 1980 as a result \n     of a compromise in the negotiations that led to the \n     conversion of the Alaska Wildlife Range into the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge, with the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge encompassing an area that is approximately double the \n     size of the Alaska Wildlife Range; and\n       Whereas 16 U.S.C. 3101(d) (sec. 101(d), Alaska National \n     Interest Lands Conservation Act) expresses the belief of the \n     United States Congress that the need for future legislation \n     designating new conservation system units, new national \n     conservation areas, or new national recreation areas in \n     Alaska has been obviated by the enactment of the Alaska \n     National Interest Lands Conservation Act; and\n       Whereas development of the oil reserves in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge would reduce the dependence of the \n     United States on unstable sources of foreign oil and would \n     make the economy of the United States stronger and more \n     stable; and\n       Whereas the economy of the United States would suffer \n     further if the large natural gas resources in Area 1002 of \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are not available for \n     transportation in the proposed Alaska natural gas pipeline; \n     and\n       Whereas clean-burning natural gas delivered by way of the \n     proposed Alaska natural gas pipeline could be used as an \n     environmentally friendly energy source for homes and \n     businesses in the lower 48 states for decades to come; and\n       Whereas new technology and environmental practices used by \n     the oil and gas industry provide for efficient production and \n     environmental protection; and\n       Whereas 8,900,000 acres of the 19,000,000 acres in the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are already designated as \n     wilderness areas; and\n       Whereas, assuming development of major oil and gas \n     prospects and full leasing, oil and gas operations will have \n     a footprint on only 2,000 acres out of a total of 1,500,000 \n     acres in Area 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \n     approximately 0.13 percent of the area; be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to preserve its right to enact a law \n     providing for the environmentally responsible exploration and \n     development of oil and gas resources in the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge by not passing any legislation that \n     designates land in Area 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge as wilderness.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Joseph R.

A joint resolution adopted by the Alaska State \n     Legislature urging the President and Congress not to adopt \n     any policy, rule, or administrative action or enact \n     legislation that would restrict energy exploration, \n     development, and production in federal and state waters \n     around Alaska, the outer continental shelf within 200 miles \n     of shore, and elsewhere in the continental United States; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n       Whereas the future growth of the United States economy is \n     energy-dependent and requires access to domestic oil and gas \n     resources, alternative and renewable energy resources, and \n     increased conservation; and\n       Whereas the United States, as a matter of national policy, \n     needs to reduce its long-term dependence on foreign energy \n     sources for the purposes of economic and national security; \n     and\n       Whereas responsible development and expansion of domestic \n     energy resources will generate thousands of much-needed jobs; \n     result in billions of dollars in new investment in and tax \n     revenue for federal, state, and local governments; reduce oil \n     imports; stem the flow of United States dollars to foreign \n     governments for the purchase of energy supplies; and \n     generally ensure the health of the United States economy in \n     the short and long term; and\n       Whereas wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and other \n     alternative energy resources hold the potential for meeting \n     future energy demands and deserve support, but are incapable \n     of meeting current domestic energy needs; and\n       Whereas current domestic energy needs require increased \n     access to domestic oil and gas while alternative energy \n     resources are developed for the future; and\n       Whereas vast energy resources in the United States, \n     including billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic \n     feet of natural gas in areas on the North Slope and offshore \n     from Alaska remain untouched and could be developed \n     economically; and\n       Whereas new drilling techniques and environmentally sound \n     exploration, development, and production technologies enable \n     the development of oil and gas reserves in the continental \n     United States and on the outer continental shelf as domestic \n     energy resources; and\n       Whereas the safe and responsible exploration and \n     development of all domestic energy resources to provide \n     economic and national security is in the best interests of \n     the citizens of the United States; and\n       Whereas the people of Alaska support the safe and \n     responsible development of domestic energy resources and \n     recognize the economic benefits of a balanced energy policy \n     that includes increased development of domestic oil and gas \n     resources; be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     not to adopt any policy, rule, or administrative action or \n     enact legislation that would restrict energy exploration, \n     development, and production in federal and state waters \n     around Alaska, the outer continental shelf within 200 miles \n     of shore, and elsewhere in the continental United States; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     to encourage and promote continued responsible exploration, \n     development, and production of domestic oil and gas \n     resources.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Joseph R.

A bill to implement title V of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nAct of 1978 and to promote economical and environmentally sustainable \nmeans of meeting the energy demands of developing countries, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Energy \nDevelopment Program Implementation Act\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\nof 2009. This legislation provides a mechanism to guide the \nimplementation of title V of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, \nwhich requires the United States to work with developing countries in \nassessing and finding ways to meet their energy needs through non-\nnuclear, alternative energy sources.\n  Although title V of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act was passed into \nlaw more than 30 years ago, Congress did not put an implementation \nframework into place, and the Executive Branch never implemented the \nprovisions. Back then, there may have been skepticism about the \neconomic viability of alternative energy resources, but in the past 30 \nyears there have been significant advances in the technology supporting \nalternative energy resources, and today there is broader agreement that \nthe development of these resources is important for economic \ndevelopment, environmental sustainability, and national security.\n  This bill provides economic and environmental benefits to developing \ncountries and diplomatic benefits for the U.S. Through the \nimplementation of the Energy Development Program supported by this \nbill, developing countries will be provided energy assessments, receive \nsupport in evaluating energy alternatives, and be able to work on \ncooperative projects with United States energy experts on resource \nexploration, production, training, and research and development. This \nbill will further international collaboration around alternative energy \nsources and allow the United States to take on a stronger leadership \nrole in this effort.\n  In addition to providing economic and environmental benefits, this \nbill supports international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. \nThe bipartisan Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Proliferation and Terrorism recently recommended the \nimplementation of title V because it will lower the risk of nuclear \nproliferation as developing countries are encouraged to focus more on \nnon-nuclear, alternative energy sources. Providing concrete technical \nassistance to promote those energy sources in developing countries \nreduces the inherent risk that accompanies the wider proliferation of \nnuclear technology and materials.\n  We should remain mindful that the same nuclear technology that can be \nused for peaceful, civilian uses may in some cases be used to support \ncovert or potentially dangerous nuclear programs. At my request, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, reviewed the International \nAtomic Energy Agency's, IAEA, Technical Cooperation, TC, Program, which \nsupports peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including nuclear power, by \nproviding nuclear equipment, training, and fellowships to IAEA member \nstates. The U.S. provides approximately 25 percent of its annual \nbudget. GAO found that the U.S. faces difficulty in assessing the \nnature of the nuclear assistance provided under that program, and that \nstate sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, Syria, Sudan, and Cuba had \nreceived funding under the program. For instance, GAO reported that \nIran requested assistance to complete a research reactor that could \nhave been used for both civilian and military applications. \nFortunately, IAEA denied this assistance, but this example highlights \nthe inherent proliferation risks of nuclear power and the benefit of \nfocusing more on alternative energy sources.\n  This bill puts into place an implementation mechanism to support this \neffort. It requires the Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the \nSecretary of State and the administrator of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, to develop strategic and implementation \nplans for the Energy Development Program. The Secretary of Energy will \nthen be required to carry out the implementation of the program \naccording to those plans.\n  The Energy Development Program would be supported by the exchange of \nenergy experts, scientists, and technicians with developing countries. \nFederal employees will have an opportunity to work with developing \ncountries on energy assessments and projects focused on finding and \ndeveloping non-nuclear, alternative sources of energy, while retaining \ntheir seniority and other rights and benefits within their home \nagencies. They will be able to share their expertise with professionals \nin developing countries and also bring back new ideas and perspectives \nfrom overseas that could help us in our own efforts to develop \nalternative energy sources.\n  The time has come to implement title V of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Act.

A bill to allow for the use of existing section 8 housing \nfunds so as to preserve and revitalize affordable housing options for \nlow-income individuals; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Affordable \nHousing Preservation and Revitalization Act. I am delighted and honored \nto be joined in this effort by my good friend and colleague, Senator \nJeff Merkley. It has been my privilege to work with Senator Merkley and \nhis staff on an issue that is so important to our state of Oregon and \nto folks around the country.\n  There has been a lot of talk about housing in the media over the past \nyear. The topic of most of these conversations has been the turmoil in \nlending industry and the fallout from the mortgage meltdown. So much so \nthat many Americans have by now become familiar with terms like \n``subprime'' and ``securitization.''\n  But there is another housing story here, even though it may not get \nthe same attention or airtime: It is the story of homelessness and the \nstruggle to find affordable housing, and for thousands of Oregonians \nit's a daily reality.\n  Like many States, Oregon is experiencing a sharp rise in \nhomelessness.\n  In Multnomah County this past January, a count found 2,438 people \nhomeless on a particular night. That was 13 percent higher than in \n2007. The deterioration in the economy since January means there are \nprobably more homeless on Portland streets now, officials said.\n  In July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development released a \nreport that listed Oregon as the State with the highest concentration \nof homeless people.\n  According to a September report by the National Alliance to End \nHomeless, Central Oregon now ranks sixth in the Nation in overall \nhomelessness rates and third among rural communities.\n  In times like these, the Federal Government can hardly stand to lose \nits stock of affordable housing. Sadly, that is exactly whats \nhappening.\n  As long term contracts are coming due, many landlords are leaving the \nbusiness of affordable housing for the private market. As these owners \nconvert to market rents, which is in their economic interest, the low-\nincome tenants will be unable to afford their homes. With fewer and \nfewer places to turn, many of these folks will end up on the street.\n  Some of properties have what are known as residual receipts--funds \nleft over once the operating expenses and owner's distribution have \nbeen paid. Currently, this money can only be used in the most extreme \nof situations. As a result, many of these residual receipts have \naccumulated for nearly 3 decades. In Oregon alone, estimates suggest \nthere are more than $10 million in untapped residual receipts.\n  Senator Merkley and I believe these funds represent a substantial \nasset that could be used to help preserve affordable housing projects \nwith expiring contracts. That is why we are introducing the Affordable \nHousing Preservation and Revitalization Act.\n  Our legislation would permit residual receipts to be transferred with \naffordable housing properties that are sold to non-profits, provided \nthe non-profits commit to preserving and maintaining the housing stock \nas affordable.\n  Our legislation isn't a magic bullet and it certainly will not ensure \nthat every American can put a roof over their head. But we think it's \nthe kind of common sense approach that Americans can get behind. I hope \nthat our colleagues will join us in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Reid, Mr. Isakson, \n        and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1678. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe first-time homebuyer tax credit, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to extend the \ncurrent first-time home buyers' tax credit for 6 months to June 1, \n2010. I am pleased to have Senators Ensign, Harry Reid, Isakson, and \nStabenow as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  I know my colleagues remember that it was housing that led us into \nthis recession. Remember how in the housing market the values fell, \nthere were mortgage foreclosures, and housing starts stopped. Well, \nhousing can help lead us out of this recession.\n  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 initially established a \ncredit at $7,500, and that was repayable over 15 years. The American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased that credit to $8,000, \ndropped the repayment obligation, and extended the credit to December \n1, 2009.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with my colleagues Senators \nEnsign, Harry Reid, Isakson, and Stabenow would change the expiration \ndate from December 1, 2009, to June 1, 2010. I know my colleagues \nunderstand the time delay here which requires that the houses go \nthrough settlement in order to qualify for the credit. So I think it is \nimportant that we act timely, not waiting until November 1, but to try \nto get this bill moving quickly. It has been an incredibly important \ntool to help the housing market to help restore our economy.\n\n  This is a direct extension, a clean extension. It basically extends \nit for 6 months. I have talked with my colleagues about ways this \ncredit perhaps could be improved, and I know we will get into that \ndebate. But I want to make sure we don't have a lapse in this credit \nbeing available to help first-time home buyers. It has been very \nvaluable. As we work to perhaps modify this proposal, let us make sure \nwe continue it so as we are fighting to get our economy back on track, \nwe don't regress and lose this tool that is available to help the \nhousing market.\n  The credit has been a huge success in helping to revive a depressed \nhousing market. As of March 6, 2009, the Treasury inspector general for \ntax administration identified nearly 530,000 returns claiming more than \n$3.9 billion in the first-time homeowners' tax credit.\n  As many as 40 percent of all home buyers this year will qualify for a \ncredit. That tells us this credit is working. It is getting people who \nhave never owned a home before into the home-buying market, knowing \nthat the Federal Government is providing an incentive. It is estimated \nthe credit is directly responsible for roughly 300,000 to 400,000 \npurchases this year. According to the National Association of Realtors, \nthose additional sales have pumped approximately $22 billion into the \neconomy. This is a modest tax incentive to help an industry that is \nvital to our economy, that produces an incredible amount of economic \nactivity and jobs. Mortgage applications increased nearly 10 percent \nfor the week ending September 3 from late August, the largest gain \nsince early April.\n  Economists such as Mark Zandi of Moody's and James Glassman of \nJPMorgan Chase support extending this credit. While there are signs \nthat the housing market is stabilizing, we are not out of the woods \nyet. The industry and part of the economy still needs help. I have \ntalked to many of the realtors in my community in Maryland and they \ntell me the inventory of property on the market is at high levels. \nThere is a lot of inventory out there. More people are wanting to sell \nthan people willing to buy. The number of new housing starts for \nresidential homes is at a very low level. Each\n\n[[Page S9440]]\n\nhousing start creates jobs. It creates jobs in the material industry. \nIt creates all types of ripples in our economy. So getting the housing \nmarket back on track will not only help in getting more homeowners into \nhomes and helping the economy that direct way, it also creates the jobs \nand maintains the jobs of those who supply the network which will \ncreate new housing stock for America.\n  Dean Baker, the codirector for the Center for Economic and Policy \nResearch, notes that price declines could resume later this fall. I \nquote:\n\n       The uptick in sales driven by the credit has led to a \n     substantial increase in the number of homes offered for sale \n     at just the time that the boost from the credit is dwindling. \n     The inventory will also be a much larger drag in the slow-\n     selling winter months. . . .\n\n  So we now have a large inventory, and if the credit is not available, \nI think it will have a very negative impact on the ability to continue \nhousing sales at a level of recovery for our economy.\n  Extending the credit is prudent and a fiscally responsible measure. \nIt provides the help. We know it works. We know what has happened. We \nknow we are still in difficult times. It is not the time to eliminate \nthis tool that we have available. That is why I am recommending an \nextension, not a permanent extension, because we want this credit to be \navailable to get us out of our current economic problems. We know we \nstill need it. A 6-month extension is the minimum we should do. At the \nsame time, we should look at other ways to improve and help the housing \nindustry and to help the recovery of our Nation.\n  I appreciate my colleagues who have joined me in this effort. I hope \nmy colleagues in this body will help us with moving this legislation as \npromptly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9440-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 269--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 20, \n        2009, AS ``NATIONAL HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Cornyn, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Udall of \nColorado, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Levin, Mr. Casey, and Mrs. \nMurray) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Borlaug was born on March 25, 1914, \n     of Norwegian parents on a farm in Cresco, Iowa, and was \n     educated in a 1-room school house throughout grades 1 through \n     8;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug attended the University of Minnesota, \n     where he earned a Ph.D. degree in Plant Pathology;\n       Whereas, beginning in 1944, Dr. Borlaug spent 2 decades in \n     rural Mexico working to assist the poorest farmers through a \n     pioneering Rockefeller Foundation program;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug's research and innovative ``shuttle \n     breeding'' in Mexico enabled him to develop a new approach to \n     agriculture and a new disease-resistant variety of wheat with \n     triple the output of grain;\n       Whereas this breakthrough achievement in plant production \n     enabled Mexico to become self-sufficient in wheat by 1956, \n     and concurrently raised the living standard for thousands of \n     poor Mexican farmers;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug was asked by the United Nations to \n     travel to India and Pakistan in the 1960s, as South-Asia and \n     the Middle East faced an imminent widespread famine, where he \n     eventually helped convince those 2 warring governments to \n     adopt his new seeds and new approach to agriculture to \n     address this critical problem;\n       Whereas, Dr. Borlaug brought miracle wheat to India and \n     Pakistan, which helped both countries become self-sufficient \n     in wheat production, thus saving hundreds of millions of \n     people from hunger, famine, and death;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug and his team trained young scientists \n     from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and \n     Afghanistan in this same new approach to agriculture, which \n     introduced new seeds but also put emphasis on the use of \n     fertilizer and irrigation, thus increasing yields \n     significantly in those countries as well;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug's approach to wheat was adapted by \n     research scientists working in rice, which spread the Green \n     Revolution to Asia, feeding and saving millions of people \n     from hunger and starvation;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1970 as the ``Father of the Green Revolution'' and is only 1 \n     of 5 people to have ever received the Nobel Peace Prize, \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug headed the Sasakawa Global 2000 program \n     to bring the Green Revolution to 10 countries in Africa, and \n     traveled the world to educate the next generation of \n     scientists on the importance of producing new breakthrough \n     achievements in food production;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug tirelessly promoted the potential that \n     biotechnology offers for feeding the world, while also \n     preserving biodiversity, in the 21st century when the global \n     population is projected to rise to 9,000,000,000 people;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug continued his role as an educator as a \n     Distinguished Professor at Texas A University, while also \n     working at the International Center for the Improvement of \n     Wheat and Maize in Mexico;\n       Whereas Dr. Borlaug founded the World Food Prize, called by \n     several world leaders ``The Nobel Prize for Food and \n     Agriculture'', which is awarded in Iowa each October so as to \n     recognize and inspire Nobel-like achievements in increasing \n     the quality, quantity, and availability of food in the world;\n       Whereas the Senate designated October 16 as World Food \n     Prize Day in America in honor of Dr. Borlaug; and\n       Whereas it is written of Dr. Borlaug that throughout all of \n     his work he saved 1,000,000,000 lives, thus making him widely \n     known as saving more lives than any other person in human \n     history: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate has received with profound sorrow and deep \n     regret the announcement of the passing of Dr. Norman Borlaug;\n       (2) the Senate directs the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of \n     the deceased; and\n       (3) when the Senate adjourns today, the Senate stands \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of Dr. \n     Norman Borlaug.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/16/senate-section/article/S9441-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2407.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of Calendar No. 120, S. 1494.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1494) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2010 for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities of the United States Government, the Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010, S. 1494, that the \nSenate has approved by unanimous consent.\n  The legislation is the product of a bipartisan effort in the \nIntelligence Committee, which was reflected by the committee's \nunanimous vote of 15 to 0 on the bill. I thank Vice Chairman Bond for \nhis efforts on the legislation and the full committee staff for their \nwork.\n  It has been 4 years since the Congress has passed and the President \nhas signed an intelligence authorization act. This has meant that the \nlaw has not kept up with changes in the intelligence community and that \nCongress has not been able to require reforms and provide flexibilities \nthat are sorely needed. I am pleased that the Senate has taken a major \nstep toward enactment.\n  Before summarizing some of the key provisions of this legislation, \nlet me briefly describe the way in which it was written.\n  The committee has worked with the Director of National Intelligence, \nDNI, ADM Dennis Blair, to identify areas where legislation is needed to \nbetter run and oversee the Nation's 16 intelligence agencies. Many of \nthese provisions have been proposed and included in previous \nlegislation reported out by the Intelligence Committee but have yet to \nbe passed into law.\n  At the request of the White House, we have separated issues of \nterrorist detention and interrogation from this bill and the committee \nintends to take up legislation on those issues separately. The \ncommittee has not changed its position from previous legislation on the \nneed to have an effective and humane interrogation program that \noperates fully within the nation's laws and international commitments.\n  The major themes of this bill are to strengthen the Director of \nNational Intelligence to make sure that he has the management \nauthorities and flexibilities needed to direct the intelligence \ncommunity; insist upon stronger accountability and oversight mechanisms \nfor intelligence activities, both within the executive branch and by \nthe Congress; and to fund fully the intelligence community's share of \nthe war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the continuing \ncounterterrorism operations against al-Qaida and other terrorist \norganizations worldwide.\n  There is also a classified annex to this bill, which lays out the \nauthorized funding levels for the National Intelligence Program. The \ntheme of the annex is to shift funds from intelligence activities that \nare less capable, lower priority, or not performing to those that will \nprovide the Nation with better capabilities for intelligence \ncollection, analysis, counterintelligence, and covert action.\n  The details of the classified annex are necessarily secret, but all \nMembers are welcome to review them at the committee's offices at any \ntime.\n  Let me describe some of the notable provisions in more detail.\n  To add to the management authorities of the Director of National \nIntelligence, the bill gives the Director of National Intelligence \ngreater flexibility in personnel matters, including extending the \nlength of time that personnel may be detailed to an intelligence agency \nto 3 years from the current 1 year. It also provides the Director, \nworking with individual intelligence agencies, to shift or hire \npersonnel by up to 5 percent above authorized personnel levels if \nintelligence requirements demand doing so. The bill authorizes the DNI \nto conduct accountability reviews of personnel and elements within the \nintelligence community, further clarifying that the Director is the \nsenior official in the intelligence community. It seeks to prevent \nrepetitions of information sharing problems by enabling the DNI to \npurchase necessary equipment or technology to improve information \nsharing with governmental departments or agencies regardless of whether \nthey are part of the intelligence community. The bill also requires the \nintelligence community to continue putting in place the information \ntechnology necessary to assure information flows between its agencies.\n  The committee has longstanding concerns with the way the intelligence \ncommunity has briefed, or has failed to brief, the congressional \nIntelligence Committees on all intelligence activities and covert \nactions. Two major controversies, over CIA detention and interrogation \nand over the warrantless surveillance program of the National Security \nAgency, were both briefed only to the chairman and vice chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. The rest of the committee's membership \nwas unaware of these programs for years.\n  The bill strengthens the statutory requirements to keep the \ncongressional intelligence committees ``fully and currently informed'' \nof intelligence activities and covert actions. The legislation makes \nclear that there is no exception to the obligation to brief Congress on \nintelligence activities and covert actions; requires that notifications \ninclude a description of the legal authority on which activities are \nundertaken; and requires that all committee members be provided with \nthe broad outlines--the ``main features''--of intelligence programs in \nthose instances where the sensitive operational details are provided \nonly to a limited number of Senators.\n  In addition to ensuring that notifications to the Congress are \nconducted, the bill includes a number of additional provisions intended \nto strengthen intelligence oversight. These include creating an \nindependent inspector general, confirmed by the Senate, to help the DNI \noversee the intelligence community and strengthening the inspectors \ngeneral of the National Security Agency, NSA, Defense Intelligence \nAgency, DIA, National Reconnaissance Office, NRO, and National \nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency, NGA, by listing them\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\nunder the Inspector General Act of 1978.\n  They include requiring Senate confirmation for the Directors of the \nNational Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and for the Deputy Director of \nthe CIA. For several years, the Intelligence Committee has viewed these \npositions as holding substantial budgetary and policy responsibilities.\n  They also include improving the intelligence community's ability to \nbudget, manage finances, and run program acquisitions. I am unable to \nstate publicly why these provisions are so important, but it is fair to \nsay that intelligence agencies have had major failures in this regard. \nIn this bill, we have sought to apply best practices from other parts \nof the government to intelligence community management and acquisitions \nwith the goal of more efficiently and effectively using taxpayer \ndollars to fund intelligence activities.\n  Finally, while I am unable to provide specifics due to reasons of \nclassification, let me highlight five other parts of the bill and its \nclassified annex that merit recognition.\n  Satellites. To address a problem created by years of mismanagement \nand acquisition failures, the annex to this bill recommends a more \ncapable and more affordable imagery satellite architecture that \naddresses the requirements of both our civilian policymakers and \nmilitary warfighters.\n  Languages. As our committee report notes, the intelligence \ncommunity's language capabilities are abysmal. This bill authorizes \nincreased funding to significantly improve language proficiencies. \nRather than funding separate initiatives across the various \nintelligence agencies, this funding is provided to the Director of \nNational Intelligence for allocation and coordination to maximize \neffectiveness.\n  Research and Development. The U.S. intelligence community leads the \nworld in the technical collection of intelligence. This success is the \nresult of decades of investment in research and development. The annex \nto this bill recommends increases in investment on research and \ndevelopment to return to the level of funding necessary to maintain the \nnation's technological edge.\n  Cybersecurity. The committee has held numerous hearings with the \nActing Senior Director for Cybersecurity in the National Security \nCouncil, the Director of the National Security Agency, and the \ncommittee's Technical Advisory Group. I believe strongly that cyber \nattack and espionage by adversary nations and nonstate actors pose a \ngrave threat to our Nation's national and economic security. I also \nbelieve, however, that initiatives underway to provide for security of \nthe government's cyber networks need to be implemented and overseen \ncarefully to ensure that privacy rights are upheld.\n  For this reason, the bill includes a provision that establishes a \nframework for executive and congressional oversight for cybersecurity. \nSpecifically, it requires reporting to Congress on the legal \nauthorities for cyber-security programs, privacy assessments, and \ndetails of the concept of operations for these activities. The \nprovision also requires thorough auditing of cyber-security programs by \nthe relevant inspectors general, especially to determine compliance \nwith law and privacy rights. Finally, the provision authorizes the \ndetail of cyber experts from the intelligence community to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and FBI to assist in their roles in \ncyber defense and law enforcement. The annex to the bill also adjusts \nfunding levels to ensure that the President's request for cyber-\nsecurity activities are appropriately funded and are proceeding under \nclear legal and policy guidance.\n  Report on compliance with laws related to detention and \ninterrogation. As I noted, the administration and our committee \ncontinue to conduct reviews of detention and interrogation practices \nbegun after September 11, 2001. This bill requires the DNI to report on \nhow the intelligence community complies with all laws, international \nobligations, and executive orders related to the detention and \ninterrogation of persons under their control.\n  Following the reporting of our bill on July 22, we have worked with \nthree committees of the Senate to resolve several questions.\n  We have worked with the Armed Services Committee to develop a Senate \nresolution that will govern the sequence of referral, between that \ncommittee and the Intelligence Committee, of nominations for Director \nof the National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, \nand the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. That resolution has \nthe support of Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain of the Armed \nServices Committee, as well as having my and Vice Chairman Bond's \nsupport. I will address the proposed resolution in a separate colloquy \ntoday with Chairman Levin.\n  We have worked with Ranking Member Cochran of the Appropriations \nCommittee on an agreement to strike, in a managers' amendment, section \n341 of the bill that would have expressed the sense of the Senate on an \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence. That internal Senate \nmatter will continue to be discussed within the Senate but will not be \na part of this bill.\n  We have worked with Chairman Leahy of the Judiciary Committee to \nresolve several matters. The managers' amendment that Vice Chairman \nBond and I have offered amends three provisions which require the \nsubmission of reports on various matters. The purpose of the amendments \nto sections 336, 407, and 445 is to ensure that the Judiciary Committee \nreceives reports on matters within its jurisdiction. In consultation \nwith the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the managers' \namendment amends section 411 on a FOIA operational file exemption to \nstate more precisely the intent of the provision. The managers' \namendment also strikes section 352 that establishes a FOIA exemption \nfor terrorist identity information that is disseminated for terrorist \nscreening purposes. As a comparable provision has been reported in the \nHouse, we expect that the provision will be the subject of further \nconsideration at conference.\n  Mr. President, the vice chairman and I have worked hard to produce \nbipartisan legislation that provides the intelligence community with \nthe tools and resources needed to keep the Nation safe and to inform \ndecisionmakers. This bill does just that. It strikes a balance between \nallowing intelligence agencies the latitude to conduct their operations \nwhile ensuring their legality and efficiency.\n  I very much appreciate the Senate's approval of this legislation and \nlook forward to bringing a conference report to the Senate as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for too many years, Congress has failed to \npass an intelligence authorization bill that could be signed into law. \nWe came close once, only to have our efforts derailed by a problematic \ninterrogation provision. We have solved that problem this year, and now \nI believe we finally have a product that we can move forward with the \nhope that it will soon be signed into law.\n  The intelligence authorization bill before us will give the \nintelligence community the flexibility and authorities it needs to \nfunction effectively and will ensure appropriate intelligence oversight \nby this committee.\n  Over the past several months, we have worked closely with the \nadministration and other committees to address their concerns over \nvarious provisions. Of course, some concerns were easier to resolve \nthan others. But we are now at a point that I believe we can pass this \nbill through the Senate.\n  I have often said that in creating the Director of National \nIntelligence, we gave him an awful lot of responsibility without all \nthe authority he needed. Well, our bill attempts to address that \nproblem by giving the DNI clearer authority and greater flexibility in \noverseeing the intelligence community.\n  There are also a number of provisions in this bill that I believe are \nessential for promoting good government. Too often, we have seen \nprograms or acquisitions of major systems balloon in cost and decrease \nin performance. That is unacceptable. We are in difficult economic \ntimes and the taxpayers are spending substantial sums of money to \nensure that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep \nus safe. If we don't demand accountability for how these tools are \noperated or created, then we are failing the taxpayers, and we are \nfailing the intelligence community.\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\n  So, for the past several years, I have sponsored amendments that \nrequire the intelligence community to perform vulnerability assessments \nof major systems and to keep track of excessive cost growth of major \nsystems. This latter provision is modeled on the Nunn-McCurdy provision \nwhich has guided Defense Department acquisitions for years. I am happy \nto say that these provisions are part of this year's bill too. I \nbelieve that these, and other good-government provisions, will \nencourage earlier identification and solving of problems relating to \nthe acquisition of major systems. Too often, such problems have not \nbeen identified until exorbitant sums of money have been spent--and, \nunfortunately, at that point, there is often reluctance to cancel the \nproject.\n  Similarly, the intelligence community must get a handle on its \npersonnel levels. Now, I do not share the belief that the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence is too large; in fact, I think we \nneed to make sure that our National Counterterrorism Center and \nNational Counterproliferation Center have more resources, not less. \nHowever, I am concerned about the number of contractors used by the \nintelligence community to perform functions better left to government \nemployees. There are some jobs that demand the use of contractors--for \nexample, certain technical jobs or short-term functions--but too often, \nthe quick fix is just to hire contractors, not long-term support. So, \nour bill includes a provision calling for annual personnel level \nassessments for the intelligence community. These assessments will \nensure that, before more people are brought in, there are adequate \nresources to support them and enough work to keep them busy.\n  Finally, the CIA's interrogation program has been a hot topic over \nthe past few months. This spring, the administration declassified \nseveral Office of Legal Counsel opinions pertaining to the program but \nredacted much of the information concerning its effectiveness. I am \ngenerally opposed to releasing information about some of our most \nsensitive intelligence sources and methods, but in this case, I believe \nthe record needed to be set straight. So I sponsored an amendment, that \nwas accepted by the committee, requiring the Director of the CIA to \nrelease an unclassified summary of several memos that discuss the \neffectiveness of the interrogation program. The American people may \ndecide for themselves whether or not the CIA's program was effective in \npreventing terrorist attacks on our nation and our allies.\n  These are just a few of the provisions in this bill that I believe \nare important for the success of our intelligence collection efforts \nand equally important for ensuring sound oversight by the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I commend Senator Feinstein for her leadership in shepherding this \nbill through the committee and the Senate. I appreciated her \nwillingness to work through the many issues raised throughout this \nprocess.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill so that we can get back on \ntrack with performing effective intelligence oversight.\n\n\n               Clarifying Responsibilities of Committees\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, section 432 of S. 1494, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2010 that is before the \nSenate today, provides that the Directors of the National Security \nAgency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National \nReconnaissance Office shall be appointed by the President with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. For several years, the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence has been seeking the enactment of legislation \nto provide for Senate confirmation of these important positions. The \nSenate has previously endorsed this effort by including this \nrequirement in the proposed Intelligence Authorization for Fiscal Year \n2008.\n  It is our strong hope that the time has come to enact this \nfundamental measure to ensure adequate oversight of these three \nagencies whose spending constitutes a significant portion of the entire \nintelligence budget. In preparation for that, my colleague at the \nIntelligence Committee, our vice chairman Kit Bond, and I have worked \nwith the leadership of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Carl \nLevin and Ranking Member John McCain, to settle on the process by which \nour two committees will assist the Senate in a careful examination of \nthe qualifications of nominees to head these agencies. The insights of \nboth committees is important in that process because the three entities \nare housed in the Department of Defense and perform significant \nresponsibilities there while also being major components of the \nintelligence community.\n  The resolution that we have prepared recognizes the contribution that \neach of our committees should make to a thorough and timely process. It \nprovides that if the nominee is an Active-Duty military officer, the \nconfirmation process will begin in the Armed Services Committee and, if \nreported, the nomination will be sequentially referred to the \nIntelligence Committee for a prescribed period of time; namely, 30 days \nplus an additional 5 days if the 30-day period expires when the Senate \nis in recess. If the nominee is a civilian, the confirmation process \nwill begin in the Intelligence Committee with a sequential referral to \nthe Armed Services Committee under those same time limits. To ensure \nthat the sequential referral does not delay completion of the committee \npart of the nomination process, the resolution provides for the \nautomatic discharge of the nominations from the second committee if it \nhas not reported with the prescribed period of time.\n  This referral system recognizes the equities of each committee and \nwill ensure that the Senate receives the benefit of the recommendations \nmade by the two committees with the expertise necessary to advise the \nSenate about the qualifications of nominees to head these three \nimportant agencies.\n  Although we are not formally introducing the resolution at this time, \nVice Chairman Bond joins me in this public commitment to the Senate \nthat we will ask our committee to report the resolution in time for \nconsideration and adoption by the Senate in conjunction with a \nconference report on the fiscal year 2010 Intelligence authorization.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the resolution, showing \nits cosponsorship by myself, Senator Levin, Senator Bond, and Senator \nMcCain, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See Exhibit 1.]\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I should note for the Senate that while the full text \nof the amendment includes language pertinent to other nominations, such \nas the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, the \nsubstantive change to section 17 of S. Res. 400 only bears on the \nsequence of responsibilities between the Armed Services and \nIntelligence Committees.\n  I now turn to Senator Levin for his remarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to express my support for the proposed \nresolution which I believe will enable both of our committees to \nfulfill their responsibilities for ensuring that the nominations to \nhead these important intelligence elements within the Department of \nDefense are thoroughly considered. I thank my distinguished colleague \non the Armed Services Committee, our ranking member, Senator McCain, \nand our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee for reaching this \nagreement.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     111th CONGRESS\n       1st Session\n\n                               S. Res. __\n\n     Amending Senate Resolution 400 (94th Congress) to clarify the \n     responsibility of committees of the Senate in the provision \n     of the advice and consent of the Senate to nominations to \n     positions in the intelligence community.\n                               __________\n                               \n    IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n   Mrs. Feinstein (for herself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bond, and Mr. McCain) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \n                             on __________\n\n                               __________\n                               \n\n                               RESOLUTION\n\n     Amending Senate Resolution 400 (94th Congress) to clarify the \n     responsibility of committees of the Senate in the provision \n     of the advice and consent of the Senate to nominations to \n     positions in the intelligence community.\n       Resolved, That section 17 of Senate Resolution 400 (94th \n     Congress) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``Sec. 17. (a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (b), the \n     select committee shall have jurisdiction to review, hold \n     hearings, and report the nominations of individuals for \n     positions in the intelligence community for\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\n     which appointments are made by the President, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate.\n       ``(2) Except as provided in subsection (b), a committee \n     with jurisdiction over the department or agency of the \n     Executive Branch within which is a position referred to in \n     paragraph (1) may hold hearings and interviews with \n     individuals nominated for such position, but only the select \n     committee shall report such nomination.\n       ``(3) In this subsection, the term `intelligence community' \n     means an element of the intelligence community specified in \n     or designated under section 3(4) of the National Security Act \n     of 1947.\n       ``(b)(1) With respect to the confirmation of appointment to \n     the position of Assistant Attorney General for National \n     Security, or any successor position, the nomination of any \n     individual by the President to serve in such position shall \n     be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary and, if and \n     when reported, to the select committee for not to exceed 20 \n     calendar days, except that in cases when the 20-day period \n     expires while the Senate is in recess, the select committee \n     shall have 5 additional calendar days after the Senate \n     reconvenes to report the nomination.\n       ``(2)(A) With respect to the confirmation of appointment to \n     the position of Director of the National Geospatial-\n     Intelligence Agency, Director of the National Reconnaissance \n     Office, or Director of the National Security Agency, or any \n     successor position to such position, the nomination of any \n     individual by the President to serve in such position, who at \n     the time of the nomination is a member of the Armed Forces on \n     active duty, shall be referred to the Committee on Armed \n     Services, and, if and when reported, to the select committee \n     for not to exceed 30 calendar days, except that in cases when \n     the 30-day period expires while the Senate is in recess, the \n     select committee shall have 5 additional calendar days after \n     the Senate reconvenes to report the nomination.\n       ``(B) With respect to the confirmation of appointment to \n     the position of Director of the National Geospatial-\n     Intelligence Agency, Director of the National Reconnaissance \n     Office, or Director of the National Security Agency, or any \n     successor to such position, the nomination of any individual \n     by the President to serve in such position, who at the time \n     of the nomination is not a member of the Armed Forces on \n     active duty, shall be referred to the select committee and, \n     if and when reported, to the Committee on Armed Services for \n     not to exceed 30 calendar days, except that in cases when the \n     30-day period expires while the Senate is in recess, the \n     Committee on Armed Services shall have an additional 5 \n     calendar days after the Senate reconvenes to report the \n     nomination.\n       ``(3) If, upon the expiration of the period of sequential \n     referral described in paragraphs (1) and (2), the committee \n     to which the nomination was sequentially referred has not \n     reported the nomination, the nomination shall be \n     automatically discharged from that committee and placed on \n     the Executive Calendar.''.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the amended \nIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010, S.1494. I \nappreciate the commitment of Senator Feinstein, the chair of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, to work with me to strengthen this \nimportant legislation. The bill the Senate has approved recognizes the \nshared jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, in several legislative areas.\n  The first opportunity to review this legislation arose on August 5, \nshortly before the Senate was scheduled to recess, and in the midst of \nthe debate on the confirmation of Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor. At \nthat time, I recognized several provisions in the bill that fall under \nthe jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, as well as issues about \nwhich the committee shares an interest with the Select Committee on \nIntelligence. Since that time, Senator Feinstein and I, as well as our \nstaffs, have engaged in serious negotiations concerning these \nprovisions. We negotiated agreements regarding exemptions to the \nFreedom of Information Act, FOIA, as well as numerous reporting \nrequirements, such as a significant, new requirement for the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, FBI, an agency clearly under the jurisdiction \nof the Judiciary Committee, and an important new cybersecurity \noversight provision.\n  The amendment to the intelligence authorization bill agreed to today \nidentifies the Judiciary Committee as a recipient of relevant reporting \nprovisions, narrows the operational files FOIA exemption for \ninformation provided by intelligence agencies to the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence, ODNI, and strikes a FOIA (b)(3) \nexemption for terrorist identity information. Senator Feinstein has \ntold me she is also committed to ensuring that the Judiciary Committee \nwill receive reports required by the bill's section 340, cybersecurity \noversight. I appreciate Senator Feinstein's support for these \nimprovements.\n  The intelligence authorization bill includes several reporting \nrequirements that involve areas of long-standing interest and \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The amended bill ensures that \nthe Judiciary Committee is a recipient of those reports. Section 336 of \nthe bill directs the Director of National Intelligence to provide a \ncomprehensive report on all measures taken by the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence and by elements of the intelligence \ncommunity to comply with the provisions of applicable law, \ninternational obligations, and executive orders relating to the \ndetention or interrogation activities of the intelligence community. \nThese include compliance with the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005; the \nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006; common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions; the Convention Against Torture; Executive Order 13492, \nrelating to lawful interrogations; and Executive Order No. 13493, \nrelating to detention policy options.\n  The amendment to the intelligence authorization bill modifies section \n336 to ensure that to the extent that the report addresses an element \nof the intelligence community within the Department of Justice, it \nshall be submitted, along with associated material, to the Judiciary \nCommittees of the House and Senate.\n  I fought for years to obtain information about the Bush \nadministration's detention and interrogation policies and practices, \nand the legal advice from that administration authorizing those \npolicies and practices. The last administration refused to give this \ninformation to Congress, instead issuing secret legal advice that \nmisconstrued our laws and international obligations with regard to the \ntreatment of people in our custody. Years later we found out that the \nadministration had sanctioned cruel interrogation techniques, including \ntorture. It is imperative that the Judiciary Committee be fully \ninformed of the extent to which the government is complying with our \nlaws and international treaties relating to detention and interrogation \nin order to be able to conduct proper oversight and ensure that our \ngovernment cannot shield policies that authorize practices in violation \nof our laws. The Judiciary Committee is an important partner in this \noversight.\n  Section 407 of the bill establishes a new office of inspector general \nof the intelligence community to conduct independent investigations, \ninspections, audits and reviews on programs and activities conducted \nunder the authority of the Director of National Intelligence. Under \nthis new authority, the inspector general is required to submit a \nsemiannual report to the Director of National Intelligence summarizing \nits activities. The amendment incorporated into S.1494 modifies the \nreporting provision to require the inspector general to submit reports \nthat focus on Government officials to the committees of the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives with jurisdiction over the department that \nofficial represents.\n  Section 407 of the bill creates an entirely new inspector general \nwith significant authority and responsibility in the intelligence \ncommunity. That authority will implicate agencies within the \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, including the Department of \nJustice and components of the Department of Homeland Security. I \nbelieve this modification to the bill provides an important recognition \nof the Judiciary Committee's need to be involved in the investigations \nand activities of this new inspector general.\n  Another significant new provision is section 445 of the bill, report \nand assessment on transformation of the intelligence capabilities of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, which creates a broad new \nreporting requirement for the FBI. The Judiciary Committee has always \nhad primary oversight over the FBI. As the FBI takes on more \nresponsibility in the areas of intelligence and national security, its \npolicies and practices in these areas must be subject to the oversight \nof Congress. The Intelligence Committees have particular expertise that \nmake them an important partner in this oversight. However, it is the \nJudiciary Committee that has the primary legislative and oversight \nresponsibilities over the FBI.\n  I am very pleased that the amendment adopted today contains several\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\nimportant improvements that I recommended to strengthen FOIA. I am \nparticularly pleased that the bill, as amended, deletes a broad and \nunnecessary exemption to FOIA's disclosure requirements for terrorist \nidentity information.\n  No one would quibble with the notion that our government can--and \nshould--keep some information secret to protect our national security. \nBut, in the case of terrorist identity information, our government has \nsuccessfully withheld this sensitive information under the existing \nFOIA exemptions for classified and law enforcement information. In \naddition, the many instances of mistaken identities and other errors on \nterrorist watchlists and ``no-fly'' lists make it clear that FOIA can \nbe a valuable tool to help innocent Americans redress and correct \nmistakes on these lists.\n  Lastly, the revised bill also narrows the exemption to FOIA's search \nrequirements for operational files information that the Nation's \nintelligence agencies share with the ODNI. The bill now makes it clear \nthat operational files that are already exempt from these search \nrequirements retain this exemption under circumstances where the files \nare disseminated to the ODNI. This carefully crafted compromise will \nhelp ensure both effective information sharing among our intelligence \nagencies and the free flow of information to the American public.\n  I believe the amendment strengthens this legislation by recognizing \nthe value and significance of the shared jurisdiction in many areas of \nnational security between the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. I \nappreciate Senator Feinstein's cooperation in adopting these \nimprovements. In a letter sent to me today, Senator Feinstein has also \ncommitted to continuing to work with the Judiciary Committee in the \narea of cyber matters. I will ask to have her letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  The agreement to proceed with the intelligence authorization bill \ntoday includes a commitment to ensure that the Judiciary Committee \nreceives reports required by the bill's section 340, cybersecurity \noversight. The Judiciary Committee has long engaged in oversight and \nlegislative activity regarding cyber threats and cybersecurity. Senator \nFeinstein and I have worked together in the Judiciary Committee for \nmany years on these issues, and we both recognize the shared \njurisdiction and responsibilities of the Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees with regard to oversight of cyber matters and cybersecurity.\n  As Senator Feinstein has described it, section 340 of the bill is \nintended to provide a preliminary framework for executive and \ncongressional oversight of cybersecurity programs, as defined in the \nsection, to ensure that these programs are consistent with legal \nauthorities, preserve reasonable expectations of privacy, and are \nsubject to independent audit and review. Section 340 of the bill \ncreates several reporting requirements with regard to the executive and \ncongressional oversight of cybersecurity programs. These include \nPresidential notifications to Congress, reports to Congress and the \nPresident from the head of a department or agency with responsibility \nfor cybersecurity programs, in conjunction with the inspector general \nof that department or agency, and a joint report to Congress and the \nPresident from the inspector general of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the inspector general of the intelligence community on the \nstatus of the sharing of cyber threat information within one year. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with Senator Feinstein in the \nJudiciary Committee and in the Senate to ensure strong oversight and \nlegislation with regard to cyber matters.\n  I am pleased the Senate today will pass the amended Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The progress that Senator \nFeinstein and I have made to improve this bill demonstrates the success \nwe can have when we work together constructively.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to which I \nreferred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: As you know, our staffs have been in \n     discussions since the beginning of recess over various \n     provisions of S. 1494, the Intelligence Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2010, ordered reported from the Committee on July \n     22, 2009. Among the provisions at issue is Section 340, \n     Cybersecurity Oversight.\n       Section 340 is intended to provide a preliminary framework \n     for executive and congressional oversight of cybersecurity \n     programs, as defined in the section, to ensure that these \n     programs are consistent with legal authorities, preserve \n     reasonable expectations of privacy, and are subject to \n     independent audit and review.\n       Section 340 contains several reporting requirements. One \n     requires the President to provide certain notifications to \n     Congress. In addition, the head of a department or agency \n     with responsibility for cybersecurity programs, in \n     conjunction with the inspector general of that department or \n     agency, is to submit to Congress and the President periodic \n     reports on the program. Finally, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Homeland Security and the Inspector General of \n     the Intelligence Community are jointly to submit a report to \n     Congress and the President on the status of the sharing of \n     cyber threat information within one year.\n       Under the provision as reported, notifications and reports \n     under the section are to be submitted ``to the Congress.'' \n     Vice Chairman Bond and I have consulted with the Senate \n     parliamentarian to convey our recommendations for how \n     referrals of notifications and reports under the section \n     should be made.\n       As we have discussed before, cybersecurity is a matter of \n     interest to many of the committees of the Senate. Of note is \n     the longstanding interest in, and jurisdiction over, cyber \n     matters by the Judiciary Committee. This includes but is not \n     necessarily limited to the cybersecurity of the Justice \n     Department and other departments and agencies under the \n     Committee's jurisdiction, privacy interests of the American \n     people, and legal dimensions of the government's cyber \n     activities. Given the Judiciary Committee's role in these \n     matters and the expectation that reports under Section 340 \n     will touch on one or more of the Committee's areas of \n     jurisdiction, it is my strong belief that documents provided \n     to the Congress should be provided to the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       In addition, should the Intelligence Committee receive \n     reports under this section that are within the jurisdiction \n     of the Judiciary Committee but that are not provided to the \n     Judiciary Committee, I will ensure that access to those \n     reports is provided to Judiciary Committee members and staff \n     as appropriate.\n       Thank you for your cooperation over this issue, and other \n     provisions of the intelligence legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Feinstein-\nBond amendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to and \nthat the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that the bill as \namended be read a third time, passed, that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements be printed at the \nappropriate place in the Record as if read with the above occurring \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2422) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 1494), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TEMPORARY PERSONNEL AUTHORIZATIONS FOR CRITICAL \n                   LANGUAGE TRAINING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2009, eight years after the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, the intelligence community continues to \n     lack an adequate supply of personnel trained in critical \n     foreign languages.\n       (2) A number of elements of the intelligence community are \n     attempting to address that lack of supply by recruiting \n     applicants who can speak, read, and understand critical \n     foreign languages.\n       (3) Leaders in the intelligence community have recognized \n     that improved recruiting practices are only a partial \n     solution and that improved language training for current \n     intelligence community employees is also necessary.\n       (4) While language education and instruction provides long-\n     term benefits for both intelligence agencies and individual \n     employees, it has short-term costs for supervisors whose \n     staff are absent due to language training and could provide \n     supervisors with an incentive to resist allowing individual \n     employees to pursue language training.\n       (5) If the head of an element of the intelligence community \n     was able to increase the number of personnel at that element \n     during the period that an employee is participating in \n     language training, that element would not have to sacrifice \n     short-term priorities to address language training needs.\n       (6) The Director of National Intelligence is uniquely \n     situated to evaluate language training needs across the \n     intelligence community and assess whether that training would \n     be enhanced if elements of the intelligence community were \n     given temporary additional personnel authorizations.\n       (7) The intelligence community has a difficult time \n     finding, training, and providing security clearances to \n     native foreign language speakers who are able to serve as \n     translators and it would be beneficial if all elements of the \n     intelligence community were able to harness the capabilities \n     of these individuals.\n       (8) The Director of National Intelligence is uniquely \n     situated to identify translators within the intelligence \n     community and provide for their temporary transfer from one \n     element of the intelligence community to another element.\n       (b) Temporary Personnel Authorizations.--\n       (1) Authorized additional ftes.--In addition to the number \n     of full-time equivalent positions authorized for the Office \n     of the Director of National Intelligence for a fiscal year, \n     there is authorized for such Office for each fiscal year an \n     additional 100 full-time equivalent positions that may be \n     utilized only for the purposes described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Purposes.--The Director of National Intelligence may \n     use a full-time equivalent position authorized under \n     paragraph (1) only for the purposes of providing a temporary \n     transfer of personnel made pursuant to the authority in \n     section 102A(e)(2) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n     U.S.C. 403-1(e)(2)) to an element of the intelligence \n     community to enable such element to increase its total \n     authorized number of personnel, on a temporary basis--\n       (A) during a period in which a permanent employee of such \n     element is absent to participate in critical language \n     training; or\n       (B) to accept a permanent employee of another element of \n     the intelligence community to provide language-capable \n     services a temporary basis.\n       (c) Inapplicability of Other Law.--Subparagraph (B) of \n     section 102A(e)(2) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n     U.S.C. 403-1(e)(2)) shall not apply to a transfer of \n     personnel authorizations made under this section.\n       (d) Reporting Requirements.--\n       (1) Report to the director of national intelligence.--An \n     element of the intelligence community that receives a \n     temporary transfer of personnel authorized under subsection \n     (b) shall submit to the Director of National Intelligence a \n     report on such transfer that includes the length of time of \n     the temporary transfer and which critical language need of \n     such element was fulfilled or partially fulfilled by the \n     transfer.\n       (2) Annual report to congress.--The Director of National \n     Intelligence shall submit to the congressional intelligence \n     committees an annual report on this section. Each such report \n     shall include a description of--\n       (A) the number of transfers of personnel made by the \n     Director pursuant to subsection (b), disaggregated by each \n     element of the intelligence community;\n       (B) the critical language that needs were fulfilled or \n     partially fulfilled through the use of such transfers; and\n       (C) the cost to carry out subsection (b).\n\n                     Subtitle B--Education Programs\n\n     SEC. 311.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Accurate, timely, and comprehensive foreign \n     intelligence and information are critical to the national \n     security of United States and the furtherance of the foreign \n     policy goals of the United States.\n       (2) It is in the national security and foreign policy \n     interest of the United States to ensure the global deployment \n     of personnel of the Government of the United States who are \n     responsible for collecting and reporting foreign intelligence \n     and information, including personnel from the intelligence \n     community, the Department of State, and other agencies and \n     departments of the Government of the United States, and that \n     adequate resources are committed to effect such collection \n     and reporting.\n       (3) The 2005 National Intelligence Strategy and the 2006 \n     Annual Report of the United States Intelligence Community \n     identified 5 major missions of the intelligence community to \n     support the national security requirements of the United \n     States, the first 2 of which, defeating terrorism and \n     preventing and countering the spread of weapons of mass \n     destruction, are global and transnational in nature.\n       (4) The third major mission identified by the 2005 National \n     Intelligence Strategy and the 2006 Annual Report, bolstering \n     the growth of democracy and sustaining peaceful democratic \n     states, requires a global commitment of collection, \n     reporting, and analytical capabilities.\n       (5) The 2005 National Intelligence Strategy and the 2006 \n     Annual Report identify as a major mission the need to \n     ``anticipate developments of strategic concern and identify \n     opportunities as well as vulnerabilities for decision \n     makers''.\n       (6) The 2006 Annual Report provides the following:\n       (A) ``In a world in which developments in distant reaches \n     of the globe can quickly affect American citizens and \n     interests at home and abroad, the Intelligence Community must \n     alert policy makers to problems before they escalate and \n     provide insights into their causes and effects. Analysis must \n     do more than just describe what is happening and why; it must \n     identify a range of opportunities for (and likely \n     consequences of) diplomatic, military, law enforcement, \n     economic, financial, or homeland security action. To support \n     policymakers, the Intelligence Community should develop, \n     sustain, and maintain access to expertise on every region, \n     every transnational security issue, and every threat to the \n     American people.''.\n       (B) ``We still need to re-balance, integrate, and optimize \n     collection capabilities to meet current and future customer \n     and analytic priorities. Collection is . . . what gives the \n     [Intelligence Community] its `competitive advantage' in \n     protecting the United States and its interests.''.\n       (C) ``One challenge to improving the coverage of emerging \n     and strategic issues across the Intelligence Community has \n     been the diversion of resources to current crisis support . . \n     .''.\n       (D) ``Collection against terrorists in places like Iraq and \n     Afghanistan took a substantial share of the [Intelligence \n     Community's] resources and efforts in FY 2006.''.\n       (E) ``With so many [Intelligence Community] resources \n     dedicated to the War on Terror and WMD programs in closed \n     regimes, the [Intelligence] Community's collection efforts \n     still have to devote significant attention to potential or \n     emerging threats of strategic consequence.''.\n       (7) On January 23, 2007, the Deputy Director of National \n     Intelligence for Collection testified to the Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the Senate that there is a ``need to get \n     the Intelligence Community back to what I grew up calling \n     global reach'', stating that ``we don't have that today''. \n     She further testified that ``our challenge is . . . with \n     [Congress] help [to get back] to a place where we can do \n     global reach, and pay attention to places that we are not.''.\n       (8) On February 14, 2008, the Director of National \n     Intelligence testified to the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate that ``certainly current crisis \n     support takes a disproportionate share'' of intelligence \n     resources over emerging and strategic issues.\n       (9) In responses to questions posed by the Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the Senate in advance of the February 5, \n     2009 hearing on the nomination of Leon Panetta to be Director \n     of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Panetta stated that \n     ``I am also concerned that we have not devoted sufficient \n     resources to a broader set of national intelligence \n     challenges - such as Russia, China, the global economic \n     downturn, as well as unstable and weak governments in places \n     such as Africa and Latin America.''.\n       (10) On February 12, 2009, the Director of National \n     Intelligence testified to the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate that ``I'd say the most \n     significant gaps are the areas that are not traditional state \n     threats, that we have not figured out the right way to \n     collect information and we have not grown the analysts to do \n     it. . .. We're not as good with non-state actors.''.\n       (11) On March 26, 2009, the Director of National \n     Intelligence stated that ``We re-evaluate that National \n     Intelligence Priority Framework formally ever six months and \n     informally, as we have. And its quite remarkable, if you - \n     you know those time-lapse pictures where things change? If \n     you showed a time-lapse picture of that National Intelligence \n     Priority Framework, you'd see, sort of, colors shifting over \n     time as things came up, in terms of their threat or in terms \n     of an opportunity that they - so I just, I think it's a \n     mistake to tie us down to, this is my important priority. \n     There are enduring things we have to spend a lot of time on \n     because you can't instantly generate intelligence about a \n     country that's very good at keeping its secrets that you know \n     is going to be a factor for a long time. And we have to work \n     on those - we have to work on those every time. We have to \n     keep an excellent baseline understanding of what's going on \n     in the world, but then we need to be able to flex.''.\n       (12) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States (hereinafter referred to as the ``9/11 \n     Commission'') reported that ``To find sanctuary, terrorist \n     organizations have fled to some of the least governed, most \n     lawless places in the world. The intelligence community has \n     prepared a world map that highlights possible terrorist \n     havens, using no secret intelligence - just indicating areas \n     that combine rugged terrain, weak governance, room to hide or \n     receive supplies, and low population density with a town or \n     city near enough to allow necessary interaction with the \n     outside world. Large areas scattered around the world meet \n     these criteria.''.\n       (13) The 9/11 Commission recommended that the ``U.S. \n     government must identify and prioritize actual or potential \n     terrorist sanctuaries. For each, it should have a realistic \n     strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run, \n     using all elements of national power. We should reach out, \n     listen to,\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\n     and work with other countries that can help.''.\n       (14) On May 6, 2008, the Acting Director of the National \n     Counterterrorism Center testified to the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate that ``I wish I had more resources \n     to dedicate to longer-term threats, absolutely,'' that ``much \n     of the information about the instability that can lead to \n     safe havens or ideological radicalization comes not from \n     covert collection but from open collection, best done by \n     Foreign Service officers,'' and that there should be ways to \n     direct resources toward whoever is best positioned to learn \n     about safe-haven conditions.\n       (15) On November 1, 2005, the Director of National \n     Intelligence Open Source Center was established with \n     functions that ``include collection, analysis and research, \n     training, and information technology management to facilitate \n     government-wide access and use'' of openly available \n     information.\n       (16) The Strategic Plan of the Department of State provides \n     as a strategic goal that ``Our diplomatic and development \n     activities will reduce the threat or impact of violent \n     conflict by developing early warning . . . capability.''.\n       (17) On January 22, 2009, James Steinberg, a nominee to be \n     Deputy Secretary of State, testified to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate that ``if we're going to be \n     effective in this move towards smart power, then we have to \n     understand how we reprioritize our resources to be able to \n     achieve that. . . If we only think about the crisis of the \n     moment, then we're not prepared as new challenges emerge. And \n     we've seen this time and time again, that issues that were \n     not immediately on the radar screen don't get the attention \n     they deserve. . .. So the idea of looking forward and trying \n     to figure out over the long term where our priorities need to \n     be, how do we anticipate some of these challenges, and then \n     judge how we have sort of assigned resources to take care of \n     not only those current needs but also those long-term \n     challenges I think has to be very important and part of a \n     strategic planning strategy. . . although we have a very \n     strong intelligence community, that there is a tremendous \n     resource of people who've lived and worked out in the \n     countries that we're dealing with and that, for a variety of \n     reasons, the intelligence community is not always the best \n     equipped to do that. They bring their own special skills. But \n     the Foreign Service officers, and also people from outside \n     the government, are enormous sources of information and \n     value. And we need to find better ways, in my judgment, to \n     have more contact with people in the private sector, from the \n     NGOs, from the business community, from universities and the \n     like, as part of our being able to touch and feel what's \n     going on the ground.''.\n       (18) On January 22, 2009, Jacob Lew, a nominee to be Deputy \n     Secretary of State, testified to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate that ``I believe strongly that \n     resources have to follow priorities. The decision of where we \n     need to be and what kinds of skills we need have to fit into \n     a comprehensive strategy. . .. We need to work with our other \n     Cabinet agency partners. There are 20 government agencies \n     that have resources that work in or through our embassies. We \n     don't need to recreate the wheel; we need to cooperate with \n     each other and make sure that we have enough Foreign Service, \n     civil service and locally engaged staff so that we can \n     effectively coordinate the efforts that the United States \n     puts on the ground. I think that it all begins with the \n     strategic planning process. If we don't have a clear vision \n     of what we need and what we want, were not going to be able \n     to make the right resource allocation decisions. And we have \n     to be able to look beyond this week, next week, or even next \n     year. . .. We need to reach not just into the building but \n     all the way into the field and make it clear that we have \n     every intention of bringing the resources of the State \n     Department to bear as we deal with these kinds of problems \n     and challenges abroad, that we have knowledge in our \n     embassies, in our consulates, about a range of issues, not \n     just political issues -- economic issues, scientific issues, \n     cultural issues -- that give us the broadest understanding of \n     what's going on in an increasingly global world.''.\n       (19) The Legal Attache offices and sub-offices of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation are currently located in 75 \n     cities around the world, providing coverage for more than 200 \n     countries, territories, and islands.\n       (20) On October 4, 2007, Thomas V. Fuentes, Assistant \n     Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for Office of \n     International Operations, testified to the Subcommittee on \n     Border, Maritime, and Global Counterterrorism of the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives that the ``core mission'' of the Legal \n     Attache offices ``is to establish and maintain liaison with \n     principal law enforcement and security services in designated \n     foreign countries. . . enabl[ing] the FBI to effectively and \n     expeditiously conduct its responsibilities in combating \n     international terrorism, organized crime, cyber crime, and \n     general criminal matters,'' and that while ``they do not \n     conduct foreign intelligence gathering,'' ``typical duties'' \n     include . . . ``conducting investigations in coordination \n     with the host government; sharing investigative leads and \n     information; briefing Embassy counterparts from other \n     agencies, including law enforcement agencies, as appropriate, \n     and Ambassadors. . . providing situation reports concerning \n     cultural protocol; [and] assessing political and security \n     climates.''.\n       (21) The July 2008 Preliminary Findings by the Project on \n     National Security Reform, entitled ``Enduring Security in an \n     Unpredictable World: the Urgent Need for National Security \n     Reform,'' included the following:\n       (A) The lack of a national security strategy that clearly \n     links ends, ways, and means and assigned roles and \n     responsibilities to each department has encouraged a \n     proliferation of department-level strategies. These \n     department strategies are uncoordinated and do not \n     systematically generate capabilities required for national \n     objectives\n       (B) The resource allocation process is not driven by any \n     overall national plan or strategy for achieving broad \n     objectives, and the results or effectiveness of the budgeting \n     process cannot be measured against such objectives.\n       (C) The national security system tends to overemphasize \n     traditional security threats and under emphasize emerging \n     challenges.\n\n     SEC. 604.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. 1677, introduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1677) to reauthorize the Defense Production Act \n     of 1950, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise at a moment when our Nation is \nenduring its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. This \ncrisis began in the financial sector, but it has impacted every sector \nof our economy. And perhaps one of the hardest-hit has been our \nmanufacturing sector, which was already reeling even before this \ncrisis.\n  Over the last decade, we have lost an average of 40,000 manufacturing \njobs per month. In Connecticut, we lost nearly 16,000 manufacturing \njobs in the last year alone more than 8 percent of our manufacturing \nsector, gone.\n  These figures represent the loss of American livelihoods, the \neconomic security of thousands of families.\n  And they represent a clear and present threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  We rely on key domestic industries to supply critical goods and \nservices in a timely fashion when our nation faces an emergency. In \nwartime and in the aftermath of natural disasters, factories in my \nstate of Connecticut and around the country are relied upon for \neverything from raw metal to military vehicles and power generators. \nThese products are essential to supporting our war efforts, maintaining \ncritical infrastructure, and protecting our homeland.\n  Connecticut, although it is 29th in total population, ranks 6th in \ntotal employment in the military and aerospace sector. Tens of \nthousands of residents of my State work in this industry.\n  When this industrial base is threatened, our military and emergency \npreparedness suffer.\n  Six decades ago, President Harry Truman sought to bolster this \ncritical bulwark of security by signing the Defense Production Act, or \nDPA, into law. The DPA allows the government to tap industrial \nresources to meet domestic energy supply, address emergency \npreparedness, protect infrastructure, and help civilian agencies and \nthe military respond to crisis situations.\n  In the 1950s, the DPA served to address our new national security \nrealities in the wake of the Cold War. In the ensuing decades, \nbeginning with the Korean War, the DPA kept production lines humming, \nmilitary supply lines fully stocked, and our country prepared in case \nof emergency.\n  Congress has reauthorized this Act every few years, but has only \nsporadically sought to update its provisions to meet changing \nconditions. And thus, according to independent analyses, Federal \nagencies' understanding and use of the tools provided by this act have \nbecome inconsistent.\n  Thus, we have proposed bipartisan legislation to make critical \nreforms to our national defense industrial policy. The Dodd-Shelby bill \nreflects the contributions of DPA practitioners from a variety of \nagencies, particularly the Departments of Defense and Homeland \nSecurity. And I would like to express my appreciation for the work of \ntwo civil servants who worked especially hard to help us develop this \nlegislation: Larry Hall, DPA Director at FEMA, and Mark Buffler, DPA \ntitle III Program Manager at DOD.\n  The bill responds to the analysis of two landmark studies completed \nlast year, as required by my amendments to the 9/11 Commission \nRecommendations Act and the fiscal year 2008 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, which directed DHS and the GAO to report to Congress \non how the DPA is being used.\n  In its report, DHS conceded that several agencies authorized to use \nDPA tools don't take advantage of them. And the GAO report echoed those \nfindings, recommending greater coordination and pro-active use of key \nDPA authorities.\n  For instance, under title I of the DPA, the President is empowered to \nrequire companies to set aside their commercial business obligations \nand fulfill government contracts first in order to meet national \ndefense needs. However, although a wide range of Departments and \nagencies are directed to use this authority, only Defense, Homeland \nSecurity, and Energy are doing so. The Pentagon has used it to require \ncompanies to set aside other work until production of mine-resistant \nambush protected vehicles was complete. FEMA, in coordination with \nCommerce, has used it to expedite the delivery of power generators and \ntransfer switches needed to restore railroad operations in New Orleans \nafter Katrina. But other agencies that could, and should, be taking \nadvantage of title I, aren't.\n  Moreover, the GAO found that, unlike DOD, FEMA doesn't even prepare \ntitle I contingency plans, which means that it takes longer for DPA \nprovisions to be implemented even after they are enacted.\n  Therefore, our bill, at the GAO's recommendation, requires that every \nauthorized agency establish a priorities and allocation system similar \nto that in place at the Pentagon and to coordinate with other agencies \nin its implementation.\n  It also sets up a new interagency body that will elevate DPA policy \ndiscussions to Cabinet-level posts, so that administrations going \nforward will be able to reassess the law's provisions and applications, \nand never lose sight of the importance of coordinating with critical \nsegments of our industry to meet national defense needs. The President \nwill designate a chairperson to lead this committee, which will be \ncomposed of Cabinet officials and agency heads authorized to use DPA \ntools, as well as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. And \nthe President will also appoint a Deputy Assistant Secretary to \ncoordinate high-level dialogue among relevant government agencies.\n  This elevated discussion will prove particularly essential in the \nimplementation of title III of the DPA, which allows the President to \nprovide financial incentives including direct capital purchases, loans, \nand loan guarantees--for U.S. firms to expand domestic production of \ncritical industries. These authorities are critically important--and \nunderused.\n  Title III is used when the U.S. is overly reliant on foreign sources \nfor a critical product, or when there is otherwise insufficient \ndomestic supply of the product. Unlike other Federal assistance, title \nIII is managed by industry experts. And it is designed to assist \ncompanies capable of meeting specific requirements: that the firms \ncan't meet government needs on their own, and that the assistance will \nlead to commercial viability in the long term.\n  Today, we have strong evidence that defense companies all along the \nsupply chain--particularly in the third and fourth subcontractor tier--\nare being denied access to credit. Machine tool and parts manufacturers \nin defense and dual-use industries are having a hard time getting \ncapital--not because demand is down, but because bank lending is down. \nGovernment loan and loan\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\nguarantee authorities in title III would help--but, the government \nisn't using those tools.\n  Therefore, our bill modernizes those powers and brings them into \ncompliance with the 1990 Federal Credit Reform Act. Accordingly, under \nour bill, such loans and loan guarantees are allowed only to the extent \nthat an appropriations act provides budget authority in advance.\n  As frozen credit markets continue to hurt our industrial base, it is \ncritical that we revitalize our factories. According to the Department \nof Commerce, manufacturing now makes up 13 percent of the U.S. economy \na quarter of what it was three decades ago. And foreign-made products \nhave risen from a tenth to a third of what we consume over that same \ntime. We are at risk of becoming overly dependent on foreign sources of \ncritical goods, materials, and technology and losing our manufacturing \nfacilities and workforce.\n  A non-partisan think tank, the Lexington Institute, recently wrote:\n\n       If the erosion of U.S. manufacturing persists, America will \n     become more dependent on offshore sources of goods and the \n     nation's trade balance will weaken. That will undercut the \n     role of the dollar as a reserve currency and diminish U.S. \n     influence around the world. The economy will be less capable \n     of supporting major military campaigns and less resilient in \n     the face of market reverses. Most profoundly, America will \n     become poorer relative to other nations, a trend that the \n     National Intelligence Council says is already under way in \n     its most recent assessment of global trends.\n\n  This bill isn't a silver bullet to address all of these problems. But \nit's an important first step towards making more effective one of our \nbest tools to strengthen our manufacturing base. Our bill also makes \nthese efforts more transparent, requiring notification to Congress and \na 30-day waiting period for larger projects. As we look to expand DPA \nuse, we are also working to make it more accountable to taxpayers.\n  As the GAO reported:\n\n       Since the DPA was last reauthorized in 2003, there has been \n     little use of its authorities for areas other than defense. \n     Lessons learned from catastrophic events have emphasized the \n     importance of ensuring that needed capabilities and contracts \n     for key items are in place in advance of a disaster.\n\n  Congress didn't intend for such inertia. And now, more than ever, we \nneed dynamic government action to reinvigorate our manufacturing base. \nIt is time for the executive branch to take heed of the warning signs, \nrepair the vulnerabilities in our industries, and restore our \nmanufacturing capacities in the name of our national and economic \nsecurity.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before concluding our discussion about the \n2009 Defense Production Act Reauthorization, I would like to pay \ntribute to two of my colleagues who have worked diligently on this \nlegislation. First, my friend and ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Shelby. Nobody understands the complexities of \nnational security policy and its nexus with economic affairs better \nthan the senior Senator from Alabama. Given the importance of \nreauthorizing and updating the law prior to its expiration on September \n30, I appreciated his good counsel and sincere effort to expedite \napproval of this important legislation today. I would also like to \nthank Senator Brown for his work, particularly as chairman of the \nEconomic Policy Subcommittee. The Senator from Ohio has proven to be \nboth an expert on U.S. manufacturing and a skillful surveyor of how the \ncurrent credit crisis is affecting America's national defense \nindustrial base.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. At a hearing of the Economic Policy Subcommittee on \nMay 13, witnesses discussed the challenges tight credit markets pose \nfor small and medium-sized manufacturers, as well as the economic, \nstrategic, and security implications of a weakened manufacturing \nsector.\n  Among our witnesses were the president of the United Steelworkers, \nand a managing director of the Carlyle Group. It is not every day \nCongress sees representatives from these two institutions, but when it \ncomes to the importance of manufacturing to this nation, the United \nSteelworkers and the Carlyle Group are on the same page.\n  The reason is simple. Manufacturing accounts for $1.6 trillion of \nU.S. GDP--12 percent--and accounts for nearly three-fourths of the \nNation's industrial research and development. Manufacturing jobs also \npay 20 percent more on average than service jobs. Each manufacturing \njob supports four to five other jobs throughout the U.S. economy.\n  In short, manufacturing matters a great deal to our Nation's \nstrength.\n  One important finding that emerged during this hearing is that \nreauthorization and expansion of the Defense Production Act of 1950 may \nprovide the U.S. Government with valuable tools for maintaining \ncritical supply lines, which would be particularly useful at a time \nwhen U.S. manufacturers are experiencing declining access to credit.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I could not agree more. And I appreciated \nthe leadership that Senator Brown demonstrated in highlighting these \nimportant facts during his hearing. In fact, I expressed a similar \nsentiment in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano \nin February, which I will ask to be made part of the Record.\n  With this legislation in place, not only do we expect the current and \nfuture administrations to apply these newly updated authorities when \nappropriate, but I hope that they will take care to use them in a \ncreative and appropriate manner in response to ongoing problems that \nthreaten the long-term health of our industrial base--namely the credit \ncrisis' impact on U.S. manufacturing.\n  My colleague from Ohio has played a key role in raising awareness of \nthese important matters and ensuring that the current administration \nwork with Congress to address our concerns. In particular, I \nappreciated his ongoing contact with the administration regarding his \nsubcommittee's findings.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the key to America's long-term security and \nprosperity is a healthy and viable domestic manufacturing base. I am \nhopeful that the administration will use the tools set in place by this \nlegislation to achieve these ends. It is for this reason that Senator \nDodd, Senator Merkley, Senator Warner and I sent a letter--which I will \nask to be printed in the Record--to the Office of Management and Budget \nurging the administration to provide their recommendations on changes \nto the Defense Production Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the two letters which \nwere referred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 4, 2009.\n     Hon. Janet Napolitano,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Secretary Napolitano: I am writing to inquire about \n     government efforts underway to address a potentially serious \n     consequence of the global economic and financial crisis. \n     Because manufacturers' access to credit is becoming \n     increasingly limited, I am concerned about the ability of key \n     sectors of our industrial base to meet emergency response and \n     defense needs of the federal government.\n       I understand that the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     is leading an interagency process to review and reform \n     current authorities afforded by the Defense Production Act \n     (50 U.S.C. App. 2061, et seq.) and Executive Order 12919. I \n     hope such an effort will help address our nation's industrial \n     readiness to maintain our critical infrastructure and \n     emergency preparedness.\n       I would like to know the current status of this initiative, \n     which should be completed with all due care and speed. With \n     the Bureau of Economic Analysis reporting a 27.8 percent \n     decline in investment in equipment and software for the last \n     quarter, some analysts are indicating that federal assistance \n     to banks may not be thawing credit markets adequately to \n     maintain U.S. manufacturing capabilities. According to the \n     Federal Reserve Board, manufacturing output fell 2.3 percent \n     in December to a level almost 10 percent below that of 12 \n     months earlier. For the fourth quarter of last year, \n     manufacturing output contracted at an annual rate of more \n     than 16 percent. In December, the factory operating rate \n     moved down 1.7 percentage points, to 70.2 percent, a level \n     9.5 percentage points below its 1972 to 2007 average. The \n     production of durable goods declined 2.6 percent in December. \n     Output fell in virtually every major category of durable \n     goods except for aerospace equipment and miscellaneous \n     transportation equipment.\n       As the Banking Committee begins to consider legislation to \n     re-authorize the Defense Production Act (DPA), I would \n     appreciate your insights into how the authorities of the DPA \n     may be used to reverse these trends and help maintain viable \n     production capabilities for items essential for our national \n     defense as defined by Section 702 of the DPA. Of special \n     interest is how Title I of this Act may be\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\n     better used to ensure adequate government access to critical \n     goods during emergencies and, under Title III how \n     provisions--including possible direct loan guarantees--might \n     be used by key industries needing access to credit. I believe \n     your Department's April 25, 2008, report ``Use of the Defense \n     Production Act to Reduce Interruptions in Critical \n     Infrastructure and Key Resource Operations During \n     Emergencies'' will prove useful in revisiting key DPA \n     authorities.\n       Please report to me on your progress in reviewing these \n     authorities at your earliest convenience. I would appreciate \n     interim reports or proposals being made available to Senate \n     Banking Committee staff prior to the Administration's final \n     submission of DPA legislation. Thank you for your attention \n     to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 1, 2009.\n     Mr. Peter Orszag,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Orszag: We are writing to request your prompt \n     recommendations to Congress on key legislative proposals \n     currently under your office's review. This letter comes as a \n     follow-up to a hearing of the Subcommittee on Economic Policy \n     held May 13 entitled, ``Manufacturing and the Credit \n     Crisis.''\n       Witnesses discussed the challenges tight credit markets \n     pose for small and medium-sized manufacturers, as well as the \n     economic, strategic, and security implications of a weakened \n     manufacturing sector. Absent some mechanism for providing or \n     spurring access to credit, witnesses testified, key \n     government functions--ranging from defense to critical \n     infrastructure operations--could be impaired.\n       One important finding that emerged during this hearing is \n     that reauthorization and expansion of the Defense Production \n     Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq) may provide the \n     United States government valuable tools for maintaining \n     critical supply lines, particularly at a time when U.S. \n     manufacturers are experiencing declining access to credit.\n       Over the past five decades, the DPA has been amended beyond \n     its original focus on military requirements, to expand \n     industrial resources to meet energy supply, emergency \n     preparedness, and critical infrastructure protection needs, \n     thereby allowing civilian agencies to rapidly respond to \n     crises such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks. \n     Titles I, III, and VII of the Act remain in effect, which \n     include authorities to require preferential performance on \n     government contracts, to fund expanded production \n     capabilities for critical security needs, and to collect \n     information on the domestic industrial base.\n       At the May 13 hearing, witnesses recommended the following:\n       Revitalizing the Interagency Task Force that administers \n     the DPA, with a chairman designated by the President.\n       Increasing the level of funding available for DPA at the \n     Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and \n     Department of Defense.\n       Resuming the loan guarantee authorities under Title III of \n     the DPA, in accordance with OMB guidance.\n       It is our understanding that OMB is reviewing interagency \n     proposals. A thorough review of the DPA, and consideration of \n     reforms, will require additional hearings. Given the urgency \n     of manufacturers' challenges, the impending expiration of DPA \n     authorities on September 30, and the impending Fiscal Year \n     2010 appropriations process, we urge you to promptly review \n     the DPA and forward your recommendations to Congress.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sherrod Brown,\n       Chairman, Economic Policy Subcommittee.\n     Christopher J. Dodd,\n       Chairman, Banking, House, & Urban Affairs.\n     Jeff Merkley,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Mark Warner,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CASEY.
