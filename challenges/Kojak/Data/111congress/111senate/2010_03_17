Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nbefore us and the motion to waive the point of order.\n  This is a good day for American workers, for Congress is focusing on \nwhat they have asked us to focus on. Congress is focusing on what the \nAmerican people want us to focus on, which is jobs, jobs, jobs, and \nCongress will act in a bipartisan way. So this is a break, in several \nways, from the past. One, we are focusing on jobs and the economy. That \nis what we should be doing. Second, we are doing it in a bipartisan \nway.\n  The bill before us focuses on private sector jobs. It has four \npieces. Each is lean. Each is directed at private sector jobs. Each \nwill give the economy a certain lift. Last quarter, we had growth of \n5.9 percent. That sounds great, but that 5.9 percent growth resulted in \nno new jobs being created. In fact, it resulted in a continued loss of \njobs, admittedly less of a loss than in the past.\n  Our job is to take that growth and translate it into jobs for the \nAmerican people, plain and simple, and that is what we are doing with \nthis HIRE Act. At the center of it is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation: a payroll tax holiday for 1 year for any new worker hired \nwho has been unemployed for 60 days, authored by the Senator from Utah, \nMr. Hatch, and myself. It is the bipartisan glue which hopefully will \nstick with us as we move forward on our jobs agenda because this is \njust the first--certainly not the last--piece of legislation we will \nput forward in relation to jobs. If we don't create jobs, the economy \nwill not move forward. If we don't create jobs, the American people, \nAmerican business, and American labor could lose the optimism that has \nbeen part of this country since its founding. When you lose that \noptimism, you lose dollars and cents economically because businesses \ndon't spend, workers don't prepare for the future, people get \ndisconsolate.\n  So this legislation is admittedly modest and focused and will go far \nbeyond what the specific legislation does because it will show the \nAmerican people, it will show American business, large and small, it \nwill show American workers Congress is focused on what they want us to \nfocus on and that we will continue to work on our jobs agenda until \njobs start growing, until people are being paid decent wages, until the \neconomy roars back on a long and stable trajectory, which can only be \ndone if employment goes up and underemployment goes down.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this isn't so much a jobs bill as it is a \ndebt bill. It has debt, debt, and debt.\n  I voted against the budget which passed the House of Representatives. \nI voted against it because it had $1 trillion worth of deficit every \nyear for as far as the eye can see. It basically put our country on a \npath of unsustainability, where the national debt will double in 5 \nyears and triple in 10 years; where every one of these young men and \nwomen sitting before us who are pages, by the time they graduate from \ncollege, will have $133,000 in Federal debt on their heads they will \nhave to pay off as they go to work. I voted against it because it was \nprofligate, because it wasn't disciplined, and because it was \nexcessive.\n  However, it appears it wasn't excessive enough for my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. This will be the third week in a row the \nleadership of the Democratic Party in this body has brought a bill to \nthis floor that violates their own budget and spends more than their \nown budget called for. A budget which this year will run $1.6 trillion \nof deficit isn't running a big enough deficit, according to the other \nside of the aisle. They have to run up the deficit with this bill by \nanother $3 billion of authorized money, above their own budget. That is \non top of last week, when they spent $30 billion this year and $100 \nbillion over 5 years in excess of their own budget.\n  When is it going to stop? When is it going to stop? When are we going \nto stop spending money around here as if there is no tomorrow? Because \npretty soon there will be no tomorrow for our children as we add this \ndebt to their backs and make it impossible for them to have the \nstandard of living we have had.\n  Yesterday, Moody's said that although today the AAA rating of this \ncountry is not at risk, it may be down the road if we continue to spend \nmoney we don't have at the rate we are spending it. That is not a sign \nof optimism for the future; that is a sign our Nation is in trouble, \nand it is in trouble because of us.\n  There is a lot of talk around here about what is the systemic risk to \nthis economy. The systemic risk is this Congress, which continues to \nspend money it doesn't have, send the bill on to our kids at a rate \nthey can't afford to pay off. As a result, their lifestyle will \nactually have to be reduced, their quality of life, their standard of \nliving will go down because they will be paying for all this debt we \nare putting on their backs today.\n  What is even worse is this Congress isn't even willing to live by the \nPROFLIGATE--and I hope capital letters will be put in the Record on \nthat because it should be all spelled out in capital letters--by the \nPROFLIGATE budget which passed the House, which projected trillions of \ndollars of deficits for as far as the eye could see and doubled the \ndebt in 5 years and tripled it in 10 years. That wasn't enough. No. We \nhave to come to the floor again this week, after last week, after the \nweek before, with another bill that breaks their own budget.\n  So all I am asking for is that the other side of the aisle be willing \nto at least live by its own budget. Last week I asked that they be \nwilling to live by their own pay-go rules. That didn't pass, and $100 \nbillion was spent that wasn't paid for. So this week I am making a \npoint of order that simply says: Live by your own budget. You passed a \nbudget; at least live by that. Can't you live within a $1.6 trillion \ndeficit? Do you have to add another $3 trillion of authorized dollars \nto this deficit this year? Gosh, I hope not. So I am making a point of \norder and asking that we live by the budget that was passed by the \nDemocratic Congress.\n  The pending amendment would cause the aggregate levels of the budget \nauthority and the outlays for the fiscal year 2010, as set out in the \nmost recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget, S. Con. \nRes. 13, to be exceeded--the Democratic budget, by the way. Therefore, \nI raise a point of order under section 311(a)2 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will support the motion to waive the \npoint of order. I believe I have 1 minute left.\n  The world is topsy-turvy. My Republican colleagues are opposing a tax \ncut to businesses, large and small, that hire people. This is exactly \nwhat we should do. We don't want to be saying to workers we can't help \nthem find a job. There are shades of Herbert Hoover in what my \ncolleague is saying, and I don't think many of my colleagues on either \nside of the aisle would support that.\n  Let me say this about the budget point of order. The Joint Tax \nCommittee, which we all respect, says these provisions are budget \nneutral.\n  We have found a way to hire workers, help businesses with tax cuts to \nhire them, and keep it budget neutral. Yet there is still opposition. \nWhen will it end? When will the bipartisan kind of feeling in this body \nreturn? This is a bipartisan measure that lives by many of the tenets \nthe party on the other side has stood for, for decades.\n  Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable \nbudget resolutions, and section (4)(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-\nGo Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts \nand applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the pending \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Parliamentary inquiry. I have made a motion that says the\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\nbudget point of order stands under section 311, which point of order \nspecifically lies because of the fact that the bill before us spends \nmore in authority and outlay than the Budget Act passed by this \nCongress allows. Is that not correct? Is that motion not well taken?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair understands that the \npoint of order would be well taken.\n  Mr. GREGG. Which means that, Mr. President, more money is being spent \nthan is allowed to be spent under our budget rules; is that not \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have been in the Senate for quite a \nwhile. I have seen a lot, but I have never seen anything like the plan \nHouse Democrats hatched this week to jam their health care bill through \nCongress and over the objections of the American people.\n  Americans woke up yesterday thinking they had seen everything in this \ndebate already. Then they heard the latest. They heard that Democrats \nwant to approve the Senate version of the health care bill without \nactually standing up and taking a vote on it. Let me say that again. \nThey heard that Democrats over in the House want to approve the Senate \nbill without actually voting on it. These Democrats want to approve a \nbill that rewrites one-sixth of the economy, forces taxpayers to pay \nfor abortions, raises taxes in the middle of a recession, and slashes \nMedicare for seniors, without leaving their fingerprints on it. In \nother words, they want to get around the very purpose of a rollcall \nvote. They want to hide what they are doing from the American people \nwhom they seem to view as an obstacle. They want to hide what they are \ndoing from the American people whom they see as an obstacle to what \nthey are trying to do.\n  Well, it won't work. They realized that yesterday when they saw the \npublic reaction to their plan. Americans are more outraged than ever. \nAmericans are shocked at these tactics. They are fed up, and they have \nhad enough. The longer Democratic leaders ignore this outrage and \nignore these questions, the worse it is going to get.\n  Democrats have lost their perspective in this debate. They have lost \ntheir way. They do not even seem to care what the public thinks. \nSpeaker Pelosi said yesterday that they will do ``whatever it takes'' \nto ensure this bill becomes law. While she is at it, she is throwing \nother legislation into the bill that does not have anything to do with \nhealth care--major legislation that would enable the government to take \nover the student loan industry without any debate whatsoever. That has \nbeen their strategy all along. Anytime one of their proposals meets \nresistance, they look for a way to get around it. But the schemes they \nhave used end up making their proposals even more repellant than they \noriginally were. And this latest scheme is the most outrageous one yet.\n  What has happened is they are trapped in a vicious cycle that someone \nover there needs to bring to a halt. This is now a fight between \nDemocrats and their own constituents, and the only way to stop this \nmadness is for a few courageous Democrats to step forward and put a \nstop to it.\n  Historians will remember this as a new low in this debate: the week \nAmerica was introduced to the scheme-and-deem approach to legislating--\nthe scheme-and-deem approach to legislating. They will remember this as \nthe week Congress tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the public in \norder to get around their will. And they will remember the men and \nwomen who stand up and put an end to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this vote, the yeas are 63, the \nnays are 34. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate has an opportunity today to take \nanother step toward restoring job growth and opportunity for American \nworkers. Others have discussed the importance of this bill's provisions \nto help put Americans back to work, and I agree: This bill marks \nimportant progress in lowering unacceptable levels of unemployment.\n  But sending the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act to the \nPresident's desk would also mark a significant victory for law-abiding \nU.S. taxpayers. Right now, thousands of U.S. tax dodgers conceal \nbillions of dollars in assets within secrecy-shrouded foreign banks, \ndodging taxes and penalizing those of us who pay the taxes we owe. The \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has estimated \nthat these tax-dodging schemes cost the Federal Treasury $100 billion a \nyear.\n  But under this legislation, for the first time, foreign banks will be \nrequired to disclose their U.S. account holders to the U.S. Government \nor face significant penalties. This provision will make it far more \ndifficult for tax dodgers to conceal assets and income in foreign \nbanks. As more banks set up systems to disclose U.S. account holders, \nbank secrecy will become increasingly difficult to maintain. With \nincreased transparency will come less tax evasion, less money \nlaundering, and less crime.\n  Certainly this legislation will not end tax avoidance or money \nlaundering. Its provisions do not take effect for several years, and \nits impact will depend in large part on the willingness of regulators \nat the Treasury Department and elsewhere to write strict regulations \nand enforce them vigorously. It also will not affect banks willing to \ncontinue to conceal their U.S. account holders despite the penalties \nthat carries a significant loophole for tax dodgers and the foreign \nbanks that assist them. So this legislation is not a silver bullet. In \nfact, I believe our tax enforcement regime could be strengthened by \nprovisions of the Stop Tax\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\nHaven Abuse Act, S. 506, which I introduced with Senators McCaskill, \nNelson, Whitehouse, Shaheen, and Sanders. For example, Treasury should \nhave authority to prohibit U.S. banks from participating in wire \ntransfers with or honoring credit cards from overseas banks that impede \nU.S. tax enforcement.\n  I will continue to press for enactment of S. 506 and to build the \ngrowing momentum against overseas tax abuses. Make no mistake, today \nmarks an important milestone. For the first time in years, we are \npoised to approve legislation with a real chance to pull back the \ncurtain of bank secrecy, expose offshore accounts, and ensure that \nthose who owe taxes pay them. Amid the growing concern over our budget \ndeficit and American families' concerns about making ends meet, we can \nno longer afford to allow tax dodgers to hide behind this curtain, \navoiding their obligations and leaving their rightful tax burden for \nhonest taxpayers to carry. I urge my colleagues to approve the HIRE \nAct, in the interest of America's workers and America's honest \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the jobs legislation, \nknown as the HIRE Act, on which the Senate will be voting tomorrow \nmorning, and to express my deep concerns with the direction this bill \nhas taken over the past few weeks.\n  Ever since the collapse of the financial markets in late 2008, \nhelping our economy should have been a priority for this deliberative \nbody. However, it has taken more than a year for us to seriously \naddress legislation that would promote permanent job growth.\n  Several of my Finance Committee colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nput a lot of time and effort into the creation of a compromise jobs \nbill that Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley were trying to move \nforward. I had high hopes that we might help thaw the partisan freeze \nthat has had this Chamber gridlocked for so long. But then, just as it \nlooked like we might see some light at the end of this bitter tunnel, \nthe rug was pulled out from underneath us by the majority leader's \ninexplicable decision to hijack our work and alter it with a piece of \nlegislation that he knew would replace cooperation with acrimony.\n  But if that weren't enough, the majority leader added another slap in \nthe face of the minority; he once again filled the amendment tree, thus \nshutting off the minority's ability to attempt to improve the bill. To \nthose unfamiliar with the Senate process, when the majority leader \nfills the amendment tree, he prevents anyone else from being able to \noffer any amendments to the underlying legislation. Thus, he prevents \ncompromise.\n  I have served in this body for a long time, and I cannot remember an \nincident that exhibited as much raw political gamesmanship as this one \ndid. The fact that the majority leader chose to choke off the first \ngenuine attempt at cooperation on a major issue of such importance does \nnot bode well for the remainder of this Congress. How are those of us \nin the minority supposed to have faith that we will not be excluded \nfrom future debates? It is easy to label Republicans as the party of no \nwhen they are completely excluded from the legislative process. When \nthis happens, ``no'' is the only option that remains.\n  But what puzzles me the most is what, even if they succeed, will the \nmajority gain from this maneuver? The Senate operates on a level of \ntrust that agreements will be honored, but now even that has come into \nquestion.\n  Less than 2 months ago, I sat in the House Chamber while the \nPresident gave his State of the Union Address where he raised the \nimportance of bipartisan cooperation, especially in the area of job \ncreation. The fact that the President hit a nerve with this plea is \nevident by the effort to build such a bipartisan bill in the Finance \nCommittee in the weeks following. However, it is obvious that many on \nthe other side cannot stand the thought of working with our side when \nthere might be political points to be gained by trying to embarrass us.\n  Here are a few of the things the President said about the need for \nbipartisanship in the State of the Union Address:\n  ``And what the American people hope--what they deserve--is for all of \nus, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences;''\n  ``[Americans] are tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the \npettiness.''\n  ``These aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're \nliving by; business values or labor values. They're American values.''\n  In the same breath, President Obama went on to address the need to \npromote job growth by saying:\n  ``Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be \nAmerica's businesses.''\n  ``We should start where most new jobs do--in small businesses, \ncompanies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or \na worker decides it's time she became her own boss.''\n  And finally:\n  ``[We should] Provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and \nall small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.''\n  I certainly believed--as did most Republicans--that the President was \nbeing sincere. But soon after President Obama addressed the Nation, \nSenate Democratic and Republican members of the Finance Committee went \nto work on a bipartisan solution to creating a jobs growth bill. I \nworked with Senator Schumer to come up with a payroll tax holiday for \nthose companies that hired unemployed workers. Under this incentive, \nthe sooner a company hired someone, the greater the tax incentives the \ncompany would receive. This initiative is a perfect example of the kind \nof bipartisan President Obama was talking about during the State of the \nUnion.\n  Senators Baucus and Grassley joined in this effort by including \nseveral other provisions aimed at job growth and remedies to address \nthe symptoms of a failing economy. This was a compromise that included \nan extension of unemployment insurance, Build America Bonds, and the \nextension of the expired tax provisions.\n  Let me be clear, there is no doubt in my mind and in the mind of many \nof my colleagues that passing a jobs bill is crucial. We have seen our \nunemployment rate remain stagnant at around 10 percent since last \nSeptember. The American people sent us here to do a job, and it is way \npast time we did it.\n  This is why it was so shocking, then, that on Thursday, February 11, \nthe Senate majority leader suddenly announced that he was scrapping the \ncompromised proposal only hours after it was unveiled, proceeding \ninstead with a scaled-down bill. In minutes, the majority leader pulled \nthe rug out from not only Republicans but also those Democrats who had \nbeen working for weeks on a bipartisan solution. Regrettably, because \nof the majority leader's decision, it looks as though President Obama's \nhope for a bipartisan solution to job creation only lasted 2 weeks. \nWhat a shame.\n  To illustrate the abruptness and surprise in Senator Reid's \nunexpected action, just look at the headlines the following day:\n\n       ``Key Dem: Reid scrapped jobs bill because he did not trust \n     Republicans'' the Hill.\n       ``Reid kills Baucus-Grassley jobs bill''--the Politico.\n       ``Senate leader slashes jobs bill; Despite new support''--\n     LA Times.\n\n  But it does not end there. The majority leader sent a pretty strong \nmessage when he said that he--and I quote--dared Republicans to vote \nagainst his bill.\n  His Democratic colleagues were quick to stand behind this reversal. \nSome Democratic Senators went so far as to say Republicans are not \ninterested in a bipartisan deal because we were more inclined to play \nrope-a-dope again. They went on to characterize the tax extenders as \nonly going to people who are making money. They even went so far as to \nsay that what the Democratic caucus is taking to the floor is something \nthat is more focused on job creation than on tax breaks.\n  Now I know the Senate recently passed the expiring tax extenders \npackage as a part of a broader bill. But what continues to astound me \nis how quickly so many Democratic Senators were to abandon these tax \nextenders. In fact, most of them support--and even voted to extend--\nthese tax provisions. The Democratic leadership even erroneously \nlabeled the tax extenders as a solely Republican-supported initiative. \nAnd many Democrats, including the majority leader, are cosponsors\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\nof legislation that would extend many of the expiring tax provisions. \nLook at the bills to extend the research tax credit or the alternative \nfuels vehicle credit or even the new markets tax credit. These are by \nno means solely Republican initiatives. The exclusion of these tax \nextenders caused one Democrat to criticize the majority leader's action \nby saying ``this bill was carefully crafted to achieve significant \nbipartisan support and contains several important measures to spur \nbusiness growth and encourage new hires.'' So to label support for \nextending these expiring tax provisions as part of a solely Republican \nagenda is misleading, unfair, and unwarranted. These statements were \nmade only to support a desperate, hasty, and ill-considered decision. \nThe icing on the cake was when the Senate ended up passing these very \ntax extenders last week by a vote of 70 to 28. In fact, only one \nDemocrat Senator voted against these tax extenders.\n  Some have questioned how extending these expired tax provisions \nrelate to job creation. It is a fair question but one with easy \nanswers.\n  The extension of these expired tax provisions only supports proven \ngrowth of companies that are slowly beginning to see the light at the \nend of the tunnel. Government funding would only provide a false sense \nof job growth because once the government funding is gone so will the \njobs.\n  If we need proof that government spending is not as effective as tax \nrelief, we only have to look to what the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid last year about the effects of the year-old economic stimulus \npackage.\n\n       The legislation would increase employment by 0.8 million to \n     2.3 million by the fourth quarter of 2009, by 1.2 million to \n     3.6 million by the fourth quarter of 2010, by 0.6 million to \n     1.9 million by the fourth quarter of 2011, and by declining \n     numbers in later years.\n\n  The reason why employment created from the stimulus bill would \ndecline in later years is because government spending does not create \npermanent lasting jobs. The private sector, however, can create \npermanent, self-sustaining jobs. The tax incentives give the private \nsector a much needed boost. If we had included more tax incentives for \nbusinesses in last year's economic stimulus bill we would have created \njobs that would have lasted well beyond the 2 or 3 years government \nspending would have created.\n  Originally projected to provide $787 billion in stimulus, the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, now puts the 10-year costs of the \nstimulus bill at $862 billion. This does not include interest owed, \nwhich would put the total cost at over $1 trillion.\n  Of the $862 billion stimulus package, only a third has been spent. \nAnother third is expected to be spent in 2010, and the remaining third \nwill be spent after 2010. What ever happened to spending money on \nprojects deemed to be shovel ready?\n  The administration has claimed the stimulus bill is responsible for \ncreating or saving 1 million jobs. If we take a closer look, we see \nthis claim is very misleading. For example, it was reported that a \nconstruction company in Nevada reported creating 20 jobs on a project \nthat has yet to receive money. A school district reported saving 665 \njobs, even though it only employs about 600 people. A town in Oregon \nreported creating eight jobs on a contract for rattlesnake stewardship. \nIn January of 2009, President Obama's economic advisers predicted in a \nreport that with an $800 billion stimulus, the unemployment rate would \nnever go above 8 percent. Without the stimulus, they said, the rate \nwould be at 9 percent. The unemployment rate has been near 10 percent \nsince last September.\n  The stimulus package was sold to the American people as an immediate \nfix. I think the exact words were that it would be a ``jolt'' to the \neconomy. Some of the quotes by the administration were ``you'll see the \neffects immediately,'' from Larry Summers. ``We'll start adding jobs \nrather than losing them,'' from Christina Romer, the President's Chair \nof Economic Advisers. ``This will begin creating jobs immediately,'' \nfrom House majority leader Steny Hoyer.\n  Back when he was pitching the stimulus bill, then-President-elect \nObama said ``90 percent of these jobs will be created in the private \nsector--the remaining 10 percent are mainly public sector jobs.'' \nHowever, in an article dated February 17, the Wall Street Journal \nreported that government data indicate that most of the jobs supported \nby stimulus spending belonged to public employees at the State and \nlocal level.\n  In fact, only 2 percent of the entire stimulus bill was dedicated \ntoward tax relief for businesses. The public sector does not create \npermanent jobs; the private sector does. We need to provide a \nfoundation to allow the private sector to nourish and create better \npaying jobs.\n  That is why many supported including these tax extenders in the HIRE \nAct. For instance, it is estimated that approximately 70 percent or \nmore of the research tax credit benefits are attributable to salaries \nof performing U.S.-based research. How can some Senators disregard the \neffectiveness of some of these tax extenders on job growth? And keep in \nmind that the research credit has traditionally received more \nDemocratic support in this body than it has Republican support. In \nfact, there is a bill to extend the expiring research tax credit. Of \nthe 18 cosponsors of this bill, 11 are Democrats. Furthermore, this \nbill was introduced by the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  The President set the tone at the beginning of the year by calling on \nCongress to put forth a bipartisan solution to creating jobs in this \ncountry. In response, both Democrats and Republicans brought innovative \nideas to the table. Then, in a sudden change of events, many Republican \nideas have been excluded from the jobs bill the majority leader has \nbrought to the floor.\n  Again, the majority leader has maneuvered this legislation to prevent \nany amendments from being offered by our side. In fact, the majority \nleader continues to exclude Republicans from debate. Just look at this \nchart that shows how many times the majority leader has filled the \namendment tree in relation to past majority leaders--25 times. If this \nis not an arrogance of power, then I do not know what is. I only hope \nthe majority leader heeds to President Obama's plea for a bipartisan \nsolution.\n  I think one Democrat, learning of the majority leader's action, said \nit best:\n\n       Most Americans don't honestly believe that a single \n     political party has all the good ideas. I hope the Majority \n     Leader will reconsider.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I rise today to discuss the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's Animal Identification System. Over the past several \nyears, USDA has administered a system called the National Animal \nIdentification System, NAIS.\n  The ultimate goal of the system was to keep track of animal movements \nso that we could trace back animals in the event of a disease outbreak. \nThe first step under animal ID was to register farms where animals are \nhoused, also known as premises, and that registration was to occur in a \ndatabase.\n  After registering a premise, a producer could identify individual \nanimals or groups of animals that moved to or from a premise, each \ngiven an individual ID number. This system worked for those who wanted \nto use it. But no one was forced to participate. In other words, it was \na voluntary system.\n  If producers wanted to participate in the program so they could keep \ntrack of an animal's movements or because a trading partner might be \nmore inclined to buy their product, or for any reason that worked well \nwith their operation, then it was there for them. It was at their \ndisposal.\n  But as long as NAIS was in existence, it was a voluntary program. \nNow, recently, on February 5, 2010, USDA announced it was doing away \nwith that and developing a new framework for animal disease \ntraceability in the United States.\n  It caught my attention as a former Secretary of Agriculture. The \nObama administration completed a series of listening sessions held by \nUSDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service--we refer to them as \nAPHIS--and those were done just last year.\n  Having held farm bill forums across the country as the Secretary of \nAgriculture, I applaud any effort to hear directly from farmers and \nranchers. I applaud USDA for seeking input on NAIS. I was very \nappreciative that, at my request, one of those animal ID listening \nsessions was, in fact, held in my own home State of Nebraska.\n  But I must admit, after the listening sessions I was very surprised \nat the new framework that the USDA has developed. USDA says the new \nprogram is not a mandatory program except for animals that travel to a \ndifferent State from where they were born.\n  Think about that. With that little caveat, that basically means the \nprogram is a mandatory program for a whole lot of livestock in the \nUnited States. You see, anybody who has any farm background or \nagricultural experience will tell you that the vast majority of animals \nin this country move to a different State in their lifetime.\n  It is just simply a fact. Additionally, the program is mandatory not \nonly for premise registration but for the actual tracking of the \nanimal. Here is the real kicker. State governments will be tasked with \nkeeping track of the livestock under the new system.\n  It is almost like this administration realized how much opposition \nthere was to a mandatory system--and, believe me, there is--and decided \nto hand the hot potato to the States. But in doing that, they said, \nthou shalt do it but keep the headache off our desks.\n  States are genuinely and rightfully concerned about this new program \npotentially being dumped on them. I am already hearing from officials \nand producers in my home State, and they are enormously concerned by \nthis proposal. Some groups are even urging the Nebraska Department of \nAgriculture, which would be tasked with administering the program, to \nrefuse to participate. And, believe me, this is not the last State that \nwill weigh in on this very controversial proposal.\n  Later this week, there is a meeting of State departments of \nagriculture, State veterinarians, and other interested parties to \nfurther examine this issue. That is why I am on the Senate floor. I am \ngoing to be very anxious to hear their input and to hear the outcome of \nthat meeting because there is great concern in farm country for this \nproposal. My hope is that conference participants can get some answers \nto some basic questions.\n  Consider this: Let's say a Nebraska farmer buys a Nebraska calf with \nno tracking number and puts it out in a Nebraska pasture. So that is in \nstate. That is pretty clear. No need to comply.\n  Sometime later, after that calf has gained some weight, it is then \ntaken to the auction barn, the sale barn. At this point, in the sale \nbarn, there are multiple buyers from all over the country typically. \nThere could be buyers from Nebraska and Kansas, Iowa, and other States. \nThey are all in the arena to bid on their calves.\n  But apparently only buyers from Nebraska could make bids even though \nother buyers from other States might offer more money. Let's say by \nchance a Nebraska feedlot is the highest bidder and buys the calf, \nstill in state, can feed that calf out--still no need to comply with \nthe animal ID program. But now, some months later, the steer is ready \nto go to the packing plant, but the plant is on the other side of the \nriver in another State, and they will pay more than a plant instate for \nthat animal. Wait a second. Can the feedlot owner sell to the Iowa meat \nprocessor? Apparently not because the two owners prior to him chose to \nnot participate in the program.\n  The bottom line: Many livestock auctions attract bidders from in \nstate and States all over the country. So one can assume all animals \nsold through an auction barn will be required to have animal ID. For \nthose who have been to these sales, can you imagine literally the \nauctioneer stopping the sale and saying: These animals are not \nregistered; only Nebraska purchasers can buy the animals. If they were \nnot ID'd, auctioneers would literally have to stop the bidding and \nannounce where the potential seller resides for each animal without a \ntracking number. Then many of the buyers must sit on the sidelines, \nvisit the bathroom, go to the vending machine, anything but bid on \ntheir calf. Can you imagine. It just doesn't make any sense. What will \nbe the viability of the cattle operations in this country for that sale \nbarn? What about the rancher who sells some of his cattle in state and \nsome of it goes to facilities in other States? Will that person be \nrequired to tag some of the animals in the feedlot but not others? He \nor she is going to spend more time trying to figure out how to comply \nwith the USDA program than he or she will spend ranching. Producers are \nbasically going to be forced to fully participate in the program. I \nthink the USDA knows it. If a potential buyer is from another State, \nthere can be no deal unless the animal has the tracking number.\n  This looks like a backdoor mandate that is being packaged as \nsomething else. Worse yet, the package is being delivered and dropped \non the doorstep of our States. Let's face facts. This so-called new \nanimal ID plan is a mandatory system, when it was promoted as a \nvoluntary one. In my judgment, to be blunt, this is a wolf in sheep's \nclothing, but America's farmers and ranchers are not going to be \nfooled. They know better than anyone that the vast majority of \nagricultural commerce occurs across State lines and even country to \ncountry. They deserve better.\n  Let me be clear. I did not come here to be critical of the fact that \nUSDA is considering new approaches. In fact, I acknowledge that when I \nwas the Secretary, I called a timeout to fully understand the \ncomplexities of the animal ID and to hear from producers. I openly \nsaid: I am considering making this a mandatory program. I thought a \nmandatory approach might be necessary, and we listened and studied it \nvery closely.\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\n  Then we went to the countryside. We listened to farmers and ranchers. \nWhat we heard overwhelmingly is: Mike, do not make this a mandatory \nprogram. We realized that producers already comply with a laundry list \nof Federal regulations. In this administration, it grows by the day. \nThey take numerous steps to ensure the safety of their animals. That is \ntheir livelihood. Mandating an animal identification system would have \nbeen one more costly burden dictated on the rancher by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I appeal to my friend Secretary Vilsack. We were Governors together. \nI know where you are coming from. I went down that road too. I can tell \nyou, Mr. Secretary, it is a dead end. On one hand, USDA has \nacknowledged the broad and deep opposition in the countryside when the \nadministration seemed to say: We are going to go forward anyway. Our \nproducers themselves have spent years trying to understand what NAIS is \nabout. There is no repackaging that will convince them another Federal \nmandate is a good idea. Does this administration think States will \nembrace this hot potato with all the costs and the unanswered questions \nthat go with it? I don't see it. The old NAIS system was not perfect. \nWe always acknowledged that. This is hugely complicated. But calling it \nvoluntary and then leaving producers no real choice is far from \nperfect, and, most importantly, it is not a solution.\n  I urge the USDA to reconsider.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

The bills I will highlight this morning have been \npassed by our committee by large and convincing margins: 18 to 0, 15 to \n3, 16 to 4. We are proud of the work we have done.\n  My call to the Senators this morning is to get our eyes off of Wall \nStreet and onto Main Street. If we really want to dig out of this \nrecession, created by a number of things--failed policies from the past \nadministration, a confluence of the crash of the stock market and the \nfinancial sector, poor regulation from us over time--the people who \nhave really suffered are the small business owners who, unlike large \nbusinesses and public companies, have put everything at risk--their \nfuture, their house, their children's future--everything at risk to \ncreate business because that is what Americans do, and we do it better \nthan any country on Earth.\n  We recognize the strength of American business. It is about \nentrepreneurship. That is what the Small Business Committee is focused \non. We want attention--and we will get it--to this issue.\n  I thank the members for their hard work and support. In this toxic \nenvironment, to get anything out of a committee with that kind of vote, \nwe deserve a round of applause before we even start. But that is \nanother story for another day.\n  Now we have to move the bills through the process. I want to share \nthis graph, which is telling. Of the share of net new jobs created, 65 \npercent of the new jobs created by everything we do here will be \ncreated by small business, not by big business. Large firms are \nshrinking, reorganizing, sort of waiting for the market to come back. I \nunderstand that. They have a fiduciary responsibility. These folks are \nout there taking the big risk. When the way is not clear, when it is \nstill cloudy, it is small businesses taking a chance that maybe things \nwill turn around. These are the people we have to get our eyes on.\n  As chair of the Small Business Committee, I have heard for months \nthat small businesses want to hire new workers. They need to hire new \nworkers. They can expand their business, but they don't have the \nability.\n\n  Small business owner Ray Meche, who owns several neighborhood \npharmacies in southwest Louisiana, has an excellent track record. He \nhas been in business for over 20 years. He has never missed a payment. \nHe can't get a loan because he uses the small business lending program \nand he is capped at $2 million. One of our bills would raise that cap \nto $5 million. That is something we must do now. Until we do, business \nowners such as Ray wait. They wait to get larger loans to expand their \nbusinesses. They wait for a government contract. They wait for \nopportunities for counseling as they attempt to boost sales by tapping \ninto potential markets overseas.\n  I want to show an export chart which is also telling. When I saw \nthis, I had my staff use it at every townhall I do because I actually \ndidn't believe it. I made them go back and do it several times because \nit was so contrary to my notion of the world. But it is true. This is \nthe truth. Of all small businesses in America, of every one we know, \nless than 1 percent export their goods out of the country. Think about \nthat. When the market in America is soft and our businesses are trying \nto create jobs, we can do what we can to energize these markets at \nhome, but we most certainly should be looking overseas. I can tell you \nwhy small businesses would be a little nervous about it. Because they \nhave never negotiated with big trade representatives China and Korea \nand Germany and France. It could be a little intimidating. They have \ngreat products. With the Internet, they have the world at their \nfingertips. What they don't have is an export bill by their own \nCongress that gives them an opportunity to get the training and \ntechnical assistance through departments we already pay for, \ndepartments that are already set up but just aren't focused on small \nbusiness and helping them trade.\n  I want to see this pie chart expanded. I don't know if we can expand \nit to 10 percent of small businesses or 20 percent, but we can't sit at \n1 percent while our people lose jobs here. That is why this package is \nimportant.\n  I thank Senator Shaheen for her extraordinary leadership and also my \nranking member, Senator Snowe, who has spent a great deal of time \ntalking in the committee and in hearings about the opportunity for \ntrade. That is what this package does as well.\n  I want to present the Access to Capital Coalition that is behind us. \nWe did not come here to the floor alone. We have an extraordinary \ncoalition for a jobs agenda from small business groups all over \nAmerica, from the small business groups represented by the Chamber of \nCommerce, to the Federation of Small Business, to the San Francisco \nSmall Business Network, to the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce, \nthe Marin Builders Association, the Main Street Alliance, just to read \na few, Oregon Small Business for Responsible Leadership.\n  This list represents hundreds of thousands of businesses that say to \nme every day: Senator, does anybody know we are here? Every day we pick \nup the paper and we read about AIG, Goldman Sachs, General Motors, \nExxon. We think those companies are great. We hope maybe to be as big \nas they are one day. But does anybody know we are here?\n  I know you are there. We are going to fight hard for you, and we are \ngoing to pull this coalition together to focus on the one group of \npeople in America who can actually create jobs, which would be the \nsmall businesses, found in every neighborhood, on every Main Street, in \nurban areas, suburban areas. And, yes,\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\neven rural areas can create the kind of jobs we need to lift this \nNation out of the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, you were a banker. You understand the \nimportance of lending money to small businesses and getting it to them \nwhen they need it quickly. You established extraordinary opportunities \nin your home State of Illinois. That is what this package of bills does \nthat has passed out of the Small Business Committee and is pending for \naction in this Senate.\n  Small businesses have borne the greatest burden in this economy. They \nare the business that have the greatest potential to improve it. By \nmaking these simple, inexpensive, and commonsense proposals to help \nsmall businesses, we can turn pink slips into paychecks for American \nworkers, and we can lift our entire Nation out of this terrible \nrecession into a brighter day in the future.\n  So, again, I thank my colleagues on the committee for working in such \na bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan outline of the five bills that make up this package, S. 2869, the \nSmall Business Job Creation and Access to Capital Act; S. 2862, the \nSmall Business Export Enhancement and International Trade Act; S. 2989, \nthe Small Business Contracting Improvement Act; S. 1229, the \nEntrepreneurial Development Act; and S. 1233 the SBIR/STTR \nReauthorization Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             ADDRESSING SMALL BUSINESS NEEDS TO CREATE JOBS\nS. 2869, the Small Business Job     Increases 7(a) loans limits from $2\n Creation and Access to Capital      million to $5 million; 504 loans\n Act of 2009.

We will take them up, hopefully, in a package at a \nlater date, but I want to call my colleagues' attention to the package \nof bills that will expand loan limits, expand contracting opportunities \nwith the Federal Government, which, by the way, spends billions of \ndollars right now with business. If we just spend a little bit more \nwith small business, these small businesses--instead of absorbing the \ncontracts, which the big businesses do--will have to hire up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Small businesses, when they get a contract from the \nFederal Government, will staff up because that is what small businesses \ndo. They are very flexible. They are very agile. They will scale down, \nand they can scale up quickly.\n  So I am proud of this package. I want to recognize two of my members \nwho are on the Senate floor: former Governor and now a Senator from New \nHampshire, Jeanne Shaheen, who has been a great leader on this issue--I \nthank you, Senator--and also Senator Ben Cardin from Maryland. He has \nbeen a particularly strong leader on the contracting for small \nbusinesses. So I would like to ask the Senator to join me in her \nremarks this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am so pleased to join Chairman \nLandrieu and my colleague, Senator Ben Cardin. Hopefully, he will be \nable to speak after me to talk about the importance of small businesses \nand what we have to do to support small business in this country.\n  Small businesses in New Hampshire and across the country, as Senator \nLandrieu has said, are struggling. Of\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\nthe jobs lost last year, almost 40 percent came from businesses with 50 \nor fewer employees. While we have taken important steps to bring back \nthe economy from the brink of depression, sales and consumer demand are \nstill too low and too many small business owners remain frozen out of \ncredit markets.\n  This economy is not going to fully recover until our small businesses \nfully recover. In the past, it has been small businesses that have \ncreated most of the jobs coming out of a recession, and this recovery \nis going to be no different. If we want to see job growth in this \ncountry, we need to take action to help small businesses get back on \ntheir feet.\n  Now, as a former small business owner, I know it is business and not \ngovernment that creates jobs and drives innovation and new ideas. But I \nalso know government has an important role to play in helping small \nbusiness create jobs, especially in these very difficult economic \ntimes.\n  Under the leadership of our chair, Senator Landrieu, who has done a \ngreat job, along with our ranking member, Senator Snowe, in the last \nseveral months the Small Business Committee has produced five major \npieces of legislation to help small companies create jobs again, and \nSenator Landrieu has laid those out for people. I am proud to be a \nsponsor of all five of these bills.\n  They spur research and innovation. They ensure small businesses get \ntheir fair share of government contracts. They expand SBA lending \nprograms so small businesses can obtain affordable credit. They \nstrengthen the technical services the SBA can provide. And they help \nsmall businesses gain access to international markets to sell their \ngoods and services.\n  These bills, as we have heard Senator Landrieu say, are bipartisan \nefforts that passed the committee with nearly unanimous votes from both \nRepublican and Democratic members. I hope we are soon going to see \nthese bills on the floor of the Senate and that they will pass \nunanimously.\n  All of the bills are important. But today I want to focus on what we \ncan do to help open global markets to small business because I strongly \nbelieve that in order to have a sustained recovery from this recession, \nwe need to expand exports. Domestic consumer demand in the United \nStates simply will not rise to the level it was before the recession.\n  The good news is that the potential for export growth is enormous. \nOver 95 percent of the world's customers live outside of the United \nStates. But as we saw so dramatically on that chart Senator Landrieu \njust showed, only about 1 percent of small businesses export their \ngoods and services, and small companies that do export usually only \nsell to one foreign market, while larger companies typically sell to \nfive or more foreign markets.\n  Emerging markets in developing countries such as China, India, and \nBrazil offer great opportunities for growth. By 2020, about 90 percent \nof the world's population will live in emerging markets. There is a \nhuge potential for smaller companies to tap these markets to grow their \nbusinesses and to create jobs.\n  I have long been an advocate for exporting because international \nmarkets are very important to New Hampshire. I was the first Governor \nto lead a trade mission from New Hampshire overseas, and those trade \nmissions I led brought back about $500 million in sales for New \nHampshire businesses.\n  Small business generates almost half of New Hampshire's total \nexports, and we have some great success stories.\n  Dartware, a software developer in West Lebanon, on the western side \nof our State, first started exporting to Canada--which neighbors New \nHampshire, for those people who are not sure on their geography. Now \nthey sell to more than 80 countries. During this recession, exporting \nhas made a huge difference on their bottom line. Last year, their \ninternational sales were 33 percent of their total sales. This past \nJanuary, export sales represented 63 percent or almost double their \ntotal sales.\n  Another company, a small business called Sky-Skan, in Nashua, designs \nand produces state-of-the-art technologies for planetariums. You would \nnot think there would be that many planetariums around the world, but \nthey have exported their products and services to over 120 countries. \nEven in the midst of one of the most difficult economies in our \nNation's history, Sky-Skan was able to bring on 10 new employees.\n  In his State of the Union speech, President Obama set a goal of \ndoubling American exports in the next 5 years. He recently signed an \nexecutive order creating an Export Promotion Cabinet. I strongly \nsupport those efforts. I know other members of the Small Business \nCommittee do as well.\n  A recent World Bank study found that each dollar spent on export \npromotion and assistance brought a fortyfold return. Right now, the \nUnited States spends considerably less than the international average \nin helping small businesses export. Government export promotion and \nassistance is a smart investment that helps create jobs. One of the \nimportant actions we need to take in the Senate to help improve export \npromotion is to quickly enact the Small Business Export Enhancement and \nInternational Trade Act of 2009--one of those five pieces of \nlegislation Senator Landrieu laid out.\n  We need to make the SBA a more valuable resource for small businesses \nlooking to export their goods and services, and this bill does just \nthat. I hope as these bills come to the floor of the Senate, we will \ntake a close look and we will recognize that if we are going to help \nsmall businesses export, then we have to give them the tools to do \nthat. This legislation does that. It helps small companies finance \ntheir exports by increasing loan limits and guarantees in SBA export \nloan programs and expanding the number of SBA finance specialists who \nare posted around the country.\n  This bill directs the SBA to collaborate more with other agencies \nthat provide services and programs for small exporters--something the \nSBA has begun doing under the leadership of Administrator Karen Mills.\n  More U.S. exports abroad mean more jobs at home. We can and must do \nmore. We must do it smarter to help small companies compete globally. \nIf we do not, we risk falling behind, and our economy, our businesses, \nand our families will lose out.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and look forward to hearing from my \ncolleague, Senator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business as part of the comments made by Senator Landrieu \nand Senator Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we are here today to talk about the \nimportance of job creation in our economy. We all know we need to \ncreate jobs. The way to create jobs is to help small businesses. Too \nmuch of the focus over the last couple years has been in helping the \nlarge companies, the large banks. We need to focus on small companies \nin order to create new job opportunities for Americans.\n  I compliment Senator Shaheen for her comments. She is absolutely \nright. Small businesses can create many jobs in the United States by \ncreating products that are wanted around the globe. The problem is, it \nis very complicated for a small business owner to have the type of \nstaff to deal with the difficulties of entering the international \nmarketplace.\n  Senator Shaheen pointed out very clearly that the legislation Senator \nLandrieu has been instrumental in bringing forward in the Small \nBusiness Committee that deals with enhancing international trade for \nsmall companies, S. 2862, will provide more jobs in America by helping \nsmaller companies be able to get their products into the international \nmarketplace. That makes common sense.\n  As I said in the beginning, we need to create more jobs. Senator \nLandrieu, in her leadership on the Small Business Committee, has made \nthat our top priority, and I congratulate her for bringing this to our \nattention.\n  We know over 50 percent--over 50 percent--of private sector jobs are \nwith small companies. We know 64 percent of the net new jobs during the \npast 15 years have come from small companies. That is where the job \ngrowth will be. We are talking about creating jobs. We create more jobs \nthrough small companies, but we have to help them because they have \nmany obstacles\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\ntoday to be able to create those new jobs.\n  Forty percent of high-tech workers work for small companies. This is \na very interesting statistic. There are 13 times more patents per \nemployee in small companies than in larger companies. Innovation comes \nfrom our smaller companies. It does not mean we ignore larger \ncompanies. They have opportunities small companies do not have. But if \nwe are going to create the jobs and innovation, we have to have a \nhealthy atmosphere for small businesses today, and we need to do a \nbetter job.\n  What is the problem? Problem No. 1 is credit. Small companies cannot \nget traditional credit. Many large banks have just closed out giving \nloans to small companies. I can tell you of the calls I have gotten in \nmy office, the letters I have gotten. There is a high-tech company \nlocated in Hunt Valley, MD. It is a small business that cannot get a \nbank to make a refinancing loan so that high-tech company can expand. \nThey are doing very well. Their customer base would be very familiar to \nmany of the Members of the Senate. But they cannot get a bank to be \ntheir partner in this environment because they are a small company.\n  As a result, many small companies, many small businesses resort to \nthe use of their personal credit cards--their personal credit cards--in \norder to finance their business. One-third of small companies have over \n25 percent of their overall debt from credit cards. Fifty percent of \nsmall businesses' interests rates are 15 percent or higher. That is not \nsustainable. You can't run a business based upon that type of \nfinancing. We have to do much better in that regard.\n\n  That is why I was particularly pleased by S. 2869, which Chairman \nLandrieu has brought forward with Senator Snowe, that would strengthen \nthe SBA's capacity to make credit available to small businesses. It \nwould increase the 7(a) loan program. The 7(a) loans are the \ntraditional loans small businesses get in order to finance their \noperations. It would increase the amount from $2 million to $5 million \nand continue the 90-percent Federal guarantee. The 504 loans, which are \nused primarily for bricks and mortar, would increase from $1.5 million \nto $5.5 million. The microloans, which give a business the opportunity \nfor working capital so they can move forward with an innovation and an \nidea and create jobs, increase from $35,000 to $50,000. That tells us \nhow important that is to a small business. That extra $15,000 can be \nthe difference between developing an idea to create jobs or not.\n  I congratulate Chairman Landrieu for bringing forward that \nlegislation. It passed our committee by a 17-to-1 vote. This is a \nstrong bipartisan bill that we hope will be made permanent.\n  I think we need to do more. I have introduced legislation that \nfollows in the direction of the President. President Obama has \nsuggested we take some of the TARP funds and use it to help community \nbanks make loans to small businesses. I think we should look at having \ndirect loans by the SBA to small businesses, certainly as a backup, if \nthe private sector is not going to show enough interest to help our \nsmall businesses.\n  I know there are other suggestions to help our States. Governor \nO'Malley has suggested a program that could use some additional Federal \nsupport and get money out quickly to small businesses for credit. We \nneed to focus on that because there is a credit crisis for small \nbusinesses. We need to be able to do better than we are doing today if \nwe are going to be able to create jobs. In every State in the Nation, I \nknow my colleagues have heard from their small business owners that \nthey can't get affordable credit. We need to act in order to bring us \nout of this current economic downturn.\n  There are other bills I wish to mention briefly. Chairman Landrieu \nmentioned the bill I have been involved with, S. 2989, the Small \nBusiness Contracting Improvement Act. Small businesses depend upon \ngovernment procurement as an effort to get started and to grow. The \nproblem is, there is this cozy relationship between procurement \nofficers and larger companies, so they have developed into practices \nthat have hurt small companies in being able to get the set-asides that \nwe in Congress said they should get. So what the contractor for the \ngovernment agency does is bundle a lot of contracts that should be \noffered individually, but they bundle them to make them too large for \nsmall businesses to be able to bid on. This legislation deals with the \nabuses of bundling. I congratulate our chair for bringing that forward.\n  It also deals with the abuses between subcontractors and prime \ncontractors. It is no surprise to anyone here that small businesses are \nmore likely to be subs. Well, we don't have transparency and openness \nand timely payments to the subs. The prime contractor is abusing \nprivileges, and we have a responsibility to make sure the law is \ncarried out with the set-asides to small businesses in our procurement \npolicies. This legislation, which passed our committee by a unanimous \nvote earlier this month, I think will go a long way to helping small \nbusinesses create jobs in our community.\n  There is other legislation that is out there to strengthen the SBA \ncounseling program that Chairman Landrieu mentioned. I think that is an \nimportant bill. It passed our committee by a 19-to-0 vote--again, \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  There is another program I wish to mention quickly, because during \nthe Recovery Act there should have been funds set aside for the SBIR/\nSTTR programs. They were not. We have spoken about that before in this \nbody. The legislation that passed our committee by an 18-to-0 vote \nwould increase the allocations for the SBIR and STTR programs, which \nare high-tech set-asides for small high-tech companies, which help us \ndevelop innovation technology here in America, keeping jobs in America \nand expanding jobs in America. It would increase that set-aside from a \nmodest 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. It passed our committee by an 18-to-\n0 vote.\n  These are all important bills that I hope we will have an opportunity \nto take up shortly as we look at the next jobs bill. I hope these \nprovisions can be incorporated into legislation we consider. This is \nbipartisan. I think all my colleagues understand we have to create more \njob opportunities in America. The way to do it is to help small \nbusinesses deal with their current needs.\n  I will mention one other bill before yielding the floor; that is, the \nhealth care bill which will help small businesses. The problem I used \nto hear the most from my small businesses was about paying health care \ncosts. Now I hear credit. Credit is their No. 1 problem. But we provide \na credit--Senator Landrieu was helpful in getting this started \nearlier--to our small businesses so they can afford to provide health \ncare for their employees. I thank Senator Landrieu for that provision. \nThat is going to help small companies and help job growth.\n  We also created the exchanges. These are the exchanges where a small \ncompany can go in and buy health insurance policies. I can't tell my \ncolleagues how many times I have heard from a small business owner \nsaying: I am getting ripped off. I have no choice with an insurance \nplan I can take. I have a 30-percent increase, a 40-percent increase in \npremiums. My employees' health didn't deteriorate. Our costs didn't go \nup by that, but I have no choice. There is no other company I can get a \npolicy with.\n  Well, under health reform, we provide options and choice and \ncompetition for the small business owner. Today, they are paying, on \naverage, 20 percent more than large companies pay for comparable \ninsurance coverage for their employees. That practice needs to end. We \nshouldn't be discriminating against small businesses in America, and we \ntake major steps forward to eliminate that discrimination.\n  These are all things we can do to create jobs in America, to help our \nsmall businesses, help our Nation, help our recovery, and help us grow \nas a nation, to be even more competitive, offering good jobs to the \npeople in our communities who are seeking employment.\n  With that, let me yield the remainder of my time to the chairman of \nthe Small Business Committee, the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, again, I thank my colleagues both, and \nparticularly Senator Cardin, for that impassioned plea to focus this \nplace on small business. If we are serious about\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\ncreating jobs, then our focus, our effort, our work should be for the \nmillions of small businesses out there that with just a little bit of \ntweaking, a little bit of help from an export initiative here, some \nregulation reform here, loan pools here, changing current law, could \nhelp them do what they want to do, which is expand and grow jobs.\n  I see my colleagues are here to speak, so I am just going to take 1 \nminute to conclude.\n  I wish my colleagues to know that while this package is five major \nbills, there is an initiative that is not in bill form yet, but we are \nvery serious about bringing it forward. It is going to include a \nprovision for there to be a pool of capital available. It may be the \nway Senator Cardin has envisioned it, which is direct loans from the \nSBA. It may be the way Senator Levin and Senator Warner have been \ntalking about, which is an idea to provide guaranteed loan pools to \nleverage private capital in the country. It may be something Bill \nClinton spoke with us about yesterday, which is creating a dynamic new \nopportunity to retrofit public buildings in America and put people to \nwork and use the savings in energy efficiency to pay back the loans so \nthere is no new taxpayer money spent. It is leveraging the private \nsector to do two great things: provide jobs immediately and make more \nefficient every public building in America.\n  There is more we can do. So as the chairman, let me be very clear. I \nam very proud of this package. It is five bills. It has passed our \ncommittee almost unanimously. As we move this package to the floor, I \nhope we will get the same cooperation from Republican Members on this \nfloor as we did from the Republican Members who serve on our committee. \nWe have been very open, very sincere in our efforts to pull this \npackage together, and we will continue to work in that good spirit. I \nhope we are met with that same feeling.\n\n  Two more things, briefly. I am probably not going to push to put in \nthis bill a reform piece on credit cards to small businesses because it \nis not the jurisdiction of our committee; it is primarily the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee. However, I want this Senate to \nknow I am on record today. Senator Cardin says--and he is correct--how \nin the world are small businesses in America going to stay in business \nif they have to pay 15 and 20 percent interest rates? Could anybody \ntell me this? Is there any small business in America that thinks they \ncan make money, hire people, and pay 20 percent interest rates? It is a \nshame. It is wrong. We are going to do something about small business \ncredit card rates. I will tell my colleagues why. Because in the old \ndays, not too long ago when the housing market was strong, which it is \nnot today, Americans--who believe in the American dream because we tell \nthem about it when they are 4 years old and they actually believe it \nwhen they grow up--their house had $200,000 or $300,000 or $400,000 or \n$50,000 in equity. So when they wanted to start a business, they went \nto their banker and their banker said: How much equity do you have in \nyour house? They said: $50,000. They wrote them a check that day for \n$20,000. They took that amount of money and they bought a stove and \nthey started a business, maybe cooking a little scrambled eggs and ham.\n  Those days are over with. There is no equity in their homes anymore. \nWhen they go to their bank, they don't see a sign that says welcome--\nand I am not talking about community banks, I am talking about big \nbanks that got all the money from us--they see a sign that says come \nback next year when things are better. So they have to then dig in \ntheir pocket and pull out their credit card. We have done them a great \nfavor. We allow the companies to charge them not 3 percent, not 6 \npercent, not 10 percent but 20 percent.\n  I can't put that bill in this package, but I promise my colleagues it \nis coming. We cannot ask small business to pay 20 percent on their \nloans. Yes, we have to give them tax relief. But do my colleagues know \nwhat they need right now? They need borrowing relief.\n  So I am going to conclude with that. It is going to be a good \npackage, and we are going to be very smart about how we put it forward. \nI know we have to take the tough things maybe separately so as to not \ndetain this. But I am on record, and we are going to fight for it until \nwe get it done.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I get into the main topic, I \nobviously appreciate the passion of the Senator from Louisiana. It is \nunfortunate that she and the majority on the other side refuse to vote \nfor the most important thing we could have done immediately for small \nbusiness; that is, give them payroll tax relief and take the money out \nof the stimulus package, so much of which is being wasted on issues \nsuch as Davis-Bacon and environmental impact statements. We ought to \ngive small businesses payroll tax relief immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1643-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1643-S1644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Now I wish to take this opportunity to speak about the \nongoing cause of human rights and democracy in Russia. These are not \nissues we hear much about from the current Russian Government, \nunfortunately, unless it is to denounce those Russian citizens who \naspire to these universal values.\n  I had an opportunity the other week to meet with one of these brave \nRussian champions of human rights, human dignity, and freedom--a man by \nthe name of Boris Nemtsov. I know several other people and other \nMembers of Congress had a similar opportunity to speak with him. Mr. \nNemtsov is but one of the many Russians who believe their country \ndeserves a government that enhances and enshrines the human rights of \nits people in an inviolable rule of law, that allows citizens to hold \ntheir leaders accountable through a real Democratic process. This \nSaturday, March 20, many Russian human rights activists are planning \npublic demonstrations all across their great country--I might add at \ngreat risk, since there is very little doubt that the Russian \nGovernment may even forcibly repress some of these public \ndemonstrations, which will be peaceful. I asked Mr. Nemtsov what we in \nWashington could do to support the cause of human rights in Russia, and \nhe simply said: ``Speak up for it. Speak up for us.''\n  It is my pleasure to do that today.\n  The Russian Government will surely take whatever I say here and \nsimilar things said by others and try to paint Russia's champions of \nhuman rights and democracy as puppets and proxies of the United \nStates. Of course, they would say and do the exact same thing even if \nno Americans spoke up for the human rights of Russia's citizens. So we \nshould refrain from internalizing the Kremlin's talking points, \nespecially when Russians themselves are requesting our moral support \nfor their cause. Because the fact is, this isn't about particular \nindividuals or particular demonstrations held this week or any week in \nRussia. This is about universal values--values that we in the United \nStates embody but do not own, values that should shape the conduct of \nevery government, be it ours or Russia's or any other country's. When \nwe see citizens of conviction seeking to hold their governments to the \nhigher standard of human rights, we should speak up for them.\n\n  This is all the more necessary when we realize the obstacles those \ncitizens face, especially in Russia. I wish to read a passage from the \n2009 Country Report on Human Rights Practices, which was recently \nreleased by our State Department. Here is how they described the human \nrights situation in Russia:\n\n       Direct and indirect government interference in local and \n     regional elections restricted the ability of citizens to \n     change their government through free and fair elections. \n     During the year, there were a number of high-profile killings \n     of human rights activists by unknown persons, apparently for \n     reasons related to their professional activities. There were \n     numerous credible reports that law enforcement personnel \n     engaged in physical abuse of subjects. Prison conditions were \n     harsh and could be life threatening. Eight journalists, many \n     of whom reported critically on the government, were killed \n     during the year. With one exception the government failed to \n     identify, arrest, or prosecute any suspects. Beating and \n     intimidation of journalists remained a problem. The \n     government limited freedom of assembly, and\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\n     police sometimes used violence to prevent groups from \n     engaging in peaceful protest.\n\n  It will be very interesting to see how the police and the government \ntreat these demonstrations that will take place across Russia on March \n20. These conditions would be intolerable in any country, and this \nconduct would be unacceptable for any government. Clearly, Russia today \nis not the Soviet Union, neither in its treatment of Russia's people \nnor in its foreign policy. But I fear that may be damning with faint \npraise, and Russians themselves are right to hold their country and \ntheir government up to higher standards.\n  Russia is a great nation, and like all Americans of good will, I want \nRussia to be strong and successful. I want Russia's economy to be a \nvibrant source of wealth and opportunity for all Russians. I want \nRussia to play a proud and responsible role in world affairs. I will \ncontinue to affirm in public and in private that the best way for \nRussians to secure what they say they care about most--reduced \ncorruption, a strengthened and equitable rule of law, economic \nmodernization--is by nurturing a pluralistic and free civil society, by \nbuilding independent and sustainable institutions of democracy, and by \nrespecting the human rights of all.\n  I was happy to see that Russian political parties not aligned with \nthe Kremlin actually won more seats in regional parliamentary elections \nthis week. Perhaps this signals a growing recognition among Russians \nthat the authoritarian tendencies of the Kremlin need to be rolled back \nthrough popular opposition. Perhaps the Russian Government could allow \nfuture elections at all levels to be freer and fairer. Perhaps. But \nthere is still a long way to go for the cause of democracy in Russia, \nand I hope these small electoral gains only embolden democracy's \ndefenders.\n  As we speak up for the rights of Russia's dissidents, we must do the \nsame for the rights of Russia's neighbors as well--neighbors such as \nthe country of Georgia. I visited Georgia in January, and I had a \nchance to travel to the so-called ``administrative boundary line'' with \nthe breakaway region of Abkhazia. On the other side of that boundary \nline is sovereign Georgian territory occupied by Russian troops, as it \nhas been since the 2008 invasion. When I was in Munich last month for \nan annual security conference, I heard several Russian officials \nspeaking from the same script, alleging acts of aggression by Georgian \nforces against Russian peacekeepers--the same kind of rhetoric we heard \nbefore the 2008 invasion. This should give us all pause. I know \nWashington has a lot of foreign policy challenges at the moment, but we \ncannot forget Georgia and the support it deserves amid a continuing \nthreat from its neighbor to the north.\n  A Russian government that better protects the human dignity of its \npeople would be more inclined to deal with its neighbors in peace and \nmutual respect. That is why we should all say a silent prayer and a \npublic word of support for Russia's courageous human rights activists, \nas they make their voices heard this Saturday. These brave men and \nwomen want the best for their country. They want a government that is \nnot only strong but just, peaceful, inclusive, and democratic. I urge \nRussia's leaders to recognize that peaceful champions of universal \nvalues are not a threat to Russia, and that groups such as this should \nnot face the kinds of violence, repression, and intimidation that \nRussian authorities have used against similar demonstrators in the \npast.

The managers on the part of the House will \nproceed.\n  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. President, the managers on the part of the \nHouse of Representatives are here present and ready to present the \nArticles of Impeachment, which have been preferred by the House of \nRepresentatives against G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., Judge of the United \nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n  The House adopted the following resolution which, with the permission \nof the President of the Senate, I will read:\n\n                              H. Res. 1165\n\n       Resolved, That Mr. Schiff, Ms. Zoe Lofgren of California, \n     Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Goodlatte, and Mr. Sensenbrenner \n     are appointed managers on the part of the House to conduct \n     the trial of the impeachment of G.

Res. 1031\n\n       Resolved, That G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., a judge of the \n     United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Louisiana, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and \n     that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to \n     the Senate:\n       Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in the name \n     of itself and all of the people of the United States of \n     America, against G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., a judge in the \n     United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Louisiana, in maintenance and support of its impeachment \n     against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n                               Article I\n\n       G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., while a Federal judge of the \n     United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Louisiana, engaged in a pattern of conduct that is \n     incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a \n     Federal judge, as follows:\n       Judge Porteous, while presiding as a United States district \n     judge in Lifemark Hospitals of Louisiana, Inc. v. Liljeberg \n     Enterprises, denied a motion to recuse himself from the case, \n     despite the fact that he had a corrupt financial relationship \n     with the law firm of Amato & Creely, P.C. which had entered \n     the case to represent Liljeberg. In denying the motion to \n     recuse, and in contravention of clear canons of judicial \n     ethics, Judge Porteous failed to disclose that beginning in \n     or about the late 1980s while he was a State court judge in \n     the 24th Judicial District Court in the State of Louisiana, \n     he engaged in a corrupt scheme with attorneys, Jacob Amato, \n     Jr., and Robert Creely, whereby Judge Porteous appointed \n     Amato's law partner as a ``curator'' in hundreds of cases and \n     thereafter requested and accepted from Amato & Creely a \n     portion of the curatorship fees which had been paid to the \n     firm. During the period of this scheme, the fees received by \n     Amato & Creely amounted to approximately $40,000, and the \n     amounts paid by Amato & Creely to Judge Porteous amounted to \n     approximately $20,000.\n       Judge Porteous also made intentionally misleading \n     statements at the recusal hearing intended to minimize the \n     extent of his personal relationship with the two attorneys. \n     In so doing, and in failing to disclose to Lifemark and its \n     counsel the true circumstances of his relationship with the \n     Amato & Creely law firm, Judge Porteous deprived the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals of critical information for its \n     review of a petition for a writ of mandamus, which sought to \n     overrule Judge Porteous's denial of the recusal motion. His \n     conduct deprived the parties and the public of the right to \n     the honest services of his office.\n       Judge Porteous also engaged in corrupt conduct after the \n     Lifemark v. Liljeberg bench trial, and while he had the case \n     under advisement, in that he solicited and accepted things of \n     value from both Amato and his law partner Creely, including a \n     payment of thousands of dollars in cash. Thereafter, and \n     without disclosing his corrupt relationship with the \n     attorneys of Amato & Creely PLC or his receipt from them of \n     cash and other things of value, Judge Porteous ruled in favor \n     of their client, Liljeberg.\n       By virtue of this corrupt relationship and his conduct as a \n     Federal judge, Judge Porteous brought his court into scandal \n     and disrepute, prejudiced public respect for, and confidence \n     in, the Federal judiciary, and demonstrated that he is unfit \n     for the office of Federal judge.\n       Wherefore, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is guilty of high \n     crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\n\n                               Article II\n\n       G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., engaged in a longstanding pattern \n     of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve \n     as a United States District Court Judge. That conduct \n     included the following: Beginning in or about the late 1980s \n     while he was a State court judge in the 24th Judicial \n     District Court in the State of Louisiana, and continuing \n     while he was a Federal judge in the United States District \n     Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Judge Porteous \n     engaged in a corrupt relationship with bail bondsman Louis M. \n     Marcotte, III, and his sister Lori Marcotte. As part of this \n     corrupt relationship, Judge Porteous solicited and accepted \n     numerous things of value, including meals, trips, home \n     repairs, and car repairs, for his personal use and benefit, \n     while at the same time taking official actions that \n     benefitted the Marcottes. These official actions by Judge \n     Porteous included, while on the State bench, setting, \n     reducing, and splitting bonds as requested by the Marcottes, \n     and improperly setting aside or expunging felony convictions \n     for two Marcotte employees (in one case after Judge Porteous \n     had been confirmed by the Senate but before being sworn in as \n     a Federal judge). In addition, both while on the State bench \n     and on the Federal bench, Judge Porteous used the power and \n     prestige of his office to assist the Marcottes in forming \n     relationships with State judicial officers and individuals \n     important to the Marcottes' business. As Judge Porteous well \n     knew and understood, Louis Marcotte also made false \n     statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in an \n     effort to assist Judge Porteous in being appointed to the \n     Federal bench.\n       Accordingly, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., has engaged in \n     conduct so utterly lacking in honesty and integrity that he \n     is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, is unfit to hold \n     the office of Federal judge, and should be removed from \n     office.\n\n                              Article III\n\n       Beginning in or about March 2001 and continuing through \n     about July 2004, while a Federal judge in the United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, G. \n     Thomas Porteous, Jr., engaged in a pattern of conduct \n     inconsistent with the trust and confidence placed in him as a \n     Federal judge by knowingly and intentionally making material \n     false statements and representations under penalty of perjury \n     related to his personal bankruptcy filing and by repeatedly \n     violating a court order in his bankruptcy case. Judge \n     Porteous did so by--\n       (1) using a false name and a post office box address to \n     conceal his identity as the debtor in the case;\n       (2) concealing assets;\n       (3) concealing preferential payments to certain creditors;\n       (4) concealing gambling losses and other gambling debts; \n     and\n       (5) incurring new debts while the case was pending, in \n     violation of the bankruptcy court's order.\n       In doing so, Judge Porteous brought his court into scandal \n     and disrepute, prejudiced public respect for and confidence \n     in the Federal judiciary, and demonstrated that he is unfit \n     for the office of Federal judge.\n       Wherefore, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is guilty of high \n     crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\n                               Article IV\n\n       In 1994, in connection with his nomination to be a judge of \n     the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Louisiana, G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., knowingly made material \n     false statements about his past to both the United States \n     Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to \n     obtain the office of United States District Court Judge. \n     These false statements included the following:\n       (1) On his Supplemental SF-86, Judge Porteous was asked if \n     there was anything in his personal life that could be used by \n     someone to coerce or blackmail him, or if there was anything \n     in his life that could cause an embarrassment to Judge \n     Porteous or the President if publicly known. Judge Porteous \n     answered ``no'' to this question and signed the form under \n     the warning that a false statement was punishable by law.\n       (2) During his background check, Judge Porteous falsely \n     told the Federal Bureau of Investigation on two separate \n     occasions that he was not concealing any activity or conduct \n     that could be used to influence, pressure, coerce, or \n     compromise him in any way or that would impact negatively on \n     his character, reputation, judgment, or discretion.\n       (3) On the Senate Judiciary Committee's ``Questionnaire for \n     Judicial Nominees'', Judge Porteous was asked whether any \n     unfavorable information existed that could affect his \n     nomination. Judge Porteous answered that, to the best of his \n     knowledge, he did ``not know of any unfavorable information \n     that may affect [his] nomination''. Judge Porteous signed \n     that questionnaire by swearing that ``the information \n     provided in this statement is, to the best of my knowledge, \n     true and accurate''.\n       However, in truth and in fact, as Judge Porteous then well \n     knew, each of these answers was materially false because \n     Judge Porteous had engaged in a corrupt relationship with the \n     law firm Amato & Creely, whereby Judge Porteous appointed \n     Creely as a ``curator'' in hundreds of cases and thereafter \n     requested and accepted from Amato & Creely a portion of the \n     curatorship fees which had been paid to the firm and also had \n     engaged in a corrupt relationship with Louis and Lori \n     Marcotte, whereby Judge Porteous solicited and accepted \n     numerous things of value, including meals, trips, home \n     repairs, and car repairs, for his personal use and benefit, \n     while at the same time taking official actions that \n     benefitted the Marcottes. As Judge Porteous well knew and \n     understood, Louis Marcotte also made false statements to the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation in an effort to assist Judge \n     Porteous in being appointed to the Federal bench. Judge \n     Porteous's failure to disclose these corrupt relationships \n     deprived the United States Senate and the public of \n     information that would have had a material impact on his \n     confirmation.\n       Wherefore, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is guilty of high \n     crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\n                                                     Nancy Pelosi,\n                          Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives by protestation, saving \nto themselves the liberty of exhibiting at any time hereafter any \nfurther articles of accusation or impeachment against the said G. \nThomas Porteous, Jr., Judge of the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Louisiana, and also of replying to his answers \nwhich he shall make unto the articles preferred against him, and of \noffering proof to the same and every part thereof, and to all and every \nother article of accusation or impeachment which shall be exhibited by \nthem as the case shall require, do demand that the said G.

The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller will be back on the \nfloor shortly. We are on the FAA reauthorization bill. This is the \nfourth day in the Senate that we have been trying to pass the FAA \nreauthorization bill. We have accepted many amendments. We have had \nmany amendments offered that have nothing at all to do with this \nlegislation. I understand that. I think we voted on three or four of \nthem last night. But the process of trying to get something through the \nSenate these days is slow and difficult. It is a little like watching \npaint dry to see activity on the floor of the Senate. We are trying \nvery hard to do this.\n  This is not and should not be a controversial bill. Every American \nwho gets on a commercial airplane in this country has a stake in this \nbill. This bill includes modernization of the air traffic control \nsystem which will allow people to fly in the skies more safely, more \ndirect routes, save energy, and save pollution.\n  Modernization of the air traffic control system, to go from ground-\nbased radar to a GPS navigation system--we should have done that a \nwhile ago. We have not. We need to catch up with the Europeans and \nothers. We need to move with some dispatch.\n  This bill should have been done long ago, but it has been extended 11 \ntimes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I serve on the Commerce Committee with \nSenator Dorgan. I thank him for his leadership.\n  During the time we waited and dithered and didn't get this done--not \nyou but others--have other countries modernized their air traffic \ncontrol systems?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Other countries are making good progress on this, going \nto a GPS system. GPS is not a new technology, as many of us know. You \nsee many vehicles, automobiles around town using a GPS to navigate. You \nhave people using GPS on their cell phones. But on a jet airliner \nflying across the country, hauling a couple of hundred people behind \nthe cockpit, they are using World War II technology, ground-based radar \nfor navigation, not GPS, which is the modernization approach.\n  This is called NextGen, modernizing the air traffic control system. \nEurope is moving on it, other parts of the world are moving on it, and \nwe need to move. This is about safety. It is about modernizing the \nsystem. But more than that, it is about investing in the infrastructure \nfor aviation in the country, building the airports and the runways. It \nis about the issue of the passenger bill of rights, which is in this \nbill, saying to the airlines: Here are the new rules. You can't have \nsomebody in an airplane 6 or 7 hours sitting on a runway someplace; 3 \nhours and then you have to bring them back to the gate. I know some do \nnot like that, but that is the passenger bill of rights, giving \npassengers some rights as well.\n  I have spoken at length about this legislation, as has Senator \nRockefeller. I guess our hope would be that, if there are those who \nhave additional amendments and wish to debate them, they might come to \nthe floor or engage in the discussion on the floor so we can get this \npiece of legislation passed. It makes no sense for us to continue to \ntalk and to continue to wait and not pass legislation when we have so \nmuch ahead of us to do.\n\n\n                           Cobell Settlement\n\n  I want to mention a couple of other issues we need to address while I \nam waiting. One is the proposed settlement of the Cobell v. Salazar \nlitigation. The parties to the Cobell settlement asked Congress to pass \nlegislation approving the settlement by April 16th. It needs to be done \nby April 16th or the parties may return to litigation.\n  Let me tell you what the Cobell settlement is. It is about American \nIndians, the people who were here first in this country, the first \nAmericans. American Indians ceded certain property as a result of \ntreaties and other agreements, and reserved lands for their \ncommunities. The federal government promised to manage these \nreservations and hold the lands in trust. Well, over the last century, \nIndians watched as timber companies would come in and produce timber \nfrom those lands, mineral companies would come in and produce minerals, \nand drill for oil on those lands. All the while, the government was \nmanaging these lands and holding monies earned from that land in trust \nfor the Indians.\n  Then the Indians asked the question: What has happened to our money? \nWe see all these timber, grazing, and mineral activities going on and \nwe are supposed to get money from these lands--that the government is \nholding in trust--but the money never quite shows up.\n  The Cobell case is named after a remarkable woman, Elouise Cobell, \nfrom Montana. She is an American Indian, a member of the Blackfeet \nNation, and a banker. She filed a lawsuit against the United States and \nshe asked for one thing. She said to the Federal government: Give me an \naccounting of the monies that you collected from my lands, my lands \nthat you held and managed in trust for me. And do the same for all \nother Native Americans.\n  The fact is, nobody knew how much money was owed her. When they took \na look at the records that the Federal government had, and held for \nIndian property and income, it was shameful.\n  For example, Mary Fish, an Oklahoma Indian, lived on her land in a \nvery small, humble house, and she lived next to an oil well pump that \nwas constantly pumping oil off of her land. She received just a \npittance of money from that oil. Where did the money go? Who would \naccount for that money? Why is it that Mary lived in such a humble \nmanner, in a very small home, when on her land, an oil well was \nproducing oil. Why is it that the money being managed by the Federal \nGovernment somehow never got to Mary?\n  When the lawsuit was filed by Elouise Cobell, the judges in the \nFederal courts asked: Where are the trust records for all these timber, \ngrazing, and mineral activities?\n  Here is what they found: the Federal Government could not produce the \nrecords necessary for an accounting. For example, there were 162 boxes \nof case-related documents that were shredded after the trial began--a \nprocedure that the U.S. Justice Department lawyers withheld from the \ncourt for 3 months. Other records were in Louisiana, and in a rat-\ninfested warehouse in New Mexico.\n\n  Still more records were in North Dakota, and scattered in sheds \nacross the country. I have photographs of what they saw when they \nopened up the warehouses in North Dakota. You can see piles of worn and \ndamaged boxes of what were supposed to have been records. And, this is \nhow the Federal Government cared for the information that was going to \ntell American Indians how their trust lands were used. It is \nunbelievable.\n  After years of litigation, the Parties in the Cobell case have \nreached a $3.4 billion settlement. The settlement needs to be approved \nby Congress, and the parties have an April 16th deadline for Congress \nto approve the settlement. I have mentioned this on the floor of the \nSenate before. This Congress has a responsibility to proceed by the \nApril 16th deadline to avoid further, unnecessary litigation.\n  The President, the Secretary of Interior--whom I commend, by the way, \nwho negotiated this settlement--have asked us to get this done, and we \nhave a responsibility to get this done.\n\n\n                           Disability Claims\n\n  I also have another point which we will get to in a short period of \ntime on appropriations. I will mention those Americans who have filed \ndisability claims under Social Security and are now waiting over 16 \nmonths to have the Federal Government determine whether their claims \nare valid, waiting 490 days after a claim is filed. That is pretty \nunbelievable to me. This Congress has included about $2.5 billion of \nadditional funding for the Social Security Administration in the last 4 \nto 5 years. The expectation was that we would reduce the giant backlog \nthat existed of cases, disability claims filed by people who have paid \nfor this insurance.\n  American people pay for disability insurance out of their paycheck \nunder\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nOASDI. When someone who is disabled files a claim in this country, on \naverage it takes 491 days to process it. That, after we have given more \nthan $2.5 billion in increased funding to the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  Precious little progress has been made. They say it used to be 514 \ndays, now it is 491 days. That is not much progress as far as I am \nconcerned if you are disabled and you are expecting to file a claim and \nhave a claim processed in a reasonable period of time.\n  In my State there are 2,800 claims that are awaiting action. The \nnumber of administrative law judges--we have two vacancies now out of \nfive. One gave his notice almost a year ago and has not been replaced.\n  None of this makes any sense to me. Congress should expect, of an \nagency like this, especially when you get $2.5 billion in extra funding \nover five years, to understand why has no progress been made. I sent a \nletter to the head of Social Security asking what happened to the $2.5 \nbillion. On the appropriations side, I want some understanding of what \nhappened to that money and why significant progress has not been made \nin these disability claims that resulted from the funding given the \nadministration by the Congress.\n  Let me withhold for a moment and yield the floor so my colleague can \ntake the floor with an agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n                           Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. As in executive session I ask unanimous consent that \ntoday at 3 p.m. the Senate proceed to executive session to consider \nCalendar No. 653, the nomination of O. Rogeriee Thompson to be a U.S. \ncircuit judge for the First Circuit, and there be up to 30 minutes of \ndebate with respect to the nomination with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Whitehouse and Sessions or their designees; \nwith Senator Reed of Rhode Island controlling up to 5 minutes; that at \n3:30 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination; \nthat upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid on the table and any statements relating to the nomination be \nprinted in the Record as if read, the President be immediately notified \nof the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding for \nthat unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, In the remaining couple of minutes, let me \nsay it is my hope and the hope of Senators Rockefeller and Hutchison \nthat we will be able to make progress and complete the FAA \nreauthorization bill. This is the fourth day. We have seen so many \ninterminable delays in the Senate. Let's not delay legislation that has \nbipartisan support, that deals with the issue of air safety in this \ncountry, and has so many important provisions. Let's not at this point \ndecide to delay this, of all pieces of legislation, something that \nshould have been done long ago and has had 11 extensions instead of a \nreauthorization bill, when we finally have a bipartisan reauthorization \nbill brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  It is my hope if we are going to get cooperation on anything, at \nleast we could expect it on this piece of legislation. My hope would be \nin the half-hour debate--I guess 1-hour debate and subsequent vote on \nthe judge, we might make some progress in seeing whether we could get \ncooperation to be able to complete this bill today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold the \nrequest?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will withhold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1649-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1649-S1652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF O. ROGERIEE THOMPSON TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                         FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will go to executive session. The clerk will report the \nnomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of O. Rogeriee Thompson, of \nRhode Island, to be United States Circuit Judge for the First Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate Justice Thompson on what \nshould be her confirmation by the Senate today as a judge on the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. President Obama has made \nanother outstanding judicial nomination. The Senators from Rhode Island \nhave worked tirelessly to bring this matter to conclusion with a Senate \nvote since her nomination was reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee 2 months ago.\n  It has been 2 weeks since the Senate has acted on any of the 18 \njudicial nominations approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee that \nare being stalled by Republican obstruction on the Senate Executive \nCalendar. It has been almost 4 months since I began publicly urging the \nSenate Republican leadership to abandon its strategy of obstruction and \ndelay of the President's judicial nominees. Regrettably, their \npractices continue. Even though Justice Thompson is a well-respected \njudge who has more than two decades of experience on her State's \ncourts, and whose nomination was reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee without a single dissenting vote, her nomination has been \nstuck on the Senate Executive Calendar for nearly 2 months. Justice \nThompson's nomination is not the only one being stalled despite having \nbeen reported without opposition by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nThere are a dozen such nominations ready for consideration and \nconfirmation that have been stalled without reason or explanation. They \ncould and should all be considered and confirmed without further delay.\n  In addition there are another half dozen judicial nominees awaiting \nfinal consideration by the Senate that were reported with just a \nsingle, or a few, negative votes. Those should be debated and voted \nupon without more delay. If Republicans would enter into time \nagreements, they would be considered. We should not have to go through \nanother filibuster and cloture vote like that on Judge Barbara Keenan \nof Virginia, whose nomination was stalled for 4 months and then \napproved 99 to 0. There was no reason for that delay. Yet it amounted \nto a Republican filibuster until it was finally ended 2 weeks ago by \nthe majority leader and that Senate vote.\n  Just yesterday, more than a dozen Senators spoke about the delays and \nobstruction of the President's nominees. Many Senators spoke about the \nrecent Republican filibuster of Judge Barbara Keenan. The Senator from \nPennsylvania spoke about the nominee stalled since December to fill a \nPennsylvania vacancy on the Third Circuit. The Senators from North \nCarolina and Maryland noted that two well-qualified nominees to \nvacancies on the Fourth Circuit remain stalled. And the Senator from \nRhode Island, a hardworking member of the Judiciary Committee, spoke of \nthe nomination on which we are finally being allowed to vote today, \nthat of Justice Rogeriee Thompson.\n  When the Senate confirms Justice Thompson, we will be confirming the \nfirst African American to serve on the First Circuit, and only the \nsecond woman. She is a trailblazer and an extraordinary woman. She will \nbe an outstanding Federal judge.\n  The Judiciary Committee has favorably reported 35 of President \nObama's Federal circuit and district court nominees to the Senate for \nfinal consideration and confirmation. Only 17 of these have been \nconfirmed. Justice Thompson's nomination will be the 18th. There are \nanother five judicial nominations set to be reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee this week, bringing the total awaiting final action by the \nSenate to 22.\n  Despite skyrocketing vacancies--now totaling over 100, more than 30 \nof which are ``judicial emergencies''--we are far behind the pace for \nconsidering nominations set by the Democratic majority during President \nBush's first 2 years in office. By this date during President Bush's \nfirst term, the Senate had confirmed 41 Federal circuit and district \ncourt nominations and there was only a single judicial nomination \npending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. Only a single nomination \nwas\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\npending. In stark contrast, to date the Senate has confirmed just 17 of \nPresident Obama's district and circuit court nominees, with an \nembarrassing backlog of 18 judicial nominations on the calendar \nawaiting Senate action. We are currently on pace to confirm fewer than \n30 Federal circuit and district court nominees during this Congress, \nwhich would easily be the lowest in memory. We have to do far more to \naddress this growing crisis of unfilled judicial vacancies.\n  The Republican strategy to stall, obstruct, and delay the Senate from \nconsidering President Obama's nominations is working, at great cost to \nthe American people. Their failure to do their constitutional duty of \nconsidering the President's nominations is encumbering judges across \nthe country with overloaded dockets and preventing ordinary Americans \nfrom seeking justice in our overburdened Federal courts. This is wrong. \nWe owe it to the American people to do better.\n  The refusal by Republicans to make progress considering judicial \nnominations is hard to understand given the work President Obama has \ndone to reach across the aisle to work with Republican Senators in \nmaking judicial nominations. Unlike the often partisan and divisive \npicks of his predecessor, President Obama deserves praise for working \nclosely with home State Senators, whether Democratic or Republican, to \nidentify and select well-qualified nominees to fill vacancies on the \nFederal bench. Yet Senate Republicans delay and obstruct even nominees \nchosen after consultation with Republican home State Senators.\n  Senate Republicans unsuccessfully filibustered the nomination of \nJudge David Hamilton of Indiana to the Seventh Circuit, despite support \nfor his nomination from the senior Republican in the Senate, Dick Lugar \nof Indiana. Republicans delayed for months Senate consideration of \nJudge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit despite the \nendorsement of both her Republican home State Senators. The nomination \nof Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit, endorsed by home \nState Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and reported by the committee \nwith bipartisan support, has remained stalled on the calendar since \nlast year. The nominations of Judge James A. Wynn and Albert Diaz of \nNorth Carolina to the Fourth Circuit both have Senator Burr's strong \nsupport and yet have remained on the calendar for more than 6 weeks. \nThe list goes on.\n  President Obama has worked closely with home State Republicans \nSenators, but Senate Republicans have still chosen to treat his \nnominees badly. Indeed, the demand for consultation with home State \nSenators was the purported basis for the threat from Senate Republicans \nto filibuster President Obama's judicial nominations before he had made \na single one. They wrote in their March 2, 2009, letter to the \nPresident: ``[I]f we are not consulted on, and approve of, a nominee \nfrom our states, the Republican Conference will be unable to support \nmoving forward on that nominee.'' Yet despite the fact that they were \nconsulted and that Senator Lugar did approve, Senate Republicans \ninsisted on filibustering Judge Hamilton's nomination. Despite \nconsultation, there are still a dozen and one-half judicial nominations \nstalled on the Executive Calendar.\n  After Republican Senators pocket-filibustered more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominations, denying them even hearings \nand votes in committee and creating a vacancy crisis on the Federal \nbench, Democrats did not do the same to President Bush's nominees. We \ntreated them much more fairly. We worked hard through 2001, even after \n9/11 and the anthrax attacks, holding hearings even during Senate \nrecess periods, in order to swiftly consider President Bush's nominees. \nThat is why by this date in 2002 the Senate had confirmed 41 judicial \nnominees. By contrast the confirmation of Justice Thompson will be only \nthe 18th Federal circuit or district court judge nominated by President \nObama to be confirmed. At this date in March 2002 there was a single \njudicial nominee awaiting Senate consideration. By contrast, today \nthere are 18 stacked up because Senate Republicans refuse to consent to \ntheir consideration.\n  Yet when Democrats refused to rubberstamp a handful of the most \nextreme, ideological, and divisive of President Bush's nominees--not \nthe 60 nominations of President Clinton's that Senate Republicans \npocket-filibustered, or the 18 we have stalled on the calendar right \nnow--Republican Senators changed their tune, disavowed any \nresponsibility for their obstruction of President Clinton's nominees, \nand contended that filibusters of judicial nominations were \n``unconstitutional'' and ``offensive.'' The Republican leadership of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee broke virtually every precedent and rule \nwe had in order to force nominees through the committee, and the \nRepublican leadership of the Senate sought to activate the ``nuclear \noption'' to break Senate rules and precedent in order to ram through \neach and every nominee.\n  Unfortunately, those same Republican Senators that once threatened to \nblow up the Senate unless every nominee received an up-or-down vote are \nnow engaged in another attempt to abuse the rules of the Senate and \nundermine the democratic process. Republican Senators who just a few \nyears ago insisted that ``elections have consequences'' have now made \nthe use of filibusters, holds, and excessive procedural delays the new \nnormal in the Senate in order to thwart our ability to make progress \naddressing issues that affect all Americans. Those who just a short \ntime ago said that a majority vote is all that should be needed to \nconfirm a nomination, and that filibusters of nominations are \nunconstitutional, have reversed themselves and now employ every \ndelaying tactic they can, imposing on the Senate a requirement to find \n60 Senators to overcome a filibuster on issue after issue.\n  A bipartisan group of Senators joined together in 2005 to end that \nlast attempt by Republican leadership to abuse the rules of the Senate \nby joining in a bipartisan memorandum of understanding to head off the \n``nuclear option'' that the Republican Senate leadership was intent on \nactivating. Those same Republican Senators who agreed in that \nmemorandum of understanding that nominees should only be filibustered \nunder ``extraordinary circumstances,'' have abandoned all that they \nsaid they stood for by engaging in an effort to stall or prevent an up-\nor-down vote on nomination after nomination.\n  We saw that with their attempt to filibuster the nomination of Judge \nHamilton. Just 2 weeks ago a Republican filibuster of Justice Barbara \nKeenan of Virginia to be a Fourth Circuit judge resulted from Senate \nRepublicans refusing to agree to debate and vote on that nomination. \nThe majority leader was required to proceed through a time-consuming \nprocedure to end the obstruction. The votes to end debate and on her \nconfirmation were both 99 to 0. That nomination had been reported in \nOctober. So after more than 4 months of stalling, there was no \njustification, explanation, or basis for the delay. That is wrong. That \nwas the 17th filibuster of President Obama's nominations. And that does \nnot include the many other nominees who were delayed or who are being \ndenied up-or-down votes by Senate Republicans refusing to agree to time \nagreements to consider even noncontroversial nominees.\n  So why are Republicans so insistent on reversing themselves and \napplying new standards to halt our progress filling vacancies on the \nFederal courts? Why have they insisted on departing so radically from \nthe standards set by the Democratic majority during the first two years \nof the Bush Administration when we confirmed 100 of President Bush's \njudicial nominations in 17 months? Why have they rejected President \nObama's efforts to reach across the aisle and nominate well-qualified \nmainstream nominees? Why are they intent on constructing procedural \nhurdles to delay and deny up-or-down votes to nominee after nominee?\n  The American people should see this for what it is: More of the \npartisan, narrow, ideological tactics that Senate Republicans have been \nengaging in for decades as they try to pack the courts with \nultraconservative judges. What is at stake for the American people are \ntheir rights, their access to the courts, and their ability to seek \nredress for wrongdoing.\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\n  For all the talk we heard about ``judicial modesty'' and ``judicial \nrestraint'' from the nominees of President Bush at their confirmation \nhearings, we have seen Federal courts--most notably the Supreme Court--\nthese last 5 years that has been anything but modest and restrained. \nConservative activist judges are time and time again substituting their \npersonal beliefs to the law and the judgment of elected officials.\n  That is what we saw in the recent decision by a narrow five-justice \nmajority of the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission, a decision that gutted bipartisan laws enacted to protect \nthe ability of individual Americans to participate in elections and not \nhave their voices drowned out by corporations. Regrettably, that \ndecision is only the latest example of the willingness of a narrow \nmajority of the Supreme Court to render decisions from the bench to \nsuit their own agenda.\n  The Citizens United decision reinforces the profound concern I have \nhad about the real-world consequences of recent court decisions for \nhardworking Americans. On issues like equal pay for equal work; the \npower of Congress under the 14th and 15th amendments to pass civil \nrights laws like the Voting Rights Act; and issues thought to be long \nsettled like the meaning of Brown v. Board of Education, the current \nconservative majority on the Supreme Court seems determined to accrue \nto itself the powers given by the Constitution to Congress and to \nrewrite long-established precedents. The lower courts must follow suit. \nMake no mistake, this is the product of years of work by Republicans \ncatering to the far right to remake the courts and reshape the law from \nthe bench.\n  Republican Senators who demanded up-or-down votes for even the most \nextreme and ideological nominees of a Republican President now balk at \nthe consideration of well-qualified, mainstream nominees of a \nDemocratic President. The many years Democratic Senators worked to be \nfairer to President Bush's nominees than the Republican majority had \nbeen to President Clinton's nominees have been cast aside and forgotten \nby the Republican minority.\n  Justice Thompson's nomination is noncontroversial and should easily \nbe confirmed. I urge the Senate also to take responsible action to \nconsider the other 17 judicial nominations still awaiting a vote by the \nSenate. The Senate can more than double the total number of judicial \nnominations it has confirmed by considering not only Justice Thompson's \nnomination but the other judicial nominees on the calendar. We should \ndo that now, without more delay, without additional obstruction, to put \nus back on track. Senators should work together to do our jobs for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that time be charged equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, shortly, we will have the honor and \nprivilege, myself and Senator Whitehouse, to join in supporting and \nconfirming the nomination of Justice Rogeriee Thompson, who will be \nconfirmed today to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Justice Thompson is an eminent member of our Rhode Island courts. She \nhas been an Associate Justice of the Rhode Island Superior Court since \n1997. She is a path breaker in many respects in terms of her talent, \nbut also because she is the first woman of African-American descent to \nserve on the Rhode Island Superior Court. She will be the first African \nAmerican to serve on the First Circuit Court of Appeals and only the \nsecond woman.\n  She has achieved these remarkable results because of her intellect, \nher character, her integrity, and her deep commitment to fairness and \nto justice. She is a remarkable woman. We are pleased and delighted \nthat her nomination has been forwarded to us by the President. He has \nmade a wise choice. Today, we will have the opportunity to consider the \nnomination and confirm her. She will do a remarkable job on the First \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Originally, Justice Thompson was born in South Carolina, but she came \nto Rhode Island to attend Brown University. She earned her J.D. from \nthe Boston University School of Law and began her career as a staff \nattorney at Rhode Island Legal Services.\n  So her progression to the First Circuit is one that has carried her a \nlong way. I think it has included, very importantly, a strong \ncommitment not just to the most fortunate in our country, but also to \nthose who desperately need help and assistance.\n  She will bring that sense of fairness and decency to the First \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nworthy woman and her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the Senate is considering the \nnomination of O. Rogeriee Thompson to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the First Circuit. I join my distinguished senior \ncolleague, Senator Jack Reed, in applauding President Obama's selection \nof this very talented nominee. Judge Thompson's nomination has been an \nuncontroversial one and for good reason: She is a dedicated public \nservant, a highly experienced and respected judge, and a credit to our \nhome State of Rhode Island. I congratulate Judge Thompson on coming to \nthis point in the process. I look forward to an uneventful confirmation \nvote in the next few moments.\n  I express to my colleagues my thorough confidence that she will have \na distinguished career as a U.S. circuit court of appeals judge.\n  I also thank some of my colleagues. I am grateful to majority leader \nHarry Reid, to our chairman, Patrick Leahy, of the Judiciary Committee, \nand to Senators on the other side of the aisle, in particular Judiciary \nCommittee Ranking Member Sessions, for clearing the path for us to vote \non Judge Thompson's nomination today. I also am grateful that my senior \nSenator, Jack Reed, gave me the opportunity to assist him in \nidentifying the best possible nominee to recommend to President Obama \nto serve on the first circuit. As my colleagues know, it has been a \ngreat honor to serve with Senator Reed since coming to the Senate. This \nexperience with him was another great privilege for which I am deeply \ngrateful.\n  After the Senate's action today, after a lifetime of achievement, \nJudge Thompson will make history as the first African American and only \nthe second woman to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First \nCircuit. This will not be the first barrier broken by Judge Thompson, \nas she was the first African-American woman on each of the Rhode Island \ncourts on which she has served. These were great moments in the history \nof our State. Her arrival will be a wonderful addition in the history \nof the first circuit. Judge Thompson has given our State 21 years of \ndistinguished judicial service, first as an associate judge on the \nRhode Island district court and subsequently as an associate justice on \nthe Rhode Island superior court.\n  Judge Thompson has long scrupulously adhered to the proper role of a \njudge, respecting the role of the legislature as the voice of the \npeople, deciding cases based on the law and the facts, not prejudging \nany case but listening to every party before her, respecting precedent \nand limiting herself to the issues properly before the court. Her \ncourtroom deservedly has come to be known as a place in which every \nparty can expect a fair hearing. I know she will earn the same \nreputation for fairness and excellence as a judge on the first circuit.\n  I should add that Judge Thompson has also made great contributions to \nour home State of Rhode Island outside of the courtroom. She has \nchaired or been a member of important court committees that have \nimproved the quality of justice in our State. She has given back to her \nalma mater, Brown University, by serving as a trustee of that great \nuniversity. She also has provided mentoring to innumerable students, \ngiven her time to countless law\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nschool programs, and served on the boards of valuable and important \nnonprofit groups such as the Rhode Island Children's Crusade for Higher \nEducation, a board on which I was privileged to serve with Judge \nThompson. Her willingness to give back to our Rhode Island community is \ncharacteristic of her entire family. Judge Thompson's husband, Bill \nClifton, is a judge on the Rhode Island district court. Her brother-in-\nlaw, Bill's brother, Edward Clifton, is a judge on the Rhode Island \nsuperior court. It is a very judicial family.\n  I had the occasion to appear before Judge Clifton. He was the first \njudge when we began our Rhode Island drug court, when I was attorney \ngeneral. I have had firsthand experience of his qualities as well. We \nin Rhode Island are very fortunate to be blessed by the service and \nexcellence of this family. I am sure this is a very proud day for them \nall. I extend my best wishes and my congratulations.\n  I anticipate we will have a strong vote in favor of Judge Thompson. \nShe passed without incident or opposition through the review of the \nJudiciary Committee. There were no questions raised about her at her \nhearing. The voice vote in her favor was unanimous. The track record to \ndate is an indication of a likely resounding confirmation. I might add, \nif that happens, that is yet another evidence of how talented she is \nand how well she deserves this seat on the Court of Appeals for the \nFirst Circuit. It is an important circuit for our State. It is a very \ndistinguished court. It has had very distinguished Rhode Islanders sit \non it in the past. A friend of Senator Jack Reed's and mine, the \nhonorable Bruce Selya, has served on that court with immense \ndistinction for many years. So there is an important Rhode Island \ntradition on the first circuit.\n  I can assure all of my colleagues in the Senate that as a justice of \nthis court, O. Rogeriee Thompson will discharge all of her duties with \nthe greatest of distinction.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be divided between the minority and majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination of Judge Thompson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof O. Rogeriee Thompson, of Rhode Island, to be United States Circuit \nJudge for the First Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want people to understand that the \nFederal aviation reauthorization process is moving slowly but steadily. \nWe take several steps forward but none backward. Yesterday we approved \n14 amendments. There was a tremendous amount of work done by the staff \nto work those out. We have another large group we hope to be able to do \nthis afternoon. So large chunks of the bill are actually getting done. \nThen, we have a number of controversial amendments, or potentially \ncontroversial, and we are in the process of getting those locked down \nso the Presiding Officer can pronounce a unanimous consent agreement \nwith 2 minutes equally divided.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague and \nchairman of the committee and I are working very hard to clear further \namendments as well as get a vote on the Sessions amendment, with a \nPryor amendment connected to that, and a McCain amendment, so that we \ncan try to finish this bill by tomorrow. So that is what we are working \non. We are of the same mind on that. I hope very much that we will be \nable to get the amendments cleared that are very important. I would ask \nall of our colleagues to work with us to expedite matters so that we \ncan finish this bill early tomorrow.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman as well for working \nwith us on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I think the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee wishes to speak, but he is waiting for \nsomething, so I will proceed.\n  This Federal aviation bill is enormous in scope, but we are doing it \nin little pieces and with little amendments, so sometimes it is hard. \nIt has seven different titles in it. One of them has to do with \ncommunity air service to rural, underserved areas, which is very \nimportant in my State and in the Presiding Officer's State--really all \nof our States. Even California and New York have many very rural areas \nwhere they need air service.\n  I spent 10 years chairing the Aviation Subcommittee, and I enjoyed it \nenormously. I now chair the full committee, which I enjoy enormously. \nBut one focus throughout has been trying to protect small and rural \ncommunities and give them air service. They travel. If the local \nairport promotes itself, as a product must--it is not just a place \npeople go to; they have to announce themselves to the public and say: \nWe can take you here, we can take you there, while others of us try to \nget flights in. It is tremendously important, so they are worth \nfighting for, and we do that.\n  Large and urban States sometimes question that, but if they look in \ntheir hearts, they have a lot of the same requirements themselves. It \nis really about equality, and it is about the economy, and it is about \nfairness. What is the difference between somebody from a city and \nsomebody from a smaller community? They both do business. One may not \nhave a big jet and therefore may require a smaller airplane, a commuter \nairplane to get to\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\nwhere he or she wishes to go, but it is important that they be able to \nget there. So it is vital to our economy.\n  Every single business considers, along with the school system, the \nso-called quality of life, the crime rate, all of this, they consider \nair service when they are deciding whether to locate or to expand in a \nparticular State. And so for that, we have this wonderful program \ncalled the Essential Air Service--the EAS. It is a program which has \nproved vital to communities across this country. It has allowed them to \nkeep air service they might not otherwise be able to keep, and \nliterally so. It doesn't bail them out to do that. I mean, it doesn't \npay the cost of that, but it helps them and they use it.\n\n  The first option of air carriers, naturally, but regrettably, as far \nas a small community is concerned--if they are in distress, as our \nairlines, our legacy airlines in particular, have been in recent \nyears--is they go to the end of the food chain to make their first \ncuts, and that is always the small communities--the small airports and \nthe small centers. That doesn't make them less important.\n  Every time I think about that, I think about the time I ran for \nGovernor and I was defeated. I became president of a wonderful small \nprivate college which had a grass airfield. They didn't get any Federal \nhelp, because you can't do that with grass. But I always remember there \nwas a little yellow farmhouse when I drove out there, and it is still \nthe same little yellow farmhouse today. But if you go inside it has a \nworldwide educational CD, video. It is the highest possible technology \ncompany you can imagine. It just doesn't happen to want to build a big \nbuilding. It is happy in this little yellow farmhouse. You don't have \nto have tall skyscrapers to do business. So the small community air \nservice development program has helped people.\n  My bill takes several important steps toward Kay Bailey Hutchison's \nbill. We worked side by side--and I can't say this enough--every step \nof the way. It is sort of a perfect combination of a ranking member and \nchairman. We do several things here: We increase the authorized funding \nfor the Essential Air Service to $175 million. That is an increase of \n$48 million. That is not a whole lot of money, but on a nationwide \nbasis that does a lot. That keeps many small airfields open and allows \nthem to have control towers and run air service.\n  We permit the Federal Aviation Administration to incorporate \nfinancial incentives into contracts with the Essential Air Service \ncarriers to encourage better service. You have to keep your eye on \nthem. It is not just the question that Senator Dorgan has talked about; \nthat is, what is the name on the airplane. Sometimes there are two \nnames and you don't know which one you are riding on--is it United or \nColgan or what--and you need to know that. We correct that elsewhere, \nin another title in our bill.\n  We also authorize the Federal Aviation Administration to negotiate \nlonger term Essential Air Service contracts. That makes sense because \nthat gives a sense of stability and predictability to an airfield--to a \nsmall airfield--and to the public which is interested in it.\n  We authorize the development of financial incentives for carriers to \nimprove their service, as I indicated. It is quite amazing, the whole \nstructure of what people get paid to fly, from these little carriers to \ncommuter airlines. I am not going to give numbers to their salaries, \nbecause you would be shocked at what they get paid--a lot less than \nteachers. But they accept that because the seniority system says if you \nhave flown a long time, you get paid a lot. And they have accepted that \nbecause people who know how to fly love to fly, and they want to fly. \nBut you have to keep your eye always on the quality of service.\n  Maintenance is a very high order, because that is the kind of thing \nwhich could be neglected and people might not notice. It is like \nkeeping up your house. You can't defer maintenance or you pay a \nterrible price. In the case of airlines, the price is very obvious.\n  We also authorize the Airport Improvement Program to convert \nEssential Air Service; that is, small airports, into general aviation \nairports. That turns out to be very convenient. There are thousands of \ngeneral aviation--big jets, little jets, and King Airs--all over this \ncountry, and they fly everywhere, and we want them to. So we try to \nencourage the EAS to do well by them.\n  We have increasing funding for contract towers. That is important. \nYou have to have a tower. I had a 9:30 appointment this morning, and \nfrom not a large airport. Before taking off, there was fog, so they \ncouldn't take off. I assume they could see the fog themselves. But if \nthey were in doubt, the air traffic controller said: You aren't taking \noff. That is called a service to them; less to me but to them, and that \nis what counts.\n  In closing, I will mention something very important to West Virginia \nand to other States. Our global economy is growing and we are much more \ninterconnected. It becomes very important now, for example, that \ncommuter services don't just take you from, let's say, Charleston, WV, \nto Cincinnati. Sometimes, more importantly for business, they can take \nyou to Dulles Airport and you can connect to the international air \nflight business, so that somebody from Bloomfield, WV, or Beckley, WV, \ncan be flying and go see his or her customers, or potential customers, \nfrom a little commuter airport and a little commuter airplane, which \nthen turns into a much larger airport and international flow. I am \nproud of this. And this is just part of our bill.\n  In the absence of other business, as we wait for amendments to be \nworked out, we will do three of those this afternoon. Then we will \nhave, as I say, a tranche of agreed-to amendments--a very large \ntranche. In the tranche of yesterday, which was 14 amendments, and the \ntranche of today, which is almost that, that will be the bulk of the \nbill.\n  We have been 3 years waiting on this bill. It has been sort of held \nover or extended 11 times. Indeed, it will be 12 times by the time we \npass it, which will be, hopefully, tomorrow evening.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I offered, along with Senator Clair \nMcCaskill, my Democratic colleague, an amendment that will help contain \nour tendency in this body--a bipartisan tendency, unfortunately--to \nbust the budget, to spend more than we state we are going to spend. It \nis a temptation that is all too real. We are faced with competing \nchoices to spend and spend, and some of our Members just find it hard \nto say no.\n  We have to be careful about that because each time we do that, the \nbaseline of the budget or the emergency spending goes up, and we have \ngotten into a habit of it that is surging us on an unsustainable path. \nMr. Bernanke, the head of the Federal Reserve, the Obama \nadministration's leaders, independent economists, and Republicans \nacross-the-board are saying we are on a spending path that is \nunsustainable, that we cannot keep on. But I have to tell you, a lot of \nthis is bad because we budgeted it; but a lot of it is bad because we \nbreak the budget and spend more than the budget says.\n  We have a historical incident in which this Congress passed statutory \ncaps on spending to support the budget. In effect, Congress passed laws \nthat said this is our budget for the next several years. We have actual \nspending dollar limits in our budget. Let's pass a law that says if we \ngo above that, it takes a supermajority.\n  Our bill says it would take a two-thirds vote to exceed the spending \nthe budget allows. Some say: A two-thirds vote? That is a high vote. \nBut it is based on the budget and the passage of a budget, and the \nbudget is passed by a 50-vote majority. So the budget essentially will \nbe the Democratic colleagues' budget. What they pass is what they \nexpect the levels of spending should be and where we should cap it and \nwhere we should not go any further.\n  This legislation would enhance our ability and state with clarity, as \na bipartisan act of this Senate and Congress, that this is where we are \ngoing to stay and that we are serious about it\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\nthis time and we are going to do something about spending that is out \nof control.\n  The simple truth is, we cannot continue to spend as we are. The \nsimple truth is, we are spending into debt, deficit, more than we ever \nhave in our history. Let me just show this chart. I think it is a \npretty indicative chart that should cause the average person to lose \ntheir appetite--maybe even have their hair stand up. I used this chart \na week or so ago. I was meeting later with a Foreign Minister from a \nEuropean country.\n  He said: I happened to be watching C-SPAN. I saw you yesterday on the \nfloor with this chart. He said: Do you use charts on the floor often?\n  I said: Yes, sir, we do, Mr. Minister.\n  He said: I thought it made a lot of sense. You ought to go all over \nthe country and show that.\n  This is the Congressional Budget Office numbers based on the budget \nthat is out there. It shows what our debt held by the public is. The \ndebt held by the public is the debt where we sell Treasury bills and \npeople give us their money. They loan us their money, and we promise to \npay them back--over 10 years or 2 years or 30 years--at a certain rate \nof interest. Some people say: You should not count the internal debt; \nthat is not exactly accurate. The only thing that really counts is the \npublic debt.\n  The internal debt, the gross debt is much larger than this, but let's \njust use these numbers. In 2008 the total public debt of the United \nStates was $5.8 trillion. Since the founding of our Republic--in 1789, \nI guess, since the Constitution was written. In 2013, according to CBO \nstaff, it will double to $11.8 trillion. That is just 3 years from \nnow--double. Then, in 2019, it is projected to go to $17.3 trillion, \nmore than triple. This is not a little-bitty matter. That is why people \nare saying we cannot continue this way. That is why Moody's, the debt \nrating agency, is continuing to discuss whether to downgrade the \nAmerican debt.\n  There are entities out there that insure debt. Some people are so \nnervous about debt they want to insure the Federal Government debt and \nthey pay an actual insurance premium to make sure if the government \ndoesn't pay them what they owe, the insurance companies will pay them \nwhat they owe. I am not sure that is a smart deal. Maybe it is in a \nsmaller country. At any rate, people pay this.\n  The amount of insurance that has been paid on the American debt has \ntripled. It is not a lot, but it says something about what independent \npeople are valuing.\n  The debt of Greece amounts to 12.9 percent. The 1-year deficit for \nGreece amounts to 12.9 percent of their total economy--GDP. We are at \n9.9 percent, our debt. This year--the year ending September 30, last \nyear--that deficit was $1.4 trillion, three times the largest debt in \nthe history of the American Republic--three times.\n  Is this year going to be better? No. This year they are projecting \nwhen September 30 arrives, our deficit for that one fiscal year will be \n$1.6 trillion. According to some of the estimates, the debt would drop \ndown to about $600 billion over the next 10 years, through 2019. But \nnow we are seeing numbers that indicate that was too rosy a scenario \nand we probably will not drop below $700 billion, and then it starts up \nin 2018, 2019, 2017--almost $1 trillion a year annual deficits.\n  These numbers are low by any estimate. Already this year's deficit \nwas supposed to be a little over $1 trillion, but it is going to be \n$1.5 trillion; maybe $1.6 trillion. That is a lot of money. We just \npassed another bill that added another $104 billion to the debt for a \njobs bill.\n  What we are saying is, we are on a pathway that is unsustainable. We \ncannot continue to run trillion-dollar deficits. We are going to \naverage almost $1 trillion a year deficit for the next 10 years--\nprobably it will average maybe more than that. That is why I think all \nof us are concerned about it.\n  Senator McCaskill and I, as a first step, offered legislation that \nsaid we are going to stick with our budget. If we will just stick with \nour budget things will be better than they would be if we do not stick \nwith our budget. It is not a cure-all. It does not deal with \nentitlements and all the things with which we are confronted, but at \nleast our discretionary spending will stick with our budget.\n  The first vote was 56 voted for it. We made some changes to \naccommodate concerns of some of our colleagues, and 59 voted for it--18 \nDemocrats joined in voting for that amendment. So we need one more vote \nto make it law, and I am pleased to work with Senator McCaskill because \nwe are serious about this good step.\n  When it was done, similar legislation was passed in the early 1990s \nand continued throughout the 1990s. That was a factor, no doubt, in \ngoing from substantial deficits in the early part of the 1990s and in \nthe 1980s to surpluses in the latter part of the 1990s. That was a big \npart of it because we stuck to our budget numbers and we made progress.\n  Again, what number are you saying--is it a freeze on spending? Not \nreally. The President talked about a freeze on spending. I will support \nthat aggressively, but we are talking about a 1-percent or 2-percent \nincrease, according to the budget. So it will give us a hard limit on \nhow much increase in spending we will have. It will not require a cut \nin spending.\n  How does this play out in terms of our economy? Well, what is a $1 \ntrillion? We used to talk about millions, and then billions, now we are \ntalking about trillions. Is that really a lot of money? Yes, it is. One \ntrillion dollars is one thousand billion.\n  In Alabama State, we are almost 1/50 of the American population, and \nAlabama's general fund budget is about $2 billion. Alabama, counting \neducation, is less than 10. One trillion dollars is an amount of money \ndifficult for us to comprehend. We have never, ever dealt with numbers \nas dramatic as these numbers.\n  What is wrong with borrowing? Why don't we just borrow? We have to \npay interest on it. This is public debt. We do not have any internal \nsurpluses anymore, or very little, from Social Security and Medicare. \nWe have to go out and borrow this money on the marketplace and we pay \ninterest on it. We pay interest every year on what we borrow. \nCongress passed, over my objection, an $800 billion stimulus package. \nEvery dollar of that was borrowed because we were already in debt, and \nwhen we spend $800 billion more we have to borrow it and we pay \nsomebody interest on it. It comes out of our money that we collect in \ntaxes. We have to pay interest first just like you do on your mortgage. \nThe first thing, you pay your house note, otherwise they are coming to \nforeclose and out in the street you will go.\n\n  How much interest do we pay? That is a question I think drives home \nhow serious our unsustainable course is. A simple truth is that the \ninterest on the national debt is growing in an incredible rate and will \nsoon surpass defense budgets and everything else in our budgetary \nitems. Look at these numbers.\n  In 2009, last year, we paid $187 billion in interest. What about the \nhighway program? The Federal highway program that we talk so much about \nand argue and debate about exactly how much that should be is $40 \nbillion a year, just $40 billion. We paid last year $187 billion in \ninterest. This is a lot of money. But as I told you, since we have an \nunsustainable annual deficit every year, huge deficits on top of the \ndebt we have already accumulated, our interest payment on the public \ndebt will go up. Look at these numbers.\n  In 2020--from 2009 to 2020 the number hits $840 billion in 1 year we \nwill have to pay in interest because we borrowed so much money. That is \nwhy we hear people say time and again this is immoral. We are borrowing \nfrom our future, from our children and grandchildren, so we can spend \ntoday and live well today without worrying about the impact it is going \nto have in the future. Do not think this will not impact the economy \nadversely also. This money is all a product of borrowing from the \neconomy, so the government is now crowding out private borrowing by \nsucking up the money itself.\n  If you are a private person and you needed to borrow money and you \nsay: I promise to pay you back, and the guy said: I think you will pay \nme back, but the U.S. Government will pay me 5 percent on a T-bill. Why \nshould I loan you money at 5 percent? If I loan to you, you are less \nsecure. I want 7 or 8 percent from you, big boy. That is how things \nhappen. It drives up our wealth\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\nand capital for the expansion of businesses and home buyers and that \nsort of thing.\n  So look at that chart. It is a stunning chart, and it is a chart that \nhas the numbers on President Obama's budget that he submitted to \nCongress, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Well, that is why we have to do something. There are a lot of things \nwe need to do. But I am hopeful that in our debate and discussion in \nrecent days that we have had this vote up, this will be the third time \nwe vote on it. I am hopeful my colleagues will see this as at least one \nfirm step we will take that will help us contain our tendency to not \nstay with our budget.\n  If we were to stay with spending increases that did not exceed 1 or 2 \npercent that is in the budget of the next 4 years now, according to the \nbudget passed last year, we would see a positive impact on spending.\n  Unfortunately, in the last year, we had bills such as Agriculture \nincreased to 10 percent; we had bills such as Interior get about 15 or \n20 percent; we had bills such as EPA, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, a 30-percent increase; State Department, a 30-percent increase.\n  A 30-percent increase in a budget, the budget is going to double in \nabout 3 or 4 years. At 7 percent, money will double in 10 years. So I \njust would say, this is a dangerous thing. This will help us contain \nthat spending. That is why Senator McConnell and I are so interested in \nseeing if we can be successful with this legislation.\n  I understand Senator Pryor has an alternative; they call it a side by \nside. ``Vote for mine, do not vote for theirs'' kind of amendment. I am \nnot exactly sure what it says. Hopefully, I can support his too. I \nunderstand his may be just a 1-year binding cap. It provides no point \nof order to waive the cap. It increases spending in a number of \naccounts. So we will look at that. I would like to be able to support \nhis too.\n  But what I would say to my colleagues is, the advantages of the \namendment Senator McCaskill and I are offering are, it is a proven \nprocedure, it requires a two-thirds vote to break the budget, it allows \nus to tell ourselves, tell our constituents, and the world financial \nmarkets that we get it, we are willing to begin to contain this \nspending and that we can do better and we will do better in the future \nand there will be other steps we will want to take.\n  But I do believe this amendment will be one of the first things we \ncan do, in a bipartisan way, to help control the growth of spending and \nput us back on track. In the 1990s, it led to actual surplus. So I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Sessions-McCaskill amendment. I believe it \nis the right thing for our country. It is a significant step that will \nwork. It is not going to solve all our problems, but it will be a big \nhelp.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would ask if Senator Sessions notes \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I do like \nall the guys I am opposing on this legislation. I have been \nparticularly close to Jim DeMint for quite some time. It happens that \nSenator DeMint and I, almost every rating that comes along, are \nconsidered always in the top five most conservative Members of the \nSenate.\n  In fact, I tell the occupier of the chair who already knows this, \nthat just last week I was declared by the National Journal to be the \nmost conservative Member of the Senate. I say that because I am \ndisagreeing with a lot of my friends who have come forth to try to do \nsomething about what they call earmarks.\n  Let me try to make a couple points that I think are significant. \nFirst of all, an earmark that is in a current underlying bill, if it is \ndefeated, does not save one cent, not one.\n  People out there believe--and I have heard the talks on the floor \nwhere they say: Well, we have to do something about the next generation \nand all that. Look, I have 20 kids and grandkids. I am the guy who is \nconcerned about the next generation.\n  So when you try to make people believe you are doing something that \nis saving money and doing something about the horrible spending that is \ngoing on, it is not sincere, because an earmark does not add money. \nWhat you do when you kill an earmark is redirect it or you might say \nyou have an earmark, but you do not like what they put in, so you are \ngoing to reearmark it to something else.\n  I will give you a couple examples. These examples, I know the Chair \nis familiar with this because he serves on the Armed Services \nCommittee. They are two earmarks that Senator McCain had; one was the \nearmark for the F-22, where the President had had an amount of money \nfor the F-22, our fifth-generation fighter. I thought it was not \nenough. Several of us added more, about $1.75 billion to that program.\n  Senator McCain--and I respect the fact that he disagreed--disagreed \non this issue. But he had an amendment to strike that earmark, which \nwas a successful effort. So he struck it. However, that did not change \nthe fact that the NDAA, that is the National Defense Authorization Act, \nwas still at $679.8 billion, the same as it would have been had that \nearmark not been struck.\n  What happens to that money? That was the $1.75. Well, that goes back \ninto the defense system, into the Pentagon, where President Obama and \nhis people can make a determination as to how to spend that.\n  Using another example very similar to that, when we had the \nappropriations bill--that was authorization--when we had the \nappropriations bill, it was at $625.8 billion. We had an earmark that--\nyou can call it an earmark because we increased the amount of money \nwithin the bill, and we offset it to increase the number of C-17s. We \nfelt, in our judgment, that is what should happen. That would have been \n$2.5 billion.\n  So Senator McCain tried to get that out of it, and he was \nunsuccessful. So I have given you two examples, one where you \nsuccessfully defeat an earmark, one where you are not successful. But \nneither one changes the underlying bill.\n  So for that reason, it does not happen. Another one the Senator had \nwas having to do with transportation. I respect him. I do not agree \nwith him. But he had an amendment that would strike some things from \nthe Transportation bill amounting to about $1.7 billion. He redirected \nthat to NextGen. NextGen is a program I am very familiar with because \nit has to do with the next generation of avionics and all of it. I know \nthe Chair is aware of this; that when Senator Glenn retired, that left \nme as the only active pilot in the Chamber or the only commercial \npilot. So I stay on those issues.\n  I found out I disagreed with Senator McCain on that because CBO said \nwe could do the NextGen without this additional money. So the point I \nam trying to make is, eliminating earmarks does not save any money.\n  Here is another thing that I think is significant. Sean Hannity had a \nthree-night report that I enjoyed. What he did, he had a list of 102 \nearmarks. He went down these earmarks, and everyone enjoyed it. Last \nnight he had the last 20. So he went: Earmark No. 20, 19, 18, 17, 16--\nwent all the way down to earmark No. 1. There is not time to cover all \n102 of these. I did this on Monday on the floor, by the way.\n  But it was such things as the $3.4 million to the Florida Department \nof Transportation to build an ecopassage to allow turtles to cross \nunder the highway so they would not get hit by a car. That was $3.4 \nmillion; $450,000 for 22 concrete toilets in the Mark Twain National \nForest; another earmark, $325,000, to study the mating decisions of \nfemale cactus bugs. That was another one. This country needs that, of \ncourse; $300,000 to buy a helicopter equipped to detect radioactive \nrabbit\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\ndroppings; $400,000 to study whether adults with attention deficit \ndisorder smoke more than other adults. This is one that really wound me \nup: $500,000 in a grant to a researcher named in the climategate \nscandal. Here is a guy who has been cooking the science, and we are \ngoing to give him half a million dollars. Then there is $500,000 to \nstudy the impact of global warming on wildflowers in Colorado.\n\n  I could go through all 102. But there is one thing they all have in \ncommon. I will bet you not many people know what that is. Not one of \nthese 102 was a congressional earmark. These were all Presidential or \nbureaucratic earmarks. There is where the problem is. But they won't \ntalk about it because the public has been duped into thinking \ncongressional earmarks are a problem.\n  Let me tell you what happened over in the other House. I am \ncriticizing my own Republicans now. The Republican caucus got together \nand they had a resolve. They said:\n\n       Resolved, that it is the policy of the Republican \n     Conference that no Member shall request a congressional \n     earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit, as \n     such terms are used in clause 9, rule XXI of the Rules of the \n     House . . .\n\n  That finally defines what an earmark is. I was thankful for that. \nEven though their policy was bad, at least they talked about what an \nearmark is. Here is what it is. Clause 9, rule XXI applies to all \nlegislation in the House of Representatives, whether it be \nauthorization or appropriation. That is what we do for a living around \nhere.\n  There is an old document nobody pays any attention to anymore. It is \ncalled the Constitution. If you look up article I, section 9 of the \nConstitution, it says that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury \nbut in consequence of the appropriations made by law. That is us.\n  Besides, if you remember studying about this--I know the Chair and I \nhave talked about his knowledge of the Constitution--it was James \nMadison who was the father of the Constitution. He was the one who came \nup with the three coequal branches of government--the judiciary, \nexecutive, and legislative. He is the one who coined the phrase ``power \nof the purse.'' That was James Madison. If you read the Federalist \nPapers, he made it clear what we were supposed to do. What we in the \nHouse and we in the Senate are supposed to do is pass laws that are \nnecessary to have appropriations and authorization.\n  The Chair and I are both on the Senate Armed Services Committee. That \nis the authorization committee. We go through and study what we need to \ndefend America--missile defense, for example. We need to have \nredundancy in all phases--the boost face, the midcourse face, the \nterminal phase. All these things are complicated, and we really can't \nexpect the general public to be aware of it because they are too busy \nmaking money to pay for all this fun we are having up here. We have \nthis authorization. That is what the Constitution says we are supposed \nto be doing.\n  Then appropriations. After we authorize something, study as to \nwhether it should be a priority, then we have an appropriation to put \nit into law. That is, again, what we are supposed to be doing. The \nConstitution tells us we have to appropriate and authorize.\n  The oath of office--everyone here has taken the oath of office. In \nthat oath, we say we solemnly swear we will support and bear true \nallegiance to the Constitution of the United States.\n  Wait a minute. They are going to uphold the Constitution, but they \nhave just said by their own resolution that they are going to break the \nConstitution.\n  I look at this, and I think about how people, if they only knew this \nwas going on, if they only knew that all these earmarks Sean Hannity \ntalked about, all 102 were earmarks that came from unelected \nbureaucrats--people not responsible.\n  There was an interesting article in the Hill paper the other day. It \nwas from February 4. They say lobbyists are now going to Federal \nagencies because of all these efforts because of earmarks and all that. \nSo we have turned over and given to unelected bureaucrats what we are \nsupposed to be doing under our sworn oath.\n  I know Senator McCain is going to have an amendment coming up \ntomorrow. I would like to suggest that people who talk about not doing \nearmarks have done earmarks. In the case of Senator McCain, there was \nan article titled ``McCain Breaks Own Pork Rule.'' This was from \nNovember 7, 2003.\n  Then we have Senator DeMint, who--again, I really value him. He is \none of my closest friends. I remember when he was first running for \noffice. I went to South Carolina, and they talked about how roads were \nso important down there, and he swore he would support them. So he did. \nHe kept his word. These are earmarks. Senator DeMint: $10 million for \nthe construction of I-73 at Myrtle Beach; $15 million to widen U.S. 278 \nto six lanes; $10 million, engineering, design, and construction of a \nport access road; $10 million in improvements to U.S. 17; $5 million, \nwidening SC 9; $3 million to complete construction. These are earmarks \nthat were done by Senator DeMint. I don't blame him. That is what we \nare supposed to be doing. I have done the same thing. You add up all \nthese earmarks on just that bill, and it comes to $110 million. Those \nare Senator DeMint's earmarks on that one bill.\n  What I am saying is, these guys all earmark, but somehow the public \nthinks there is something wrong with earmarks. I say: Fine. Define \nearmarks. Be as honest as the House of Representatives. The House of \nRepresentatives says earmarks are authorizations and appropriations.\n  What we need to do is remember what our jobs are here. Again, the \nthing that frustrates me is that there are so many people writing \neditorials thinking earmarks are going to somehow cut spending. They \ndon't cut any spending. Eliminating an earmark merely transfers it from \nour constitutional responsibility to the executive branch. I am hoping \npeople will understand this.\n  I can remember 8 years ago. Everyone said at that time that global \nwarming was caused by manmade gases, anthropogenic gases. I thought, it \nmust be true; everybody says it is true, until the Wharton School of \nEconomics came along and did a study during the Kyoto Treaty days. They \nsaid: What would it cost America if we were to sign and ratify that \ntreaty and live by its emissions restrictions? The range they gave us \nwas between $300 and $400 billion a year. We are talking about $300 to \n$400 billion a year.\n  I see my friend from Arkansas. I suggest to him, that $300 to $400 \nbillion a year would cost every taxpayer he has who files a return in \nthe State of Arkansas just under $3,000 a year. That is what it would \ncost. We didn't ratify that.\n  Along came, in 2003, the McCain-Lieberman bill--another cap-and-trade \nbill to do essentially the same thing Kyoto did--and then the McCain-\nLieberman bill in 2005 and the Warner-Lieberman bill in 2008 and the \nSanders-Boxer bill in 2009. All of these have one thing in common; that \nis, cap and trade. Right now, we have Senator Lindsey Graham and \nSenator John Kerry trying to change the word, not use ``cap and \ntrade,'' but essentially it would be cap and trade.\n  All of that would have cost between $300 and $400 billion a year. I \nbring that up because it is pertinent to this. I brought it up because \n8 years ago nobody believed me when I said it is going to cost that \nmuch money and it will not accomplish anything.\n  Then, as the years went by, finally the Environmental Protection \nAgency director, appointed by President Obama, in response to a \nquestion I had--I asked: Let me ask you this. If we were to pass this \nbill--that was the Markey bill; they are all the same; cap and trade is \ncap and trade--how much would it reduce the emissions of \nCO2? Her answer was: It wouldn't reduce it.\n  Common sense tells us it wouldn't. If we do something unilaterally in \nAmerica, it will not reduce the worldwide amount. As we lose our jobs \nhere, they to go China and Mexico, places where they are generating \nmore electricity. It will have the effect of increasing not reducing \nit.\n  It took America 7 years. I was a bad guy for 7 years because in \nadvance I said that this is what it was going to cost. It was a phony \nissue. Finally, they agreed.\n  This has endured 3 years. I have been trying to explain to people for \nthe last 3 years that you don't save any money\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nif you kill earmarks. We need to define what they are. The House has \nbeen honest. They have defined it as authorization and appropriation, \nwhich is what the Constitution says we are supposed to do. Everybody \nwho says they are against earmarks has been introducing earmarks.\n  The bottom line is, we need to really address something meaningful.\n  What I have done is I have introduced a bill that will do what \nPresident Obama said he was going to do; that is, freeze the nondefense \ndiscretionary spending at the 2010 levels. The only problem with that \nis he increased it in his budget by 20 percent. You are talking about \nincreasing the nondiscretionary or the discretionary nondefense \nspending after you have increased it by 20 percent. So I introduced a \nbill that says let's take it back.\n  This President is always talking about what he inherited from the \nBush administration. In 2008, the amount of money that was called \ndiscretionary spending was 20 percent less than 2010. If it is good for \n2010, let's bring it down to 2008. We have an opportunity that would \nsave just under $1 trillion in the next 10-year budget cycle. That is \nthe answer. That is what I think we ought to be doing instead of \nsitting around and deceiving the public into thinking that just because \nthe media doesn't understand it, somehow earmarks are going to \naccomplish something worthwhile.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3548 to Amendment No. 3452\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I move to set aside the pending amendment and call up \namendment No. 3548.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], for Mr. Reid, for \n     himself and Mr. Pryor, proposes an amendment numbered 3548.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I know this Nation is in a fiscal crisis. \nAnybody who is paying attention to the details understands that. We \nhave to get serious about deficit reduction. I believe that in order to \ndo so, we have to look at the full picture. We can't just look at \ndiscretionary spending.\n  I thank the President for saying he wants to freeze discretionary \nspending. It is going to be an unpopular decision, but we need to start \ntaking steps like that. I also thank Senators Sessions and McCaskill \nbecause they have offered an amendment that is going to be voted on in \na few minutes that freezes discretionary spending and puts a cap on it. \nIt is for fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013. I voted for that on a \ncouple occasions and still support the concept.\n  But in order for us to get serious about getting our fiscal house in \norder, we have to put everything on the table. That is the bottom line. \nWhen we do the fiscally responsible thing, it is going to be hard. It \nis going to be difficult politically. It will take determination and \npolitical will. But we have to put everything on the table.\n  The multiyear discretionary spending caps were a key part of the \n1990, 1993, and 1997 deficit-reduction packages. However, one of the \ndifferences in those packages and what Senators Sessions and McCaskill \nare offering today is those deficit-reduction packages looked at all \nspending, mandatory and discretionary, as well as revenues. That is \nwhat my amendment, the Reid-Pryor amendment we will also vote on this \nafternoon, does. It puts everything--almost everything on the table.\n  We have to get serious about fiscal discipline and restoring fiscal \norder in the United States. There is a story in yesterday's New York \nTimes--I am sure it was widely reported--that Moody's is considering \ndowngrading our bond rating from AAA down to something lower because of \nthe enormous national debt we have.\n  By establishing limits only on discretionary funding sources, we \ngreatly reduce the likelihood of any bipartisan agreement we can make \nin this Chamber to fix our long-term deficits and long-term debt \nproblem. I think for us to fix this and to get our fiscal house where \nit needs to be, we have to approach this in a bipartisan way. My \nconcern is, if we just do discretionary spending, we will never get to \na bipartisan agreement.\n\n  The other thing about this: If the Reid-Pryor amendment were adopted \ntoday, I think the markets would like it. I think Wall Street and the \nglobal markets and all these folks such as Moody's and all these other \npeople who are watching would see this as a very positive signal and it \nwould help the U.S. economy in many ways beyond just the pure numbers \nin the budget.\n  I trust the members of the President's National Commission on Fiscal \nResponsibility and Reform. I trust they will provide very viable \noptions and solutions. I look forward to their hearings and all of \ntheir suggestions as they go through this year and try to address some \nof the fiscal challenges we have.\n  The Senate has six Members on this commission: Senators Baucus, \nCoburn, Conrad, Crapo, Durbin, and Gregg. All of these people bring \ngreat experience. They all bring to the commission great depth of \nknowledge on these issues. I am afraid if we do the cap on \ndiscretionary spending, as we talked about before, it might actually \nserve to undermine the commission's very challenging work.\n  I have a chart here that lays out a few things. This actually comes \nfrom CQ Today, from Tuesday, February 2, so it is a little more than a \nmonth old. But it paints a couple of pictures that I think we need to \nemphasize today as we compare these two amendments.\n  The first picture shows these pie charts. I do not know if the \ncameras can pick these up for the folks back home, but, as shown on \nthese two pie charts these are the 2011 revenue estimates and the 2011 \nproposed outlays.\n  One thing that I think is critically important is that when we look \nat the Sessions-McCaskill amendment--you can see this purple slice of \nthe pie right here. You can see it is much less than half of the \nFederal budget. You can see that very easily. But in the fine print \nhere--this is discretionary spending--that is nondefense and national \ndefense right there. Of course, they are carving out for national \ndefense. So my guess is, they are only talking about, I will guess, 20 \npercent of the Federal budget. I am not quite sure how much. So they \nare trying to fix all of our problem with just about 20 percent of the \nbudget.\n  What our proposal does is it actually includes almost everything in \nthis pie, instead of saying 20 percent, probably 80 percent, 85 \npercent, 90 percent of the Federal budget will be included in trying to \naddress the fiscal challenges we have.\n  There is another thing I want to point out on this chart. It has been \naround a long time. I have seen it in many publications. On this chart, \nyou can see our deficit spending, starting with the Jimmy Carter \nadministration, going through the Reagan years, the George Bush years, \nthe Clinton years, the George W. Bush years, and the Obama years. You \nwill see that, of course, the Obama years are mostly projections.\n  But what you see in these purple lines, all down here--under zero--\nthose are our deficits. Then they actually go up during the Clinton \nyears above zero. We go into surplus spending for the first time in a \nlong time, paying off national debt, trying to be fiscally responsible, \nmaking tough choices. Not everybody was happy about that. We were \ntrying to do that. Then you see what happened after 2000, where our \nnumbers plummeted.\n  This yellow line--that maybe is hard to pick up on television--is the \npercentage of GDP. But, nonetheless, you see on this chart a sharp \ndropoff, and then you see this other sharp dropoff. So we have to \nunderstand, when this President came into office, President Obama, he \ndid inherit a lot of problems, a lot of fiscal problems. But it is also \nbecause of the recession, because of the near global economic collapse, \nbecause of two wars and just because of some of these fiscal policies \nof the previous administration and because of the stimulus and because \nof some of his priorities. But you see the numbers going way down.\n  To President Obama's credit, he is moving the purple lines back up, \nand that is great. But it is not enough. It is not enough. We need to \nmove these lines on up here, and we need to get above zero. We have to \nget back to surpluses in this government so we can\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\npay off the national debt, and do this before our children and our \ngrandchildren are stuck with us living beyond our means.\n  I think that is the bottom line. I think the Reid-Pryor amendment is \nthe amendment that does that. We can talk about how we have an annual \ndeficit this year of--I think it is $1.2 trillion. I have forgotten the \nnumber. We can talk about the national debt of--I think it is $13 \ntrillion, and growing every single year. We have to get that turned \naround. We are on an unsustainable course. We have heard the chairman \nof the Budget Committee. We have heard the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. We have heard people who care about this issue say time and \nagain: We are on an unsustainable course.\n  I would ask my colleagues to look at the Reid-Pryor amendment. In \nsome ways, it is structured like what Senator Sessions and Senator \nMcCaskill have offered. Again, I voted for previous versions of that. \nThey changed it a little bit this time. But I think the greatest \nliability for the Sessions-McCaskill amendment is it does not take in \nthe whole picture. Like the pie chart, it takes in a little bit of this \npie chart but not the whole thing.\n  If we are going to get serious--get serious--about fixing our fiscal \nequation, we have to put everything on the table. That is discretionary \nspending, mandatory spending, as well as revenues. We have to put it \nall on the table, and we have to work through this together, hopefully \nin a very bipartisan way.\n  I do not think we can fix this overnight. Even if our amendment were \nto pass this evening, it does not mean we are out of the woods yet. \nWhat it does is set the table for the deficit commission and others in \nfuture Congresses to come in and do the things we need to do and get us \nback where we need to be.\n  The last point I want to make about this chart right here is, if you \nlook at this purple line, this chart is basically a graph of political \ncourage. That is what this is. Because the easiest thing in the world \nfor a politician to do--the easiest thing for a politician to do--is to \ncut taxes and raise spending. That is exactly what you see on this \nchart. You see tax cuts coming in at various times, and you see \nspending going up at various times. These purple numbers get way out of \nbalance when Congress and the White House take the easy way out, and \nthat is exactly what you see on this chart.\n  That is why we are in this situation today. It is not one President's \nfault. I do not want to blame it all on this President or on the \nprevious President. This has been going on for a long time. It is not \none Congress's fault. It has been going on for a long time. But we have \nto have the political will to change the way we do things around here.\n  I hope tonight will be a very important step in that process. I hope \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will look at the Reid-Pryor \namendment that contains all three fixes--and that is discretionary \nspending, mandatory spending, as well as revenues--and try to get this \npassed tonight and get us moving in the right direction.\n  I say to the chairman, I think we are waiting on Senator Inouye. So \nuntil he gets here, all I wish to say is, what the Pryor amendment does \nis to freeze all discretionary spending caps at the levels proposed by \nPresident Obama for fiscal year 2011. It freezes all discretionary \nspending caps for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 at 40 percent of the \ndifference between President Obama's budget proposal and last year's \nbudget resolution. The reason we do that is because Senator Sessions \nand Senator McCaskill used last year's budget numbers, and it may be \nfair under the circumstances this year. We are splitting the difference \nthere.\n  The third thing is that these two freezes will reduce discretionary \nspending by at least $77 billion over 3 years-- reduce discretionary \nspending by $77 billion over 3 years--a pretty substantial cut.\n\n  When we talk about discretionary spending, we are talking about \nmostly the popular programs the government has. It may be things such \nas auto safety. It may be things such as child product safety. It may \nbe things such as the Federal Trade Commission and some of the \noversight they have to keep consumers safe. It could be the EPA. There \nare a lot of things--clean drinking water, clean air. That is what we \nare talking about when we talk about discretionary spending. So we are \ndoing cuts there. Those are going to hurt. Again, people are not going \nto be happy about that.\n  It also requires the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and \nReform to find at least an additional $77 billion of deficit reductions \nover the 3 years to close the gap between the projected revenues and \nentitlement spending. It basically says they have to find some spending \ncuts as they do their work.\n  It also requires Congress to enact the debt commission's \nrecommendations by January 2, 2011, for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 \ndiscretionary spending caps to go into effect. It has a sense of the \nSenate that the total amount of deficit reduction by the debt \ncommission shall be at least equal to the reductions in discretionary \nspending.\n  One of the differences between the Reid-Pryor amendment and the \nSessions-McCaskill amendment is theirs is just about spending. And \nlisten, spending is important, and that is half of the equation. We are \nspending too much money, and I recognize that, a lot of other people \nrecognize that. I know a lot of people in Arkansas recognize that. But \nthat is only half the equation. The other half is how much we are \ntaking in, and can we do better and smarter all around the board and \nput everything on the table to try to fix this.\n  The real problem we face, in my view, is not spending alone but it is \nthe spending that is leading to these enormous deficits every year and \nthis enormous national debt. So I think our approach is more \ncomprehensive. I think it is fairer. I hope many of my colleagues, once \nthey see the language of the legislation, will consider voting for it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are continuing to wait, as we \nhave basically waited all day for amendments to be offered and debated \nand voted on to the FAA reauthorization bill, Senator Rockefeller has \nremained on this floor most of this day. This is a very important piece \nof legislation. It is disappointing that it has slowed down, as have \nmost of the issues we have dealt with in recent months, in the past \nyear.\n  Apparently, we will vote either later tonight or likely tomorrow on \nan amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill that has nothing to do \nwith the bill. It is so characteristic of the Senate that we bring a \nbill on air safety and modernizing the air traffic control system, on \nessential air service, on passengers bills of rights, and an amendment \nis offered that has nothing to do with those subjects. The rules of the \nSenate allow that.\n  Let me at least talk for a moment about an amendment that will be \nvoted on probably next and probably tomorrow, I guess, by Senator \nSessions and Senator McCaskill. I know Senator Sessions spoke about \nthis recently. He used a very large chart to show the growth in Federal \nbudget deficits and also debt. There is no question that the level of \nbudget deficits and debt are unsustainable and dangerous to this \ncountry. There is no question about that.\n  What we ought to do is understand, No. 1, how did we get here and, \nNo. 2, how do we get to a different direction that addresses these \nissues. Let me describe briefly the first part and then the second \npart.\n  Ten years ago, there was a budget surplus in this country--the first \ntime in 30 years, a budget surplus 10 years ago. Then President Bush \nwas elected, and President George W. Bush said at the time: There is a \nbudget surplus, and it is expected now there will be a surplus for the \nnext 10 years. He had Alan Greenspan, then-Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, whispering in his ear and saying: And, by the way, if we \nhave surpluses for 10 years, I worry\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\na lot about paying down the Federal debt too quickly. I worry that may \nbe a real problem for our economy. I hope he did not spend a lot of \nsleepless nights worrying about that. He needn't have, I guess.\n  The President then, with that kind of counsel, said: I am going to \ncut taxes, and I am going to cut taxes for 10 years at least. What I am \ngoing to do is cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans because I believe \nthis economic engine works best by putting something in at the top and \nletting it trickle down to everybody else.\n  We had a tax cut proposal that was very generous to the people at the \ntop. I stood on this floor and said: I don't think that makes any sense \nat all. I think we ought to be a little conservative. First of all, \nthese are budget estimates of surplus. They don't exist. They are just \nestimates by economists who cannot remember their home telephone \nnumbers, let alone what is going to happen 3 years from now. So let's \nbe a little conservative.\n  The President and those in the Chamber who voted for it in 2001 said: \nNonsense. Katy, bar the door; we are going to have budget surpluses \nforever. We are giving big tax cuts and, yes, we are giving big tax \ncuts to the wealthiest because they are the ones who make this economic \nengine hum. And they did. I did not vote for it.\n  Very shortly then we found out we were in a recession.\n  That was a problem. Six months after that, we found out terrorists \nwere bent on injuring this country, and we had the 9/11 attack that \nkilled several thousand innocent Americans. Then we were at war with \nterrorists--at war in Afghanistan and then at war in Iraq--none of it \npaid for, not a penny. We sent men and women off to fight and did not \nask anybody to pay for a penny of it and put all of those costs on the \nFederal budget debt. Just put it right on top of the debt.\n  In the meantime, as that decade--which I think will be known perhaps \nas ``the lost decade'' of lost opportunity in some ways--moved on, we \nalso had people come into this town who were to be regulators and were \npaid to be regulators who boasted: We are going to be willfully blind \nfor a few years. You do what you want. We won't watch. We won't tell.\n  The result was a field day for the biggest financial interests in \nAmerica, creating the most exotic financial instruments, such as credit \ndefault swaps, CDOs, derivatives--by the way, synthetic derivatives. \nWhat does that mean? That means you have an instrument that has nothing \non either side. It is just flatout gambling.\n  We have some of the biggest financial institutions that were spending \na decade trading trillions of dollars of derivatives, synthetic \nderivatives, much of it by hedge funds and other financial entities \nthat were unregulated.\n  Again, Mr. Greenspan said, when those of us in the Senate pushed for \nregulations: No, they don't need to be regulated. It will all work out \nfine. Self-regulation--they are not going to do anything stupid. Self-\nregulation will work just fine.\n  In the meantime, we had the home loan scandal, massive amounts of \nmoney in subprime loans put out there to people who could not afford \nthem by companies that were making billions of dollars. Mr. Mozilo ran \nCountrywide, the single largest home lender in America. He left with a \ncouple hundred million dollars. He is now under investigation. They \nwere putting teaser loans out.\n  They said: By the way, you have bad credit, no credit, don't pay your \nbills, no pay, slow pay. They said: Come to us. We want to give you a \nloan.\n  All of us understand that does not work. Yet that is what was going \non. They were awash in money by moving all these assets and securities \naround. Unbelievable. That is the subprime loan scandal.\n  All of this transpired, and then it collapsed. When you create a \nhouse of cards, the slightest little wind blows the house of cards \ndown. That is exactly what happened. We discovered that some of the \nbiggest financial institutions in this country had much more leverage \nthan they were able to sustain, and the entire thing came crashing \ndown.\n  The Federal Reserve Board now has spent untold amounts of money--\nuntold because they would not tell us. We asked them. They said: You \ndon't deserve to know nor do the American people deserve to know how \nmany trillions of dollars have gone out the back door to sustain \ninvestment banks and others who made bad judgments. Those too-big-to-\nfail institutions, no-fault capitalism, they were too big to fail, and \nthe American taxpayers got stuck. The American taxpayers and American \ncitizens lost about $15 trillion in value, and at the same time had to \nbail out big financial institutions that made massive amounts of money.\n  By the way, right now they are paying, once again, bonuses of $120 \nbillion, $140 billion in some of those same industries, and they are \nshowing record profits while some 15 million, 17 million people went \nout to look for work and could not find it. Small- and medium-size \nbusinesses are still having difficulties. Those at the top, too big to \nfail, who received massive amounts of government help, are now making \nrecord profits and paying record bonuses. All of that exists.\n  When we hit this ditch, this financial wreck, we lost a substantial \namount of income coming into the Federal Government--about $400 \nbillion. The economic stabilizers we have, such as unemployment \ninsurance, food stamps, and others, the cost of them went way up. Had \nBarack Obama, winning the Presidency, done nothing--walking across the \nthreshold into the White House for the first day, had he done nothing \nfor the next 10 to 12 months he would have had a $1.3 trillion Federal \nbudget deficit not of his making. That was his inheritance when he won \nthe Presidency.\n  We have these giant budget deficits. I find it interesting, people \ncome out and talk about these big budget deficits who have spent the \nlast 10 years saying: You know what. Let's go ahead and send men and \nwomen to war, and we will just charge it. We will not ask anybody to \npay for it, ratcheting up this deficit, helping create these problems.\n  Now, all of a sudden they are having an apoplectic seizure over \nbudget deficits and the increased level of debt. We should have a \nseizure over it because it is unsustainable, and we should fix it.\n  We need to understand what happened to create it and making sure we \nfix it so that it does not happen again. That means financial reform. \nThat means paying for wars we are fighting, and so on, which is not \nhappening yet. Even more than that, the question is, What is the \nmedicine or the solution? So our colleagues bring an amendment that we \nwill vote on tomorrow that says what we should do is to freeze domestic \ndiscretionary spending for 3 years--domestic discretionary spending. \nWell, people who don't work around here don't know what that means so \nmuch. What it means is they are proposing to freeze that portion of \nFederal spending that has not blown through the lid here. What is out \nof control are the entitlements--massive increases in Medicare and \nMedicaid. What is out of control is the substantial increase in defense \nspending that is not paid for. What is out of control is the \ndramatically less revenue that comes from giving tax cuts to people who \ndidn't need it.\n\n  If you have a million dollar income a year--which would be a good \nthing to have--and somebody says: You know what, you just won the \nlottery. Our government says: We are going to give you a $79,000 tax \ncut. So a proposal that says: You know what we are going to do, we are \ngoing to take that smaller portion of the budget and we are going to \nfreeze that for 3 years--you know, the kinds of things that educate \nkids, the sort of things that invest in people's lives, human capital, \nhuman potential, the kinds of things that make life better. We are \ngoing to freeze all that, but we are not going to touch anything on the \nrevenue side. No, we want to protect those tax cuts for the biggest \ninterests. We are not going to do anything in the entitlement areas, \ndespite the fact that we have dramatic growth in Medicare. There is \nnothing in this that says: Let's take a look at all spending. They say: \nLet's take a look at a bit of spending. And there is nothing in here \nthat says: Let's take a look at revenues.\n  You have to look at all of these things. If you are serious, if you \nare a deficit hawk and you are about getting your hands around this \ndeficit problem and getting rid of this problem, then\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\nyou have to be serious out here and say we are going to do it all; that \nwe are going to take a look at every single area of spending and we are \ngoing to take a look at revenues as well.\n  Let me mention one example. In 2008, the highest income earner, pure \nincome, in America is a man who made $3.6 billion--$3.6 billion--\nrunning a hedge fund. So he goes home at night and his spouse says: How \nare you doing, honey? Pretty good. I made $10 million today. It is a \nlot of money for a day, isn't it? Well, $3.6 billion is $300 million a \nmonth, and so $10 million a day. But that is not his only success. It \nwasn't just that he made $3.6 billion. It was that he gets to pay a \nlower income tax than almost anybody in the State of Minnesota--the \nState of the Presiding Officer--because most of the constituents of the \nPresiding Officer pay income tax rates that are much higher than 15 \npercent. But that $3.6 billion earner gets to pay an income tax rate of \n15 percent because it is defined as carried interest. That is a \nloophole that you can drive a Humvee through, and it is one that we \nought to close right now.\n  You say you want to do something about deficits. How about making \nsomebody like that pay a fair share of taxes? If somebody is going to \nwork all day as a drill press operator and come home and shower after \nwork and try to figure out how he is going to pay the bills and so on, \nif that person is paying a 20-percent, 28-percent, 30-percent, 35-\npercent income tax rate, how about the person who is making $3.6 \nbillion?\n  Somebody will listen to this and say: That is that old populism \nagain. That is not populism, to talk about things that are necessary \nand right. It is not populism. It is deciding that everybody ought to \nbe treated fairly, and it is not fair if those who are at the low end \nof the income ladder are paying the highest tax rates and those who are \nat the high end are paying the lowest tax rates.\n  Warren Buffett, the second or third richest man in the world--a guy I \nlike and whom I have known a long time. He is a wonderful man. He did \nan experiment at his office in Omaha, NE. I think he said they had \nsomething like 20 or 40 or 50 people working at Berkshire Hathaway at \nthe office. So he asked them, I believe voluntarily, to disclose what \ntheir income was--although his company pays them--and what their tax \nrate was. What he discovered was this: Of all the people in his office, \nthe person who paid the lowest combined tax rate of income taxes and \npayroll taxes was the third or second wealthiest man in the world: \nWarren Buffet. He paid a lower tax rate than his receptionist. Warren \nBuffett said to me: That is so unbelievably wrong. It has to change. \nYou all have to change that. I am paying what I should pay, but he \nsaid: It is not right that you have a Tax Code that has me paying a \nlower tax rate than the receptionist in my office.\n  My point simply is this: We could change that, and should, and \nincrease some revenue as a result by making the tax system fairer and \nhaving those who should, pay their fair share. That is one way to \nreduce the deficit, isn't it? Except it will never be done with this \nresolution because it looks at that portion of the budget that would be \nused to fund a school or to build a water project or to build a flood \nprotection project--just that domestic discretionary in which you \ninvest in America. Well, that doesn't make any sense at all.\n  Senator Pryor came to the floor and said he is going to offer an \nalternative, which I am going to support, which includes all of these \nthings. It says: Yes, tackle this budget deficit, do it now, don't \ndelay, but tackle it with seriousness, seriousness of purpose, not just \ntaking one piece that hasn't exploded and ignoring the other pieces. \nTake the piece of domestic discretionary spending that has not exploded \nand say: Let's take all the savings out there. I don't understand that.\n  I understand the motive. The motive is to say: Well, we have a bunch \nof people who don't want to touch taxes in any way, even asking the \n$3.6 billion person who pays a 15-percent rate to start paying his fair \nshare. I understand they want to protect that. I don't. I want that \nperson to pay a fair rate of taxes to our government. They would call \nthat a tax increase. I don't. I think it is just evening up the score, \nsaying: You want all the benefits America has to offer but don't want \nto pay the full obligation of being a citizen? The same is true with \nsome corporate interests that decide they want everything America has \nto offer them but they want to run their employees through the Grand \nCaymans so they can avoid paying payroll taxes.\n  By the way, the same people who are paying a 15-percent income tax \nrate on carried interest running hedge funds are setting up deferred \ncompensation accounts in the Bahamas to avoid paying even that 15 \npercent. So is that something we can shut down? Of course. Would that \nhelp reduce the budget deficit? Yes. Is that tackling domestic \ndiscretionary? No. It is more effective than doing that, because we \nknow where this money is and we know how we could reduce the budget \nthis way.\n  I am in favor of tackling every part of the Federal budget and seeing \nwhat works and what doesn't. There are a whole number of things this \ngovernment does that it doesn't need to do anymore.\n  I know Senator Kaufman wants to speak, but I want to mention one \nthing first. I have been here at this desk a long time now, and let me \ndescribe how unbelievable it is that even waste has its constituency in \nthis Chamber--even waste. We are doing this: We broadcast television \nsignals into the country of Cuba every single day that the Cuban people \ncan't see. We do it every single day. We have spent $\\1/4\\ billion \ndoing it. We broadcast from 3 in the morning until about 7 in the \nmorning and the Cubans routinely block them. The purpose of it was to \nbroadcast--under what is called Television Marti--and to inform the \nCubans about how wonderful freedom is. They are pretty well aware of \nthat by listening to Miami radio stations. And we know they understand \nfreedom because they get on rafts trying to find their way to this \ncountry. But we have Television Marti, which is a big group of people \nthat is pretty well funded, about $20 million a year, or $25 million a \nyear now, and so we send television signals to the Cuban people that \nthey can't see. We first did it with a big blimp called Fat Albert, way \nup in the air shooting signals down that the Cubans could block. Then \nFat Albert got off its tethers and landed in the Everglades, and what a \nmess that was. Then they bought an airplane and they send the signal by \nflying these planes, which the Cubans routinely block.\n  I have offered amendment after amendment after amendment to try to \nstop spending to send television signals to no one, but you can't get \nit done. Isn't that unbelievable? I will continue to do that because \nthat is an area of spending, it seems to me, where it takes a \nnanosecond of thought to say: That is just stupid. That is just dumb. \nSo stop it. Except government doesn't quite work that way, or that \nwell.\n  But if the Pryor amendment is offered tomorrow, I fully intend to \nsupport that aggressively because we are on an unsustainable path. Most \nof us know how we got here, but not everybody yet knows how we are \ngoing to get out of it, and I think that is a decent step in the right \ndirection. I would say that the Sessions-McCaskill amendment is \nseriously deficient and is not, in my judgment, the serious way to \naddress what is a very serious problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n   In Praise of Jeffrey Amos, Marvin Caraway, Jr., and Colin Richards\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once more to highlight some of our \nNation's outstanding Federal employees. I have spoken before about \nthose who, in serving our Nation, place their lives in danger in order \nto protect others. On March 4, a lone gunman opened fired near the main \nentrance to the Pentagon, wounding two security officers before being \nquickly subdued. These two officers and a third who assisted them \nprovide an example of the bravery and excellence of Federal employees, \nand especially Federal employees in law enforcement who take risks \nevery day.\n  These three men all worked for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency,\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nwhich oversees security for the Defense Department's headquarters as \nwell as several other Defense facilities in the Washington area. It was \ncreated after the attacks of September 11, 2001, to provide \ncomprehensive threat prevention for one of the buildings targeted on \nthat fateful day. Like those serving in other law enforcement and \nsecurity agencies, the men and women of the Pentagon Force Protection \nAgency undergo rigorous training. Many are veterans of the Armed Forces \nor have worked previously as police officers for States and \nmunicipalities. They train to be ready at a moment's notice for \nscenarios they pray will never come. Often these security officers will \nstand at a checkpoint for hours at a time at the ready during days and \nweeks and months of quiet.\n  As a youth, I worked two summers as a lifeguard in Philadelphia, and \nwe always used to say it was hours of boredom interspersed with seconds \nof sheer terror. Well, sheer terror happened for these great Federal \nemployees. For these three officers from the Pentagon Force Protection \nAgency such a moment came just before 7 o'clock in the evening of March \n4, 2010.\n  Officers Marvin Caraway, Jr. and Colin Richards were standing guard \nat the main entrance to the building--the Pentagon--when a suspicious \nfigure approached. Marvin sensed something was amiss, so he walked \ntoward him to check out his identification. When the man pulled a gun \nfrom his jacket and began firing, one of the bullets grazed Marvin's \nthigh. Undeterred, he held his ground and fired back. Later, his fellow \nofficer would tell reporters that Marvin was like ``Superman''--``a man \nof steel.''\n  Colin ducked behind a barricade and began to return fire. Hearing the \nshots, a third officer, Jeffrey Amos, ran over from his post nearby and \njoined the effort to subdue the gunman. In the process, he was wounded \nin the shoulder. The whole incident took only a minute and the three \nofficers fatally shot the assailant.\n  The quick reaction and undeterred professionalism of these three are \ninspiring. All brought to the job a strong background in law \nenforcement and public service. Marvin, who lives in Clinton, MD, is a \nformer marine, who served in the first Persian gulf war, and has \nexperience protecting our embassies overseas. Jeffrey, from Woodbridge, \nVA, is a retired member of the Air Force Reserve. He spent 11 years in \nthe New Orleans Police SWAT team.\n  Colin, who resides in Arlington, VA, recalled how his experience and \ntraining prepared him to act quickly. He said: ``My vision was big; my \nhearing--I could hear everything. When the shooter started running, he \nlooked like a big target. At that point I felt like I couldn't miss.''\n  Federal security officers, such as Marvin, Jeffrey, and Colin, are \nour modern-day ``Minutemen''--trained and ready to keep us safe from \nthreats to our liberty and security. We owe all of them our constant \nappreciation.\n  I must add that we see the same dedication and professionalism right \nhere each day in our very own Capitol Police force as well. I know how \nproud Majority Leader Reid is of his own service as a Capitol Police \nofficer when, as a young man, he stood guard at one of the entrances to \nthis building.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Marvin Caraway, Jr., \nJeffrey Amos, and Colin Richards for their bravery and a job well \ndone--as well as all those who serve as Federal security officers \nstanding at the ready. They are reminders of our great Federal \nemployees.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, so ordered. \nThe Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            new philadelphia\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, in 1777, when our Republic was just a year \nold and the Revolutionary War was raging, a man named Frank McWorter \nwas born in South Carolina.\n  In 1795, when the war was over and George Washington was President, \nhe moved to Kentucky. He married a woman named Lucy.\n  And in 1830, he and his family moved to Illinois--the very same year \nthat a man named Thomas Lincoln, along with his son Abraham, moved to \nthere from Indiana.\n  Frank McWorter decided he would settle down, and so he bought a farm \nin Pike County's Hadley Township, and he began to plan out the town of \nNew Philadelphia. Other settlers moved in. Soon, there were family \nhomes, businesses, and even a school.\n  And when Frank McWorter died of natural causes in 1854, having lived \nmore than three-quarters of a century, he died in the town he founded \nand guided to prosperity.\n  The community of New Philadelphia continued to thrive until it was \nbypassed by the expanding railroad in 1869. Left behind by the steam \nengine, and the wave of expansion it pushed across the western \nfrontier, the residents of New Philadelphia began to disperse by the \nlate 1880's, and the town gradually disappeared again into the Illinois \nprairie.\n  The story of Frank McWorter and New Philadelphia is an extraordinary \none.\n  But as I told this story a moment ago, here on the Senate floor, I \nleft out one defining detail.\n  If Frank McWorter had been a farmer, or a banker, or a soldier, his \ntale would be remarkable because of the era in which he lived--but in \nmany ways, he would have been no different from thousands of others who \ngrew up in the early days of our country.\n  But Frank McWorter's story is extraordinary because he was not a \nfarmer, or a banker, or a soldier--no, he was a slave.\n  When he moved to Kentucky in 1795, he did not go voluntarily. He went \nwith his owners. On the day he met Lucy, his future wife, the two of \nthem were slaves on neighboring farms.\n  Eventually, Frank was allowed to work odd jobs, and hire out his own \ntime and labor. He learned to mine a major component of gunpowder, \nwhich proved profitable.\n  By 1817, he had earned enough money to purchase freedom for his wife. \nAnd in 1819, he bought his own freedom--and set out to build a life for \nhimself, as a free American. That is the story of Frank McWorter.\n  So, when he started the town of New Philadelphia in 1836, he \naccomplished something truly remarkable and unique. He became the first \nknown free African American in history to legally found and plan a \ntown.\n  And he used the proceeds from land sales to purchase freedom for 15 \nof his family members.\n  I invite my colleagues to imagine what life must have been like in \nNew Philadelphia in the mid-1800s. In pre-Civil War America--in a time \nwhen this country still legally permitted slavery--New Philadelphia, \nIL, was a place where people of all races lived and worked side by \nside.\n  Federal census records indicate that the town was populated by \nteachers, blacksmiths, merchants, cabinetmakers, and shoemakers. There \nwas a seamstress, a doctor, a wheelwright, and a carpenter. New \nPhiladelphia even had its own post office, which also served as a \nstagecoach stop.\n  Imagine what we could learn from studying this unique place, which \nexisted during such an important time.\n  An in-depth study of New Philadelphia could yield important \ninformation about what life was like in an integrated community during \nthat period. It could add new dimensions to our understanding of the \nhistory we share.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in preserving this historic \nsite, which was designated a National Historic Landmark last year.\n  But I believe it's time to take the next step to ensure that the \nextraordinary story of Frank McWorter and New Philadelphia is preserved \nfor generations to come.\n  I ask my colleagues to support S. 1629, a bill I have introduced to \ndirect the Secretary of the Interior to begin a Special Resource Study, \nwhich would determine whether the New Philadelphia site can be managed \nas a unit of the National Park Service.\n  Today, not much remains of the structures where the town's residents\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\nlived and worked. For passersby, the site is an open field just \nsoutheast of Springfield, IL.\n  But in 2004, a three-year National Science Foundation grant allowed \narchaeologists to explore this site for the first time. They found \nbuilding foundations, wells, pit cellars, and a total of more than \n65,000 artifacts. They recognized that these exciting discoveries have \nthe potential to yield even more information.\n  And if we pass this bill, and allow the Secretary of the Interior to \nevaluate the national significance and suitability of this site, we \ncould pave the way for its preservation as part of the National Park \nService.\n  We can re-discover the incredible history that has been hidden among \nthe prairie grass for more than a century.\n  We can reclaim the spirit that drove Frank McWorter--a man born into \nslavery--to reach for equality and opportunity, to establish himself \nand his family as free African Americans, in a time when freedom was \nextremely hard to come by, and to establish a thriving community--a \nplace of inter-racial peace and cooperation--in a dark period for race \nrelations in America.\n  I believe we must act to preserve this legacy. I believe we owe it to \nourselves--and to future generations of Americans--to examine the \nhistory of New Philadelphia, and the life of pioneers like Frank \nMcWorter.\n  Let us pass S. 1629, so we can better understand those who came \nbefore us. In the process, I have no doubt we will discover some \nremarkable things about ourselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Social Justice\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as a result of the greed, recklessness, \nand illegal behavior by a small number of executives on Wall Street, \nthe American people today are suffering through the most serious \neconomic conditions we have seen since the Great Depression of the \n1930s. Since the recession started in December of 2007, 8.4 million \nAmericans have lost their jobs and, while the official unemployment \nrate is 9.7 percent, according to the latest Gallup Poll, nearly 20 \npercent of the American workforce is either unemployed or \nunderemployed. In other words, we have people who are working, but they \nare working 20 hours when they need to be working 40 hours.\n  Further, long-term unemployment is soaring. Today, over 6 million \nAmericans have been unemployed for over 6 months, the highest on \nrecord. This is not a situation where people are losing their jobs and \na few weeks later they go out and get another job. People are losing \ntheir jobs and they cannot find another job, which is why it is so \nimportant that we extend unemployment benefits and so reprehensible \nthat there are those in this Chamber who have resisted that effort.\n  Today, there are fewer jobs in the United States than there were in \nthe year 2000, even though the workforce has grown by 12 million since \nthat time.\n  Today, we have the fewest manufacturing jobs than at any time since \nApril 1941, 8 months before the start of World War II.\n  Today, home foreclosures are the highest on record, turning the \nAmerican dream of home ownership into an American nightmare for \nmillions of our people.\n  Further--and we do not discuss this enough--in the United States \ntoday, we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of \nany major country on Earth. That means that while the middle class is \nin rapid decline, while poverty is increasing, the gap between the \npeople on top and everybody else is wider than in any other major \ncountry on Earth and growing wider.\n  The reality is, today the top 1 percent now earns more income than \nthe bottom 50 percent and the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the \nbottom 90 percent. Meanwhile, while the folks on Wall Street give \nthemselves tens and tens of millions of dollars in bonuses for having \ndestroyed our economy, the United States has, by far, the highest rate \nof childhood poverty among major countries. Almost one-quarter of our \nchildren today are dependent on food stamps. Approximately 19 percent \nof our kids are living in poverty, and one out of four kids in the \nUnited States, in order not to be hungry, is dependent on food stamps.\n  While the Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, recently talked about how ``the \nrecession is likely over,'' I urge him to meet with America's blue-\ncollar workers or those few people left who do manufacturing in this \ncountry. As the Boston Globe reported several months ago:\n\n       The recession has been more like a depression for blue-\n     collar workers, who are losing jobs much more quickly than \n     the nation as a whole. . . . [T]he nation's blue-collar \n     industries have slashed one in six jobs since 2007, compared \n     with about one in 20 for all industries, leaving scores of \n     the unemployed competing for the rare job opening in \n     construction or manufacturing, with many unlikely to work in \n     those fields again. . . .\n       Up to 70 percent of unemployed blue-collar workers have \n     lost jobs permanently, meaning their old jobs won't be there \n     when the economy recovers . . .\n\n  That is a staggering fact.\n  So when talking about the recession hurting people, it is hurting \nsome of the people who already are in the most serious trouble; people \nwho do not have a whole lot of money to begin with. That is what is \ngoing on in the real world today. But, sadly and significantly, what is \ngoing on today simply is an acceleration of what was going on the \nprevious 8 years. It is not like, oh, times were good, the middle class \nwas doing well, and, oops, the reckless behavior of Wall Street plunges \nus into a major recession.\n  What is not talked about enough is that this continues and \naccelerates a trend that has been going on for a number of years. \nDuring the 8 years of the Bush administration, here is what happened: \nOver 8 million Americans slipped out of the middle class and into \npoverty. Over 7 million Americans lost their health insurance.\n  Our Republican friends are vehemently objecting to us going forward \nin terms of health care. When they had the power, when they had the \nPresidency, when they had control over the House and the Senate, during \nthat period millions of Americans lost their health insurance. Do you \nrecall them coming forward and saying: We have to do something about \nthis crisis; more and more people are losing their insurance; more and \nmore people are unable to afford their insurance? I did not hear a \nword. But they are very vocal now. They are very loud: Stop it. We \ncannot do anything. No. No. No. They had their chance, and it is sad to \nsay that right now, all they can do is play the obstructionist role and \nbe the party of no.\n  I make this point not to just relive history but to understand where \nthe anger comes from today. It is not just in the last year and a half \nmillions more people lost their jobs, lost their health insurance. \nDuring the 8 years of President Bush, median household income declined \nby over $2,100--$2,100. So people came out of that period, from 2000 to \n2008, staggering. They were earning less than they did before that \ndecade began, and than they walked into the greed and recklessness of \nWall Street, which created a massive recession.\n  The Washington Post reported last January: The past decade was the \nworst for the U.S. economy in modern times. That was before the Wall \nStreet crash.\n  Let me say it again. The Washington Post last January: The past \ndecade was the worst for the U.S. economy in modern times. It was, \naccording to a wide range of data, a lost decade for American workers--\na lost decade for American workers.\n  There has been zero net job creation since December 1999. Imagine \nthat. Since December 1999, the country has grown zero jobs. Middle-\nincome households made less in 2008, when adjusted for inflation, than \nthey did in 1999. The number is sure to have declined further during a \ndifficult 2009.\n  So there you have it. You want to know why people are angry, why \npeople are frustrated, why people are pointing their finger at \nWashington and us and saying: Hey, we are in trouble: massive \nunemployment; real wages have gone down; people are working incredibly \nhard, if they are lucky enough to have a job; and, at the end of the \nday, they are worse off than they were 10 years ago.\n  According to a September 2009 article in USA Today--this is quite \nincredible--and these are statistics that we do not talk about enough: \nfrom 2000 to 2008, middle-class men experienced an 11.2-percent drop in \ntheir incomes. Can you imagine that. From 2000 to 2008,\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\nmiddle-class men experienced an 11.2-percent drop in their incomes, \nwhich amounts to a reduction of $7,700 after adjusting for inflation.\n  So imagine that you work hard for 8 years. At the end of those 8 \nyears, you have lost $7,700. Even worse, the USA Today article goes on \nto report that many age group Americans are poorer today than they were \nin the 1970s. We talk about the American dream and that parents work \nhard so that their kids will do better than they did.\n  Well, we are moving in the wrong direction. Today the average \nAmerican worker, or at least millions of American workers, in terms of \ninflation-accounted-for dollars are worse off than they were in the \n1970s.\n  Without going through all of the reasons the middle class is \ncollapsing and poverty is increasing, without going into great length \nabout the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, I think \nit is important to say a few words about our good friends on Wall \nStreet, people who have made it clear to everybody in this country that \nthe only thing they care about is making as much money as they possibly \ncan in any way they possibly can.\n  Recently, in the last several years, 40 percent of all profits in \nthis country went to the relatively few people in the financial \nindustry--40 percent of the profits. We have seen hedge fund managers \nand owners earning billions of dollars. We have seen CEOs of major Wall \nStreet banks being worth hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, \nall the while the middle class collapsed.\n  We have the highest rate of childhood poverty. Millions of people are \nlosing their health insurance.\n  We talk about people living in a gated community, people living in \nvery expensive homes protected by armed guards and surrounded by gates, \ndriving around in their chauffeured limousines, getting into their \nprivate jets, having no clue about what is going on in the real world. \nThat is what Wall Street is about. They are engaged in producing \nesoteric financial instruments which very few people understand which \nare producing nothing real in the real world. They are not creating \nreal jobs. They are not creating real products, real services. They are \na gambling casino whose function in life is to make more money for the \npeople who own that casino.\n  Now, after we deal with health care, and I hope we can finish that as \nsoon as possible, the issue of financial reform is going to come into \nthis Chamber. I hope very much that we can respond to the frustration \nand the anger of the American people about what Wall Street has done \nand promise them, through legislation, that those people will never \nagain get away with the crimes they have committed against the working \nfamilies of this country.\n  Let me suggest a few of the areas I think a serious and real \nfinancial reform bill should address. Every week I hear from \nconstituents in Vermont, and I suspect you hear from constituents in \nIllinois who say: How in God's name can these large financial \ninstitutions we bailed out with our tax dollars now charge us 25 or 30 \npercent interest rates on their credit cards?\n  I hear this all of the time. And let's be clear. When a large bank--\nand about two-thirds of the credit cards in this country are issued by \nthe four largest financial institutions in America--when a large \nfinancial institution is charging a working American 25 or 30 percent \ninterest on their credit cards, we have to be very clear and call that \nwhat it is. That is loan sharking; that is usury; that is immoral.\n  The Bible, in all of the major religions--Christianity, Judaism, \nIslam, all of them--talk about the fact that usury is immoral; that you \ncannot lend money at excessive rates to struggling people who need that \nmoney to survive. That is what is happening today.\n  The loan sharks today are not gangsters out on the street who break \nkneecaps. These are guys in three-piece suits who, in some cases, make \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year by stealing money from working \npeople through excessively high interest rates.\n  The middle class is collapsing, poverty is increasing, and often, in \norder to deal with the day-to-day needs of a family, whether it is \nfood, whether it is gas to get to work, whether it is money to heat \ntheir homes, people are using credit cards. To be charged 25 or 30 \npercent is simply immoral, in my view, and it is something that has to \nbe eliminated.\n  As you know, a number of States all over the country have passed \nusury laws. But as a result of the Marquette Supreme Court decision a \nnumber of years ago, these credit card companies go to certain States--\nSouth Dakota--where there are no usury laws and charge anything they \nwant, all over the country. They have nullified State usury laws.\n  Well, you know what. We need a national usury law. We have to say \nstraight out it is immoral; it is wrong to be charging working people \n20, 25, 30, 35 or more percent interest rates on their credit cards. As \npart of any serious finance reform legislation, the American people \nhave to know we are going to end usury.\n  My view is--and I have introduced legislation to this effect--that we \nshould do for the private banks what we do with credit unions right \nnow: 15 percent max, except under certain circumstances, which now take \nthem up to 18 percent. No more 25 percent. No more 30, 40, 50 percent. \nNo more payday lending. We are going to end that.\n  I think that has to be incorporated into any serious financial reform \nlegislation. Any part of a serious financial reform bill has to deal \nwith the need to increase transparency at the Federal Reserve.\n  I will never forget, about a year ago, the Chairman of the Fed, Ben \nBernanke, came before the Budget Committee on which I serve. I asked \nhim if he could tell us which banks received trillions of dollars in \nzero interest or almost-zero interest loans, trillions of dollars, \nplacing the taxpayers of this country at risk.\n  Mr. Bernanke said: No, I am not going to tell you that. Well, we have \nintroduced legislation to demand that he tell us. The American people \nhave a right to know which financial institutions have received \ntrillions of dollars in loans. One of the great scams of our time--you \nwant to talk about welfare. There is abuse. These are ``welfare \nqueens.'' We have heard that expression before. Those guys are getting \nzero-interest loans from the Fed, or maybe they were paying one-half of \n1 percent, and then they go out and lend that money to the Federal \nGovernment, they buy government securities at 3\\1/2\\ or 4 percent, \nhaving taken money from the government at zero percent or half a \npercent. How is that? You get a nice spread there. You have a 3-percent \nspread on that. The money that you are lending is guaranteed by the \nfaith and credit of the United States, never once failed. That is a \npretty good deal. We give you money at zero interest, and you go out \nand get guaranteed money at 3 percent. Not a bad deal. That is welfare \nfor billionaires, and that is unacceptable.\n  We have a right to know which financial institutions are engaged in \nthat. Most importantly, we have to end that right now. So we need \ntransparency at the Fed. They cannot continue to operate in that kind \nof secrecy.\n  We also have to end the too-big-to-fail phenomena. Here is a fact \nthat I think many Americans do not know; that is, while we bailed out \nWall Street because institutions were too big to fail--if they went \ndown, they would take the whole economy with them--well, guess what. A \nyear later, three out of the four financial institutions are bigger \ntoday than before we bailed them out.\n  Now, what am I missing? It does not make a whole lot of sense to me. \nNot only that, not only are they a greater danger to the economy today \nthan they were before, but there is something else which is going on \nwhich we also do not talk about too much. Maybe as the only Independent \nin the Senate--I am not a Democrat or Republican. Maybe it is my job to \nbe raising these issues, but somebody has to raise them; that is, the \ntop four financial institutions in this country have enormous amounts \nof economic power over this country.\n  As I mentioned earlier, they issue two-thirds of all of the credit \ncards in this country. Does that sound like a very competitive \nsituation to you? The four largest financial institutions issue two-\nthirds of the credit cards in America. I do not think that is a healthy \nthing for our economy.\n  So not only do we have to end this, these huge financial \ninstitutions, because they are too big to fail, but we\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\nalso have to allow for increased competition within the banking \nindustry, in doing away with this huge concentration of ownership. Not \nonly do the top four--which is JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells \nFargo, and Citigroup--issue two-thirds of the credit cards, they also \nissue half of the mortgages. I don't think that is a healthy state for \nthis country. We have to start breaking up these guys.\n\n  The last point I would make is maybe the most important. In Vermont \nand all over the country, small and medium-size businesses are in \ndesperate need of capital, of affordable loans so they can better \nproduce the products and services they need and, in fact, create the \njobs our economy desperately needs. I am sure the case is similar in \nIllinois, but in Vermont, I have small businesses coming into my office \nsaying they can't get the credit they need to expand and create jobs.\n  You have Wall Street operating as a gambling casino, selling and \nplaying with esoteric financial instruments. It is time they started \ninvesting in a productive economy and creating jobs.\n  The American people are hurting. They are suffering through a \nterrible moment economically. People are wondering whether, for the \nfirst time in the modern history of America, our kids will have a lower \nstandard of living than their parents. This is the reverse of what the \nAmerican dream is about. People are wondering how they will be able to \nafford to send their kids to college, how they will pay for childcare, \nhow they will pay for the mortgage on their home, when they are either \nlosing their jobs or real wages are going down.\n  They are looking to Washington. They are becoming increasingly \nfrustrated by the Republican party of no which seems to gain \nsatisfaction every time they can stop legislation which attempts to \naddress real problems, whether it is health care, jobs, extending \nunemployment benefits. It is no, no, no from the Republicans.\n  The American people are beginning to catch on that there have been a \nrecord number of filibusters in this session, a recordbreaking number \nof obstructionist tactics. What the American people are saying is: Hey, \nCongress, Mr. President, we are hurting. We need action or else the \nmiddle class is not going to survive.\n  As difficult as it is, as much as we understand that when we \nderegulated Wall Street, they spent $5 billion in 10 years in lobbying \nand campaign contributions, making sure the Congress did what Wall \nStreet wanted--in 2009, Wall Street spent $300 million on lobbying. I \ndon't know how you spend $300 million on lobbying. There are 100 \nMembers in the Senate and 435 in the House. These guys will spend and \nspend and spend to make sure Congress does nothing to prevent them from \ngoing on their merry way of doing whatever they want without any \nserious kind of regulation.\n  In these difficult moments, I hope the Senate and the House will \nsummon the courage to do the job we were elected to do and what we are \npaid to do, and that is to represent working families and the middle \nclass and not only big money and Wall Street.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3548\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 3548 be designated as a Pryor amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, earlier today the senior Senator from \nOklahoma incorrectly claimed that an article entitled, ``McCain Breaks \nOwn Pork Rule'' that ran in Roll Call on November 6, 2003, proved that \nI had broken my pledge against requesting earmarks. However, the \nSenator failed to mention that Roll Call subsequently ran a correction \nto this article on November 17, 2003, stating that, ``the article \ninaccurately stated that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) violated his own \nrules against so-called ``pork barrel'' spending.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that the entirety of the original story and, more importantly, \nthe correction published in Roll Call be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Roll Call, Nov. 6, 2003]\n\n                          Correction Appended\n\n                           (By Emily Pierce)\n\n       After years of crusading against ``pork-barrel'' spending \n     projects in Congressional appropriations bills, Sen. John \n     McCain (R-Ariz.) may be breaking his own rules.\n       McCain pushed for, and got, $14.3 million for Arizona's \n     Luke Air Force Base inserted into the just-completed fiscal \n     2004 military construction appropriations conference report.\n       The only problem is the project to acquire more land near \n     the base was not requested by President Bush or fully \n     authorized by the Senate Armed Services Committee--two of \n     McCain's criteria for identifying so-called ``pork.''\n       ``Even though this project is in clear violation of the \n     McCain rule because it was not authorized nor requested, we \n     are happy to provide the funds at his request and the request \n     of other members of the Arizona delegation,'' said House \n     Appropriations Committee spokesman John Scofield.\n       Scofield also noted that the provision may violate other \n     tenets of McCain's ``pork'' rules because the purpose of the \n     funds--to acquire land to prevent the encroachment of \n     residential development near the base's live-fire range--is \n     not included in Defense's long-term strategic plans and may \n     not be achievable within a five-year time frame.\n       Senate Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who \n     has bitterly fought McCain's repeated attempts to strike even \n     the smallest of pork projects during Senate floor debate on \n     appropriations, was blithe about the news that McCain had \n     secured an earmark for his own state.\n       ``One man's pork is another man's alternate white meat,'' \n     said Stevens. ``We don't discriminate. . . . If he asked for \n     it, we put it in.''\n       McCain defended his actions, saying he first sought \n     authorization for the measure in the fiscal 2004 Defense \n     Department authorization bill.\n       ``The fact that the appropriations bill may [be sent to the \n     president] before the authorization bill is not relevant to \n     my point of view, because we did the authorization before we \n     did the appropriations bill,'' McCain said of the order the \n     bills came to the Senate floor.\n       McCain, who sits on the Armed Services Committee in charge \n     of devising the Defense Department authorization, said he has \n     little control over the process once it passes the Senate \n     floor.\n       ``It was my job to get it authorized,'' he said. ``So I had \n     no involvement after that.''\n       Part of the problem is that the Defense authorization bill, \n     which gives the Appropriations committees the official \n     authority to dole out money to the Pentagon, has been stalled \n     in conference negotiations for months over various issues, \n     most notably McCain's insistence that an Air Force-Boeing \n     lease deal be scrapped.\n       McCain has charged that the Boeing deal to lease 100 tanker \n     planes over several years would cost much more than simply \n     buying the planes outright. Meanwhile, the Defense Department \n     has argued that the plan will expend less money in the short-\n     term and that they don't currently have enough money to buy \n     the planes.\n       While Armed Services negotiators in both chambers say they \n     have made some progress toward resolving their differences on \n     the Boeing lease deal and other issues, it is unclear whether \n     the bill will actually become law this year.\n\n                       Correction: Nov. 17, 2003\n\n       The article inaccurately stated that Sen. John McCain (R-\n     Ariz.) violated his own rules against so-called ``pork \n     barrel'' spending. The Senate Parliamentarian's office \n     maintains that the provision was properly authorized in the \n     Senate-passed version of the fiscal 2004 Defense \n     authorization bill and did not need to be signed by the \n     president to be considered ``authorized,'' as the article \n     suggested. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), chairwoman of \n     the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction, \n     told Roll Call that McCain never specifically asked her to \n     put the $14.3 million project for Arizona's Luke Air Force \n     Base into the fiscal 2004 military construction bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1664-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \nimportant and essential role that health care professionals play in \nproviding quality health care across our Nation. Our Nation's health \ncare system is complex and people with many different health needs are \nserved by the diverse group of caring, qualified professionals in the \nallied health fields. Some of these important health practitioners \ninclude respiratory therapists, music therapists, athletic trainers, \nclinical laboratory scientists, radiologic technologists, medical \nassistants and many others. There are more than 100 distinct \noccupations in the health professions, in addition to physicians and \nnurses.\n  These dedicated health professionals are expert in a multitude of \ntherapeutic, diagnostic, and preventive health interventions and \nwellness initiatives in diverse settings. These professionals work in \ndisease prevention and control, dietary and nutritional services, \nmental and physical health promotion, rehabilitation and health systems \nmanagement. They can be found in community, school and athletic \ntraining clinics, long-term and rehabilitation facilities, hospitals, \nlaboratories, hospice, and private homes.\n  These health professionals represent about 60 percent of the health \ncare workforce and approximately 6 million jobs. According to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, 10 of the 20 fastest growing occupations \nfor 2008-2018 are in the health professions.\n  With many of these fields facing critical workforce shortages, it is \nessential that we work to increase awareness of the great career \nopportunities they offer, especially for racial/ethnic minorities. We \nalso need to support the educational programs that will produce our \nfuture caregivers. Recent stimulus funding, for example, will go to \ntrain 15,000 people nationwide in job skills for careers in health \ncare, IT, and other high-growth fields. In Park Forest, IL, Governors \nState University will use its $4.9 million grant to help unemployed, \ndislocated, and low-wage incumbent workers pursue careers in health \ncare.\n  I strongly support the vital role health care professionals play in \nour health care system, which could not function without their tireless \nefforts. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing this important \ngroup of professionals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1665-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1665-S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPARENCY AND SUNSHINE WEEK\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this week we celebrate Sunshine Week, not \nas a seasonal way to welcome the spring weather but as a time to mark \nthe importance of transparency in our government.\n  At the U.S. Helsinki Commission we monitor 56 countries, including \nthe United States, to ensure compliance with human rights and other \ncommitments made under the Helsinki Final Act.\n  A major part of that compliance rests on governments being open and \nacting transparently--the same focus that is at the heart of the \nAmerican Society of Newspaper Editors' Sunshine Week.\n  Practicing open governance is not something countries, States, and \ncities should do because they have to comply with some international \nagreement or public records law; rather, being transparent should be an \norganic part of providing a democratic government and empowering \ncitizens.\n  When President Obama began his Presidency he called for unprecedented \ntransparency. In his Open Government Directive, he outlined a clear \nplan for government to become more transparent, participatory, and \ncollaborative.\n  The logic is clear--only through transparency can people gain the \nknowledge needed to participate and hold their governments accountable. \nAnd only if the people participate can government collaborate with them \nto glean the best ideas.\n  This directive was bold and action-oriented, but sadly we have not \nseen the U.S. bureaucracy react with the same swiftness with which this \ndirective was made. Most agencies, in fact, have not made concrete \nchanges to comply with the directive, according to a government-wide \naudit released earlier this week by the National Security Archive based \nat the George Washington University.\n  It seems for all the White House is doing disclosing its visitors \nlog, broadcasting policy meetings, increasing interactivity through \ntownhall meetings and YouTube interviews--a lot of work remains at the \nagencies.\n  Most glaring to me are the delays and in some cases outright denials \nof Freedom of Information Act requests. I was surprised to learn in the \nNational Security Archive audit that some requests have been pending \nfor 18 years when the law very clearly calls for responses within 20 \nbusiness days when possible.\n  Most baffling from the audit may be what files still remain locked in \ngovernment vaults. For example, today--more than 20 years after the \nfall of the Berlin Wall--the Pentagon still has not responded to a \nrequest for records detailing the military's reaction in 1961 to the \nbuilding of the wall.\n  When it comes to diplomacy, this President and Secretary of State \nClinton deserve great praise for the work they have done around the \nworld to strengthen dialogue and improve U.S. relationships abroad. \nThis successful record, however, is slightly tarnished by the \nDepartment of State's efforts on open governance. The Department more \nthan doubled the number of denials it issued to people filing Freedom \nof\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\nInformation Act requests last year--the largest increase of any agency \nexcept for the Social Security Administration, which tripled its \ndenials.\n  Fourteen months is a short time to change a bureaucracy charged with \nmanaging countless records. But a handful of agencies have already \nshown it is possible and committed to open government changes. On top \nof other positive reforms, the Departments of Agriculture and Justice, \nthe Small Business Administration, and the Office of Management and \nBudget all increased how much information they released and decreased \nhow many requests they denied last year. These agencies have embraced \nthe spirit of transparency ushered in by President Obama, and as we \nmark Sunshine Week, I hope others will follow suit with their own \ninnovative ways to increase transparency and spur citizen involvement. \nAnd once agencies adopt these practices, I hope they stick with them--\nnot because they fulfill any Presidential directive but because they \ngive us a better democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1666-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MITCH ALBOM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 25 years ago, an article appeared in the \nDetroit Free Press sports section headlined, ``Give Me a Sporting \nChance, And I'll Give It Right Back.'' It was the debut column from a \nyoung writer just arrived from Florida, and he admitted to some nerves \nabout writing for his new audience. ``Starting tomorrow, I ask your \nattention, your reaction, your letters, your laughter and, once in a \nwhile, the benefit of the doubt,'' he wrote.\n  I doubt many Free Press readers knew that morning that they held the \nbeginning of a journalistic legend in their hands. And the writer \nhimself surely didn't know what he was starting. But thousands of \ncolumns, millions of laughs, more than a few tears, 28 million books, \nand dozens of awards later, Free Press sports columnist Mitch Albom has \nbecome a Detroit institution right alongside the beloved athletes he \nhas covered.\n  Recently, it was announced that Mitch Albom will receive the ultimate \naward for a sportswriter, the Red Smith Award from the Associated Press \nSports Editors. Smith, the legendary New York writer, once said his \ndemanding craft was really simple: ``All you do is sit down at a \ntypewriter and open a vein.'' And Mitch Albom is a worthy successor to \nthat legacy of writing with heart and emotion as well as style and \nprecision. In thrilling victories and painful losses, fans of \nMichigan's sports teams have seen 25 years of sports history through \nAlbom's observant eyes. They have gotten to know the State's towering \nsports figures--be they heroic, tragic, or both--through Albom's \nperceptive character sketches.\n  That careful attention to the human element of sports allowed Albom \nto branch out into other areas. His ``Tuesdays with Morrie'' is one of \nthe 100 best-selling books of all time. He is one of Michigan's most \nlistened-to radio hosts, and a regular on ESPN television. And as his \nsuccess has grown, so have his contributions to his community. His \ncharitable endeavors include efforts to help disadvantaged students \nstudy the arts, get health care to homeless families, and gather \nvolunteers for worthy local service projects. Recently, he labored \nmightily and successfully to get aid to earthquake victims in Haiti.\n  In winning the Red Smith Award, Albom joins a list of the most \nhonored names in sports journalism. The award speaks forcefully to the \nrespect of his professional peers. For Michigan readers, however, \nAlbom's ongoing legacy is his remarkable writing on the games and \nathletes who are so much a part of our State's identity and DNA and his \ncontributions to improving his community. I congratulate him on this \nlatest honor, and I thank him for 25 years of great journalism. The \nreaders of Michigan and the Nation look forward to many, many years \nmore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1666-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RON DZWONKOWSKI\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is a truism, a belief espoused by those \nof all political parties and persuasions, that the functioning of our \ndemocracy depends on an informed citizenry to make wise decisions at \nthe ballot box and hold elected officials accountable.\n  That means our system depends on careful, thoughtful, impartial \njournalists, those who bring to their work as much passion for \nknowledge and understanding as we bring to our advocacy for policies we \nsupport. In that difficult and necessary work, few Michigan journalists \nhave succeeded more than Ron Dzwonkowski of the Detroit Free Press, \nwhich is why the recent announcement of his selection to the Michigan \nJournalism Hall of Fame is so well-deserved.\n  For nearly three decades, Dzwonkowski has served the Free Press as an \neditor, editorialist, and columnist. His professional peers have \nawarded him a host of awards, including a Pulitzer Prize and a National \nHeadliner Award for work to which he has contributed. As an editor and \nwriter for the Free Press's editorial pages, he has shown a remarkable \ncommitment to accuracy, but just as important, a remarkable passion for \nsolving the problems of our city and State.\n  Whether he is praising an elected official or criticizing one, his \nwriting is grounded in a thorough understanding of the facts and a \ncommitment to looking out, above all, for the interests of Michigan's \ncitizens. His reporting, writing, and editing have made a significant \nand lasting difference in the lives of the readers he serves, and his \nselection to the State's hall of fame for journalists is a much-\ndeserved reward for a career of distinguished service, one I hope will \ncontinue for many, many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1666-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1666-S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BOB SCOTT\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the 80th birthday of a Maryland lacrosse \nlegend, Mr. Bob Scott, a former Johns Hopkins University athlete, \ncoach, and athletic director.\n  Lacrosse is the official team sport of Maryland and there is perhaps \nno other Marylander who has done as much for the game as Mr. Scott. His \n41-year career at Johns Hopkins, spanning from 1955 to 1995, were years \nof great success for Hopkins lacrosse as well as Blue Jays athletics in \ngeneral.\n  At a university that expects nothing less than dominance on the \nlacrosse field, Mr. Scott more than lived up to the high expectations. \nAs the head lacrosse coach from 1955 to 1974, Mr. Scott left a legacy \nthat will be hard to match. He led the Blue Jays to an unparalleled \nseven national championships, his players were recognized as first-team \nAll-Americans an outstanding 42 times, and he left his position with \n158 wins, more than any other head coach in program history.\n  Mr. Scott was a successful lacrosse player for Johns Hopkins from \n1948 to 1952 as well. During his playing days, he received national \nrecognition as the winner of the Penniman Award for outstanding play as \na midfielder and as an honorable mention All-American.\n  In addition to his playing and coaching acumen, Mr. Scott also wrote \nthe premier lacrosse book. ``Lacrosse: Technique and Tradition,'' \nwritten in 1976, still sits in lacrosse players' lockers and on \ncoaches' desks to this day. The book has since been translated into \nother languages and has given Mr. Scott the vehicle to become the \nsport's unofficial ambassador.\n  Mr. Scott is more than just a lacrosse legend, however. He helped \nbuild Hopkins into the division III powerhouse it is today. During his \n22-year tenure as director of athletics, the Blue Jays emerged as \nnational contenders in many different sports--including baseball, \nbasketball, fencing, swimming, and soccer--and Mr. Scott played a \npivotal role in successfully developing the women's athletics program \nthat continues to thrive today.\n  Most of Mr. Scott's life has been dedicated to sports, but he also \nspent 2 years in the U.S. Army after graduating from Johns Hopkins. He \nrose to the position of instructor in the Ranger Department and was \nstationed at Fort Benning, GA.\n  In honor of Mr. Scott's 80th birthday today--St. Patrick's Day--I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in recognizing the life of a great Marylander \nwho has served our country and has given so much of his time to help \nmold our Nation's student-athletes.\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1667-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR E.

I know he will be deeply missed by his \ncolleagues at Engineered Fabrics, which is one of the largest employers \nin Rockmart.\n  In addition to his impressive career, Terry has a long history of \ncommunity involvement in Polk County, where he is a well-respected and \ndedicated leader. Terry is a member of the Rotary and has been active \nin the Polk County Chamber of Commerce for a number of years. In \nparticular, he has served as an inspiration and a role model to the \nyoung men and women in the chambers Youth Leadership committee.\n  Terry has been a familiar face during the Polk Chambers annual trip \nto Washington, DC, over the years. He has been instrumental in ensuring \nmembers of the Polk County delegation had the opportunity to come to \nWashington and discuss important issues affecting the community with \nthe Georgia congressional delegation through his role as a host or \nsponsor of these Washington fly-ins.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize on the floor of the Senate, Terry Lindsey for his service to \nPolk County and to our great State of Georgia. He and his wife Jean \nhave earned the many happy years of retirement ahead of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1667-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING PATRICIA MALONE\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record of \nthe Senate the life of a wonderful lady and a great Georgian, Mrs. \nPatricia Malone. Her commitment to the aviation industry spanned more \nthan 50 years, affecting thousands of pilots through training \nstandards.\n  Patricia ``Mother'' Malone began her introduction into aviation began \nduring World War II when she was a link instrument training instructor \nfor the U.S. Navy, training fighter pilots in instrument flight \nprocedures. After the war, she was a civilian instructor for the U.S \nAir Force.\n  She went to work for Delta Air Lines in 1972 and moved her family \nfrom Quincy, MA, to Atlanta, GA. During her long career with Delta, she \ncreated the operations specification curriculum for the airline and \nserved as the manager of certificate compliance by the time she retired \nin 1994.\n  Patricia affected countless numbers of aviators through her work in \naeronautical charting, and she trained pilots from most of the major \nairlines as well as military pilots. She earned the nickname ``Mother'' \nMalone from her pilots because she did more than teach them instrument \nflying and FAA regulatory compliance; she was truly invested in the \nlives of those she taught.\n  During her retirement years she consulted with pilots and airline \nindustry professionals as well as lending her time to volunteering in \nher community. She selflessly gave her time to the YWCA of Cobb County, \nthe Delta Pioneer, American Business Womens Association, Goodwill \nIndustries, the American Red Cross, and her local board of elections.\n  Patricia W. ``Mother'' Malone passed away on August 12, 2008, at the \nage of 84. She is survived by her daughters, Alison, Peggy and Tricia, \nnine grandchildren, and one great grandson.\n  This year, Patricia will be posthumously inducted into the Georgia \nAviation Hall of Fame, and I cannot think of anyone more deserving of \nthis honor. It is only right that her accomplishments are permanently \nenshrined in Georgia's aviation history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1667-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THEODORE ELDRIDGE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

The award is \npresented each year by the Arkansas office of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's Farm Service Agency.\n  Theodore represents the best of our Arkansas values: hard work, \ndedication, and perseverance. He currently serves as the coordinator of \nthe University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff's 52-Acre Demonstration Farm. \nHe also works part-time for the UAPB Demonstration Outreach Center in \nMarianna and the East Arkansas Enterprise Community.\n  I have had the privilege of working closely with Theodore on several \nprojects for the USDA Rural Development Program, where he served as \ndistrict director in Forrest City, and later as the director of water \nand wastewater programs.\n  This past December, I was pleased to announce his appointment to \nserve on the Arkansas Farm Service Agency State Committee. He has since \nbeen elected chairman by the committee and has shown exemplary \nleadership for our State's farmers and ranchers as he ensures our \nproducers have the tools in place to produce a safe and affordable food \nsupply. Theodore plays a vital role in our State's rural communities as \nhe works to facilitate programs that will spur local economic \ndevelopment. He also oversees and informs local producers about USDA \nprograms.\n  As a seventh-generation Arkansan and farmer's daughter, and as \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I understand firsthand \nand appreciate the hard work and contributions of our Arkansas \nagriculture community. Agriculture is the backbone of Arkansas's \neconomy, creating more than 270,000 jobs in the State and providing \n$9.1 billion in wages and salaries. In total, agriculture contributes \nroughly $15.9 billion to the Arkansas economy each year.\n  I salute Theodore and the entire Arkansans agriculture community for \ntheir hard work and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1667-5", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1667-S1668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT MOORE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

He \nis survived by his wife of 58 years, Ruth Powell, and son Lee Powell of \nWashington, DC, who I have worked with in his role as the executive \ndirector of the Mississippi Delta Grassroots Caucus.\n  During his 30-year tenure at the Gazette, James fought to preserve \nthe journalistic principles of integrity and honesty. Among his \nmemorable writings, James penned a series of editorials during the \n1950s and 60s in support of the civil rights movement and opposing \nschool segregation. He chronicled Arkansas politics with clarity and \nthoughtfulness, including extensive coverage of Arkansas Governors \nWinthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers, and Bill Clinton.\n  After retiring from the Gazette in 1987, James continued to write a \nsyndicated column published in many Arkansas papers until 2000.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Judge \nMary Ann Gunn for her personal commitment and innovative approach to \npublic service in northwest Arkansas. Judge Gunn, who serves on the \nWashington County Circuit Court, received the 2009 FBI Director's \nCommunity Leadership Award.\n  The award, presented on behalf of the Director of the FBI, was \nestablished in 1990 to recognize individuals and organizations for \ntheir efforts in combating terrorism, drugs, and violence in America. \nIn addition to her duties as a circuit judge, Judge Gunn voluntarily \nserves as a judge for the Washington and Madison County Drug Court, in \nArkansas. Since 2000, the drug court has accepted first-time, \nnonviolent drug offenders into a nine month program of intensive \ncounseling and close supervision. When offenders successfully complete \nthe program, their criminal records are cleared of the drug offense.\n  Judge Gunn's courtroom is one of the most successful in the nation. \nHer drug court is regularly televised in Washington and Madison \nCounties, and is an excellent example of how the community, the courts, \nand law enforcement work together to reduce crime. In addition, she has \nheld drug court sessions in school gymnasiums to show students just \nwhere drug use can lead.

Mr. President, restaurants in my home State \nrecently celebrated the second annual Maine Restaurant Week from March \n1 through 10. This creative event is designed to offer Mainers and \nvisitors alike the opportunity to spend an evening out to try a new \nrestaurant at an affordable fixed price. After last year's success, \nwhere nearly 98 percent of attendees said the event met or exceeded \ntheir expectations, over 100 restaurants participated in this year's \ncelebration. I rise today to recognize one restaurant that took part in \nRestaurant Week, Fuel, that has helped to lead a renaissance in \ndowntown Lewiston.\n  In 2005, Eric Agren and his wife Carrie purchased the old Lyceum Hall \nin downtown Lewiston with the purpose of renovating the 135-year-old \ntheater, which is listed on the National Historic Register. The goal \nwas to transform the theater, vacant for over 50 years, into a cozy, \nwelcoming space while maintaining the historical nature of the \nbuilding. Mr. Agren, who is originally from the Lewiston-Auburn area, \nspent several years in Chicago working for a kitchen design company, \nwhich piqued his interest in the culinary arts, before returning home \nto pursue his longtime dream of opening a restaurant. The couple also \nturned the upstairs of the building into a 5,000-square-foot apartment. \nBecause of the Agrens' dedicated efforts, Fuel received historic \npreservation awards from the State of Maine and the city of Lewiston, \nboth in 2007.\n  Fuel's menu features French country cuisine with a close-to-home \ntwist. Starting with French classics like escargot, fondue, and French \nonion soup, the menu includes an eclectic mix of dishes from braised \nshort ribs and steak frites to roasted chicken and homemade macaroni \nand cheese. The Agrens describe Fuel's interior decor as ``urban \ncozy,'' with French vintage art, leather chairs in the bar, and butcher \npaper topping the tables. The restaurant received a 2008 Editor's \nChoice Award from Yankee Magazine, as well as Wine Spectator magazine's \nAward of Excellence for its exceptional wine list of over 100 \nselections. Fuel has also been the recipient of the Androscoggin County \nChamber of Commerce's President's Award and has received recognition as \nDowneast Magazine's Best Dining in Lewiston.\n  Since the opening of Fuel, several other restaurants have opened \nacross Lewiston, resulting in a burgeoning revival of the city's \ndowntown. Nearly a dozen new restaurants have entered the Lewiston \ndining scene in recent years, leading to increased traffic and a more \nvibrant atmosphere downtown, as well as creating new jobs. Indeed, to \ncontinue this trend, the Agrens soon plan to open another restaurant \njust down Lisbon Street from Fuel called Marche. In the process of \nrefurbishing the building, the couple also created a two-bedroom, \n2,000-square-foot apartment upstairs from the restaurant. As Mr. Agren \nrecently explained, he hopes these efforts bring new people to the \ndowntown area, and expects `` to see a small core of affiliated \nbusinesses sprout up--such as dry cleaners and specialty markets--that \nwould cater to a growing downtown population.''\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\n  Additionally, over the years, Fuel and other local eateries have \nparticipated in numerous community events, raising money for charities \nlike the Sisters of Charity Food Pantry and the American Heart \nAssociation. While these restaurants engage in healthy competition, \nthey are also team players when it comes to helping the community.\n  The renaissance of downtown Lewiston is well-documented, and a \nwelcome sign during these difficult economic times. And Eric and Carrie \nAgren have played a central role in spurring this critical development. \nI thank the Agrens for their commitment to the Twin Cities of Lewiston \nand Auburn, and I look forward to hearing about the continued success \nof their investments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1669-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1669-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1669-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:08 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4628.

A bill to enhance global healthcare cooperation and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Global \nHealthcare Cooperation Act of 2010. This legislation takes measured but \nimportant steps to enhance global healthcare cooperation and help \ndeveloping countries address public health challenges. The Global \nHealthcare Cooperation Act will bolster the ranks of healthcare workers \nserving in developing countries by enabling American legal permanent \nresidents to assist with overseas public health emergencies, and by \nresponsibly regulating the ``brain drain'' of skilled healthcare \nworkers from underdeveloped countries to the U.S. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see these provisions enacted into law.\n  While many nations are currently experiencing shortages of healthcare \npersonnel, the lack of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers in \nthe world's poorest nations is an urgent crisis. There are many factors \ncontributing to this crisis, but the massive ``brain drain'' of trained \nhealthcare workers from the poorest nations to the richest is a central \ncause. According to the World Health Organization, Africa loses 20,000 \nhealth professionals a year as part of this brain drain. In Ethiopia, \nfor example, there are only 1,806 doctors serving a population of 80 \nmillion. By comparison, there are 5,074 doctors serving the 600,000 \nresidents of Washington D.C., and 17,507 doctors serving the 5.3 \nmillion residents of Cook County in my home state of Illinois. The \nshortage of healthcare personnel is considered the single biggest \nobstacle to fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa. Healthcare worker shortages \nare particularly devastating when nations are confronted with natural \ndisasters and other humanitarian crises, such as the recent Haiti \nearthquake.\n  I again saw this problem first hand during a trip to east Africa that \nI took last month with Senator Sherrod Brown. In places such as \nTanzania and Ethiopia the story was the same--in countries already in \ndesperate need of health workers, many were instead leaving for work in \nother countries. Many are being recruited to work in the U.S. and in \nother wealthy nations.\n  We should do what we can here in the U.S. to make sure these talented \nhealth professionals are free to return temporarily to help in \ncountries with urgent health needs without jeopardizing their \nimmigration status. We should also ensure they have met all medical \ncare obligations in their home countries that may have been tied to \ntheir health training.\n  The Global Healthcare Cooperation Act would take two steps to address \nthese challenges. The first part of the bill would allow a healthcare \nworker who is a legal permanent resident in the U.S. to temporarily \nprovide healthcare services in a country that is underdeveloped or that \nhas suffered a disaster or public health emergency without jeopardizing \nhis or her immigration status in the U.S. Specifically, the bill would \nallow legal permanent resident healthcare workers to work in qualifying \ncountries for up to 36 months without running afoul of the continuous \nresidency requirement for naturalization. This provision will allow \nimmigrants in our country to lend their skills to overseas disaster \nrelief and public health crises while still pursuing their dream of \nAmerican citizenship.\n  The second part of this legislation would require a foreigner who is \npetitioning to work in the U.S. as a healthcare worker to attest that \nhe or she has satisfied any outstanding obligation to his or her home \ncountry\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\nunder which the foreigner received money for medical training in return \nfor a commitment to work in that country for a period of years. In \nexchange for financial support for their education or training, some \nforeign doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers have signed \nvoluntary bonds or made promises to their governments to remain in \ntheir home countries or to return from their studies abroad and work in \nthe healthcare profession. The bill provides that the petitioner must \nsatisfy any outstanding obligation in order to be eligible for \nadmission into the U.S., though the bill is flexible in allowing the \npetitioner to reach agreement with the home country in order to satisfy \nhis or her commitment. The legislation provides a waiver in cases of \ncoercion by the home country government or other extraordinary \ncircumstances. The goal of this provision is to ensure that foreign \ncountries do not invest money in healthcare workers who then renege on \ncommitments to work in their country without satisfying their \ncommitment.\n  The small but important steps contained within the Global Healthcare \nCooperation Act will help save lives, and will demonstrate America's \nleadership in the effort to improve the health of people across the \nglobe. The provisions in this legislation have previously passed the \nSenate twice, as part of the 2006 immigration reform bill and the 2007 \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill, but have not yet become law. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the enactment of these important provisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This order \n     shall be effective on issuance.\n       (2) Special rule.--If the date specified for the submission \n     of a Presidential order under subsection (a) falls on a \n     Sunday or legal holiday, such order shall be issued on the \n     following day.\n       (c) Effects of Sequestration.--The effects of sequestration \n     shall be as follows:\n       (1) Budgetary resources sequestered from any account shall \n     be permanently cancelled, except as provided in paragraph \n     (5).\n       (2) Except as otherwise provided, the same percentage \n     sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and \n     activities within a budget account (with programs, projects, \n     and activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or \n     accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering \n     that account).\n       (3) Administrative regulations or similar actions \n     implementing a sequestration shall be made within 120 days of \n     the sequestration order. To the extent that formula \n     allocations differ at different levels of budgetary resources \n     within an account, program, project, or activity, the \n     sequestration shall be interpreted as producing a lower total \n     appropriation, with the remaining amount of the appropriation \n     being obligated in a manner consistent with program \n     allocation formulas in substantive law.\n       (4) Except as otherwise provided in this part, obligations \n     or budgetary resources in sequestered accounts shall be \n     reduced only in the fiscal year in which a sequester occurs.\n       (5) Budgetary resources sequestered in special fund \n     accounts and offsetting collections sequestered in \n     appropriation accounts shall not be available for obligation \n     during the fiscal year in which the sequestration occurs, but \n     shall be available in subsequent years to the extent \n     otherwise provided in law.\n       (d) Submission and Availability of Reports.--Each report \n     required by this section shall be submitted, in the case of \n     CBO, to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and OMB \n     and, in the case of OMB, to the House of Representatives, the \n     Senate, and the President on the day it is issued.

LIMITS.\n\n       (a) Discretionary Spending Limits.--As used in this \n     subtitle, the term ``non-security discretionary spending \n     limit'' shall have the same meaning as in section 316 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (b) Enforcement.--\n       (1) Sequestration.--On the date specified in section \n     212(a), there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-\n     year breach.\n       (2) Eliminating a breach.--Each non-security discretionary \n     account shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by \n     multiplying the enacted level of budget authority for that \n     year in that account at that time by the uniform percentage \n     necessary to eliminate a breach of the discretionary spending \n     limit.\n       (3) Part-year appropriations.--If, on the date the report \n     is issued under paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act \n     making continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year \n     for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration \n     calculated for that account under paragraph (2) shall be \n     subtracted from--\n       (A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in \n     that account under that or a subsequent part-year \n     appropriation; and\n       (B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is \n     enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year \n     appropriation.\n       (4) Look-back.--If, after June 30, an appropriation for the \n     fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach for \n     that year (after taking into account any previous \n     sequestration), the discretionary spending limit for the next \n     fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of that breach.\n       (5) Within-session sequestration reports and order.--If an \n     appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after \n     Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and \n     before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach, 10 \n     days later CBO shall issue a report containing the \n     information required in section 221(c). Fifteen days after \n     enactment, OMB shall issue a report containing the \n     information required in section 221(c).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 460, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 460) recognizing the importance of \n     the Long Trail and the Green Mountain Club on the 100th \n     anniversary of the Long Trail.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will agree to \nthis resolution commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Long Trail \nand the Green Mountain Club. In March 1910, James P. Taylor, a teacher \nfrom Vermont, fulfilled a dream held by many when he founded the Green \nMountain Club, and created a long-distance trail to extend from \nMassachusetts to Canada.\n  Spanning over 273 miles, the Long Trail is the oldest long-distance \nhiking trail in the United States, and has survived many floods, \nhurricanes, and harsh Vermont winters. The Long Trail's scenic and \nvaried landscapes, from the alpine peaks of Camel's Hump and Mount \nMansfield, to quiet woodland trails and mountain streams, have \ndelighted countless tourists who have visited the Green Mountain state. \nSeveral Senators, a Secretary of Agriculture, and even a President have \nall enjoyed the trail.\n  It is only through the hard work of the thousands of Green Mountain \nClub volunteers that the Long Trail has flourished and grown during the \nlast century. The Green Mountain Club has resisted efforts to build \nhighways or commercial developments that intersect with the Long Trail, \nand helped to maintain pristine Vermont forestland that we all love for \nfuture generations to enjoy. They have protected the habitat of many \nimportant woodland species, including the black bear, the moose, the \nbobcat, and migratory songbirds.\n  I was pleased to secure funding to help the Green Mountain Club \nrenovate their headquarters and visitors center in 2008 in anticipation \nof the centennial, so that Vermonters and tourists alike can enjoy \nVermont's natural beauty for another 100 years. I join with all \nVermonters, and the thousands of people from across the United States \nand around the world who have enjoyed the beauty of the Long Trail, in \ncelebrating this centennial celebration.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 460) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 460\n\n       Whereas the Long Trail is the oldest long-distance hiking \n     trail in the United States;\n       Whereas the Long Trail stretches over 273 miles, from the \n     Massachusetts to Canadian borders, with approximately 175 \n     miles of side trails and more than 65 shelters;\n       Whereas the Long Trail has achieved the dream of founder \n     James Taylor of creating ``a high highway, a mountain \n     footpath over the skyline of Vermont'';\n       Whereas the Green Mountain Club is the founder, sponsor, \n     defender, and protector of the Long Trail;\n       Whereas the Green Mountain Club has delivered 100 years of \n     conservation, community education, and outreach on local \n     ecology;\n       Whereas the Long Trail has protected the habitat of many \n     important species for future generations, including the black \n     bear, the moose, the bobcat, and migratory songbirds;\n       Whereas the thousands of members and dedicated volunteers \n     of the Green Mountain Club have worked to maintain, manage, \n     and protect the Long Trail for the benefit of the people of \n     the State of Vermont during the last century;\n       Whereas the Long Trail is a popular tourist destination for \n     people from around the world, including Senators, a Secretary \n     of Agriculture, and even a President;\n       Whereas the Long Trail allows the people of the State of \n     Vermont and tourists to enjoy the Green Mountain State and \n     all the beauty and history the State has to offer;\n       Whereas the Green Mountain Club has successfully conserved \n     the entire corridor of the Long Trail, fought efforts to \n     build highways or commercial developments that intersect with \n     the Long Trail, and helped to maintain pristine Vermont \n     forestland for future generations to enjoy; and\n       Whereas the Green Mountain Club has recognized members \n     regardless of sex or race since the founding of the club: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 100th anniversary \n     of the Long Trail of the\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\n     State of Vermont, the oldest long-distance hiking trail in \n     the United States, and applauds the Green Mountain Club and \n     the many volunteers of the Green Mountain Club for a century \n     of service and for creating, protecting, and enjoying the \n     Long Trail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/17/senate-section/article/S1680-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRESSIONAL AWARD PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, prior to making the next unanimous consent \nrequest, I wish to make a statement on the Record relative to the bill \nthat I will be asking for unanimous consent on. It is S. 1789.\n  This bill is known as the Fair Sentencing Act. It is bipartisan \nlegislation which has cleared both sides. At the conclusion of my \nremarks, I will, of course, ask for unanimous consent, but will ask \npermission, if possible, that the statement of Senator Sessions be \nprinted in the Record. I don't know if he will be able to make it this \nevening, but if not, we will do our best to accommodate him.\n  The Fair Sentencing Act would reduce the sentencing disparity between \ncrack and powder cocaine and increase penalties for serious drug \noffenders. Crack and powder cocaine have a devastating effect on \nfamilies in America, and tough anti-cocaine legislation is definitely \nneeded, but the law must also be fair. Current law is based on an \nunjustified distinction between crack and powder cocaine. Simply \npossessing five grams of crack--the equivalent of five tiny packets of \nsugar that you find in restaurants--carries the same sentence as \nselling 500 grams of powder cocaine. That is 500 packets of sugar. Five \npackets for crack; 500 packets for powder, the same sentence. This is \nknown as the 100-to-1 disparity.\n  I can remember as a Member of the House of Representatives when we \nenacted this legislation. Crack cocaine had just appeared on the scene \nand it scared us, because it was cheap and it was addictive. We thought \nit was more dangerous than many narcotics and left the legacy of crack \nbabies and broken lives. In our response to this terrible new narcotic \nat the time, we enacted this sentencing disparity, saying that 5 five \ngrams of crack cocaine would lead to the same sentence as 500 grams of \npowder cocaine. What it has meant is that, unfortunately, in the years \nthat followed, we have seen people sent to prison for extended periods \nof time for possessing--merely possessing--the smallest amount of \ncrack.\n  Disproportionately, African Americans who are addicted use crack \ncocaine. The use of powder cocaine is spread across the population \namong Whites, Hispanics, and others. So the net result of this was that \nthe heavy\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nsentencing we enacted years ago took its toll primarily in the African-\nAmerican community. It resulted in the incarceration of thousands of \npeople because of this heavy sentencing disparity and a belief in the \nAfrican-American community that it was fundamentally unfair. It was the \nsame cocaine, though in a different form, and they were being singled \nout for much more severe and heavy sentences. This debate went on and \non and on. African Americans make up about 30 percent of crack users in \nAmerica, but they make up more than 80 percent of those who have been \nconvicted of Federal crack offenses.\n  Law enforcement experts say that the crack-powder disparity \nundermines trust in the criminal justice system, especially in the \nAfrican-American community. In a hearing I held last year, Asa \nHutchinson, a former Member of Congress who was also head of the Drug \nEnforcement Administration during the Bush administration, testified \nand he said:\n\n       Under the current disparity, the credibility of our entire \n     drug enforcement system is weakened.\n\n  The bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission and the Judicial Conference \nof the United States support reducing this disparity. According to the \nSentencing Commission, this:\n\n     would better reduce the gap in sentencing between blacks and \n     whites than any other single policy change, and it would \n     dramatically improve the fairness of the Federal sentencing \n     system.\n\n  That comes from the Sentencing Commission.\n  The Fair Sentencing Act, which I will call up for unanimous consent \nmomentarily, would reduce the current 100-to-1 disparity to basically \n18 to 1. The Fair Sentencing Act would also eliminate the 5-year \nmandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine.\n  Incidentally, this is the only mandatory minimum for simple \npossession of a drug by a first-time offender. For this one form of \nnarcotics, persons who were found in simple possession of crack cocaine \nliterally faced years in prison for that possession without any \nevidence that they were selling it or involved in any other way.\n  There is a bipartisan consensus that current cocaine sentencing laws \nare unjust. Now Democrats and Republicans have come together to address \nthe issue in a bipartisan way. Last week, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reported the Fair Sentencing Act by a unanimous 19-to-0 vote. \nThe bill is cosponsored by 16 of the 19 members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. This is the first time the Senate Judiciary Committee has \never reported a bill to reduce the crack-powder disparity, and if this \nbill is enacted into law, it will be the first time since 1970--40 \nyears ago--that Congress has repealed a mandatory minimum sentence.\n  Here is what Attorney General Eric Holder said last week in response:\n\n       The bill voted unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee today makes progress toward achieving a more just \n     sentencing policy while maintaining the necessary law \n     enforcement tools to appropriately punish violent and \n     dangerous drug traffickers. I look forward to the Senate and \n     the House approving this legislation quickly so that it can \n     be signed into law.\n\n  The Fair Sentencing Act is supported by law enforcement groups, \nincluding the National District Attorneys Association, representing \n40,000 State and local prosecutors; the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, representing 240,000 law enforcement officers; and the \nInternational Union of Police Associations, representing more than \n100,000 law enforcement officials.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee for \nsupporting the Fair Sentencing Act. I especially wish to thank the \nfollowing Members who have done an extraordinary job over the last year \nduring which we have worked to reach this bipartisan agreement. First, \nthe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Pat Leahy. He is a great \nleader and a patient man. This bill has been sitting on a calendar for \nweeks and he keeps coming to me and saying: Durbin, when are we going \nto have this ready?\n  I said: Mr. Chairman, we are working on it.\n  He had the patience of Job.\n  I especially wish to thank my friend from Alabama, the Judiciary \nCommittee ranking member, Jeff Sessions. If asked if there are two \npoliticians on the floor of the Senate who are dramatically different, \nyou couldn't find two any more different than Dick Durbin and Jeff \nSessions. We seldom agree on things, but we came together on this, and \nwe made mutual concessions to come up with a good bipartisan bill. \nJeff, I think, went the extra mile to find some agreement here. He held \nto his principles, but we worked it out.\n  In the process of reaching that agreement, I wish to also thank some \nRepublican Members who were invaluable. Lindsey Graham was one of the \nfirst to come up to me and say, I want to work with you on this. There \nhas to be a way we can work this out to the satisfaction of law \nenforcement and to reach the standards of justice. I thank Senator \nLindsey Graham, the Republican from South Carolina, for all the work he \nput into it.\n  Tom Coburn of Oklahoma is another Senator I disagree with so many \ntimes politically. He went the extra mile on this. I know it meant a \nlot to him and he was very helpful.\n  Finally, Orrin Hatch from Utah. Senator Hatch from the beginning \nsaid, Don't quit, stick with it, we can reach an agreement. He was an \ninspiration to us as we brought this to a conclusion.\n  We have talked about the need to address the crack-powder disparity \nfor too long. Every day that passes without taking action to solve this \nproblem is another day that people are being sentenced under a law that \nvirtually everyone agrees is unjust. I wish this bill went further. My \ninitial bill established a 1-to-1 ratio, but this is a good bipartisan \ncompromise. If this bill is enacted into law, it will immediately \nensure that every year, thousands of people are treated more fairly in \nour criminal justice system. I hope my colleagues, when they hear about \nour efforts on this, will join in supporting our efforts to deal with \nthis disparity.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement by \nWade Henderson, president of The Leadership Conference, in support of \nthe bill that is currently being considered by the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Wade Henderson, president of The Leadership Conference on \n     Civil and Human Rights, issued the following statement \n     regarding the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote on March 11 \n     to amend and pass The Fair Sentencing Act (S. 1789).\n       For nearly two decades, The Leadership Conference has \n     fought for the complete elimination of the unjustified and \n     racially discriminatory disparity in sentencing between the \n     crack and powder forms of cocaine. This disparity subverts \n     justice, undermines confidence in our criminal justice \n     system, and wreaks havoc on the African-American community. \n     We strongly supported Senator Dick Durbin's bill, S. 1789, \n     which would have completely eliminated the disparity.\n       While we are disappointed that the goal of complete \n     elimination has not yet been accomplished and that \n     discrimination will remain, The Leadership Conference \n     considers the Senate Judiciary Committee's unanimous passage \n     of the amended version of S. 1789, which reduces the \n     disparity from a ratio of 100-to-1 to 18-to-1, to be a step \n     forward.\n       This legislation represents progress but not the end of the \n     fight. As Dr. King said, An unjust law is a code that is out \n     of harmony with the moral law. We are committed to redoubling \n     our efforts to obtain complete elimination of this sentencing \n     disparity--the only fair and just solution.\n       We applaud Senator Durbin for his persistence in seeking \n     real reform, along with Chairman Patrick Leahy and Senator \n     Jeff Sessions for their steadfast commitment to addressing \n     this issue. We appreciate the contributions of Senator \n     Lindsey Graham toward finding a resolution. We want to note \n     Senator Ben Cardin's continued commitment to the complete \n     elimination of the disparity and Senator Russ Feingold's \n     courageous vote against the amendment. We also want to \n     recognize the leadership of Representative Bobby Scott and \n     the Congressional Black Caucus, who have served as the \n     conscience of Congress on this issue.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 316, S. 1789.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1789) to restore fairness to Federal cocaine \n     sentencing.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \namendment\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nto strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the \nfollowing:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, I join Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle to pass the historic and bipartisan Fair Sentencing Act.\n  The racial imbalance that has resulted from the cocaine sentencing \ndisparity disparages the Constitution's promise of equal treatment for \nall Americans. Although this bill is not perfect, its passage marks a \nsignificant step forward in making our drug laws fairer and more \nrational. Despite my belief that parity was the better policy, I have \njoined with Senator Durbin and support the progress represented by his \ncompromise with Senator Sessions. It reduces the disparities that leave \nsome in jail for years while their more privileged counterparts go home \nafter relatively brief sentences. Today, that compromise means we are \none step closer to fixing this decades-old injustice. I commend \nSenators Durbin, Sessions, Graham, Coburn, and Hatch for negotiating \nthe compromise that allowed this important piece of legislation to pass \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee by a unanimous vote. As chairman, I was \nable to report on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee the first \nmeasure we have ever been able to approve that begins to undo the \nunjust sentencing disparity.\n  For more than 20 years, our Nation has used a Federal cocaine \nsentencing policy that treats ``crack'' offenders 100 times more \nharshly than other cocaine offenders, without a legitimate basis for \nthe difference. We know that there is little or no pharmacological \ndistinction between crack and powder cocaine, yet the resulting \npunishments for these offenses is radically different\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\nand unjust. This policy is wrong and unfair, and it has needlessly \nswelled our prisons, wasting precious Federal resources.\n  These disproportionate punishments have had a disparate impact on \nminority communities. This is unjust and runs contrary to our \nfundamental principles of equal justice under law. According to the \nlatest statistics of the independent and nonpartisan United States \nSentencing Commission, African Americans continue to make up the large \nmajority of Federal crack cocaine convictions, accounting for 80 \npercent of all Federal crack cocaine offenses, while they represent a \nmuch smaller fraction of those who use the drug. In a letter to our \ncommittee, John Payton, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, \ncalled this disparity ``one of the most notorious symbols of racial \ndiscrimination in the modern criminal justice system.''\n  These disparate penalties, which Congress created in the mid-1980s, \nhave failed to address basic concerns. The primary goal underlying the \ncrack sentence structure was to punish the major traffickers and drug \nkingpins who were bringing crack into our neighborhoods. But the law \nhas not been used to go after the most serious offenders. In fact, just \nthe opposite has happened. The Sentencing Commission has reported for \nmany years that more than half of Federal crack cocaine offenders are \nlow-level street dealers and users, not the major traffickers Congress \nintended to target.\n  The Fair Sentencing Act of 2009 returns the focus of Federal cocaine \nsentencing policy to drug kingpins, rather than street level dealers, \nand eliminates the mandatory minimum sentence for possession of crack \ncocaine. The 5-year mandatory minimum sentence penalty for simple \npossession of crack is unique under Federal law. There is no other \nmandatory minimum for mere simple possession of a commonly abused drug.\n  This bill does not legalize drugs, nor does it eliminate harsh \nsentences. In fact, this bill toughens some penalties. It increase \nfines for major drug traffickers and provides sentencing enhancements \nfor acts of violence committed during the course of a drug trafficking \noffense. But this bill also helps to ensure that our system will no \nlonger affect many minority and urban communities more harshly than \noffenders who use drugs in the suburbs and corporate offices. That \ninequality has reduced trust in law enforcement and cooperation with \npolice, which makes us all less safe.\n  American justice is about fairness for each individual. To have faith \nin our system, Americans must have confidence that the laws of this \ncountry, including our drug laws, are fair and administered fairly. We \nmust be smarter in our Federal drug policy. Law enforcement has been \nand continues to be a central part of our efforts against illegal \ndrugs, but we must also find meaningful, community-based solutions \nwhich enable people to feel they are being treated fairly. I look \nforward to working with Chief Kerlikowske, the director of the \nPresident's Office of National Drug Control Policy, to develop and \ndeploy such a strategy.\n  Since 1995, the United States Sentencing Commission has issued report \nafter report calling on Congress to address this unfair sentencing \ndisparity. We would not be making the progress we are today without the \nleadership of the United States Sentencing Commission. I thank them and \ntheir chairman, Judge William Sessions.\n  I thank the U.S. Department of Justice for the testimony of Assistant \nAttorney General Lanny Breuer at our hearing on this matter last year. \nAttorney General Eric Holder also reminded us that ``the stakes are \nsimply too high to let reform in this area wait any longer.'' I agree. \nIt is time for the Senate and House to act.\n  After more than 20 years, the Senate has finally acted on legislation \nto correct the crack-powder disparity and the harm to public confidence \nin our justice system it created. Although this bill is not perfect and \nit is not the bill we introduced in order to correct these \ninequalities, I believe the Fair Sentencing Act moves us one step \ncloser to reaching the important goal of equal justice for all. I urge \nthe House to act quickly so that the President can sign this historic \nlegislation into law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1789), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
