Mr. President, I had hoped we would be able to come to \nagreement with Republicans to hold votes today to protect middle-class \nfamilies. But the Republican caucus would not agree, so we will have a \nseries of votes tomorrow on the tax rates set to expire at the end of \nthis month.\n  Democrats' priorities are clear. We are protecting middle-class \nfamilies every way we can. Tomorrow's votes will show where Republican \npriorities are and where ours are. Those votes will clearly demonstrate \nwho supports the middle class, and that includes every Senator.\n  The minority can spin any way they want what has taken place over the \nlast 24 hours. They can pretend giving the rich tax breaks creates \njobs, even though we know from the past decade that it does not. If \nthat were the case, the economy would be booming, except during the \nlast years of the Bush administration, when those tax cuts were in \neffect, we lost 8 million jobs. They can pretend we can afford to give \nbillionaires another handout, even though we know we can't. But no \nmatter how many times you pretend, it doesn't make it true. The truth \nis simple: Holding middle-class tax cuts hostage for tax breaks for the \nwealthy that they don't need and we cannot afford is irresponsible.\n  A lot has been written about the letter that 42 Republican Senators \nsent me a couple days ago. Maybe it is news that they put it in \nwriting, but that is all that is new about it because, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, everything we have tried to do legislatively this year \nhas been stymied, stopped with filibusters, well more than 100. \nRepublicans have been holding good legislation hostage for 4 years--\nimportant bills, noncontroversial bills, every bill. That is why we \nhave a lameduck session with such a long to-do list.\n  Interestingly, I heard one Republican Senator, my friend, the senior \nSenator from Tennessee, say: The majority leader fills the tree. They \nhave had lots of opportunities to offer amendments. The problem is, it \nis not the offering of amendments. We will allow them to offer \namendments, but they are not satisfied with that. They want the \nresults. They are not willing to offer an amendment they may lose. They \nare only willing to offer amendments they want to win. If they don't \nwin them, then they stop everything. That isn't the way it has been \ndone around here, and it should not be done in the future that way.\n  Since they sent me that letter, a lot of focus has been on the \npolitical impact of this game. I am more interested in the impact on \nthe people I represent than the political games being played.\n  When Republicans take their ball and go home, here is what happens: \nMore than 83,000 Nevadans who are jobless and looking for work will \nlose their unemployment insurance over the next\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\nyear. The Council of Economic Advisers predicted that will cost the \ncountry 600,000 jobs.\n  What else happens? A treaty that will make Americans safer goes \nnowhere, a treaty supported by the entire military leadership and \nendorsed yesterday by the Secretaries of State of the last five \nRepublican Presidents. Without the START treaty, there are more nuclear \nweapons than there should be, we know less about the Russian nuclear \narsenal than we need to, and Americans are less safe.\n  Here is one more consequence of the Republican ultimatum: Thousands \nof first responders who rushed to Ground Zero on 9/11 got terribly sick \nfrom the toxins there. The longer Republicans stall, the longer these \nheroes have to wait for the health care and compensation they deserve.\n  Why are tens of thousands of unemployed Nevadans at risk of losing \ntheir lifeline? Why is Nevada at risk of losing jobs when we are \ndesperate to create them? Why is the START treaty stalled? Why are the \n9/11 heroes still sick with nowhere to turn? Each of these questions \nhas the same answer--because Republican Senators want to give their \nrichest friends a tax break they don't need, many don't want, and none \nof us can afford.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8446-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the textbook definition of ``economics'' \nis about scarcity. For example, in his textbook ``Principles of \nEconomics,'' President Bush's chief economic adviser, Gregory Mankiw, \nwrote this:\n\n       Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce \n     resources.\n\n  We could say the same thing about fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is \nabout how society, acting through its government, chooses to allocate \nscarce resources. There is not an endless supply of money. We have to \nmake choices. Every time we put together a budget, we have to make \nchoices. Every time we formulate the Nation's tax policy, we have to \nmake choices.\n  So when it comes to whether to extend the 2001 tax cuts, once again, \nwe have to make choices. It is a question of priorities. The debate \nover what to do about the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for those with the \nhighest incomes is a debate about priorities.\n  Are we better off devoting scarce resources to a larger tax cut for \nthose at the very top or are we better off devoting those scarce \nresources to new tax incentives to promote investment and create new \njobs or are we better off devoting those scarce resources to reducing \nthe Federal budget deficit and debt? Those are the choices we need to \nmake.\n  Today, the Senate is considering how we should make those choices. \nThe amendment we have offered says basically: Let's make the middle-\nclass tax cuts permanent. That is something on which pretty much \neveryone in this Chamber should agree. After we have cut taxes for \nmiddle-class Americans, then let's have an honest debate. Let's debate \nwhether extending tax cuts for the very top incomes is the right \npriority.\n  But, in any case, making middle-class tax cuts permanent is the right \nthing to do. Let's not allow tax cuts for middle-class Americans to be \nheld hostage to partisan wrangling about tax cuts for those who make \nthe very most.\n  So how did we come to this choice? Let me take a few moments to \nreview how we got here.\n  In 2001, Congress enacted legislation to let American families keep \nmore of their money. Many of these tax incentives were phased in over \nseveral years. In 2003, Congress enacted legislation adding new tax \nincentives and speeding up implementation of the 2001 law.\n  The 2001 and 2003 tax laws lowered tax rates for all taxpayers, and \nthose laws provided much needed tax relief for families, education, and \nsmall business. Many of these tax provisions have broad support across \nthe political spectrum. But these tax benefits are not permanent. \nBeginning on January 1, all these 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire, even \nthose for Americans who need them the most.\n  At the same time, the Federal debt is at its highest level since \nshortly after World War II, and our fiscal challenges are growing with \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation. The amendment we consider \ntoday responds to both these challenges.\n  So what would our amendment do? First, our amendment would extend tax \ncuts for middle-class American families. Our amendment would \npermanently extend the lower tax rates for income up to $250,000 for \nmarried couples and $200,000 for individuals.\n  Extending these lower tax rates would benefit all taxpayers--all \ntaxpayers--including higher income taxpayers. In fact, higher income \ntaxpayers would receive the largest tax benefits in terms of dollars \nper taxpayer. That is, of course, because we have our marginal tax rate \nsystem in America. So making the tax cut permanent for all taxes of \nAmericans below $250,000 will benefit all Americans--not only those \nbelow $250,000, but those above $250,000, will, under this amendment, \nget a benefit. As I said, in fact, higher income taxpayers receive the \nlargest tax benefits in terms of dollars per taxpayer, even under the \n$250,000 amendment.\n  Our amendment would make permanent the provisions that help working \nfamilies with children. The number of people living in poverty is at a \n15-year high. One out of every five American children lives in poverty. \nMany of these provisions in our amendment would help keep children and \ntheir families out of poverty.\n  The amendment would make permanent the expanded earned-income tax \ncredit for families with three or more children. The increased tax \ncredit provides more help to families with children. The partially \nrefundable portion of the credit allows families to receive a benefit \neven when their tax liability is low, as long as the family has earned \nincome of more than $3,000.\n  This credit helps to support 13 million children in low-income \nworking\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\nfamilies every year. These families are likely to spend every dollar \nthey receive right away. That means this provision would also help the \neconomy.\n  The increased dependent care credit recognizes the increased cost of \nchildcare for working families. People should be able to go to work and \nhave the quality care they need for their children. In 2008, the \ndependent care credit helped more than 6.5 million working families to \nmake ends meet.\n  Our amendment would make permanent a tax benefit for employers who \nconstruct, build or expand property used as a childcare facility. This \nbenefit recognizes the contribution that some employers make to help \ntheir employees balance child-raising and a career.\n  The amendment would provide permanent marriage penalty relief. That \nway, married couples would not get higher taxes as an added wedding \npresent.\n  The amendment would direct that certain government programs disregard \nrefundable tax credits when determining eligibility for the \nprograms. This would ensure that America's most in need would not be \nworse off because of tax incentives. We don't want to give with one \nhand and take away with the other.\n\n  Our amendment also addresses the importance of getting a quality \neducation and the increased cost of getting an education. Our amendment \nwould make it easier to deduct student loan interest, to eliminate the \nrestriction on the number of months eligible for the deduction, and it \nwould expand the eligibility to more postgraduates. Our amendment would \nmake permanent the American opportunity tax credit. This would help \nstudents to afford a higher education. This provision is a partially \nrefundable tax credit up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition and fees, \nincluding books. The amendment includes an income exclusion for loan \nrepayment for programs where a postgraduate becomes a health \nprofessional in an underserved area. The amendment would include \ncontinuing education for workers by allowing an exclusion from income \nfor employer-provided educational assistance programs.\n  What do we do about capital gains and dividends? Right now, capital \ngains are currently taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent and dividends \nare treated as capital gains. This treatment expires at the end of this \nyear. Starting January 1, unless we act, capital gains will be taxed at \n20 percent and dividends will be treated as ordinary income.\n  Our amendment would make permanent the current capital gains rate for \ntaxpayers with incomes up to $250,000 for married couples and up to \n$200,000 for individuals. The amendment continues to treat dividends as \ncapital gains for all taxpayers, so dividends would not be treated as \nordinary income for any taxpayer. This would level the playing field. \nThis would ensure that the Tax Code will not favor one type of \ninvestment over the other.\n  What do we do about the alternative minimum tax? Our amendment would \nprovide 2 years of relief from the AMT. Every year, we talk about the \nAMT and how it ensnares hard-working Americans. Originally, Congress \ncreated the AMT to stop--get this--just 155 millionaires from \ncompletely avoiding income taxes. That was the point of the AMT. It was \nan attempt to make sure all taxpayers paid their fair share. What about \ntoday? Now, millions of hard-working families are subject to this \ndreadful tax--not 155 millionaires but millions of people--families who \nare working hard, raising children, and find themselves hit with \nincreased taxes. We are not talking about millionaires; we are talking \nabout a larger group of Americans. AMT has this effect because it was \nnot indexed.\n  To keep the number of taxpayers subject to this tax from growing, \nCongress has to pass an AMT patch every year. Without an AMT fix, the \nnumber of taxpayers subject to the tax would explode. In Montana, \nCongress's failure to enact a patch would mean that more than six times \nas many taxpayers would have that burden.\n  Our amendment would take care of the AMT for 2010 and 2011. During \nthat time, Congress can deal with this stealth tax once and for all as \npart of tax reform.\n  What about small business? Our amendment would benefit small business \nowners by making permanent the 2007 expansion of section 179 expensing.\n  What about the estate tax? Our amendment would provide permanent \nestate tax relief for family-owned businesses. In 2001, Congress voted \nto provide estate tax relief to American families. We decreased the \nrate and increased the exemption over time, until we had complete \nrepeal for 2010 only. That is what we have today, in 2010. Next year, \nif we don't act, the law will snap back up to the old 2001 rate. This \nhas resulted in uncertainty and a planning nightmare for families. Our \namendment would eliminate that uncertainty. The amendment would make \npermanent 2009 estate tax law going forward. It would set the top tax \nrate at 45 percent and the exemption at $3.5 million per person, which \nobviously amounts to $7 million per couple.\n  The amendment includes an election for estates that arose between \nJanuary 1 and the law's enactment. The heirs would be able to choose \neither current law or the new permanent tax rate and exemption.\n  Our amendment would provide an exemption for family ranches and \nfarms. This provision would ensure that no family farm or ranch ever \nhas to be sold to pay estate taxes.\n  Our amendment would simplify planning for spouses. Most people \nbelieve that a couple automatically receives double the exemption \namount. So if an exemption is $3.5 million, most folks assume that a \ncouple gets $7 million. But what many people don't know is that to get \nthe full $7 million exemption, couples have to plan. Our amendment \nwould simplify planning for spouses by allowing the transfer of any \nunused exemption between spouses. This would make the law work the way \nmost people think it works already. The resulting estate tax law would \nprovide certainty to taxpayers, and the remaining estate tax would \naffect only the heirs of the very largest estates. It would ensure that \nthe small number of people who inherit so much money that they never \nhave to work during their life would contribute their fair share.\n  What about the provision that folks call tax extenders? Our amendment \nwould extend a number of other tax provisions important to individuals, \nbusinesses, and State and local governments. These provisions will \ncontinue to help create jobs and pay taxes. Our amendment would create \njobs by improving our Nation's infrastructure. It would reduce the cost \nto local governments to build roads, bridges, and water treatment \nfacilities. The amendment would extend multiple incentives that promote \nenergy sustainability and efficiency. The amendment would extend the \ndollar-per-gallon credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel, and the \namendment would extend the manufacturer's credit for the construction \nof new energy-efficient homes.\n  The amendment includes a credit for energy-efficient appliances and a \ncredit for alternative-fuel motor vehicles. The amendment includes an \nextension of the advanced energy investment credit for businesses \nengaged in the manufacturing of technologies for the production of \nrenewable energy and energy storage, and the amendment provides parity \nfor transit benefits so that employers can provide tax-free benefits to \ntheir employees for both transit and parking.\n  Our amendment would extend a number of tax cuts for individuals, \nincluding an extension of the making work pay credit--very stimulative. \nIt helps the economy dramatically, and if it is not in here, it will be \ndestimulative and hurt the economy.\n  Our amendment would help teachers by extending the expense deduction \nfor teachers who buy school supplies for their classrooms. The \namendment would extend the additional standard deduction for State and \nlocal real estate taxes as well as the ability of itemizers to deduct \nsales taxes in lieu of State and local income taxes. Our amendment \nwould extend the qualified tuition deduction to help with college \ncosts.\n  This amendment would extend much needed relief for communities that \nhave suffered from natural disasters.\n  Our amendment would extend important business tax provisions to help \ncreate jobs and make our companies competitive in a global economy. The \namendment would extend the research and development credit to help \nAmerican businesses keep on the cutting edge.\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\n  Our amendment also includes a provision that will help small \nbusinesses across our country. The provision would repeal an expansion \nof information reporting rules that was enacted this past year, \notherwise known as 1099. Those rules expanded current information \nreporting requirements to include payments businesses make to \ncorporations and payments for goods and property, not just services. \nThis provision, known as the 1099 provision, imposes a record-keeping \nburden on small businesses that would take away from the time business \nowners need to expand their business and create jobs. This information \nreporting went too far, especially in this difficult economy. It is \nimportant that we repeal this expansion of information reporting.\n\n  Now, some will say that we should extend tax cuts for everyone, even \nthe very rich. America is working through tough economic times. At the \nsame time, our country has record deficits. Our amendment would balance \nthese two concerns. Our amendment would extend all the tax cuts \naffecting middle and lower income Americans that Congress enacted in \n2001 and in 2003 that sunset this year. Our amendment would also extend \nseveral expiring tax cuts benefiting middle and lower income Americans \nthat Congress enacted in 2009. Our amendment would protect Americans \nwho have been struggling to get by.\n  Our amendment would also benefit taxpayers with higher incomes. The \ncuts in our amendment apply to all of the income up to $200,000 for \nindividuals and $250,000 for couples even if the taxpayer makes more \nthan that. At the same time, we crafted our amendment with recognition \nof the mounting deficits our country faces.\n  Our amendment would not rely on the gimmick of temporarily extending \ntax cuts in order to mask their size, knowing that future Congresses \nwill be unable to resist the temptation to keep extending these cuts. \nIt is about priorities. Our amendment makes choices.\n  Our amendment would not make permanent all of the expiring tax cuts \nthat Congress enacted in 2009. It would not make permanent tax cuts \nthat benefit only those Americans who need them the least. Only 3 \npercent of Americans have incomes greater than $250,000 for couples or \n$200,000 for individuals.\n  Over the past quarter century, the average after-tax income of the \nwealthiest 5 percent has grown 150 percent.\n  At the same time in the past quarter century, the average after-tax \nincome of middle-class Americans has grown by only 28 percent. So 150 \npercent for the top 5 percent--the wealthiest--and only 28 percent for \nmiddle-income Americans. Today, the bottom 80 percent of households \nreceive less than half of all after-tax income. The benefits of recent \neconomic growth have not been widely shared, so the middle class should \nnot be asked to tighten their belts as much as the high-income folks \nwho have benefited the most.\n  As we come out of the great recession, we need to recognize the \ngrowing Federal budget deficit. In 2010, the deficit was $1.3 trillion. \nThat is the second highest level relative to the size of the economy \nsince 1945. This was exceeded only by 2009's $1.4 trillion deficit--\n$100 billion more--and the Congressional Budget Office projects that \ndeficits will remain high for the rest of the decade. That means the \nFederal debt will keep growing.\n  When we passed the 2001 tax cuts, the Federal Government was running \na surplus. When we passed the 2001 tax cuts, economists projected big \nsurpluses as far as the eye could see. Times have changed. We need to \nconsider our current fiscal condition. With 15 million Americans still \nout of work, it is important that we keep our economy on the path to \nrecovery by extending tax cuts for families who need them the most and \nwho will spend it.\n  Our amendment strikes the right balance. It is a question of \npriorities. Our amendment says that we should not devote scarce \nresources to a larger tax cut for those at the very top. Our amendment \nsays that we would be better off devoting those scarce resources to new \ntax incentives that promote investment and create new jobs or we would \nbe better off devoting those scarce resources to reducing the Federal \nbudget deficit and debt. Those are the choices we have to make.\n  Our amendment says: Let's make the middle-class tax cuts permanent. \nOur amendment says: Let's not allow tax cuts for middle-class Americans \nto be held hostage for tax cuts for those who make the very most. There \nis not an endless supply of money. We have to make choices.\n  I submit that these are the choices we need to make. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support our amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suspend my request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from \nMontana, who laid out exactly why his efforts to extend the Bush tax \ncuts to the middle class up to $250,000 and to not extend them beyond \nthat is the exact right public policy. It is good fiscal policy. It is \ngood economic policy. It is good for our country. It is exactly the \nright thing to do. I thank him for his explanation of including the \nearned-income tax credit, which is the best tax incentive to help \npeople who are working hard, playing by the rules, making $20,000 to \n$30,000 a year, get a much fairer tax--really encouraging work the way \nthe IETC does.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, the senior \nSenator from Montana, for including the unemployment insurance in this \nbecause 85,000 Ohioans have lost their unemployment insurance. These \nare people--or many of them are, as I have read letters on the Senate \nfloor and will read a couple today--who have worked for 20, 30, 40 \nyears and simply can't find a job.\n  There are five people applying for every one job opening in my State \nand in this country. It is so important that these people continue to \nget some assistance. In spite of what some of my Republican colleagues \nsuggest, unemployment insurance is insurance, not welfare. Their \nemployer, on their behalf, pays into the unemployment insurance fund in \ntheir States. When they lose their jobs, because it is insurance, they \nshould get assistance. It is like fire or health insurance. You don't \nwant to use it, but you want it to be there if you need it. That is why \nit is so important. I appreciate Senator Baucus's discussion of why \nthis is the right policy.\n  Before I read some letters from people about unemployment benefits, I \nwant to talk about why that is the right policy. The Bush tax cuts \nprimarily went to the wealthy in 2001 and 2003. As Senator McCaskill \nsaid, it was an experiment. For 10 years, we tried to see if this \nworked. I didn't support that when it passed in the House many years \nago because I thought they were tilted toward upper income people and \nnot focused on the middle class. So it was an experiment in many ways \nwhere major tax breaks were given to the rich, and according to the so-\ncalled trickle-down economic theory, they would hire people and much \nwould trickle down and they would provide jobs and strengthen the \nmiddle class.\n  What we saw during the Bush 8 years as the main thrust of the \neconomic policy was the tax break for the rich. That was the stated \npolicy; that if we cut taxes enough on the wealthiest Americans, it \nwould drive the economy forward. But we know that in those 8 years of \nthe Bush administration there was a 1 million net job increase, not \nenough to provide jobs to keep up with the growing population or not \nenough to provide jobs for the kids coming out of high school or those \nleaving the Army or those coming out of college.\n  So it is clear the experiment failed. They cut taxes for the rich and \nthere was only a 1 million increase in jobs. It didn't work.\n  Look at the 8 years before that, the Clinton years--and these are \nfacts, not opinions--where President Clinton did a mix of tax cuts, tax \nincreases on the wealthy and spending cuts, and he balanced the budget. \nWe ended up with a 22 million job increase with that economic policy, \nwhich we want to follow today, versus a 1 million job increase, which \nwas not even enough to keep up with the growing population with the \nBush economic policy.\n  It is clear what this means--not to mention what Senator Baucus \npointed\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nout too. We are, in essence, borrowing $700 billion from the Chinese to \npay for these tax cuts. That is where we borrow a lot of money. We are \ntalking about borrowing $700 billion and putting it on a credit card \nfor our children and grandchildren. The pages sitting here will get to \npay off that $700 billion in tax cuts for the rich, and then the $700 \nbillion is given to the wealthiest taxpayers. So they want to borrow \nfrom China, charge it to our children and grandchildren, and give it to \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  What kind of moral policy, let alone the bad economic policy, is \nthat? It is bad fiscal policy to do anything but tax cuts for the \nmiddle class. It is bad economic policy. It is not fair to our children \nand grandchildren.\n  Also, I will make a comparison in this bill between unemployment \nbenefits, extending and maintaining unemployment benefits to the 85,000 \nfamilies in Ohio who found out 2 days ago their unemployment insurance \nwas no longer. Some of those families will lose their homes, and a \nfather will have to sit down with his 12-year-old daughter and say: \nHoney, we are going to lose this house and move somewhere else. The \nchild will say: What school district are we going to be in, Dad? He \nwould say: I don't know yet.\n  We know the hardship this will create if we don't extend these \nbenefits. These people want to go back to work and they are trying to \nfind jobs, but there are not enough jobs out there. They need money for \ngasoline to drive around and look for jobs, and they need all these \nthings just to stay alive and have a decent standard of living. But \ntake the money in the unemployment extension--as John McCain's chief \neconomic adviser during his 2008 campaign said, $1 put into \nunemployment benefits of a person in Zanesville or Lima or Hamilton, \nOH, that father or mother, that man or woman will spend that money \nbecause they need to. They need to buy shoes for their kids, food for \nthemselves; they need to heat their homes and put gas in their cars. \nThat money will be spent. Every dollar you put into unemployment \ngenerates $1.60 in economic activity, and that will create jobs.\n  Conversely, a dollar in tax cuts for the wealthy--a dollar that goes \nto a millionaire--what are they going to buy that they are not already \nbuying? They meet their needs. They have millions of dollars at their \ndiscretion to do it. They are not going to buy more food or go to a \nfancy restaurant or take an extra vacation. They have the money they \nneed. That $1 going to the wealthy, according to the analysis of John \nMcCain's chief economic adviser, ends up generating about 30 cents in \nactivity and creating significantly fewer jobs.\n  I want to read a couple of letters from people in my State of Ohio \nabout what this legislation means in terms of unemployment benefits.\n  This is from Shanata from Montgomery County, in the Dayton area:\n\n       I have been out of work since February and have been \n     receiving unemployment benefits. I am 36 years old and have \n     been working since I was 16.\n\n  This is par for the course in the letters we get. These people have \nbeen working hard since a very young age.\n\n       I have applied for 100 jobs in the past month alone, and \n     have found absolutely nothing. If unemployment stops, I will \n     have even less. I am in school full-time, but I know that I \n     can't return in January since I will have absolutely no way \n     to pay my bills. Unemployment is not allowing me to go on \n     trips, eat out every day, shop 'til I drop, or anything else \n     frivolous. I just need to keep a roof over my head and food \n     in me and my daughters' stomachs. Please work diligently to \n     help extend unemployment for those who will have nothing \n     without it.\n\n  This is Dagney from Lorain County, my home county, between Cleveland \nand Toledo:\n\n       Please, Senator, please do everything you can to get the \n     unemployment extension passed. I have been unemployed for \n     more than a year and have not found a job yet. We are two \n     months behind on our mortgage and I am so afraid we are going \n     to lose our house. We have exhausted our savings and my \n     husband is off work too due to an accident. I am so worried. \n     Please help us.\n\n  This is from Carol from Summit County, in Akron:\n\n       I am writing for myself and thousands of other unemployed \n     Ohioans whose unemployment benefits are running out. We need \n     help.\n\n  Mr. President, again, 85,000 families lost their benefits in my State \nalone three nights ago.\n\n       I am 61 years old and have been on unemployment since June \n     2010 and my benefits run out December 20. There are no \n     extensions at this time and there are no jobs for a senior \n     citizen with over 40 years of work experience. Believe me, I \n     have tried everything from Walmart to McDonalds. I have no \n     savings and lost what little retirement I had a couple years \n     ago with many others. I'm not asking for a handout--just some \n     help until the job market picks up out here. Please encourage \n     Congress to provide at least one more extension--without it, \n     many Ohioans will be destitute. I never thought when I was \n     raising my family as a single mom that I would find myself in \n     this position at this age.\n\n  I know my colleagues want to do the right thing. I believe even those \nwho vote no on everything that I believe in, I think they want to do \nthe right thing. I just wonder--I know they get letters like this \nbecause every one of us--whether you are in Missoula or in Eugene or in \nDayton, every one of us gets letters from constituents in our States \nwho are hurting, even in States that have pretty good economies. I \ndon't know if they don't read them or if our colleagues never meet \npeople like this. I assume our colleagues probably don't visit food \npantries as I do, but some of my other colleagues do and hear the \nstories. I don't know that I have been to a food pantry in the last 2 \nyears where I don't hear a volunteer--and most of them are staffed by \nall volunteers--or a paid director say: You know, see those people over \nthere? They used to bring food in, and now they are picking up food. \nThat is the story I hear time after time.\n  I don't think my colleagues are hard hearted or callous. I just \nwonder if they know, or if they are hearing from, people like Carol and \nShanata and Dagney, or if they are not visiting food pantries and \nstopping at a union hall and talking to an out-of-work carpenter or a \nlaborer who hasn't been called to a worksite for 7 or 8 months.\n  I have said to the majority leader that I think we should stay here \nuntil New Years. I would rather be home with my family; family is very \nimportant to me. But if we don't continue these unemployment benefits, \nwe are going to ruin the holidays for those 85,000 Ohioans--and that \nnumber keeps growing--so we don't deserve much of a holiday either if \nthat is the best we can do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me start by thanking Senator Baucus \nfor putting forward his proposal on tax issues. It is a responsible \ncourse for us to follow. It is one I can vote for without reservation.\n  He is basically saying: Look, let's ensure the first $250,000 that is \nearned by any and all Americans in this next year will be subject to \nthe lower tax rates that were put in place during President Bush's time \nin office--the tax rates that were adopted essentially in 2001. Of \ncourse, it also contains other very useful provisions to reinstate the \nestate tax at a reasonable rate, with a significant amount exempted \nfrom the estate tax. It has provisions for energy tax--the extending of \nenergy tax provisions, which I think are very important to the \ncountry. But we had a hearing yesterday in the Finance Committee. I am \nprivileged to serve on that committee that Senator Baucus chairs. We \nhad a very good hearing on the whole issue of Federal revenues and \noutlays. I thought some useful information came out there. I was able \nto speak very briefly with Doug Elmendorf, the head of the \nCongressional Budget Office. I was particularly impressed with one \nchart he presented in his materials. I have made a copy of that, \nessentially, that I want to go through and explain because I think it \nputs this entire discussion into context.\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\n  This chart shows what has happened with both outlays--and that is the \nlight blue line--and revenues--the darker black line--outlays and \nrevenues of the Federal Government for a 40-year period starting in \n1970 and ending, essentially, right now. One useful thing about the \nchart is it has an average. It shows that, on average, outlays were \nabout 21 percent, and that is the dotted blue line across here. It also \nshows, on average, revenues--what the government collects in taxes--was \nabout 18 percent, and that is the dotted black line down here. You can \nsee there is--I don't know if you call it a structure gap but a \npersistent gap between what we raise for the operation of the Federal \nGovernment and what we spend. Every year we spend more than we raise.\n  There is an exception to that. There is a period here where these two \nlines cross, and that is the period at the end of the Clinton \nadministration where we got to a balanced budget and a surplus. That \nwas achieved for a variety of reasons, and let me talk a little about \nthose reasons.\n  There was a 4-year period there, 1998 through 2001, where the Federal \nGovernment essentially did not spend more than it took in. In 2001 \nagain, as you can see from this chart, beginning in 2001 with this \nprecipitous dropoff in revenue, the deficits began to grow. We now have \na very large deficit. What is particularly disturbing is when you look \nahead and project where we are going to be over the next 5, 10, 20 \nyears, we are projected to have a very large deficit indefinitely \nunless we change some things.\n  Changing either the outlay numbers, what we spend, or the revenue \nnumbers, the level of taxes that are collected, is not easy. It is not \neasy in this Congress. It has never been easy. So how did we produce a \nsurplus during the 4 years we had a surplus? I think there were three \nmain factors that account for that.\n  In 1990, the Congress and President George H.W. Bush were able to \nagree to legislation that controlled spending and increased revenues as \nwell. That was the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. It, for \nthe first time, enacted pay-go rules. It also increased taxes on the \nwealthiest Americans by raising the top income tax rate from 28 percent \nto 31 percent.\n  At the time, President George H.W. Bush said--this is a quote from \nhim--``It's time, I think it's past time, to put the interests of the \ncountry first.''\n  Over the next 5 years, this legislation did reduce the deficit by a \ntotal of $480 billion. That was one of the factors that got us to that \nperiod of balanced budget and surplus.\n  The second factor was in 1993, when the Congress and President \nClinton agreed, again, to legislation that increased revenue and \ncontrolled spending. This legislation once again raised taxes on the \nwealthiest Americans. Over the 5 years following, the legislation \nreduced the deficit by $430 billion and revenue increases were \nresponsible for over half that deficit reduction that occurred in that \nperiod.\n  Of course, the third factor, which is the most important, is that the \ncountry enjoyed very strong economic growth during the 1990s, \nparticularly the latter part of the 1990s. That allowed revenues to \nrise above the historical average we see down here, this 18 percent \nhistorical average for revenues. We were able to get that up \nsignificantly, both because of the changes in law that occurred under \nPresident George H.W. Bush and under President Clinton and the very \ngood economic circumstances we enjoyed in the 1990s.\n  What caused the situation to reverse? Was it an increase in spending \nor was it a decrease in revenue? I think this chart makes the point \nvery clearly that initially what caused the situation to reverse was \nthe Bush tax cuts of 2001. They reduced revenue by $70 billion in that \nexact same year, 2001. In total, the tax cuts President George W. Bush \nsigned into law reduced revenue by an estimated $1.6 trillion over a \n10-year period. The actual costs may have been significantly greater.\n  Simply put, the Congress and the President, when we enacted those \nBush tax cuts, so-called Bush tax cuts, cut taxes more than we could \nafford to unless we were willing to also dramatically cut spending, and \nwe did not cut spending. In fact, we increased spending. We increased \nit fairly dramatically to fund the Afghanistan war, to fund the Iraq \nwar, to fund Medicare Part D. None of that new spending was paid for.\n  Former Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management and \nBudget Director Peter Orszag estimates that because they were not paid \nfor, the Bush tax cuts, if extended again, and Medicare Part D, those \ntogether would add $5 trillion to the debt over the next decade.\n  So the votes we are casting on this tax issue are significant votes \nthat will reverberate for some time and affect our economy and the \ndeficit and the debt. People need to understand that.\n  Of course, in the last 3 years since we have been in this recession, \nthe deficit has worsened very substantially. Revenue dropped to \nhistoric lows as the economy contracted. Spending also increased due to \nthe Recovery Act and also due to the automatic stabilizers we have \nbuilt into the law, such as unemployment compensation.\n  It is important to note that only about 10 percent of the debt we \nincur over the next 10 years--the debt over the next 10 years--is due \nto the Recovery Act.\n  With the economic recovery underway, the size of the deficit is \nbeginning to stabilize. You can see that at the far right end as part \nof this chart. You can see these numbers, you can see the outlay number \nbeginning to come down, you can see the revenue number at least \nleveling off, and that is positive. But the obvious point I think we \nneed to understand is, we cannot solve the deficit problem by simply \nreverting to the situation before the economic crisis. The chart shows \nthat, on average, outlays have exceeded revenues by about 3 percent of \ngross domestic product. That is about $450 billion under the current \nsize of our gross domestic product. In other words, if Congress can \nonly accomplish an average performance, we are looking at a $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion deficit going forward even after we are fully out of this \nrecession.\n  Clearly, we need to do better than that. Congress needs to make some \ntough choices, both to control spending and to increase revenues, just \nas we did in the 1990s. Both the President's Deficit Reduction \nCommission, which I know is having its final vote today, and the \nbipartisan commission led by my former colleague, Senator Pete \nDomenici, and Alice Rivlin, former Budget Director--both of those \nCommissions recognize we will need revenue increases as well as \nspending cuts to solve the deficit problem.\n  The proposal that Senator Baucus has come forward with is to allow \neveryone in the country to enjoy the lower tax rates that were adopted \nunder President Bush but only to enjoy those lower rates for the first \n$250,000 of income each year. I know Senator Schumer has a proposal \nwhich says we will allow the lower rates on taxation of earned income \nto apply to the first $1 million of income of all Americans. All \nAmericans will get the tax cut, as they will under the proposal by \nSenator Baucus, but Senator Schumer's proposal would be to give them \nthe lower rates on the entire $1 million that they earn in the first \nyear. Above that they would have to pay the rates that were in place \nunder President Clinton's time in office, in the 1990s, when the \neconomy was so strong.\n  The question is, Can we in this Congress do what needs to be done to \ndeal with the deficit issue and particularly on this tax bill to do \nwhat needs to be done to raise revenue? Tomorrow we will be voting on \nwhether to let the Bush tax cuts expire for income above $250,000. One \nof these votes will be to effectively raise taxes on annual income \nabove $1 million, as I said. Compared to other choices we have, it \nseems to me this is a fairly easy choice. If we are not willing to \nrevert to the Clinton-era tax rates on any income, no matter at what \nlevel, then it is going to be very difficult for us to make a credible \nclaim that we are serious about the deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Baucus proposal, and I hope we \ncan get a good, strong bipartisan vote on that. It is clear to me \nAmericans do want to see the taxes they are paying on the first \n$250,000 of their income remain where they are today. That will only \nhappen if we are able to pass this proposal Senator Baucus has put \nforward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have heard a lot from our friends on \nthe other side this week about the middle class, and that is because \ntheir policies have been so ineffective in helping the middle class.\n  They are trying to distract the American people from their record. It \nis that simple. This is what those in power often do when their \npolicies don't work. They search for a target, and the targets \nDemocrats have decided on are Republicans and small business owners, \nour Nation's leading job creators, which is, of course, ridiculous.\n  All of this finger-pointing is doing nothing to create jobs. It is a \ntotal waste of time.\n  This morning, we learned unemployment is now at 9.8 percent, even \nhigher than last month, and Democrats are responding with a vote to \nslam job creators with a massive tax increase.\n  Millions of out-of-work Americans don't want show-votes or finger-\npointing contests. They want jobs.\n  Americans don't want to see meaningless theatrics in Congress. They \nwant us to do something about the economy. The single best thing we can \ndo is to tell small businesses across the country they are not going to \nget a tax hike next month.\n  These are the folks that create the jobs that every one of us claims \nis our first priority. Why in the world would we do something that \nmakes them less likely to create those jobs?\n  Our friends on the other side know all this just as well as \nRepublicans do, but for some reason their base is demanding that they \nraise taxes on small business owners.\n  It is the perfect way to punctuate their 2-year experiment in \nantibusiness, big-government policies that have only led to more \njoblessness, more debt, and more uncertainty.\n  Over the past several weeks, we have seen a growing number of \nDemocrats begin to publicly disagree with their own leadership on the \nwisdom of scapegoat politics in a time of recession.\n  We saw this in a vivid way yesterday, when so many Democrats in the \nHouse defected from their leadership on the show-vote Speaker Pelosi \nheld over there.\n  And we have seen it here in the Senate, where a number of Democrats \nhave told their constituents that, no, of course they won't raise taxes \nin the middle of a recession.\n  They know as well as Republicans do that raising taxes--on anybody--\nis counterproductive in a fragile economy like ours. And they have said \nso.\n  One of our Democrat colleagues even went on ``Good Morning America'' \nand said he would extend the current rates ``for everyone.'' So we \nfully expect these Democrats to keep their word and vote against \nproposals that do anything less.\n  These votes are a purely political exercise at a time when Americans \nare looking for action.\n  And here is all the proof we need: The author of the plan to raise \ntaxes on anybody who earns more than a million dollars a year has \nopenly admitted that the only rationale for that figure is that it \nsounds better--that it is the best way to send a message that \nRepublicans are bad.\n  How about forgetting who looks good and who looks bad and start \nthinking of what is good and what is bad for working Americans?\n  These votes are an affront to millions of people struggling to find \nwork.\n  What these votes say is that Democrats care more about doing harm to \ntheir political adversaries than doing good for middle class Americans \nstruggling to find a job.\n  We don't help the middle class by punishing job creators; we hurt \nthem.\n  We make it harder for them to find jobs. We make it harder to revive \nthe economy.\n  We have now had more consecutive months of 9 percent unemployment \nthan at any time since the Great Depression. And Democrats would rather \nplay games than do something about it.\n  It should go without saying that Americans have had enough of this.\n  It is time to get serious. It is time to put the needs of middle \nclass Americans above the needs of the liberal base that is demanding a \nshow here in Congress. And that is all that this is--a show.\n  The left-wing might find it all very entertaining, but most Americans \ndon't find it amusing at all. They don't want games; they want action. \nIt is long past time we took them seriously.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to support the Middle Class Tax \nCuts Act of 2010, which gives permanent tax relief to struggling \nAmerican families who need it most. By extending the current rates for \n98 percent of taxpayers, this bill provides the certainty and security \nnecessary to protect working Americans, while at the same time \nindicating that we need help and that we ask upper income Americans to \nhelp address our growing fiscal deficits.\n  Make no mistake; extending current tax rates for the middle class is \ncrucial in order to encourage economic growth. The economic turmoil of \nthe last 3 years has left many American families cash-strapped and \nstruggling to stay afloat. Every extra dollar is critically important. \nThe evidence bears this out. Analysis by the Congressional Budget \nOffice indicates that lower and middle-income taxpayers have a higher \ntendency to spend every dollar they earn. Consequently, by ensuring tax \nrates don't rise on lower and middle-income earners, we prevent a \ndramatic decline in consumer spending that could have a negative impact \non this fragile economic recovery.\n  Today's job numbers are bad. They indicate we are far below what is \nnecessary to reduce the unemployment rate. Unemployment remains \npersistently high--12.4 percent or over 2.2 million people in my State, \nCalifornia, unemployed and 9.8 percent or 15.1 million people across \nAmerica unemployed. With economic growth projected to be slow in the \nnear future, those numbers will likely not come down for some time.\n  America is hurting right now. Those who can should step up and help. \nI know of no millionaire who needs a sustained tax cut of 4.6 percent \nor who has asked for one. But I know several who are willing to step up \nand help. That is the irony of this debate.\n  Conversely, the evidence is extremely poor for extending tax cuts for \nwealthy Americans. When the CBO analyzed the number of different \npolicies aimed at creating jobs, sustained tax cuts for the wealthy \ncame in dead last. Interesting. On the other hand, permanently \nextending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy would require $700 billion \nmore in deficit spending. They are unpaid for.\n  In light of this report issued Wednesday by the President's fiscal \ncommission, of which some of my colleagues are members, I simply cannot \nargue for extension of the upper income brackets.\n  It would be one thing if I could say the Bush tax cuts for the \nwealthy contributed to an era of substantial economic growth and \nprosperity. But here is the key: History does not support that.\n  In 2001, the first set of Bush tax cuts was proposed as a means of \nstimulating the economy as we emerged from the dot-com bubble. Of \ncourse, we were also projected to have a $5.6 trillion, 10-year budget \nsurplus. We all know that when President Clinton left office, he left a \nsurplus.\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\n  In light of these facts--the fact that there was money, there was a \nsurplus--I voted for the first round of Bush tax cuts. I believed the \ngovernment surpluses should be returned to the American people. But as \nPresident Bush was leaving office, we were forced to confront some very \nsobering truths. The 10-year budget deficit was projected to be $6.3 \ntrillion, not the $5.6 trillion surplus we had thought. There was a \ntotal turnaround. The national debt had increased by over 80 percent.\n  The argument made by Republicans, if we remember, during that time \nwas that deficits don't matter. It doesn't matter that the Iraq war was \nnot funded. The tax cuts didn't matter. ``Deficits don't matter'' was \nreiterated throughout this Chamber, and the belief was that lower \nincome tax rates would actually increase revenue for the Federal \nGovernment. This has been debunked by recent history.\n\n  CBO data shows that changes in law between 2001 and 2005 resulted in \ndeficit increases of $539 billion, and the Bush tax cuts accounted for \nnearly half that amount.\n  However, the most scathing indictment against extending these tax \ncuts for the wealthy is illustrated in our recent history of inequality \nand wage stagnation. From 2003 to 2007, incomes for families in the top \n5 percent of taxpayers increased by 7 percent, while incomes for the \nother 95 percent of taxpayers remained stagnant. So from 2003 to 2007, \nthe only incomes that increased were the top 5 percent. Everybody else \nremained stagnant. So the economy was clearly working for the other 5 \npercent but not for anybody else.\n  The average income of the top 1 percent of income earners increased \nby 10 times as much as that for the bottom 90 percent. That is an \namazing figure, if you think about it, that the top 1 percent gained 10 \ntimes more in income than all of the other bottom 90 percent of \ntaxpayers.\n  During the expansion of 2002 to 2007, families saw their median \nincome drop by $2,000. That is the first time Americans have seen their \nincomes drop during a period of economic growth. So there was growth, \nbut the median income was dropping during that period of time.\n  During this period, also, income tax rates for the top 1 percent of \nearners were reduced by twice as much as rates for anyone else. The top \n1 percent today--and under the Bush years--are paying less in taxes \nthan they did in the Clinton years. So there was actually a drop in \nrate for the top 1 percent.\n  In 2007, the top 10 percent took home almost half of the country's \ntotal earnings, which translates to the highest level of income \ninequality in our Nation's history in that year, 2007.\n  We face a number of daunting problems. Our national debt is now in \nexcess of $14 trillion. If we continue deficit spending, we will \nunquestionably begin to constrict economic opportunity for this \ngeneration and those that follow.\n  Our economy is struggling to grow at a pace that will start providing \njobs, we hope, for over 15 million out-of-work Americans. I think \nincome inequality today is at a historic high, and it is an \nunacceptable high.\n  In light of these facts, I do not see the merit in the argument that \na permanent extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy will have a \nmaterially beneficial impact on the economy, and I applaud Chairman \nBaucus for introducing a responsible bill recognizing these stark \nrealities.\n  If we were to do this, we increase income inequality. If you continue \nto lower taxes for the top brackets, all you do is increase income \ninequality. You grow the gap between the rich and the poor. I would \nsuggest that bodes ill for the United States of America.\n  Chairman Baucus also included two key provisions in this bill, and I \nwould like to take a few moments to speak about them.\n  This summer, I introduced a bill that would allow family farmers to \ndefer their estate tax payments until they sold the farm or took it out \nof operation as a farm. The idea was to make sure small working family \nfarms avoided having to make crippling decisions about their land when \nit came time to pay the estate tax. Let me explain why.\n  Family farms today in America are land rich and cash poor. Farm \nincomes have not kept pace with rising land values in this country, \nwhich puts family farms in a precarious position when it comes to \nsettling estate tax bills. Because family farmers often have little \ncash on hand to pay the estate tax, they can be forced to sell land to \ndevelopers in order to make good on the estate tax. Over multiple \ngenerations, this can decimate the operation of a farm.\n  This proposal before us today would preserve the existence of family \nfarms by allowing them to defer paying the estate tax until they are \ntaken out of operation and to reassess it at a stepped-up value at that \ntime. By doing this, we can preserve and strengthen existing family \nfarms, which I strongly believe are part of the fabric of this country.\n  This provision would not be available to everyone. It includes income \nand asset restrictions in order to ensure that the deferral benefit \ngoes only to farmers who need it most and not agribusinesses. If \nfarmers who elect deferral fall out of compliance with the \nrequirements, they would face a recapture penalty in the amount of the \nestate tax owed. It is my hope in this way we can help ensure the \ncontinued existence of family farms, and I applaud the chairman for \nincluding this provision.\n  The legislation also includes a 2-year extension of the highly \nsuccessful Treasury Grant Program, which has been widely credited with \nmaintaining strong economic growth in the renewable energy sector in \n2009 and 2010 despite the severe economic turndown.\n  The grant program has proven a particularly effective job creation \ntool. According to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study, the \nprogram has enabled hundreds of renewable energy projects to move \nforward and save more than 55,000 American jobs in the wind industry \nalone.\n  Prior to the economic meltdown, clean energy project developers \nrelied on tax equity partnerships with investors to take advantage of \nclean energy tax incentives. In 2008, the economic meltdown froze the \n$8 billion tax equity market, jeopardizing billions of dollars in clean \nenergy investment. The Treasury Grant Program proved an effective \nreplacement for these partnerships, supporting about $18.2 billion in \nclean energy investment to build 8,600 megawatts of renewable energy \ngeneration through October 25 of this year.\n  With most utilities and developers still unable to utilize existing \nproduction and investment tax credits, and our Nation's economic \nrecovery dependent on the creation of new jobs, this 1-year extension \nof the grant program is critical.\n  According to a survey of all leading participants in the tax equity \nmarket, without an extension of the program, the anticipated financing \navailable for renewable energy is expected to decrease by 56 percent in \n2011.\n  In contrast, a recent study found that a 1-year extension of the \nTreasury Grant Program would result in nearly 65,000 more jobs in the \nsolar industry alone and enough additional solar power to power more \nthan 1.2 million homes.\n  So it is important to emphasize this is not a new Federal incentive \nprogram. It simply allows clean energy companies to utilize existing \ninvestment and production tax credits without having to partner with \nWall Street banks.\n  This proposal, however, does include one serious problem, which I and \nmany of my colleagues oppose: an extension of wasteful subsidies and \ntariffs for ethanol. The Baucus draft would extend, for 1 year, the \nethanol tariff at 54 cents per gallon while lowering the tax credit for \nblending ethanol into gasoline from 45 cents to 36 cents. This \nincreases the real trade barrier on ethanol imports. Fuel importers \nwill pay a real 18 cents per gallon tariff on ethanol that they do not \nhave to pay if they choose to import oil instead.\n  This will only make America more dependent on foreign oil from OPEC \nstates. It will increase the competitive advantage that oil already has \nover cleaner, climate friendly ethanol imports from democratic, sugar-\nproducing states including Brazil, Australia, and India. This is bad \ntrade policy, bad environmental policy, and bad energy policy.\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\n  This provision is in direct conflict with the Imported Ethanol Parity \nAct, a bill I have introduced on a bipartisan basis. This bill would \nrequire the ethanol tariff to be lowered to the same level as the \nethanol subsidy. I believe the tariff should be lowered to 36 cents per \ngallon, at a minimum, in this bill. Keeping the tariff at 54 cents does \nnot make sense.\n  Even the ethanol lobby itself does not believe the tariff should be \nthis high. In a statement just this week, the primary ethanol lobbying \ngroup, the Renewable Fuels Association, put out a statement saying:\n\n       The tariff simply exists to offset the value of the tax \n     credit, preventing American taxpayers from subsidizing \n     foreign ethanol producers.\n\n  Bottom line: If the ethanol tariff served only as an offset, it \nshould be at the same level as the subsidy, not 18 cents higher.\n  Also, this proposal would be extraordinarily expensive. Oil companies \nare required under the Renewable Fuels Standard to use 13.95 billion \ngallons of biofuel in 2011. At 36 cents per gallon, the subsidy would \ncost the U.S. Treasury more than $5 billion to pay profitable oil \ncompanies to follow the law. We cannot afford such a subsidy to oil \ncompanies that will use the ethanol anyway.\n  I believe it is important to underscore who is bearing the brunt of \nthe pain being doled out by the economic downturn and the subsequent \nweak recovery. The top 2 percent of taxpayers are not the ones \nsuffering during this crisis. In fact, with sales of luxury goods set \nto surge to their highest peak since the recession began in 2007, the \nrecovery for the richest Americans seems well under way. They are able \nto do well for one reason or another in this economy. But it is the \nincome groups below them who are not, who cannot get the loans, who \ncannot meet the payrolls, whose homes are being foreclosed on, who have \ngreat difficulty surviving in this most difficult economic marketplace.\n  So let's not forget why we are faced with this impending tax increase \nin the first place. The Bush tax cuts were designed to sunset because \nthey were not paid for. They were not paid for because we were told \nthey would lead to higher revenues. In fact, that has not happened. It \nis time to let the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy Americans expire.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8453-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8453-S8454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFICIT COMMISSION REPORT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, underneath the ground level of the \nbuildings on Capitol Hill is a subway system. It connects on the Senate \nside the major buildings where Senators and staff and committees have \ntheir offices with this glorious Capitol Building. If you get on the \nsubway over at the Dirksen Office Building to come over to the Capitol, \nit is a very brief journey. I do not think it lasts for an entire \nminute. In less than 1 minute you move from the Dirksen Office Building \nover to the Capitol Building.\n  This morning, I took that journey, leaving the meeting of the deficit \ncommission to come over to the Senate floor, and in less than 1 minute \nI emerged from the world of reality to a surreal world in the Senate. \nLet me explain.\n  For the last 10 months, because of President Obama's Executive order, \nwe have had a bipartisan deficit commission that has asked some of the \nhardest questions I have ever faced as an elected official: How can we \ncome to grips with the debt of this country? What can we do to reduce \nspending and increase revenue so our children do not end up inheriting \nan unconscionable, unsustainable debt?\n  It has been a hard meeting to discuss changes in the law and changes \nin spending. The goal was to cut $4 trillion out of the deficit in the \nnext 10 years. It sounds simple, doesn't it, with a government this \nsize and an economy this size, but it is not. When you get down to it, \nhard choices have to be made.\n  Erskine Bowles from North Carolina and Alan Simpson, former Senator \nfrom Wyoming, chaired it and did a great job. It was inspired by Kent \nConrad, our colleague from North Dakota, and Senator Judd Gregg of New \nHampshire. They were the ones who asked for this commission.\n  We went to work for 10 months, and today we voted on that commission \nreport. I voted yes. I left that deficit commission to take that short \n1-minute subway ride over here to the Capitol to emerge in the Senate \nChamber and to try to understand how two buildings so close to one \nanother can be so far apart. Here on the floor of the Senate, the \ndebate is on whether we should extend tax cuts for the wealthiest \npeople in America. Doing that will add dramatically to our national \ndebt.\n  Just to put it in perspective, Senator Mitch McConnell's proposal for \ntax cuts for the next 10 years will cost us $4 trillion. Does that \nnumber sound familiar? That is the amount the deficit commission was \ntold to eliminate in spending and create in revenue over the next 10 \nyears. All of the work of this commission, as controversial as it is, \nwould only pay off Senator McConnell's Republican tax cut proposal, \nmeaning we would make no progress in reducing the deficit of the United \nStates of America.\n  Well, let me tell you about that vote over in that deficit \ncommission. My phone has been ringing off the hook because some people \nknow--and I will put it on the record--I am a progressive. I come from \nthe left side of the spectrum. I am a Democrat. I am proud of it. I \ncome from a tradition of two wonderful people who served in this \nSenate: Paul Douglas of Illinois, who was my first boss on Capitol Hill \nwhen I was a college kid, and his friend and my mentor, Paul Simon of \nIllinois, who preceded me in the Senate. They were both liberal and \nproud of it, but they were both fiscally conservative. Someone may ask: \nHow could you do that? Well, because, as Douglas once said and Simon \noften repeated, if you are a liberal, it doesn't mean you are wasteful. \nIt doesn't mean you are a spendthrift and can't be thrifty and find \nways to cut spending so that the money that is absolutely needed in \nAmerica for critical national security or the benefit of people who are \nstruggling is there when you need it. They believed those two things \nwere consistent, and I do too.\n\n  What this deficit commission forced us to do was take an honest look \nat the debt of America, which is over $13 trillion. This debt has \nexploded in recent years.\n  A little bit of history. When President William Jefferson Clinton \nleft the White House 10 years ago, the national debt was $5 trillion. \nThe budget was in surplus. There was extra money in the budget that was \nbeing used to buy time and longevity for Social Security. And it was \nprojected that the next year, there would be a $120 billion surplus in \nthe budget. Ten years ago: $5 trillion debt, budget in surplus, and \n$120 billion surplus predicted for the next year.\n  Fast forward 8 years after President George W. Bush, and there was a \nmuch different picture. The national debt was no longer $5 trillion. \nThe national debt of America had risen in 8 years to $12 trillion. It \nmore than doubled. The budget was in serious imbalance.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama inherited in his first year a more \nthan $1 trillion deficit. That is the budget he was left by President \nBush. What happened in 8 years for that dramatic negative turnaround in \ndebt in America? We waged two wars and didn't pay for them. We had \nprograms that might have been fundamentally sound, such as the \nprescription drug program, but we didn't pay for them. And there was \nthe argument by the Republicans that in hard times and good times \nalike, tax cuts were always the answer. So for the first time in the \nhistory of the United States of America, during two wars, we gave away \ntax cuts, plunging this Nation deeper and deeper into debt. Today, that \nnational debt is over $13 trillion.\n  Listen to this: 40 cents out of every dollar we spend in Washington \nis borrowed--40 cents. Who loans us the money? The Chinese--they are \nour mortgagors--Japan, Korea, the OPEC nations. Sadly, as we become \nmore deeply in debt and more indebted to them, we are at their mercy. \nIf tomorrow--and it could happen as quickly as 1 day--if tomorrow the \nChinese said: We have lost confidence in the American dollar and we \ndon't believe this government is serious about deficits, we could see a \ndramatic negative economic impact on the United States of America. We \nare at the mercy of our\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\ncreditors, and our largest creditor is China, which today happens to be \nour largest global competitor for emerging markets around the world.\n  That is why this deficit commission is so important. The commission \nset out not only to eliminate $4 trillion in spending over 10 years but \nto engage America in a conversation long overdue.\n  Think about this for a moment: If you ever happen to see the Tax Code \nof the United States of America and open it, you will understand why \nmost people don't. It is unintelligible. Unless you are an accountant \nor a lawyer or practiced in the art, it is hard to understand what is \ngoing on, with sections and articles and subparagraphs. But that book, \nthat Tax Code of America, is one of the most important books when it \ncomes to this deficit debate because each year in America we spend, on \nthat Tax Code, $1.1 trillion. We spend $1.1 trillion in deductions, \ncredits, exclusions, and tax earmarks. That sum, as huge as it is--$1.1 \ntrillion--is more than we collect each year from all of the personal \nincome taxes paid across America. That sum is more than we spend each \nyear for all of the domestic discretionary nondefense programs. It is \nhuge, and people don't know what is in it. Some do. There are a lot of \nspecial interest groups, businesses, groups, organizations, and \nassociations that have protected themselves and taken care of \nthemselves in that Tax Code.\n  This deficit commission, the Bowles and Simpson commission President \nObama put together, has finally opened the door and taken a look inside \nof that Tax Code. I think they did the right thing. What they said to \nAmerica is, if we eliminated all of these deductions and all of these \ncredits, how could we reduce the rates, the income tax rates paid by \nAmericans at every level and by corporations. And the answer is, they \ncould be reduced dramatically--dramatically. That, to me, would be a \nstep forward. I am not calling for the elimination of all of the \ndeductions and credits. Some of them are important--the deduction for \nhealth insurance, mortgage interest, charitable donations, and the \nlike--but we should take a look at each one of them, and we virtually \nnever do.\n  Tax reform needs to be part of deficit reform. That was the message I \ntook away from this deficit commission report.\n  Some people ask me how a person such as myself, coming from my end of \nthe political spectrum, could vote for a deficit commission report. \nWell, it is basically this: I don't think that borrowing 40 cents out \nof every dollar we spend for either a nuclear missile or a food stamp \nis sustainable, and I don't believe that being indebted for generations \nto China and OPEC makes America a more fair and just nation.\n  When we engage in the critical decisions about our Nation's future \nbudgets, I want progressive voices at the table arguing that we must \nprotect the most vulnerable in America and demand fairness in budget \ncuts, in spending, and in revenues. My vote today for the deficit \ncommission report is my claim for a seat at that table. I don't view \nthis vote as a vote on final passage of a bill. That is not how I \nlooked at the commission report. I view it, as we say in the Senate, as \na vote for a motion to proceed, to begin an important budget debate on \nthe floor.\n  After the commission meeting, reporters came up to me and said: What \nis next? Well, I will tell you what is next. What is next is President \nObama's State of the Union Address in which I am sure he will allude to \nthis challenge. What is next is the President's budget, which we should \nreceive in February, and following that, a budget proposal from the \nHouse, then one from the Senate, and a debate on our debt ceiling in \nAmerica. Each of these will create an opportunity for us to take the \nmessage of this deficit commission and move forward. Some parts of it I \nwill definitely want to change. Some parts I don't agree with. Other \nparts I think are essential.\n  Let me say a word about Social Security. There is no more important \nsocial program in America, and there never has been. It is more \nimportant today than it has ever been because people understand that \nyour pension and work may not be around when you need it. A lot of them \nhave lost it. People understand that the little nest egg, the savings \nyou have, may get beaten up by Wall Street tomorrow. But Social \nSecurity is the bedrock. It is what we count on.\n  We have to make sure this program, which is destined to be solvent \nfor another 20 years, is destined to be solvent for more years. This \ndeficit commission has come up with a proposal which will add 75 years \nof solvency to Social Security.\n  Although it is the deficit commission, the Social Security Program \nhas nothing to do directly with the deficit. Making it a solvent \nprogram isn't going to help solve our deficit, but it is going to give \npeace of mind not only to those currently receiving Social Security but \nto a lot of young people who really question whether the program will \nbe there when they need it. I don't agree with all of the proposals \nthat came out of this deficit commission. I would change some. I think \nsome of the benefit cuts don't have to take place, but I think this \ndeficit commission is on the right track to give people peace of mind \nthat Social Security is going to be there for a long time to come.\n  There are parts of this proposal, this deficit commission proposal, \nwith which I do not agree. But I will tell my colleagues, getting back \nto my beginning point--and I see some other Senators coming to the \nfloor--I hope those Senators who come to this floor and passionately \nargue for tax cuts for wealthy Americans at this moment in time will \nacknowledge the obvious: They are piling up deficit debt on America, \nthey are calling for more money to be borrowed from China and other \nnations, and they are enslaving our children and future generations to \npaying off that debt before they can enjoy the prosperity most of us \nhave enjoyed in our lives. To ignore that is to ignore the deficit. To \nignore the debt is to turn their backs on the reality of what extending \nthe tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America will mean.\n\n  I hope we can ask our Republican colleagues to take that little trip \non the subway over to the Dirksen Building and go in there and read the \ndeficit commission report before they come to the floor and make a \nspeech that ignores the obvious: Cutting taxes on the wealthy adds to a \ndebt that our children will have to pay.\n  I believe we need to continue the tax cuts for the time being for \nthose making $250,000 a year and less. That is needed to get us through \nthis recession and create more jobs. I hope we can get that done before \nwe leave so that what happened in the deficit commission will be \nreflected in sound judgment here on the floor of the Senate.\n  The last point I will make is this: It is unfair, it is unjust, it is \ninconsistent with the history of this country for us to cut off \nunemployment benefits for Americans, as we did yesterday. Cutting off \nthose benefits means that 2 million unemployed Americans will lose the \nhelping hand they need to feed their families, to pay utility bills, to \nbuy clothes for their kids, in the middle of this holiday season. There \nare 127,000 unemployed Illinois families that will lose their \nunemployment benefits this week. That weekly check of $300 may not \nsound like that much to a Senator or a Congressman. It may be the \ndifference between making that second trip to the food pantry and \nkeeping the lights on in their home during the holiday season.\n  I urge my colleagues in both political parties to put party aside and \nthink about the reality of this recession and unemployment in America, \nand whatever we do on tax cuts, I insist, I beg that we include \nunemployment insurance as part of that benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

That is an impressive reversal, don't you \nthink?\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side ran for reelection this fall \nsaying\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\nthat the deficit is a cancer, that we owe it to our children and \ngrandchildren to cut the deficit. Well, to them I say: Congratulations \nbecause for one of the first votes after returning to Washington, you \nare going to vote to put over $9,300 more debt on the head of every \nchild in America. Way to go. And what is that for? To give an average \ntax cut of $100,000 to Americans making over $1 million a year.\n  My friends, on this subject, have been saying to us: Haven't you \nlearned the lesson of the election? I do not recall permanent tax cuts \nfor millionaires being on any ballot. In fact, let's take a look at the \nexit polls conducted by Edison Research, the exclusive provider of the \nnational election exit polls for all of the major TV networks and the \nAssociated Press. In their poll, they found that roughly 60 percent of \nAmericans wanted to end tax cuts for income over $250,000. More \nrecently, a Quinnipiac poll said that only 35 percent of Americans \nwanted the Bush tax cuts extended for those with incomes over $250,000.\n  Of course the American people feel this way. They know what has been \nhappening over the last 20 years in this country. According to the \nEconomic Policy Institute, during the past 20 years, 56 percent of all \nincome growth went to the top 1 percent of households. Even more \nunbelievably, a third of all income growth went to just the top one-\ntenth of 1 percent. The wealthy have done extremely well for themselves \nover the past 20 years. Unfortunately, this is why the middle class has \ndone decidedly worse. When we adjust for inflation, the median \nhousehold income actually declined over the last decade. During those \nyears, while the rich were getting richer, the rest of working America \nwas struggling to keep up. We have been growing apart. The American \npeople know this.\n  Now, working Americans are forced to listen to Republicans as they \ndemand that everyone needs to share in the pain; we are all in this \ntogether.\n  The IRS published a study analyzing the tax returns of the wealthiest \n400 Americans. Want to take a guess at what their average effective tax \nrate was? Just over 16.5 percent. Is that sharing the pain? Are they \nsharing the pain just like everybody else?\n  Frankly, I am a little tired of being lectured to by my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle on the deficit. We all know Bill Clinton \ninherited the largest deficit in history from George H.W. Bush and then \nhanded George W. Bush the largest surplus in history. Then George W. \nBush nearly doubled the national debt and also handed Barack Obama the \nlargest deficit in history. Of course, my friends controlled the \nCongress for most of those Bush years.\n  Today, we are talking about how to get our economy going and keep \ndeficits down at the same time, while what we are discussing right now \nis whether to restore the Clinton marginal tax rate on the very \nwealthiest of Americans. I remember that when he raised the tax rate on \nthe top 2 percent, Republicans said that would kill the economy. Newt \nGingrich--remember him--on August 5, 1993, said:\n\n       I believe this will lead to a recession next year. This is \n     the Democrat machine's recession, and each one of them will \n     be held personally accountable.\n\n  Senator Phil Gramm--remember him--said:\n\n       The Clinton plan is a one-way ticket to recession. This \n     plan does not reduce the deficit . . . but it raises it and \n     puts people out of work.\n\n  Governor-elect John Kasich said:\n\n       This plan will not work. If it was to work, then I would \n     have to become a Democrat.\n\n  Congratulations, Ohio, on electing a Democratic Governor.\n  Mr. President, 22.7 million jobs and a giant surplus later, George W. \nBush waltzes into office and says: Hey, we are running a surplus. The \npeople deserve a tax cut.\n  Let's recall what he said about his tax cut. He said over and over \nagain:\n\n       By far, the vast majority of the help goes to those at the \n     bottom end of the economic ladder.\n\n  Wow. That sounds like the bottom got the vast majority of the tax \ncuts, doesn't it? They didn't. Actually, the bottom 60 percent of \nAmericans got just 14.7 percent of the Bush tax cuts. The top 1 percent \ngot 29.5 percent of the tax cuts, which is exactly double. Let me \nrepeat that. The top 1 percent got double of what the bottom 60 percent \ngot.\n  The results of this new policy? Massive deficits. Only 1 million new \njobs over the 8 years of the Bush Presidency, compared to 22.7 million \nduring Clinton's 8 years. My friends in the minority want to go back to \nthat discredited economic policy.\n  The figleaf here is small business. They attack us and say that not \ncutting taxes on the richest Americans will hurt small business. Well, \nit seems that, to my friends, some small businesses are more important \nthan others. Why did they block us for months on passing the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act, which gave tax cuts to small businesses and created \na $30 billion line of credit for small businesses on Main Street? Why \ndid they oppose the HIRE Act, which gave large tax cuts to small \nbusinesses to encourage them to hire unemployed workers? Well, it seems \nthese aren't the small businesses my friends are so concerned about. \nWhen you and I think about small businesses, we picture the mom-and-pop \ngrocer down the street somewhere in Oregon or Minnesota or maybe a \nhardware store or a small precision manufacturing operation--we have a \nlot of those in Minnesota. We probably think of them as small \nbusinesses because they are small. They probably have a few employees, \none location, and make a modest but comfortable living doing it.\n  Republicans are trying to scare us into believing that the grocer and \nthe hardware store owners will shutter their doors and fire people if \nwe return the top two tax brackets to previous levels. But that is \nsimply not the case.\n  In reality, only 3 percent of small businesses will be affected by \nthis change. Yet you will hear Republicans tout that these top 3 \npercent of businesses make up 50 percent of the total small business \nincome. That tells you one important thing--that those 3 percent of \nsmall businesses aren't truly small businesses. Only under the \nbroadest, most arbitrary of definitions are these businesses small.\n  When many of my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about \nsmall businesses, they are including anybody who uses a flowthrough \nbusiness entity--so an S corp or a partnership. They are not defining a \nsmall business by size, profits or the number of people they employ. \nThey are defining it on a technicality.\n  Under their definition, Bechtel, the fifth largest company in the \nUnited States, is a small business. The Koch brothers, who run a \npetroleum company with nearly $100 billion in annual revenue, are \nconsidered a small business. They are worth about $16 billion each. Law \nfirm partners and Wall Street bond traders are considered small \nbusinesses.\n  So Republicans are using the mom-and-pop grocery store to defend the \ncontinuation of these tax cuts. In reality, the only people they are \nhelping are the Bechtels and the Kochs of the world and maybe Derek \nJeter, Inc.--he deserves every dollar he gets--and Mel Gibson, Inc.--\nmaybe he has had a bad year--and other likely ``small business'' \nbeneficiaries.\n  At the same time that Republicans are demanding unpaid-for tax cuts \nfor the Koch brothers, they are insisting we pay for a continuation of \nthe emergency unemployment insurance program. They want to pay for it, \neven though unemployment benefits have been shown to be an extremely \neffective stimulus--in fact, one of the most effective stimulus \nmeasures. Why? Because when unemployed workers get their checks for a \ncouple hundred dollars, they go to their local mom-and-pop grocery \nstore and buy food. They spend that money right away in their \ncommunities in real small businesses.\n  It is the holidays. Can they afford to buy a small Christmas present \nfor their kids? I am worried that there are those among us who would \nsay: No, no presents.\n  The Republicans say these unemployment benefits are too expensive. \nThey demand that these benefits must be paid for. But tax cuts for the \nrichest people in America--no need to pay for those. Adding $700 \nbillion to the deficit--or actually $830 billion when factoring in \nextra interest payments--that is no problem. I hear my friends on the \nother side say we are going to have to make some hard choices. I agree. \nThe deficit is a problem. Getting it under control will take shared \nsacrifice.\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\n  There are a lot of Minnesotans who have to make hard choices now. \nMaybe it means giving up a second car or no summer camp for the kids. \nSome communities in Minnesota have had to go to a 4-day school week \nbecause there just isn't the money there.\n  Some Minnesotans have been even harder hit. Their unemployment \ninsurance was cut off earlier this week because of us. They have a lot \nof hard choices right now. Where are they going to live if they can't \npay their mortgage or their rent? Choices: food or medicine or heat. \nHow do I give my kids anything resembling a Christmas?\n  These are people who lost their jobs and desperately want to find \nwork, but we can't pass unemployment insurance for them unless it is \npaid for. But for the owners of Bechtel or PricewaterhouseCoopers--yes, \nPricewaterhouseCoopers is a small business too--the sky is the limit.\n  I am Jewish. I don't know the New Testament all that well, but I do \nknow Matthew, which says:\n\n       Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of \n     my brethren, you did for me.\n\n  I went to a union hall not long ago for the building trades. A \ncarpenter came up to me--a big, strong guy with rough hands, big \ncalloused hands--with tears in his eyes. He had just a little bit of \nwork here and there over the last 18 months. He said to me: I never \ntook unemployment insurance before. I hate it. But if it weren't for my \nunemployment insurance, I wouldn't be in my house.\n  Making tough choices means doing one thing and not another. Right \nnow, we are faced with that choice. If we can't agree to help people \nsuch as that carpenter and his family by continuing emergency \nunemployment benefits, how can we live with ourselves? How can we think \nwe are doing our jobs?\n  The choice before us is clear this holiday season: Lend a hand to \nthose who simply can't get by without the help or give $100,000 in \naverage tax cuts to people making over $1 million.\n  Where are our values? What are we doing here? It is almost Christmas. \nWe will be leaving to spend time with our families. We have jobs; we \nhave great jobs. I think this is the greatest job--trying to make \npeople's lives better back in Minnesota. That is my job.\n  I ask my colleagues this: What are we doing here?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nupon my finishing, the Senator from Utah be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise as well to speak about the single \nmost important issue facing the American people today, and that is the \nstate of the economy.\n  Let's consider three facts and lay them side by side. First, over the \nlast decade, even though the economy was growing modestly, middle-class \nincomes declined for the first time since World War II. The average \nmiddle-class family, which had always seen things get better and \nbetter, did not from 2001 to 2010.\n  By the way, this did not just occur during the recession which began \nin 2008. It was constant throughout this decade. The great American \ndream, what is it? I submit it is very simple. Not everyone wants to \ntry to become rich, and everyone knows they are not going to become \nrich, but they certainly know one thing: In America, the odds are very \nhigh you will be doing better 10 years from now than you are doing \ntoday. And the odds are even higher your kids will do even better than \nyou. When incomes decline over a decade, that American dream burns a \nlittle less brightly for people and the whole tenor of America changes \nand we see the kind of anger we have seen, which is not typical of this \ngreat land of ours with its amazing people. That is unusual.\n  So, first of all, middle-class incomes have gone down.\n  Secondly, in the last decade, one group did very, very well--the \nhighest in income among us, the millionaires and billionaires. God \nbless them. Their taxes went down, down, down over the last decade \nbecause of the Bush era tax cuts, but their incomes went up, up, up. \nThey did great.\n  Thirdly, over the last decade, while all of this was happening, our \ndeficit got out of control. When we began this decade in 2001 there was \na $250 billion surplus. We hadn't had that in decades. It was wonderful \nand it helped fuel the economy because small businesspeople and large \nbusinesspeople would borrow knowing that interest rates would stay low. \nInterest rates are often a greater cost to them than taxes. But when \nPresident Bush departed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at the end of 2008, he \nleft behind a deficit of $1 trillion. Some of that was due to the war \nin Iraq, where our brave soldiers defended us, and Afghanistan as well, \nand a little more of it was due to new programs the President authored, \nincluding a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens. But most of \nit was due to the fact that he cut taxes on the wealthy.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say we have to keep the \nBush tax cuts, particularly those for the wealthy. Well, was the last \ndecade a great success? Not for the middle class. No. Their incomes \nwent down. Not for job growth because that was smaller than before. So \nwhen we had the Clinton era level of taxes in the 1990s, all of America \nand job creation and the middle class, in terms of income, did better \nthan with these tax cuts which began in 2001. So this cry that we need \nthese tax cuts for prosperity doesn't fit with history. It may fit with \na particular ideology, but it doesn't fit with history.\n  Who on Earth would want to extend a failed economic program that \ndidn't help the middle class--the backbone of America, the place I come \nfrom and always fight for? Who would want to extend this failed \neconomic program? I will tell you who. Every single 1 of my 42 \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle is marching in lockstep \nsaying please extend this failed economic program. Why? It seems to me \nwhat they hold out for is tax cuts for the millionaires. In fact, they \nare so committed to extending the failed economic program of the Bush \nyears, they are willing to hold hostage the middle-class tax cuts, \nwhich we all agree we should have, until they can give a giant tax \nbreak to millionaires and billionaires.\n  That defies economic logic. The well-off--the people for whom my \ncolleagues in the minority are fighting--aren't going to spend their \ntax break and get the economy moving. They are not going to rush to \nJCPenney and buy that warm winter coat they have been waiting to buy. \nThey are not going to go out to the Barnside Diner and buy a nice prime \nrib dinner. They can afford all that already. They can afford it 7 days \na week, 52 weeks a year.\n  I want to say something about these millionaires and billionaires. \nGod bless them. We are not mad at them for having done well. We admire \nthem. We all wish we were like them, as successful as they were. God \nbless them. All we are saying is they do not need another $400,000 or \n$4 million at this time when there are so many other more important \nneeds.\n  I want to reiterate that. I have nothing against the wealthy. I don't \nlike it when we knock them. I think they are great. I respect them. I \nadmire their achievements. There are lots of them in New York who \nstarted with nothing and worked their way up. I think it is great. Some \nof them inherited their wealth, that is true, and they seem to have \neven more a sense of entitlement than the ones who made it themselves, \noftentimes, but many more live the American Dream through their own \ngreat ingenuity. They pulled themselves up the economic ladder by their \nbootstraps. But I have to tell you something. When I talk to them, at \nleast those who are wealthy in my home State of New York--even many \nRepublicans--they say: You know what. For the good of the country, I \ndon't need this kind of tax break. If we put it to deficit reduction, \nmost of them say: I would be for it. Not all of them say that. \nCertainly not the hard right people who seem to have the party on the \nother side in the palm of their hands, who say: I made my $10 million \nand don't you dare touch a nickel of it. But most--most--say: Chuck, I \ncan afford to pay a bit more. I have nothing against returning to the \nClinton rates, as long as, they say--and this is a reasonable caveat--\nthe money goes to a good purpose: making our schools better, improving \nour infrastructure and, above all, they say, decreasing the deficit.\n  That is what the amendment I will offer tomorrow would do. The other\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\nside of the aisle wants you to believe the average American \noverwhelmingly supports tax breaks for millionaires. I have heard it. \nThey say: The election--haven't you Democrats heard about the election? \nWell, I was running this year. I happened to get 65, 66 percent of the \nvote. I got a lot of votes from Republicans, a lot of votes from \nIndependents, and I talked to a lot of angry people. I saw a lot of tea \nparty people. None of them said to me: Make sure you keep tax breaks \nfor the millionaires. They may have said shrink the government; they \nmay have said repeal health care. That is true. But none, none said: \nKeep the tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\n  Here is a poll that reflects that, and it is not by some Democratic \nParty organization or some Republican Party organization but by CBS, a \nnonpartisan poll. The poll yesterday said only 26 percent of Americans \nsupport millionaire tax breaks--26 percent. Now you may say: Well, that \nis just the Democrats. Oh, no. Only 25 percent of Independents say keep \nthe tax breaks for millionaires--those swing voters who are the ones \nwho created a lot of new Republican seats and caused us to lose a lot \nof Democratic seats. Even on the Republican side, 46 percent--only 46 \npercent--supported millionaire tax breaks.\n  So this idea that the election was a mandate to cut taxes on \nmillionaires and billionaires--you know, I didn't only run in New York, \nbut I worked closely with many of my colleagues in many parts of the \ncountry--the Northeast, Midwest, Southwest--and none of them reported \nany hue and cry to keep tax breaks for millionaires--none. That is not \nwhat the election said.\n  Now maybe the money of some of those millionaires helped create ads \non other issues that helped win the election for these folks but not \nthe issue itself. So we need to get our economy humming on all \ncylinders again, and it is true we need to stimulate demand.\n  Mark Zandi, an economist who is as well-respected on the right, as \nwell as the left--I believe he was Senator McCain's chief economic \nadviser when he ran his campaign--said every dollar spent on tax breaks \nfor the millionaires generates 32 cents of economic activity. Those of \nus who believe in economic efficiency, which I do, know that doesn't \nwork. Let me give a contrast. Every dollar spent on unemployment \nbenefits generates $1.61 in economic activity.\n\n  So if you care about getting the economy going, you are going to be \nfor increasing unemployment benefits quicker than tax breaks for \nmillionaires. According to Mark Zandi, most every economist--even those \non the right--doesn't believe that is false. UI benefits are 400 \npercent more stimulative than tax breaks for the wealthy according to \nMr. Zandi.\n  Yet on Wednesday, when my esteemed and effective colleague from Ohio, \nSenator Sherrod Brown, came to the floor and asked unanimous consent \nfor just a 1-year reauthorization for unemployment benefits, the other \nside objected. As the Senator from Minnesota said when he was speaking \non the Senate floor a few minutes ago, the anomaly is that the \nRepublican Party is saying we don't have to pay for tax breaks for the \nmillionaires but we have to pay for an increase in unemployment \nbenefits. What kind of logic is that?\n  The middle class is worried. They are worried about how they are \ngoing to stretch that paycheck. They are worried about how they are \ngoing to make that mortgage payment. They are worried about how they \nare going to keep that job. In this recession, middle-class people are \nmore unemployed than ever before. Most recessions in the past had two \ndifferences: One, they mainly affected the poorest people and the \nworking-class people who made the lowest salaries. This one has gone \nway up into the middle class and the upper middle class. I have met \nhundreds of these people as I have traveled through my State, and they \nare out of work for a lot longer. It is no longer 3 weeks or even 3 \nmonths but 6 months, 9 months, a year. We just heard the unemployment \nrate went up, under these Bush tax cuts, to 9.8 percent.\n  We are trying to offer solutions that bring the unemployment rate \ndown. We are trying to offer solutions that focus on the middle class, \nwhile our Republican colleagues are busy defending the wonderful people \nwho made a lot of money but don't need the help.\n  After Senator Brown offered his bill to reauthorize unemployment \ninsurance, Senator Udall of New Mexico asked for consent to take up and \npass a bill to extend the highly successful Building Start Program. \nThat gave tax incentives so construction workers could build buildings \nthat were energy efficient--150,000 good-paying jobs. They objected.\n  Next came Senator Stabenow from Michigan, a real leader in the fight \nfor job creation. She came to the floor with a bill to give tax breaks \nto manufacturers. We need manufacturing, not only in her State of \nMichigan but in my State of New York--particularly upstate. \nConservative estimates said the bill would create 40,000 private sector \njobs. Again, the Republicans objected.\n  Then I offered a bill myself--and I am glad my colleague from Utah is \nhere because this was a bipartisan bill. It was a tax cut for business \ncalled the HIRE Act. It said if you hire somebody who is unemployed 60 \ndays, you don't have to pay the payroll tax for this year. It is \nexpiring. I wanted to extend it. Objection.\n  The bill had passed with bipartisan support. But the point is to get \ntax breaks for the millionaires they would even object to a bipartisan \nbill that gave a tax break to businesses that would employ people. What \nkind of logic is that?\n  One final point as I conclude, and that is about the deficit. The \ndeficit, as I mentioned, is huge. But let me just say the Bush tax cuts \nand particularly those for the millionaires and billionaires add a huge \namount to the deficit, and we do not hear a peep about it from the \nother side. They care about the deficit, but $300 billion that it would \ncost to give these tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, that is \nOK. Please.\n  Over the next year, I am going to be up here reminding my colleagues \nwhen they say we cannot pay for help to our schools so they can hire a \nscience teacher who might create the genius that would create a new \nindustry that would create new jobs, when they say we cannot have money \nto repair a road or a sewer project that would create good-paying jobs \nbecause it would increase the deficit, I am going to remind each and \nevery one of them that they said, when they gave tax breaks to \nmillionaires, the deficit didn't count. Just remember that.\n  And, of course, they say these tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires are tax breaks for small business. My good colleague--\nsomeone who looks very much like the Presiding Officer, the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, who was seated over there a few minutes ago--talked \nabout that.\n  My dad was a small businessman. He had a little exterminating \nbusiness. It wasn't very successful. I know how he suffered through it. \nHe knows these tax breaks are not for a business like his--or the dry \ncleaner or the restaurant or any of these other businesses. They are \nnot for any at all because we are not talking about corporate tax cuts. \nThey are for very wealthy people, some of whom you have mentioned.\n  I know my colleague from Utah has been patiently waiting, so I am not \ngoing to talk about all the small business stuff, but I just want to \nremind people about this plan. Under the President Bush tax breaks for \nmillionaires, here is what would happen. Under the plan my colleagues \nacross the aisle are supporting, people who make $1 million would get a \n$43,000 break per year; people who make $10 million would get a \n$400,000 break per year; people who make $100 million would get a \n$3,800,000 break per year. The average middle-class family making \n$60,000 would get $2,500. We want to get that middle-class family its \nbreak. We will give the same amount to these folks, they will get a \nbreak, no more and no less, than the middle-class family. But we don't \nbelieve these breaks, where we have so many other needs and a huge \ndeficit to boot, are called for.\n  We will be debating that all day today, all tomorrow morning until \n10:30--but also for the rest of the next 2 years.\n  Again, I repeat, don't talk to us about deficit reduction, folks, if \nyou are willing to put this whopping hole for deficits for tax breaks \nfor the millionaires and billionaires. Don't come\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\nto us and say this program for this school or this road or this small \nbusiness incentive should not be passed because of the deficit but it \nis OK to give the breaks to these folks.\n  More people last night tuned in to watch the reruns of ``Matlock'' on \nTV Land than would benefit from the Republican proposal. I haven't seen \n``Matlock'' in a long time. I am sure those people who watched it had a \ngood time, but it wasn't many of them. But it was more of them than the \nmillionaires and billionaires who would get this break. They are a \npowerful group. God bless them. They should not have the kind of power \nthey have, to have good people on the other side of the aisle tie \nthemselves in a knot to prevent all kinds of important things from \nhappening until they get their break.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been in touch with Senator McConnell, \nand he knows I am asking this consent agreement. I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, December 4, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Reid motion to \nconcur with the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 4853 \nwith the Baucus amendment No. 4727, with the time from 8:30 a.m. to \n10:30 a.m. equally divided between the leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a time that virtually no one is \nhappy with. Someone wanted it late, someone wanted it early. As I \nindicated to Lula Davis, we just split the baby in half. This is the \nbest we can do. Make as many people happy as we can. We are coming in \nat 8:30, which is unusual on a Saturday morning, but people who live \ncertainly east of the Mississippi, they can go some ways--it is \ndifficult for those of us who live west of the Mississippi to go \nanyplace, but at least some people will be able to have an afternoon at \nhome or in their States with this agreement that has just been \napproved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I always enjoy listening to my colleague \nfrom New York. He is one of the brightest people in this body, he is \none of the toughest, and he has been a very dear friend all these \nyears.\n  I might mention that the Schumer-Hatch bill is now law, a bipartisan \nbill we did put through. That was a good step in the right direction as \nfar as gaining jobs.\n  I would also like to point out that 56 percent of all capital gains \nthat create jobs are paid for by people who earn over $500,000 a year.\n  I also would care to point out that I absolutely guarantee to \neverybody watching us today what would happen if there were these tax \nincreases. I think the distinguished Senator knows his suggestion polls \nvery well. Is that the reason we should do it? No. But I guarantee, and \nI do not think anybody could doubt this guarantee, that if his approach \nwins, the Democrats will take every dime of that and spend it. In fact, \nthe President's budget spends more toward the end than it does now--I \nmean a lot more. That is one of the problems.\n  We know a good 50 percent of small businesses would be affected. They \nare the ones who create jobs--25 percent of the employees and about 50 \npercent of small businesses would be affected if we do what the \nDemocrats would like to do.\n  Be that as it may, those are some of the differences. But I am going \nto explain why at the last minute this Congress--after the upheaval \nthat happened during the election--this Congress cannot seem to get \ntogether during a time of economic distress and put over these tax \nreliefs that were started in 2001-2003--that we cannot do that and at \nthe last minute to come in and want to change the game again and do \nthat at a time when we have the economic difficulty and problems we \nhave. It is more of the same.\n  Over the last few days Americans watching C-SPAN would have seen a \nlot of speeches about widespread tax hikes that will arrive with the \nnew year. Many of my friends on the other side deployed several \nattacks. C-SPAN viewers probably were not surprised the attacks were \nexclusively aimed at those on this side.\n  I will not get into correcting the record any more than I have on all \nof that misinformation right now. I would like to focus on two themes \nwe heard. We heard them over and over. The first theme was repeated \nmany times. It was this: Republicans are accused of holding hostage tax \nrelief for middle-income taxpayers. The second theme took some \ncreativity. If you listen to our friends on the other side you would \nthink they had hired a psychic or mind reader, that somehow this mind \nreader had successfully read the minds of 42 Republican Senators.\n  Our friends spoke as if they had determined the motives of 42 \nRepublican Senators. Perhaps not surprisingly, the motive ascribed was \nnot very favorable. Republicans' alleged hostage taking was described \nas solely motivated by a desire to cut taxes for high-income people.\n  If our friends in the Democratic leadership hired a mind reader, I \nadvise them to seek a refund because it did not work. You have been \nhad, my friends. You didn't need a mind reader. You need not come to \nthe floor and spend all day ascribing motives to your colleagues on \nthis side.\n  The record is clear today. It has been clear for a decade that the \ntax relief program has been in effect. Actions speak louder than words. \nVotes speak louder than talking points or press releases.\n  When first passed over 9\\1/2\\ years ago, nearly all of the Republican \nconference supported the bipartisan tax relief plan. Roughly one-fourth \nof the Democratic caucus supported the plan.\n  Because of the opposition of the Democratic leadership, efforts to \nmake these policies permanent law were rebuffed. Check the record. \nDuring the years of the Republican majority, the Democratic leadership \nopposed efforts to make the widely applicable tax relief measures \npermanent. Those efforts were also opposed by the other side.\n  What is even more revealing is the record since the Democratic \nleadership assumed control of the Congress almost 4 years ago. A few \nmoments ago, I said actions speak louder than words. Votes speak louder \nthan speeches. After obstructing permanent tax relief in the minority, \nwhat did our friends in the Democratic leadership do when they gained \npower? Let's take a look.\n  I have a series of charts. The Democrats have taken power. These \ncharts chronicle the record of the Democratic leadership on this time-\nsensitive matter. The first chart chronicles the first year of the new \nDemocratic Party majority. The year is 2007. The Democrats took power \non January 4, 2007. You will see it circled on the chart right here. \nThat is January 4. Look at the rest of the year in 2007. Think about \nit. No action was taken on the tax hikes that come down in less than 1 \nmonth. No action, none, nothing, zilch.\n  Let's take a look at 2008. This chart is pretty simple. Take a look. \nIt is completely blank other than the calendar on there. No action, \nnothing, none, zilch.\n  Here is a chart for 2009. It is an important chart as well. There \nwere big changes in Washington. Democrats gained a large majority, 60 \nvotes in the Senate. It was basically a filibuster-proof body. That is \ncircled here on January 6.\n  President Obama takes office on January 20, right here. It is circled \nright there. You can see it. A little over 3 months later an event \noccurred that many on our side of the aisle will not forget. The senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania crossed the aisle to give Democrats a \nfilibuster-proof majority. Let me just point to that third circle right \nhere.\n  Nothing happens for the rest of the year, not a doggone thing \nhappened for the rest of the year. We had a larger Democratic majority \nsworn in; President Obama was sworn in.\n  Then my dear colleague Senator Specter decided he wanted to be a \nDemocrat, and he switched parties. That got 60 votes in the Senate. \nNothing happens for the rest of the year, nothing else happens.\n  On December 3, 2009, 1 year ago, the House Democratic leadership \npasses a long-term death tax reform. That is right here on December 3. \nThis represents a milestone. Almost 3 years into their majority, one \nportion of the congressional Democratic leadership took comprehensive \naction on one piece of the 2001 tax relief expiring provisions.\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\n  Let's take a look at 2010. It is the fourth year congressional \nDemocrats have controlled both bodies, abjectly controlled them, in \nthis decade. The House-passed death tax reform was placed on the Senate \ncalendar on January 20, 2010. When Senator Scott Brown was sworn in on \nFebruary 4, the Democratic majority fell, if that word is appropriate, \nto 59 majority votes. What has happened for the balance of this year? \nWhat action has the Democratic leadership taken as the big tax hikes \napproached? With the economy slumbering and a big tax hike coming, what \nactions has the Democratic leadership in both Houses taken? With the \nNation's job creators, America's small businesses, expressing pessimism \nabout the business environment and a looming tax hike on the horizon, \nwhat actions has the Democratic Party leadership taken? With \nunemployment announced today at 9.8 percent and a big tax hike coming, \nwhat action has the Democratic Party leadership taken over these last 4 \nyears?\n  By the way, this latest data indicates that the unemployment rate is \ngoing the wrong way; that is, upward. It is going up again. More \nAmericans are out of work. I remind my friends in the Democratic \nleadership to pay close attention to this data. It should concentrate \nthe mind on policies to counter the problems at hand rather than \npolitics.\n  With a big tax hike less than 1 month away and this horrible economic \ndata arriving this morning, what action has the Democratic Party \nleadership taken and the Democratic leadership in the Senate? Let's \ntake a look. Over the past several months, Republican Senators have \ncome to the floor to urge our friends in the Democratic leadership to \naddress a time-sensitive topic. I am referring to a package of \nunfinished tax legislative business.\n  I am on the Finance Committee. I sit right next to our ranking \nmember, Senator Grassley. I expect to take over as ranking member in \nJanuary. Ranking Member Grassley and I used this chart in a colloquy a \ncouple of weeks ago. Here is our checklist chart. The only piece of \nlegislation the Senate has considered is one small but important piece \nof unfinished tax legislative business. It is what we call tax \nextenders--something we almost automatically have passed in the past.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party leadership in the Senate and \nHouse scuttled a bipartisan agreement between Chairman Baucus and \nRanking Member Grassley about 10 months ago. After we put it right out \nof the Democratic-controlled Finance Committee, they basically canceled \nit. That includes the research and development tax credit that helps \nour high-tech world to remain competitive, to mention one.\n  The reason I mention that is because it is something almost everybody \nwants. It is one of the glues that bind everything together. Over this \nwhole year after we put that tax extender bill out, look where we are.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership scuttled the bipartisan \nagreement between Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley about 10 \nmonths ago. After that, a partisan strategy was pursued by our friends \non the other side. Not surprisingly, it failed several times. I will \ngive them a checkmark on the chart for doing the minimum. My friends in \nthe Democratic leadership did at least bring up a bill.\n  As the chart shows, the tax extenders--right here--which are overdue \nby almost 1 year, are not alone. There are three other major areas of \nunfinished business, and there are others as well. But I decided to \ntalk about these.\n  One area Senator Grassley and I discussed at length a couple weeks \nago applies to millions of middle-income families this year. It is the \n2010 alternative minimum tax. Another area is the death tax. In less \nthan 1 month from now, the number of States to be hit by the death tax \nwill shoot dramatically upward. Small businesses and family farms are \ngoing to be lost unless we do something about it. But here we are in \nthe last few weeks of this session. They haven't done a doggone thing \non the AMT patch. The House did something on death tax reform, but we \nhave done nothing. Both bodies have done nothing. And they have done \nabsolutely nothing on these tax hikes. When compared with the Lincoln-\nKyl compromise on death tax reform, the number of taxable estates will \nbe 10 times higher. In the case of family farms, it will be 13 times as \nhigh.\n  The third area is the 2001 and 2003 tax rate cuts. As important as \nextenders, the AMT patch, and the death tax are, the impact of this tax \npackage down here is monolithic in comparison. I am referring to the \nmarginal income tax rate reductions that are current law until the end \nof this month. I am also referring to family tax relief. Both pieces \nwere the core of the bipartisan tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003.\n  For an example of the importance of this package, we need look no \nfurther than a typical family of four. For a family of four earning \n$50,000 of income, the tax hike they face will be $2,136. In this slow-\ngrowth environment, who among us thinks it makes sense to hike this \nfamily's taxes by almost $200 a month? That is where we are. Unless we \ncan get this all done by the other side cooperating, it seems to me, a \nfamily earning $50,000 is going to be socked an extra $2,136.\n  Contrast the record I have laid out with the two attacks directed at \nRepublicans over the last 2 days. Just tell me, how could we possibly \nhave held hostage any bill with the votes the Democrats have had over \nthe last 4 years? The folks taking these partisan shots have had almost \n4 years with an overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate \nto deal with a massive tax hike set to kick in in less than a month \nnow. Republicans have not controlled the House for 4 solid years. For \nalmost 2 years, the other side has ruled with one of the most robust \nmajorities in modern times. The motives of the minority in the House \nhardly ever solely determine the fate of any bill there. It is likewise \nin the Senate. A filibuster-proof majority has a lot of power. A \nmajority that is slightly less than filibuster proof needs to work with \nthe other side. That is the way the Senate has always worked.\n  Even if we Republicans were to decide to filibuster, how could we \nhave filibustered something that doesn't exist? Look at all those prior \ncharts. Not one doggone thing done. It is something that has not \nexisted for almost 4 years of Democratic Party control of both Houses \nof Congress. Go back through the record. In the 4 years of majority \nrule, show me the Senate Democratic leadership bill that Republicans \ncould obstruct. There hasn't been any.\n  Yesterday, finally the dam of inaction broke, but it broke on the \nHouse side. House Democratic leadership sent a bill late in the second \nweek of this lameduck session. The bill does not prevent a tax hike on \nvirtually every American taxpayer. But what kind of action is the House \nbill? It is political action, pure and simple. It is political. Look no \nfurther than the statements of the bill's authors, the House Democratic \nleadership. We can view that bill as an expression of partisan \nsentiment in the House Democratic caucus. It will not become law, and \nwe all know it.\n  It is up to the Obama administration and Senate Democratic leadership \nto work with Republicans. The aim should be a bipartisan transaction or \ndeal, if you want to call it that. Real legislating on these time-\nsensitive tax hike prevention issues is long past due.\n  What kind of actions are the American people receiving from the \nSenate Democratic leadership? The majority leader has used his \nprocedural power to jam Republicans. He has a right to do that. But it \nhas been consistent. Call a bill up, fill up the parliamentary tree, \nprevent any and all amendments in the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld, and then try to ram it through. I have to say that these tactics \nalso jam any Democrats who might differ with the Democratic \nleadership's scheme. And there are some who do. The sum and substance \nof the Democratic leadership procedural jam is to guarantee that we \nwill waste yet more procedural and more precious time. If Members don't \nbelieve me, ask the congressional press corps outside the Chamber.\n  Taking a bet on a successful legislative outcome of the two jammed \nvotes would not be a good wager. It could be akin to accepting an offer \nto sell the Brooklyn Bridge from a fast-talking New Yorker. No one is \nfooled by this move by the Senate Democratic leadership. I challenge \nany of my friends on the other side to show me the votes.\n  How will the actions of the Democratic leadership advance the ball if\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\nthe two votes are designed to fail? Sure, maybe from their perspective \nthere is some cheap political benefit to the Democratic leadership and \nDemocratic Party staging these jammed votes. As one member of the \nDemocratic leadership implied yesterday, maybe there will be some \ncampaign material produced. Is that what this is all about? Is that \nwhat the greatest deliberative body in the world is all about in the \nlast few weeks of this session when this country is in the fiscal \nproblem it is in?\n  I ask my friends to step back and take another look at the political \ncalculation they may be making. The American people are angry. I have \nheld seven townhall meetings in the last few months, plus two tele-\ntownhall meetings. The American people are very angry. The American \npeople know it has taken almost 4 years for our friends in the \nDemocratic leadership in both the House and Senate to address this \nlooming tax hike. They have had monumental majorities that would have \nenabled them to put just about anything through that they wanted, such \nas the looming tax hike they all knew about when they took power long \nago. Is it really worth running through this political charade with a \ncouple of partisan votes and campaign commercials that may be used 2 \nyears from now? Is it really that important?\n  I ask my friends in the Democratic leadership and the Democratic side \nto consider the political calculation further. Especially consider it \nwhen these two partisan jam votes fail. If they want to keep playing \npolitics with a big tax hike on virtually every American, what will \nthey say when we hit the last day of this calendar right here? Will \nthey say: Too bad, American families. Will they say: Too bad, small \nbusiness folks. Will they say: Jamming the other side with partisan \nvotes was our foremost goal. What will they say after wasting the hard-\nworking taxpayers' time and money on these jam votes?\n  Let's go to the partisan allegation that it is not helpful to the \ngoal of a bipartisan deal. It is the second theme to which I \nreferred. Many on the other side ascribed to Republicans a motive to \ntake whatever action necessary solely to provide tax relief for high-\nincome taxpayers. Now, let's be clear. Senate Republicans and Democrats \nboth want to prevent tax hikes on middle-income families. The only \ndifference is Senate Republicans want to do more.\n\n  On this side, in this slow-growth environment, we do not want to \nraise taxes on anyone right now. Yesterday, I discussed some of the \nreasons for preventing any tax hikes, even preventing the so-called \nmillionaires' tax hike. It is a hit on small businesses, and we all \nknow it. It is a hit on the after-tax rate of return on investment. \nThis so-called millionaires' tax hike will slow the flow of the \nlifeblood of business--capital.\n  Let's be clear. On our side, we want, just as much as the Democrats \nwant, to protect middle-income taxpayers from a tax hike. Nearly every \nRepublican in 2001 supported it then, tried to make it permanent, and \nwe support it now.\n  You need look no further than our leader's bill. It is right there in \nthe bill. On our side, we want more of these middle-income taxpayers to \nkeep their jobs. We want a business and investment environment that \nreduces the punishingly high unemployment rate of close to 10 percent \nnow. That does not even talk about the underemployment rate which is a \nlittle more than 18 percent when you include people who do not even \nwant to look for a job anymore and those who have given up.\n  Almost 4 years ago, in the 2006 election, the American people \nprovided the Democratic Party leadership with control of the Congress. \nIn the 2008 election, almost 2 years ago, the American people provided \nthe Democratic leadership with the largest majorities in more than a \ngeneration. They also provided the Democratic leadership with a \nPresident of their party.\n  The Democratic leadership spent the period of 2001 to 2006 thwarting \nefforts to make the bipartisan tax relief of 2001 and 2003 permanent. \nUpon assuming control, they spent almost 4 years with no legislation, \nas you can see on this chart, to make permanent or even extend the \nmarginal rate cuts and family tax relief packages. No Senate \nlegislative action, no Senate committee and floor action, no Senate \naction until this late lameduck session partisan jam vote.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership needs to engage. Engagement is \ndefined as a constructive activity with the goal of changing the law. \nEngagement is not defined as repeating a dead-end partisan process like \nwe have seen with the extenders bill--something we should have passed \nlong ago and we were willing to. Time-sensitive tax legislative \nbusiness should go through the regular order process. It is too late \nfor that now, as you all know, as we all know.\n  It is too late for partisan stunts. The American people need action. \nActions speak louder than words. It is too risky for all of our \nconstituents to aim for partisan stunts. The clock is ticking, and soon \nthis calendar, in this year right here--this whole calendar--will be \nhistory.\n  Well, the Americans deserve real legislative action. As I have said, \nit is one thing to come on the Senate floor now and try to raise the \nthresholds and so forth at this late date. But the fact is, small \nbusinesses are mainly partnerships, sub S corporations, entities where \nthe income comes to the small businessperson who, in most cases, if \nthey want their business to grow, puts a lot of that income back into \ncreating jobs and opportunities.\n  I have even heard the phony argument over the years that, well, it is \nonly 3 percent of small businesses. Well, that 3 percent is 750,000 \nbusinesses that create 70 percent of the jobs in this society.\n  I would like to see jobs recreated. I would like to see us do the \nthings we are here to do. I would like to have the White House--they \nhave brilliant people in the White House, brilliant people, not one of \nwhom, to my knowledge, has been constructive in his or her lifetime in \ncreating private sector jobs. They are great at creating public sector \njobs, as we have all seen over the last couple years, as Federal jobs \nhave jumped dramatically. But hardly anybody down there even knows how \nto create a private sector job.\n  I do not want to be mean to the President or anybody else. These are \nbrilliant people. Maybe there is something there that they can come up \nwith. But they sure as heck are not helping us get through this end of \nsession in a way that will create jobs.\n  I hope our negotiators on both sides will wake up and realize we have \nto do what is right for this country, and we have to do some things \nthat will help small businesses in this country create jobs. At a time \nwhen unemployment has now jumped to 9.8 percent, with the \nunderemployment rate over 18 percent the last time I checked, it seems \nto me the worst thing we could possibly do is mess it all up with tax \nincreases against anybody.\n  I personally have suggested that since Republicans want this tax \nrelief of 2001 and 2003 to be permanent, since we have wanted that, and \nthe Democrats have wanted only those at $200,000 and $250,000--below \nthose figures--to have the tax relief, and they want their so-called \nmiddle-class tax rates to be permanent--which we would keep going \nbecause we believe as much in middle-class tax relief as they do--in \nfact, I think actually more--it seems to me we ought to get together \nand we ought to at least give this economy a chance over the next 2 or \n3 years, as much as I would like to make this statute permanent, and \ngive us a chance to be able to regenerate jobs in this society in ways \nthat make sense.\n  Keep in mind, when we start talking about the so-called millionaires' \ntax, we are talking about 56 percent of all capital gains rates paid by \npeople, many of whom are small businesspeople who will create jobs if \nwe can get rid of the uncertainty that, I have to say, has been \ncontinuous over the last 4 years, and certainly over the last 2 years.\n  I just hope we can get together. I hope nobody will construe my \nremarks as trying to pick on anybody. I do not want to do that. I just \nwant to make these points because I think they are relevant, they are \ntruthful, and, frankly, it is time we get together and get these \nproblems solved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from South \nDakota, Senator Thune, for allowing me to precede him.\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this morning to urge my \ncolleagues--all of us--to move very quickly to pass tax relief for \nmiddle-income Americans. We have a crisis in this country: a crisis of \njobs, a crisis of income for middle-class families. One of the ironies \nis I was here in 2001 when the Bush tax cuts were proposed. One of the \nmajor premises of those tax cuts was, well, this is going to free up \nthe engine of job creation. It is going to result in such economic \ngrowth that our surplus--and at that time we had a surplus--is going to \nbe sustained, if not increased.\n  The record is that we have seen the worst private sector job creation \nin this decade since pre-World War II. We have seen the incomes of \nmiddle-class Americans stagnate, while we have seen the incomes of the \nvery richest expand dramatically.\n  One of the phenomena that was taking place at the end of the 1990s \nand in 2000 and was a function of several things--first, tough tax \nvotes by Democrats alone in 1993 to begin to balance the budget; \nsecond, Federal Reserve policy that recognized those tough votes and \nwas appropriate in terms of providing an adequate interest rate level; \nand the third was something, frankly, we did not even recognize: the \nexplosion of information technology in terms of how it made us more \nproductive--but those three factors together led us to the year 2000, \nto a situation where we had a surplus. We had unemployment rates that \nwere very low, particularly relative to today.\n  Then the Bush administration came in and decided tax cuts, \nparticularly tax cuts for the upper income Americans--because that was \nthe implicit argument, that they create the jobs--if you give those tax \ncuts to the wealthy, they will create the jobs. Well, we have had 10 \nyears of real experience, and that has not worked.\n  There are other factors that intervened. We have had two wars we \nchose not to pay for, increasing the deficit; we vastly expanded \nentitlements--not reforming them really but expanding them--through \nPart D of the Medicare Program, which was also unpaid for.\n  Now we are looking at the worst economic performance we have seen \nsince the 1930s. We need to do two hugely challenging missions: First, \nwe have to grow jobs. We have to continue to sustain demand. That is \nwhy in that context a tax cut for middle-income Americans makes some \nsense now. I did not think the package of tax cuts made any sense in \n2001. I voted against it. I think we should have stuck with the hard-\nwon surplus, investing in the country. Or if we were going to provide \ntax relief, give it to the middle class, give it through a reduction in \npayroll taxes that will encourage more employment, give it in a way \nwhere it is targeted to those people who are struggling with jobs, with \ncollege tuition. That was not the choice that was made though. I think \nthat choice back in 2001 was the incorrect choice.\n\n  But now we have another choice, and this choice--again, mission 1: \nHow do we keep this demand going? How do we sustain it? There is a \nstrong argument to provide a continuation of the middle-class tax cuts.\n  But the next mission is, how do we rein in this deficit? That \nrequires tough choices. To me, the idea of withholding further income \ntax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, that is something that in \nterms of deficit reduction is probably a lot easier to do--and, \nfrankly, there is nothing easy to do around here these days--but a lot \neasier to do than some of the glib discussion or claims that we will \njust reform Medicare, or we will reform this entitlement, or we will \ncut this defense program, et cetera. All of that may have to be done, \nbut ask yourselves: If we cannot do this, how likely will we be able to \ntake on even tougher issues that confront us?\n  So I think this is a defining moment in terms of our continuation of \nsupporting working families, expanding the economy, growing jobs in \nAmerica, and also taking at least a small step to begin to deal with \nthe deficit. We know the addition of these tax breaks for the \nwealthiest--and let me put the tax issue in context. We have a \nprogressive tax system. People who make a lot of money will enjoy all \nthe tax reductions that stay in place for middle Americans. They will \nnot enjoy the tax cuts that were imposed by the Bush administration for \nthe wealthiest. That cost to the Nation over 10 years will be $700 \nbillion of additional deficit.\n  We are already in a hole, and we are going to dig ourselves much \ndeeper. We can decide--and I hope we do--to continue to try to provide \nsupport to middle-income Americans, and at the same time achieve that \nother objective which must be dealt with: somehow trying to get a \nhandle on the deficit--a deficit that the President inherited, along \nwith an unemployment rate that was unacceptable. Progress has been \nmade, not enough progress in terms of employment, and we have to keep \nup the effort.\n  So this is an issue of providing support for working Americans and \nbeginning the long-term difficult task of getting the deficit under \ncontrol. It is a difficult task. I was here in 1992 and 1993 and 1994 \nwhen it was done--and it was a difficult, arduous task.\n  The bill that Chairman Baucus is offering today will also extend the \nMaking Work Pay tax credit that gives all working Americans a $400 tax \ncut in their paycheck through 2011--again, to encourage work in the \nUnited States. It will make the child tax credit permanent. It cuts \ntaxes for families paying college tuition, State and local sales tax, \nand property taxes. All of that is aimed at working families, our \nconstituents. It also cuts taxes for business research and development, \nother programs that are going to help, we believe, stimulate job \ncreation. These are very important.\n\n  At the crux of it, though, is this decision to support working \nAmericans, middle-income Americans. Again, there is a tendency in these \nkinds of debates to be stereotypical and to misunderstand. People who \nhave been very successful in the country and make a lot of money work \nawfully hard, but I use the term to refer to those middle-income \nAmericans who are working very hard, facing real challenges, and don't \nhave the same kind of support they just had, if you will, 2 or 3 or 4 \nor 5 years ago to fall back on.\n  There is another aspect of this legislation that is pending before \nus. One point I wish to make is that there is a national housing trust \nfund that was discussed being included. That is not included, and I \nhope we can include it. That is another program that is going to help \nput people to work, and I hope we can do that.\n  Then, of course, there is the other aspect of the Baucus bill; that \nis, the emergency unemployment compensation. We just received a report \nfrom the Council of Economic Advisers, and they have pointed out that \nthis program has helped 14 million unemployed workers as of October \n2010, and at that time, there were nearly 5 million unemployed workers \nbenefitting from these programs each week--5 million Americans. These \npeople were working. They got caught up in this recession. This is, for \nmany of them, the only constant source of support they have now as they \nlook for work.\n  We have seen this benefit not just the recipients but their families. \nIn fact, there has been an estimate of about 40 million people--spouses \nand 10.5 million children--who have depended in part on getting these \nunemployment benefits.\n  It has also been able to maintain employment. There is an estimate \nthat 800,000 jobs have been maintained and created because of this \nunemployment compensation. That is because when someone gets their \ncheck, they do not usually toss it aside; they cash it. They go to the \ngrocery store. They go to the gas station. They go to places they have \nto go. They put a little tuition down if they have to pay tuition on a \nchild's education because they desperately need these funds. So in that \nregard, it creates and sustains jobs.\n  We are in danger, frankly, of seeing this UI program terminated. I \nthink we have to continue it. I think it will add immensely to the \nefforts under way to help middle-income Americans. The average benefit \nis about $300 a week. That is certainly not an inducement to say: I \ndon't need to look for work; I want to spend the rest of my life making \n$300 a week. The program provides up to 99 weeks of benefits. There is \nno attempt to extend it, but it would be the same 99 weeks people were \nable to benefit from 2 years ago. So I think we have to do that. That \nis part of this debate also. I would hate to see that the only thing we \ndo at the end of this day is pass tax cuts and not also include \nunemployment compensation.\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\n  I think we have to have a middle-class tax cut, but we also have to \nhave unemployment compensation benefits extended. I don't have to tell \nanyone in this room that the unemployment rate is too high everywhere. \nIn my State, it seems to hover between 10 and 12 percent. We have never \nwithheld emergency unemployment benefits nationally as long as the \nunemployment rate was above 7.2 percent. Republican administrations, \nDemocratic Congresses; Democratic administrations, Republican \nCongresses--in every combination, we have always understood that this \nprogram needs to be renewed.\n  So I have heard other proposals such as, let's do this, but let's \noffset it by unobligated funds. But these unobligated funds could \ninclude many things. For example, they could include a border fence in \nArizona and California because there are funds there that are \nunobligated. Now, I ask some of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, is that what they intend? Border Patrol stations in Texas, \nArizona, California, and Washington. Construction of Coast Guard ships \nand planes and the National Security Cutter built in Mississippi. Then \nthere are cyber security investments to secure Federal information \nsystems. We have just been briefed on the profound and deleterious \nimpact of the WikiLeaks. We have a lot of work to do to improve our \nsecurity systems. Are those unobligated funds coming out of that \nprogram? Homelessness assistance grants that go to help people who, in \nmany respects, are homeless because of a combination of factors: They \nhave lost their jobs; they have different problems. So, literally, are \nwe borrowing from Peter to pay Paul? Are we telling someone they can't \nget Section 8 housing because we paid someone else's unemployment \nbenefits?\n  So the proposal to pay for this by unobligated expenditures might \nhave some rhetorical appeal, but I ask, what are these expenditures? If \nwe are so committed to being clean and transparent about what we are \ndoing here, then list them out: We are going to cut funds for border \nfence, Border Patrol stations, the Coast Guard. This is how we are \npaying for it. Otherwise, I think, frankly, we should go ahead and pass \nthis as we have always done--as emergency spending--because it has a \nstimulative effect. For every dollar of unemployment compensation, \nthere is estimated to be $1.90 of economic activity. It goes right back \nto the obvious, simple point we all grasp: When that check comes in, it \nis not tossed aside. It is cashed immediately for grocery store \nvisits--all of those things are done. It gets the economy moving.\n  We are at a crisis, at a critical point. We have 10 years of \nexperience that, despite all the rhetoric, tax cuts that go to the \nwealthiest Americans probably don't contribute directly and immediately \nto jobs in the United States. We can save not only working Americans by \ngiving them a little help in their tax check, but we can begin the \nlong, difficult struggle of going from a deficit to a surplus. I have \ndone it once. It is not easy.\n  Frankly, I think the choice before us in the next 6 or 7 months will \nlook a lot clearer and more graphically in favor of the position we are \nadvancing than some of the proposals that are floating around in terms \nof programs such as Medicare and defense spending, et cetera. All of \nthem have to be looked at. But if we can't do this, I think a lot of \nAmericans and people around the globe are going to start asking the \nquestion: Do they have the political capacity to make the difficult \nchoices that are necessary?\n  A final point. Many of my colleagues say, and I think with great \ninsight, that the real judge of some of our economic policies is the \nmarketplace, the people who buy our Treasury securities. I wonder if \nthey see us as literally unable to make this choice between stimulus \nfor the middle-income Americans through tax cuts but saving $700 \nbillion. We can't make that choice? I wonder what that is going to do \nto their confidence in our ability to make tough choices down the road, \nthe confidence that keeps them buying Treasury securities. We should \nthink about that.\n  I urge passage of the proposals we have before us that would provide \na middle-income tax credit while saving money and preserving further \ndeficit spending under the Republican proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the remarks made \nearlier by my colleague from Utah whom I thought did a nice job of \nproviding a history lesson for Members of the Senate about the past \nseveral years of tax policy and why we are where we are today. I don't \nthink there is anybody here in this Chamber or any Senator from any \nState who doesn't acknowledge that we have a big problem right now with \n9.8 percent unemployment.\n  We have a lot of things on which we agree in the Senate. We have a \nlot of things on which we disagree. I think the one thing we agree on \nis that 9.8 percent unemployment is unacceptable. I think the thing we \ndisagree on is how we get that unemployment rate down. How do we create \njobs? How do we get people in this country back to work?\n  There has been a lot of discussion about various issues that might be \ndealt with here in the Senate before the end of the year, most of which \ndon't deal with this fundamental issue. The fundamental issue that is \nimportant to most Americans--and I have heard many of my colleagues get \nup and talk about people who are hurting. They are hurting.\n  We are going into a holiday season with a lot of people unemployed, \nand with the numbers that came out this morning, that number got worse. \nWe have more people unemployed, more people hurting economically. Yet \nin the waning days of this legislative session before the holiday break \nand before a new Congress gets seated next year, we have had discussion \nand motions about the DREAM Act. We had motions about don't ask, don't \ntell. We talked a lot about getting the START treaty done before next \nyear. There has been discussion about this Public Safety Unionization \nAct. I think all of these things are probably important to certain \nMembers of the Senate but none of which are as important to the \nAmerican people as the point I just mentioned; that is, 9.8 percent \nunemployment.\n\n  People are hurting. People have lost jobs in this country. That is \nthe fundamental point that I think drove voters out to the polls in \nNovember. They want the Congress to focus exclusively on fixing this \neconomy and getting people back to work. Yet we came back here in \nDecember and spent 7 days here in the Senate on a food safety bill--not \nthat that is not an important issue. It is an important issue, but is \nit as important as dealing with this number I just mentioned--9.8 \npercent unemployment?\n  The irony about the food safety bill is that after we spent 7 days on \nit, we had a little snafu. It went over to the House of Representatives \nand somebody blue-slipped it, which is something they have the \nprerogative to do, because it turns out there were revenue increases in \nthat bill, and revenue measures have to originate in the House of \nRepresentatives. So that bill, for all intents and purposes, is dead \nfor the rest of this Congress.\n  So we spent 7 days here in the Senate on the food safety bill. Now we \nare talking about doing something on unemployment, which is something \nwe should have been talking about. We all knew that the deadline was \ncoming and that it was ahead of us. We have these tax rate increases \nthat occur on January 1 of this year, which is something we should have \nbeen focused on. It is not any secret that, as the Senator from Utah \npointed out, the tax laws we have today have been the tax laws now for \nthe better part of a decade. So if we knew they were going to expire on \nDecember 31 of this year, that wasn't a secret. Many of us here have \nbeen advocating for some time for a permanent extension of those tax \nrates, but that wasn't acted on. There weren't opportunities--or at \nleast the Democratic leadership, since they have been in charge here, \nhas had no appetite to deal with doing something about a permanent \nextension of those tax policies. We have had tax extenders we have been \ntalking about for the last year, but nothing has happened. We had tax \npolicies that expired on December 31 of last year which haven't been \nextended yet. We have a whole bunch more in addition to the 2001 and \n2003 tax laws that expire at the end of this year, all of\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\nwhich impact some sector of our economy and most of which are very \nimportant to job creation. Yet for the better part of this year, what \nwe talked about were issues that arguably the other side wanted to put \nbefore the Senate.\n  We had a stimulus bill which borrowed $1 trillion from our children \nand grandchildren which supposedly was going to keep unemployment under \n8 percent. We all know that obviously didn't work. We had a massive \nexpansion of health care, which is going to spend, when it is fully \nimplemented, $2.5 trillion. We have had debate about financial services \nreform. I am not saying that any of these are unimportant issues. All \nof them involve new spending, creation of new government, new \nbureaucracies, and at the same time ignored what I think is the \nfundamental issue, which is jobs and the economy. That is what we have \nheard repeatedly.\n  Now, the reason I think so many people turned out at the polls in \nNovember was because they were very concerned about what has been \nhappening in Washington, and they wanted to come out and protest the \npolicies that were coming out of Washington, DC, because they thought \nthey were counterproductive in terms of the ultimate goal of creating \njobs and expanding the economy and getting people back to work. Yet we \ndidn't have a discussion during the entire lead-up, runup to the \nelections about getting these, with the exception of efforts on our \nside to get amendments on the floor, about these expiring tax rates.\n  We do have taxes going up on January 1 on income, on capital gains, \non dividends, on estates. You can go right down the list. There isn't \nanything in any sector of our economy that isn't going to experience \nhigher taxes on January 1.\n  In fact, it was interesting. This was a U.S. News and World Report \narticle from yesterday, a story in there that said:\n\n       Failure by Congress to extend the Bush tax cuts, especially \n     locking in the 15 percent capital gains tax rate, will spark \n     a stock market sell off starting December 15 as investors \n     move to lock in gains at a lower rate than the 20 percent it \n     would jump to next year, warn analysts.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       ``Capital gains tax rate will increase from 15 to 20 \n     percent if the tax cuts are not extended. The last time the \n     capital gains tax rate increased--on January 1, 1987, from 20 \n     to 28 percent--investors realized their gains at the lower \n     tax rate,'' said Daniel Clifton, a Washington partner at \n     Strategas Research Partners. ``We would expect a similar \n     effect this time around as investors see the tax rate going \n     up and choose to realize gains and incur the [lower] 15 \n     percent tax.\n       In a memo to clients, [this particular firm] says that the \n     date most clients are focused on is December 15 for a deal in \n     Congress before beginning to sell. One reason: Many stock \n     options expire that day and investors have to act.\n       . . . Fixing this issue next year will not negate these \n     negative impacts.\n\n  If they say we are going to put this off until next year, a lot of \nfolks will say: I don't trust these guys; they haven't done anything \nwith this yet. They are going to sell off, and that could have a very \ndestructive impact on the market and on many people's gains and things \nthat have been acquired this year, stocks and investments. It is \nunclear how bad the selloff would be, it says. But it could wipe out \nall of this year's gains.\n  That is one reason out of many that we need to act to address this \nimportant issue before the end of the year. It is fair to say, as well, \nthat contrary to what has been espoused by the other side about people \ngetting tax cuts, a lot of people are going to get tax increases. This \nhas been tax law for the better part of a decade. A lot of it was put \ninto effect in 2001 and some in 2003. So these tax cuts we have in \neffect today on capital gains dividends, marginal income tax rates have \nbeen in effect for many years now. What we are going to experience on \nJanuary 1 is not a tax cut but a tax increase on a lot of people in our \neconomy.\n  The argument was made throughout the course of the year that we need \nto allow the tax cuts to expire for people above $250,000. Of course, \nwe pointed out that half of all small business income would be taxed at \na higher rate if we allow those to expire for people above $250,000, \nand 25 percent of the workforce would be impacted. I think that was a \nview that was shared by the American public.\n  There was a CNN poll that I have here that was done in September, \nwhere 60 percent of Americans said all the tax cuts put in effect many \nyears ago ought to be extended for everybody. I think that was a view \nshared by people when they voted during the election.\n  I remember campaigning for people across this country--Senate \ncandidates and House candidates--and this was a landslide election, a \nwatershed election, by American standards. If we look at the number of \nnew Members in the House, I think Republicans have 83 or 87 new \nMembers, and there are a number of new Senators. In all of those \ncampaigns, and in all of the advertising I saw, in all of the speeches \nI heard from candidates in traveling around the country, I didn't hear \nany of them say: I want you guys to go back, when you get to \nWashington, and deal with this food safety issue or we want you to pass \nthe DREAM Act. I didn't hear anybody say: We want you to go back and \naddress this issue of don't ask, don't tell. I didn't hear anybody say: \nWe want you to go back and pass the START treaty.\n  These are all important issues. But, remember, that is not what the \nAmerican people are concerned about. Certainly, these are important, \nbut not the most important we should concern ourselves with, which is \nthe 9.8 percent unemployment rate and the fact that a lot of people are \nhurting and don't have jobs in this country. I think the issue of \nextending unemployment benefits, which will be dealt with--and for how \nlong, I am not sure--is, is it paid for? I believe it should be; some \ndon't. In any case, I think that will be dealt with.\n  That is a symptom; that is not the cause. The cause for people \nhurting in this country is that we have policies in place that are \nmaking it more difficult for small businesses to create jobs.\n  The best solution for the American people is a job, to get people \nback to work. Raising taxes has never been a way of creating jobs. Now, \nthe $250,000 threshold I think the other side concluded was not good \npolitics. So it has been tested and polled, and that is a losing issue. \nIt does impact so many small businesses.\n  So the latest version is to raise that to $1 million, and that is a \nvote we are going to have sometime tomorrow.\n  The fundamental point I am making is, I think the American people \nunderstand that to grow the economy, expand the economy, and create \njobs, we have to incentivize the job creators to create jobs. We can't \ndo that by raising their taxes. We can't do it by passing new \nregulations and making it more difficult and costly for them to do \nbusiness. That is basically what this whole past year has been about. \nMy counterparts on the other side have attacked Republicans on the \nfloor for the situation we are in, saying: Republicans are blocking us \nfrom dealing with all these important issues.\n  We did send a letter this week, signed by all 42 Republicans, and the \nletter was simple. The message was this: Yes, we think there are a few \ndays left in this legislative session, and we ought to use those days \nto focus on the things the American people care about. Notwithstanding \nany of the polls we are taking today, the best poll was election day. \nWhat people voted on on election day was jobs, the economy, reducing \nspending, and debt. The letter we put forward said let's focus on the \ntax issue and get that resolved. It is so important to our economy and \nit provides certainty for job creators to create jobs. Let's focus on \nfunding the government and dealing with this issue of spending.\n  Those are the two most important issues, as I think was expressed at \nthe ballot box by people across this country this year. Then, if you \nwant to move to other issues, fine. We had 42 Republicans who said \nthat. I think that is perfectly appropriate and in accordance with what \nthe American people want us to do.\n  As I said earlier, we spent 7 days on food safety, which is arguably \nan important issue. I am not discounting that. That was 7 days spent on \na piece of legislation that went to the House, was blue-slipped, and is \nnot going to become law this year. We lost 7 days that we could have \nbeen talking about getting tax rates down for middle-income taxpayers \nand investors. We could have dealt with the issue of the death tax \nbecause on January 1 the exemption for the death tax comes down\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\nto $1 million, and the top rate goes up to 55 percent.\n  I have heard repeatedly from farmers, ranchers, and small businesses \nin my State the concerns they have about that. What are they going to \nbe able to do if they want to pass on their business or their operation \nto the next generation, and if they have a $1 million threshold and \nanything above that, that would be taxed at 55 percent, that means many \nof them will be forced to liquidate their holdings in order to pay the \nIRS. That doesn't seem like a very good way to run a government or \ncreate jobs in the economy.\n  Again, I simply point that out as the reason I think in these waning \ndays of this session that Congress should focus on this 9.8-percent \nunemployment rate. The unemployment debate, the debate about \nunemployment benefits which will occur here is a symptom of the high \nunemployment rate. But the cause of the high unemployment rate is the \nfact that the policies coming out of Washington, DC, are not conducive \nto job creation in this country. It doesn't have anything to do with \nthese Bush tax rates because, frankly, we saw a lot of economic growth \nin the early part of this decade.\n  Since 2008, we have been in a recession. Since 2008 we have had a \nPresident in the White House and a huge Democratic majority in both \nHouses of Congress which have attempted to address this issue in the \nform of a stimulus bill which added trillions of dollars to the debt \nbut didn't reduce unemployment. It created 250,000 new jobs in \nWashington, DC. The food safety bill, according to estimates, would \ncreate another 17,000 jobs in Washington, DC. So almost anything that \nhas been done hasn't created private sector jobs but has created a lot \nof government jobs.\n\n  That is not what people want. They want jobs in the economy. They \nwant the small businesses on their Main Streets and in towns and \ncommunities to be able to invest, be able to hire that new employee, or \nbuy that new piece of equipment, add to the productivity of their \noperation in a way that will expand the economy, grow the economy, and \ncreate jobs for more Americans. I think that was the message of the \nelection. I think that is the interest of the American people still. It \nis not on all these other things.\n  I understand there is a need sometimes for political parties to check \nthe box to say they have done this or tried to do that for a particular \nconstituency. That is perhaps what drives the reason we have to have \nvotes on some of these other issues. But at the end of the day, it \ncomes down to one simple basic fundamental fact: A lot of people are \nunemployed, hurting, and the policies of Washington, DC, are \ncontributing to that. I think you can't blame Republicans in the \nCongress where for the last 2 years the Democrats have had huge \nmajorities. In the Senate, they have 58 votes now, and they had 60 \nvotes for 2009. They had 250 votes in the House of Representatives. \nThey had the White House. Yet here we are 2 years later and \nunemployment has actually gone up. We have fewer people finding jobs in \nthis country and an economy that continues to struggle and Washington, \nDC, that seems more intent on dealing with all these issues that are \nunrelated to the fundamental issue, which is creating jobs and getting \npeople back to work.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, as we head into the end of the \nyear to stay focused on the issues the American people care about--\njobs, the economy, their ability to pay their bills, and to hopefully \nsave a little money for their children's college education. As we head \ninto the holiday season, they want to have a good holiday season with \ntheir families. But this idea that somehow the way we help the American \npeople in this country is by focusing on these unrelated issues, and \ntalking about things that they at this particular point in time are not \nparticularly concerned about, strikes me as missing the point and not \nhaving gotten the message the voters sent in November of this year.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues in these last few days to work on keeping \ntaxes low on all Americans, extending the tax relief. It is not a tax \ncut. It will be a tax increase starting January 1 for people across \nthis country, including the job creators. We cannot allow that to \nhappen for the best interests of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here, like so many of my colleagues \ntoday, to talk about the situation in which we find ourselves, where \nmillions of American families and small businesses, on January 1, are \ngoing to see a tax increase because the Bush tax cuts are set to \nexpire.\n  Before I talk on that issue, I heard my colleague from South Dakota \nspeaking. I think it is important to point out the differences of \nopinion in some of his remarks because he talked about how great things \nwere in the previous decade, in the early years of this decade. But he \nneglected to point out why we are in the situation with this recession: \nbecause of the financial meltdown, the recession that began in 2007 and \n2008 as the result of so many of the policies of the previous Bush \nadministration.\n  Unfortunately, if those tax cuts that everybody is talking about were \ngoing to create so many jobs, we have had them for 10 years, and I want \nto know where the jobs are. I have a lot of people in New Hampshire who \nare unemployed, and they are not benefiting from those tax cuts because \nthey haven't created the kinds of jobs my colleague from South Dakota \nis talking about.\n  I appreciate the frustration that is there because this recession has \ngone on way too long and been way too deep, and too many people have \nsuffered. But the efforts of this Congress, through the American \nRecovery Act to try to stimulate our economy and keep people working \nhas been successful. There are construction workers, there are \nteachers, and there are small businesspeople in New Hampshire who are \nworking because of the dollars spent under that Recovery Act. The \nestimates are that 3 million people are working now or have been kept \nworking because of the dollars in the Recovery Act.\n  I just think it is important for us to correct the record a little \nabout why we are where we are today and how best we can get this \neconomy moving again.\n  Like everybody else here, I think tax increases on struggling small \nbusinesses and on families who are just getting by would be devastating \nto them and to our economy. I understand we have to do something about \nthat. But at the same time, we face another growing problem, and I \ndon't think we can talk about how we are going to deal with these tax \ncuts without recognizing that we have to look at a long-term plan for \nhow we are going to deal with this other growing problem--the problem \nof our national debt.\n  Our national debt is now approaching $14 trillion. It is approaching \nthat number quickly. In an effort to address the growing debt, I joined \n12 Democrats and 15 Republicans, including my New Hampshire colleague, \nSenator Judd Gregg, in cosponsoring legislation earlier in this \nCongress to establish the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility \nand Reform. Now, although that legislation failed, earlier this week a \nsimilar debt reduction commission, one appointed by President Obama, \nissued its report. The findings are very sobering. The report indicates \nthat we need to take dramatic action to reduce our debt. We need to \ndevelop a plan for how we are going to do that and we need to do that \nsooner rather than later. This is not a problem we can keep kicking \ndown the road and expect it is going to solve itself. But while we are \ndeveloping that plan, we need to look at how we can do everything \npossible to get the economy moving again.\n\n  We need to confront an economy that is still recovering from a deep \nrecession. I appreciate, as all my colleagues do, that now is not the \ntime to raise taxes on middle-class Americans. Senator Baucus has \nproposed a plan that makes sense. It keeps taxes low on middle-class \nAmericans, so it essentially extends middle-class tax cuts, and it also \nmakes some smart, targeted tax cuts--tax cuts that can help us lay a \nfoundation to create good jobs and grow the economy.\n  For example, I am a strong supporter of the research and development \ntax credit. When companies invest in developing new technologies, as \nthe R tax credit helps them do, they generate\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\nhigh-paying jobs and solutions that change our world for the better. \nInvestment in R plants seeds that will grow our economy and create \njobs for decades to come. I believe we should make the tax credit \npermanent myself, but I am pleased Senator Baucus's plan extends it for \nat least 2 years.\n  The Baucus plan also reauthorizes Federal unemployment benefits, and \nthe extension of unemployment benefits is one of the best things we can \ndo to help average Americans and stimulate our economy. This money will \nnot sit quietly in the accounts of millionaires and billionaires. It \nwill get spent immediately at the local grocery store, at the pharmacy, \nat the gas station, and at other small businesses that need that \nspending the most. In fact, economist Mark Zandi, who was a former \nadviser to Senator McCain, has cited unemployment insurance as one of \nthe three most effective uses of Federal funding. According to his \nanalysis, every dollar we invest today will create $1.61 cents in \neconomic growth. That is a good investment in today's economy.\n  I think it would be great if we could give everybody a tax cut and \nnot worry about the consequences. I would love to do that, but we don't \nhave that luxury. Tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent in this country \nwill cost America $700 billion over the next decade. Let me be clear: I \ndon't think we should heap another $700 billion onto our national debt. \nThat would be irresponsible. It isn't fair to our children and it isn't \nwise for the economy.\n  I think we need to move forward and provide certainty for taxpayers--\neverybody agrees with that--and to do that we will have to compromise. \nIt takes working together, Democrats and Republicans. So I am also \nwilling to vote for Senator Schumer's plan to extend tax cuts for \neveryone except those who make over $1 million a year. I think this is \nimportant to ensure that we include small businesses that might get hit \nat some level.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will come together; \nthat we can negotiate a package that is responsible with taxpayer \ndollars, that stimulates our economy, and that protects middle-class \nAmericans. That is what I am hoping to do, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we try and \ndevelop a compromise that can allow us to move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, earlier today, I was listening to the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and he talked about coming over to \nthe Senate floor from a meeting over in the Dirksen Building, which he \nsaid is about a block away, but he said it was like going from the real \nworld to a surreal world here in the Senate. As I have listened to some \nof these Senators on the Republican side speak since then, I think \nSenator Durbin is right on the mark.\n  What is going on here? Sometimes you have to stop and say: What truly \nis going on here? We have lost touch with what is happening in \nAmerica--to ordinary Americans, to the real middle class. What do we \nhave here? We have Republicans who will not do anything until we have a \ntax break for the richest Americans--continue these tax breaks.\n  I listened to my friend from South Dakota recently who was just on \nthe floor talking about creating jobs and all that kind of stuff. Well, \nwe just had the new unemployment figures come out this morning from the \nLabor Department--the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which says \nunemployment rose to 9.8 percent. But that is just the official \nunemployment figure. Actually, if you do a full accounting of payroll \ndata, if you take into account the 14.8 million workers who are part \ntime, of necessity, because they can't get a full-time job or they are \ndiscouraged and have left the workforce because they have been looking \nand they are out of work and they have gone past their 99 weeks of \nunemployment compensation, according to Leo Hindery, who is the \nchairman of the Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America \nFoundation, the real unemployment rate is now 18.7 percent--18.7 \npercent--and the job gap is not just 7.3 million, it is actually 21.9 \nmillion in real terms--21.9 million people in this country--who are \neither unemployed, underemployed, left the workplace because they are \ndiscouraged, their unemployment benefits have run out or they basically \nhave shifted around and they are not any longer in the workforce. You \ntake all that into account and you have 21.9 million people out there \nout of work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe study from the Smart Globalization Initiative project.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Friends, In a very disappointing announcement, the Bureau \n     of Labor Statistics (BLS), using its Current Population \n     Survey of non-farm jobs [attachment 2], announced this \n     morning that in November 2010 ``U.S. employers increased \n     (non-farm) payrolls by only 39,000 jobs, with 50,000 private \n     sector jobs added in the month, versus a revised 172,000 \n     overall payroll increase in October. The ``official'' \n     unemployment rate rose from 9.6 percent to 9.8 percent.''\n       The BLS also noted that there are now 15.1 million \n     unemployed workers and that since the Great Recession began \n     (in December 2007) employment has decreased by 7.3 million.\n       The monthly BLS announcement regarding unemployment, \n     however, as we note each month:\n       1. Uses only a survey of households rather than much more \n     accurate payroll data;\n       2. Excludes changes in employment among the Nation's 11.0 \n     million farm and self-employed workers; and, most important,\n       3. Does not take into account the 14.8 million workers who \n     are either: (i) ``part-time-of-necessity'' because their \n     hours have been cut back or they are unable to find a full-\n     time job (9.0 million); (ii) ``marginally attached'' because \n     while wanting work, they have not searched for it in the past \n     four weeks (2.5 million); or (iii) ``discouraged'' and out of \n     the labor force because they believe no jobs are available \n     (3.3 million).\n       Our Summary of U.S. Real Unemployment [attachment 1] makes \n     these three adjustments. It also identifies average weeks \n     unemployed, job openings, and the ``Jobs Gap'' that needs to \n     be filled in order to be at full employment in real terms. \n     With the three adjustments made, in November:\n       The number of real unemployed workers in all four \n     categories--BLS ``official'', part-time-of-necessity, \n     marginally attached, and discouraged--increased by 59,000 \n     workers to 29.9 million, compared to BLS's November figure of \n     15.1 million. Significant changes this past month in overall \n     real employment included: private sector employment \n     increasing by 50,000 jobs, which included 53,000 more \n     professional and business services jobs; manufacturers \n     shedding 13,000 jobs after shedding a revised 11,000 in \n     October; total government employment declining by 11,000 \n     jobs. The continuing loss of manufacturing jobs, for the \n     fourth consecutive month, is of particular concern.\n       The real unemployment rate is now 18.7 percent, the same as \n     October's real unemployment rate, compared BLS's dramatically \n     lower ``official'' rate for November of 9.8%.\n       The number of real unemployed workers has increased by 13.2 \n     million since the start of the recession, and since December \n     2008 it has increased by 5.3 million. By contrast, the \n     economy needs to add around 150,000 new private sector jobs \n     each month simply to keep up with population growth--in \n     November, the increase was only 50,000.\n       The Jobs Gap is 21.9 million in real terms.\n       (I must note again that some in the national press, notably \n     the New York Times, when commenting on real unemployment, \n     still leave out ``discouraged workers'' despite the fact that \n     this is a huge category and arguably the most effectively \n     unemployed of the four categories. The all-in real \n     unemployment rate of 18.7 percent drops to 17.0 percent if \n     discouraged workers are not included.)\n       The average number of weeks unemployed is now at least 33.8 \n     and the number of workers unemployed a half year or longer is \n     at least 9.6 million (i.e., BLS's figure of 6.3 mm plus the \n     3.3 mm discouraged workers). When considered together, these \n     two figures--average number of weeks unemployed and number of \n     workers unemployed a half year or longer--are a much better \n     measure of the real employment condition than the more \n     commonly used ``initial jobless claims'' number. Each figure \n     is now unprecedented in modern times.\n           Kindest regards,\n     Leo Hindery,\n       Chairman, US Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the \n     New America Foundation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. So we have a high unemployment rate, we keep losing jobs, \nand Republicans keep saying we have to extend the tax breaks for the \nwealthy. I hear that in terms of jobs--jobs, jobs, jobs. Well, that is \ninteresting, because in 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners \nin America took home 23\\1/2\\ percent of all the income in America. So \nlet us get that straight. The top 1 percent took home 23\\1/2\\ percent \nof all the income. In fact, they took home more money than the bottom \n50 percent of income earners\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\ntotal in America. Eighty percent of all the increase in income earned \nfrom 1980 to 2005 has gone to the top 1 percent. In the wake of the \n2008 Wall Street bailout, executives from Goldman Sachs received \nbonuses totaling $13 billion--$13 billion for Goldman Sachs.\n  So Republicans keep talking about we have to do more tax breaks for \nthe wealthy. Well, after 10 years of tax cuts for the wealthy, where \nare the jobs? We have had this for 10 years--what they are trying to \nextend, the Bush tax cuts, which I never voted for in 2001. So we have \nhad them for almost 10 years. If cutting taxes were so good for \ncreating jobs, I ask my colleagues: Where are the jobs? Where are they?\n  It is that same old trickle-down theory. If only we would give more \nto the top, it will trickle down on everybody else. Well, as one worker \ntold me the other day--talking about trickle down--who has been out of \na job for 2 years: I haven't had a drop. He said: I would settle for a \nheavy dew. One person told me one time--and I will never forget this \nabout trickle down--he said: If you have been raised on the farm, you \nunderstand something very simple. You don't fertilize a crop from the \ntop down. You don't fertilize a tree from the top down. You fertilize \nit by putting it at the roots. You want to create jobs in America, you \ndon't give it to the wealthiest in America, you start putting things \ndown at the bottom.\n  If we want to get to the jobs issue in America, we have to start \ntalking about what our trade laws are doing and how we are shipping \nmore jobs overseas. Let's talk about our educational system and \neducating people into job retraining or rebuilding the manufacturing \nbase in America so we can actually manufacture and make things here one \nmore time--and I mean new things, not the old things but new things: \nrebuilding our infrastructure, our high-speed networks of \ncommunications, and make sure we have an infrastructure that is second \nto none in the world. There are a lot of things we can do to spur \neconomic growth and jobs, but the worst possible one of all is giving \ntax breaks to the wealthy.\n  I haven't even touched on the moral implications of that or the \njustice or fairness issue, and I will, but just on pure economic \ngrounds we know tax breaks for the wealthy don't do it. They never have \nand they never will. Yet Republicans keep wanting to do the same thing \nover and over and over again. Someone attributed this to Albert \nEinstein--I don't know if it is true--but whoever it was said: The \ndefinition of ``insanity `` is doing the same thing over and over and \nover again and expecting a different result. Republicans keep wanting \nto give more tax breaks to the wealthy and expecting that somehow, \nmagically, we will have jobs created. Well, we gave all this money to \nWall Street and to Goldman Sachs and I don't see any jobs out there \nanywhere.\n  My friend from South Dakota was talking about the election; that we \nhave to listen to the American people. Well, here is a poll that came \nout this morning. Senator Schumer showed this earlier. This is a CBS \nNews poll out today which shows that only 26 percent of Americans \nsupport millionaire tax breaks. Guess what. N ot even a majority of \nRepublicans support it. Only 46 percent of Republicans support the \nmillionaire tax breaks. So who are my friends on the other side of the \naisle listening to? Wall Street. They are listening to those who have \nmade a lot of money and they do not want to pay their fair share of \ntaxes. They are certainly not listening to, I guess, the majority of \nRepublicans who say they don't even want the tax breaks for the \nwealthy.\n\n  My friend from South Dakota was talking about the election. We had a \nbig election. Republicans got elected to office in larger numbers. That \nis absolutely true. We can't deny that. But what ever happened to the \nelection of 2008? It is as if it never happened. Yet 40 million more \nAmericans voted in 2008 than voted in 2010. Do you know for whom they \nvoted? They voted for Barack Obama. They voted for Democrats. They \nvoted for change. They did not vote for more tax breaks for the \nwealthy. They wanted to change the system. That is what we have been \ntrying to do for the last couple of years, except that we have had \nintransigence on the part of Republicans in the Senate in the form of \none filibuster after another. So 40 million more people voted in the \nelection of 2008 than voted in 2010. Again, what we need to do is \nchange things. We don't need to change things to do more of the same, \nwhich is what the Republicans want to do.\n  I hear my friend--again, I cannot help but refer to this. He said \nthat the tax increases never created jobs. That is kind of the way I \nheard it said. I wrote it down here--can't create jobs by raising \ntaxes; never happens.\n  Frankly, I remember 1993. I was here then, and we had the Clinton \nbill here from President Clinton. It was sometimes called the Clinton \nrecovery bill. We had all worked on it here. Did it increase taxes? \nYes, it did. It increased taxes. Boy, did the Republicans howl. I was \nhere. I remember. And all the economists on the other side were saying: \nOh my gosh, if we pass this, it is going to be terrible.\n  I went back and got some of the quotes. My friend from Utah, Senator \nHatch, said:\n\n       Make no mistake, these higher taxes will cost jobs.\n\n  Senator Burns from Montana said:\n\n       So we are still going to pile up more debt. Most of all, we \n     are going to cost jobs in this country.\n\n  Senator Phil Gramm. This is August 5, 1993:\n\n       I want to predict tonight that if we adopt this bill, the \n     American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger. The \n     deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is today, \n     and not lower. When all is said and done, people will pay \n     more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, the \n     government will spend more money, and the American people \n     will be worse off.\n\n  That is what he said in 1993.\n  Do you want me to go on? My friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, said:\n\n       I really do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know \n     that this bill will cost jobs.\n\n  August 6, 1993.\n  Here they were all predicting this. I had a couple more I wanted to \nget in the Record here just to put an emphasis on it.\n  Representative Newt Gingrich--oh, yes--Republican of Georgia. On \nAugust 5, 1993, he said:\n\n       I believe this will lead to a recession next year. This is \n     the Democrat machine's recession, and each of them will be \n     held personally responsible.\n\n  I like this one. Representative John Kasich from Ohio said:\n\n       This plan will not work. If it was to work, then I'd have \n     to become a Democrat.\n\n  If I am not mistaken, former Representative John Kasich was just \nelected Governor of Ohio. I didn't know he ran on the Democratic \nticket.\n  History--read the history of it. You cannot deny it. As we often say \naround here, everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, but not \neveryone is entitled to their own facts, and the facts are very clear. \nAfter we passed the Clinton bill--with not one Republican vote--the \neconomy started to get better, we started to create jobs, we started to \nreduce the deficit. In just 7 years--actually 6 years, a little over 6 \nyears--we actually got a surplus in our budget--a surplus and a huge \nnumber of jobs were created with the higher taxes. The last time we had \na surplus was then. We were on the path of reducing our debt, our \nnational debt. We had more jobs. People were working.\n  Then George Bush came to office in 2001, and the Republicans looked \nat all this money that was coming in which we were going to use to pay \ndown the national debt so our kids would not have a big debt hanging \nover their heads--they looked at all that and said: Oh my gosh, let's \nhave a tax cut. And they rammed through a tax cut--they sure did--in \n2001. They rammed through a huge tax cut that to a large extent \nbenefitted the wealthiest people in this country. By 2007, the top 1 \npercent took home 23.5 percent of all the income and were not paying \ntheir fair share. But that is what they want to extend. That is what \nthe Republicans want to do. They want to continue the Bush tax cut they \nput in 2001 for the wealthy.\n  So they took all that money that was coming in that we were going to \nuse to pay down the debt so our kids would have a better future, they \ngave it all to the wealthy--not all but a fair amount of it--about 80 \npercent to the wealthiest in our country and a few crumbs and stuff to \nothers. What did it do? It raised the deficit and put us in deeper debt \nthan ever before--all so the wealthy could have a little bit more \nmoney. This is what they want to continue.\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\n  As I said, I think the evidence is clear that what they did in 2001 \ndid not give us jobs, it hurt the economy, and widened the gap in \nAmerica between the top and the bottom even more. It widened the gap \neven more in our country. Now they want to continue that same policy, \nand they say it is going to create jobs. It did not create jobs. We \nhave lost jobs because of this.\n  I spoke here last evening, and after I spoke, the Senator from Texas \nspoke, and she was talking about who creates jobs in this country. It \nis the wealthy; they get this money and they create jobs. Entrepreneurs \ndo create jobs. Most of the jobs and businesses created in this country \nwere not created simply by the wealthy; they were created by ingenious \npeople who had a good idea, were willing to work hard, gather some \nmoney together, get investors, and build a business. Most of the new \njobs in America are not created by the DuPonts or the Rockefellers or \nthe people like that; they are created by Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and \nthe people like that who did not start with a lot of money, but they \nhad a good idea and they were entrepreneurial and went to work and \nstarted these businesses.\n  So create more jobs, get more money to the wealthy? Here is the \nheadline in USA Today recently. It said ``Luxury spending is back in \nfashion.'' Then underneath, in small print, it says, ``Jobless still \naren't buying essentials.'' So I guess what we need to do is give more \ntax breaks to the wealthiest so they can go out--I just read about \nsomeone the other day going out and buying $2,600 cashmere scarves--\n$2,600 for a scarf. I suppose so.\n  I was just with a group of unemployed Americans the other day who \ncame to Washington. Some have been out of work for over 2 years, all of \nthem hoping we can extend the unemployment benefits--which the \nRepublicans will not let us do, by the way, and I am going to get to \nthat in a second. But I held this up. I thought, ``Luxury spending back \nin fashion.'' I asked those people who are unemployed if they were \ngoing to be shopping in Tiffany's this year. Maybe you are going to go \ndown and buy a little jewel-encrusted broach for your wife or maybe, if \nyou are a woman, you will buy one of those diamond-encrusted watches \nfor your husband. Oh, I know, you are going to go buy a Lamborghini \nmade in Italy or a Mercedes made in Germany. I said to these people: \nMaybe you would like to go down and buy one of those 3D, high-\ndefinition flat screen TVs made in Japan. That is where the money is \ngoing. The rich are not creating jobs; they are buying $2,600 cashmere \nscarves, and they are going to Tiffany's and buying jewels and buying \nwrist watches that cost $25,000, most of which are not made in America, \nanyway, but are made in some other country.\n  If you really want to give tax breaks to businesses, I am all for it \nif it is truly oriented towards businesses employing people in America, \nas long as their products are made in America, as long as they are \nmanufactured here and they do not take the money and ship it off to \nsome other country. If a business wants to start here and employ people \nhere in America, manufacture something here--rebuild the steel industry \nin our country, rebuild manufacturing--I am all for it. I just do not \nbelieve in giving tax breaks to someone who takes that money and say: \nGuess what, I am going to invest it in a business in Thailand or in \nGermany or in Brazil. That is what they do. You give all that money to \nthese wealthy people up on Wall Street and stuff, they can invest that \nmoney wherever they want, and out it goes, out of the country.\n  Since we have such high deficits and we want to get our deficits \ndown, we want to create jobs, don't give it to the most wealthy in our \ncountry; give it to legitimate businesses that either start or expand \nand employ Americans and start making things here in America or put it \ninto infrastructure spending, rebuilding the infrastructure of \nAmerica--our highways, bridges, roads, schools, communication systems. \nThat will create jobs. That will create jobs.\n  They say government spending cannot create jobs. I happen to disagree \nwith those who said the stimulus bill did not create jobs. It sure did. \nIt put a lot of people to work all over this country, not in government \njobs but in rebuilding America. When you put money out there and you \nare rebuilding a highway or a bridge in Iowa or in Minnesota, it is \ndone by private contractors, private businesses that employ people and \nspend the money here, mostly on products made in America. That is why \ninfrastructure spending has such a good multiplier effect. It has a \nmultiplier effect because when you build a new school or a new \nclassroom or whatever, first of all, the work has to be done here, it \ncannot be shipped off to China. Second, the money is spent here. Third, \nmost of the products that go into our infrastructure are still made in \nAmerica. When you think about it, when you build a school, rebuild a \nschool, you think about the cement, you think about the bricks, you \nthink about the mortar, you think about all the conduits for the \nlighting, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning units, windows, doors, \nand 9 times out of 10, it is made in America. So you get a big \nmultiplier effect from that money, and it does indeed create a lot of \njobs.\n  I mentioned just a second go that I was with a group of unemployed \nwho had come to Washington to petition their government for a redress \nof their grievances, and their grievances are that they are out of \nwork, they are looking for work, and their unemployment benefits have \njust run out.\n  We have tried several times here on the floor of the Senate asking \nunanimous consent to extend the unemployment benefits for another year. \nThe Republicans have objected every time. And the letter that was sent \nout by the Republican leader the other day said that they are going to \nobject to anything passing this floor until they get their tax breaks \nfor the wealthy. So they are holding hostage millions of Americans who \nhave lost their jobs. Some have been out of work, as I said--I met some \nwho have been out of work for over 2 years; some for a year or months. \nFor $300 a week--that is about the average in unemployment benefits, \nabout $300 a week. They say we cannot afford that. My Republican \nfriends say we cannot afford that. But we can afford to give a $100,000 \ntax break to the wealthiest Americans. Think about that.\n  During this holiday season--I heard my friend from South Dakota say \nthat we should wrap up our business so Senators can go home and spend \nour holidays with our families, have a nice holiday season. What about \nthose millions of Americans who are out of work and have just had their \nunemployment benefits cut off? What about them? Are they going to have \na nice Christmas?\n  Are they going to have a nice holiday season? The Republicans say no. \nGive the tax breaks to the wealthy first. Well, as I said, Wall Street \nexecutives got billions of dollars in bonuses--billions. They are \nprobably going to have a nice holiday season. They will probably even \nshop at Tiffany's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus. But how about the \nmillions of Americans who are out of work who rely upon unemployment \nbenefits, $300 a week, less than the poverty wage, and we are saying: \nNo. No, we are not going to extend them during this holiday season.\n  The Republicans are holding them hostage. I am sorry. This is \nunconscionable. Have the Republicans lost all sense of fairness? Have \nthey lost all sense of justice? Have the Republicans lost all sense of \nwhat is right and wrong? I mean, they can fight for their tax breaks \nfor the wealthy. Fine, that is what they are fighting for. I understand \nthat.\n  But to say we cannot extend unemployment benefits for people out of \nwork because we have not yet given the tax breaks to the wealthy is a \nmorale outrage. I ask: Where is our outrage at something like this? \nWhere is the President's outrage at this? The President ought to be out \nthere saying: This is morally outrageous, that we are going to deny \nunemployment benefits to people during this time of the year \nespecially.\n  We can have our battles on the tax cuts. We can have those battles, \nbut we should not hold hostage the people who are out of work today and \nneed unemployment benefits. Some people say: Well, unemployment \nbenefits, it makes people lazy.\n  Well, as I pointed out the other day in a speech on the floor, when \neight people look for one job. There is one job for every eight people. \nSo you have musical chairs going round and round.\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\nOne person gets it, and you have seven people still unemployed.\n  What a lot of people do not even know is that in order to even \nqualify for unemployment benefits, you have to be actively looking for \nwork. You cannot sit at home. You have to be actively looking for work. \nA lot of the people I talked to 2 days ago who were here who were \nemployed, you hear their stories. They have tried everything. Some have \ngone to different States. They have gone to different communities. They \nhave tried everything to find another job.\n  I just read a letter from one the other day, a math teacher, has \nthree college degrees. She has lost her job. She has tried to find work \nin different States. She has tried everything from McDonald's to \neverything else and cannot find a job.\n  By the way, the people who are truly hurting the most in this job \nmarket right now are people over the age of 50, mostly women. Women \nover the age of 50 who have worked hard, many of them had good jobs. \nAgain, I spoke to one on Tuesday who had worked all her life, had a \nvery good job. She admitted she was making $70,000 a year, good middle-\nclass income.\n  She lost her job and has been out of work for over a year. She cannot \nfind work. She has tried and beat the pavement and looked all over. \nBut, you know what, she is in that area between 50 and 60. Very tough. \nVery tough. Yet we will not even extend unemployment benefits for \npeople like her.\n  Well, as I said, I think it is a moral outrage, and I would hope our \nPresident would get out there and start saying that. Let the American \npeople know how the jobless are being held hostage by the Republicans \nin trying to get their tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  So it is been said the Republicans are playing hardball. Well, if \nthey are playing hardball for the rich, we ought to play hardball for \nthe jobless, too, in this country. They want to play hardball, we ought \nto play hardball. My friend from South Dakota says he would like to get \nout of here and spend Christmas with his family. Would not we all?\n  But, I think, rather than identifying with those on Wall Street and \nthose who wear suits and ties every day and have a comfortable life \nsuch as we do, we ought to be identifying with those middle-class \nAmericans who are out of work.\n  If the Republicans want to play hardball, I think what we ought to \nsay is: Look, we are going to stay here every day, we are going to be \nhere every day, and every day we are going to ask consent to bring up \nthis bill to extend unemployment benefits. If we have to be here on \nChristmas Eve, so be it. If we have to be here on Christmas Day, we \nought to be here on Christmas Day, if necessary, so the American people \nwill get an idea of what is going on in this Senate Chamber, the \noutrageousness of it.\n  So, yes, we would all like to spend time with family over the \nholidays. But unless and until we extend the unemployment benefits, at \nleast at a minimum, we should not leave this Chamber and see how long \nthe Republicans want to hold on to that and how much they want to deny \npeople their benefits.\n  If 2 million Americans and 10,000 of my fellow Iowans are going to be \nsuffering because they will not even be able to put food on the table \nor have a nice holiday season with their families because they are \nunemployed, the least we can do is identify with them. They are not \ngoing to have a very good holiday season unless we do something and \ntake action. So I think we should stay as long as is necessary.\n  Lastly, for too long and for too many times, the Republicans have \nused an archaic 19th century procedure called the filibuster to thwart \nthe will of the majority of the people in this country, to stop \nlegislation, to stop a whole bunch of things, nominations, things they \neven, when we finally get them through, get 99 votes out of 100.\n  But they stop them because of a filibuster. Well, that may have been \nOK in the 19th century. It may have been OK in the early part of the \n20th century. But we can no longer live with that. We cannot run a 21st \ncentury government in a 21st world with an archaic millstone around our \nneck called a filibuster.\n  When this body reconvenes in January, we finally have to break the \nshackles of that. We have to break the shackles of that 19th century \nrule, proceeding, where one or two Senators can stop everything. Stop \nit. I quote Vice President Biden who said: No democracy has ever \nsurvived that needed a supermajority. No democracy.\n  Ours cannot survive either if we continue with a supermajority needed \nin the Senate.\n  I hope we stay here. I hope we increase the unemployment benefits. We \nwill continue the debate on the taxes. I will be supporting, tomorrow \nmorning, the vote on continuing the tax benefits for those families \nmaking $250,000 and less, to extend the tax breaks for that group. I \nwill not go higher than $250,0000. I will not vote to extend tax breaks \nfor anybody over $250,000.\n  Quite frankly, if you make $250,000, you are in the top 7 percent or \nso of income earners in America. So is that the middle class? I think \nthat is stretching it. Those making $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 \nto $80,000 a year are clearly in the middle class. That is the broad \nmiddle class of America. What are we doing for them? What are we doing \nfor them?\n  So I will vote to go up to $250,000 but not a cent more than that. \nQuite frankly, I have a hard time even going to $250,000. It ought to \nbe less than that. If you want to give more tax breaks to people, \nextend the earned-income tax credit and increase the childcare tax \ncredit for working families.\n  If you want to do that, now you are talking about helping middle-\nclass families. Some people say: Well, we have to do something for \nsmall businesses. I am all for that. But I wish to make sure it really \ngoes to small businesses that employ Americans, keep the jobs here, \nmanufacture things in America, and do not ship them overseas.\n  You do that, I am all for a small business tax break. You bet. So \nthat is the debate we should have. But the unemployed and those who \nneed unemployment benefits during this holiday season should not be \nheld hostage.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is good to see the distinguished \nPresiding Officer. He must have been here all day. He was here \nyesterday, and I am glad to see him again.\n  Are there limits on my speaking time at the moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a 10-minute grant at this time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Chair please let me know when I have consumed \n9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8468-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8468-S8472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE NEW PROMISE OF AMERICAN LIFE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I just returned from the Hudson \nInstitute, a distinguished think tank downtown where I made an address \ncalled the New Promise of American Life--Less From Washington and More \nof Ourselves. It included a panel of the following people: Kate \nO'Beirne of the National Review; Christopher DeMuth, who was formerly \nthe head of the American Enterprise Institute; Chester Finn, who runs \nthe Fordham Foundation; Bill Kristol, the founder of the Weekly \nStandard; and William Schambra, who is a fellow at the Hudson \nInstitute. They commented on what I had to say. It was one of my most \nenjoyable experiences because it was a reprise of something we did in \n1995.\n  In 1995, I was a fellow at the institute and I was also touring the \ncountry trying to persuade Americans that I was the next logical choice \nfor President of the United States. That didn't work out exactly right. \nIn fact, when I lost, my brother-in-law, who is a preacher, said I \nshould think of that political loss as a reverse calling. I have always \ntried to think of it that way. Nevertheless, during that time, Chester \nFinn and I edited a book called ``The New Promise of American Life.'' \nWe selected that title because Herbert Croly,\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\nin 1909, had written a book called ``The Promise of American Life'' \nwhich really was the progressive manifesto that launched the thinking \nof President Wilson and more recently President Obama.\n  Our thought then, in 1995 and 1996--Mr. Kristol, Mr. Schambra, and \nMr. Finn were all contributors to our volume--was that progressivism \nhad gone too far and that we needed less of Washington and more of \nourselves. That is what we said in 1995. Looking back over that volume, \nthat was pretty good advice, but obviously nobody took it. So today the \nHudson Institute sponsored another forum about the new promise of \nAmerican life. I talked about it, and the people I just mentioned \ncommented.\n  It was interesting for me in a variety of ways. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the address I made at the \ninstitute today as well as excerpts from ``The New Promise of American \nLife'' published in 1995, namely, the introduction, the preface, and \nthe first chapter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed the \nin Record, as follows:\n\nLess from Washington and More of Ourselves: The New Promise of American \n                                  Life\n\n      (By Senator Lamar Alexander, Hudson Institute, Dec. 3, 2010)\n\n       A wise political candidate, like a good composer, listens \n     for words and music that resonate with audiences--and then \n     repeats those phrases and melodies over and over again.\n       For the phrases that resonated during the 2010 election, we \n     might listen to the senators who were successful.\n       In a year when television screens displayed anger, these \n     politicians often talked about hope.\n       There were Rand Paul and Pat Toomey evangelizing about \n     spreading free market prosperity instead of dwelling on \n     government austerity.\n       Rob Portman and Kelly Ayotte and Roy Blunt and Ron Johnson \n     using their experience to describe ways to make it easier and \n     cheaper to create new private sector jobs, rather than just \n     wringing their hands about ten percent unemployment.\n       And Marco Rubio affirming with his life's story America's \n     exceptionalism, instead of lamenting America's decline.\n       To be sure, the issues that fired up voters this year were \n     about too much spending, too many taxes, too much debt and \n     too many Washington takeovers.\n       But the senators who voters elected to fix these problems \n     are mostly American dreamers who believe that in this country \n     anything still is possible for anyone who will work for it.\n       Europeans and others find this to be an irrational view \n     held by citizens in no other country in the world. Yet most \n     of American politics is about setting high goals and dealing \n     with the disappointment of not meeting them and then trying \n     again--all men are created equal, pay any price to defend \n     freedom, no child left behind.\n       This is not an enforced Americanism where the government in \n     Washington tells you what to believe. It is a spontaneous \n     patriotism of the kind you get reading Lincoln's second \n     inaugural address, or the oath of allegiance that George \n     Washington's men swore to at Valley Forge, or David \n     McCullough's 1776, or attending citizenship day at any \n     federal courthouse when new citizens from all over the world \n     become Americans.\n       The vitality of that dream is why Herbert Croly's book, \n     ``The Promise of American Life,'' written in 1909, still is \n     powerful today. The first chapter of Croly's progressive \n     manifesto could be read with enthusiasm at any Tea Party. But \n     it is the rest of the book that we propose to discuss and \n     dispute in this forum, for in his remaining chapters Croly \n     argues that for individuals to realize the promise of \n     American Life the central government in Washington must play \n     a much larger role. His book launched the progressive \n     movement, featuring first President Wilson and most recently \n     President Obama. His is a strategy of made-in-Washington \n     policies, grand schemes to solve big national problems based \n     upon the assumption that these are things that individual \n     Americans can't do for ourselves.\n       In 1995, at the Hudson Institute's request, Checker Finn \n     and I edited a book, which we called ``The New Promise of \n     American Life.'' Checker and I then both were fellows at \n     Hudson and I was touring the country hoping to persuade \n     Americans that I was the logical choice for President of the \n     United States. (The public didn't agree with my logic, \n     prompting my preacher brother-in-law to suggest that I should \n     think of that political loss as a ``reverse calling.'')\n       Our book was an attempt to provide intellectual context for \n     the anti-Washington fervor of the moment, a fervor that \n     surges throughout American history. We chose the title ``The \n     New Promise of American Life'' because we believed that \n     progressivism had been carried too far and that what our \n     country now needed was a reverse mirror image of Croly's \n     vision--``Less from Washington and more of ourselves.'' Our \n     idea of America was one created by states, operating \n     community by community, depending upon civic virtue, valuing \n     individual liberty--a nation simply too large and too diverse \n     to be managed successfully by an all-knowing central \n     government in Washington, D.C.\n       Speaking of phrases that resonate, my best political one \n     liner at the time was ``Cut Their Pay and Send Them Home'' \n     (referring to Congress), which made few friends in the \n     world's greatest deliberative body in which I now serve.\n       Reading what we published 15 years ago, I have been \n     impressed with the prescience of the essays from contributors \n     such as William Kristol, Paul Weyrich, Howard Baker, David \n     Abshire, Francis Fukayama, William Schambra and Diane \n     Ravitch. Their advice resonates as well today as it did then. \n     Reading their advice also reminds me of how little of this \n     advice anyone took. Republicans who were elected in 1994 on \n     the cry of ``No more unfunded federal mandates'' soon were \n     promulgating conservative big-government rules to replace \n     liberal big-government rules. Since 1995, the size of the \n     federal budget has grown 140 percent, the federal debt has \n     grown from $5 to $14 trillion.\n       Within the last two years, the progressive solution \n     symphony has been playing in Washington again, reaching a new \n     crescendo with budgets that double the debt in five years and \n     triple it in ten, with government bailouts, and, as one \n     blogger has suggested, the appointment of more new Czars and \n     Czarinas than the Romanovs ever had.\n       Seeing the inevitable anti-Washington surge rising again to \n     counter the excesses of progressivism, I suggested to Checker \n     about six weeks ago that we ask Hudson to revisit our 1995 \n     book. This forum is the result of that suggestion. After this \n     luncheon address we will hear from a panel that includes \n     three contributors from the 1995 volume--Checker, Bill \n     Kristol and William Schambra--as well as from Chris DeMuth \n     and Kate O'Beirne. Our hope is the same today as it was \n     fifteen years ago: to provide an intellectual context for the \n     latest anti-Washington surge--with the additional hope that, \n     this time, more elected officials listen to and act on our \n     advice.\n       To begin the discussion, let me renew a suggestion that I \n     have made before: the new Congress should proceed step-by-\n     step in the right direction to solve problems in a way that \n     re-earns the trust of the American people rather than invent \n     comprehensive, conservative big-government schemes in an \n     attempt to correct comprehensive, liberal big-government \n     schemes.\n       To make this point, I thought of hanging up in the \n     Republican cloakroom photographs of Nancy Pelosi and Henry \n     Waxman because they symbolize what the federal government has \n     done wrong during the last two years: not just to head in the \n     wrong direction, but to try to go there all at once. This has \n     been government by taking big bites of several big apples and \n     trying to swallow them at the same time, which has had the \n     effect of enraging Republicans and terrifying the independent \n     voters of America.\n       During the recent health care debate, I heard a number of \n     times from friends on the other side of the aisle this \n     question: What are Republicans for? My answer was that \n     Democrats would wait a long time if they were waiting for the \n     Republican leader, Sen. McConnell, to roll into the Senate a \n     wheelbarrow filled with a 2,700-page Republican comprehensive \n     health care bill, or, for that matter, a Republican version \n     of a 1,200-page climate change bill or an 800-page \n     immigration bill.\n       Congressional action on comprehensive climate change, \n     comprehensive immigration bills, and comprehensive health \n     care have been well-intended but the first two fell of their \n     own weight and the health care law has been subject to \n     multiple efforts to repeal it since the day it passed the \n     Senate a year ago on Christmas Eve in a driving snowstorm.\n       What has united almost all Republicans and a majority of \n     Americans against these bills has not only been ideology but \n     also that they were comprehensive. As George Will might \n     write, ``The. Congress. Does. Not. Do. Comprehensive. Well.''\n       Two recent articles help to explain the trouble with the \n     Democratic comprehensive approach. The first, which appeared \n     in National Affairs, was written by one of our panelists \n     today, William Schambra, who explained the ``sheer ambition'' \n     of President Obama's legislative agenda as the approach of \n     what Mr. Schambra called a ``policy president.'' Mr. Schambra \n     wrote that the President and most of his advisers have been \n     trained at elite universities to govern by launching ``a host \n     of enormous initiatives all at once--formulating \n     comprehensive policies aimed at giving large social systems--\n     and indeed society itself--more rational and coherent forms \n     and functions.''\n       Or, in the terms of today's forum, this is the latest \n     outburst of Crolyism or progressivism. Mr. Schambra notes \n     that other most prominent organizational feature of this \n     Obama administration is its reliance on Czars to manage broad \n     areas of policy. In this view, systemic problems of health \n     care, of energy, of education, and of the environment can't \n     be solved in pieces.\n       Analyzing Mr. Schambra's article, David Broder of the \n     Washington Post wrote this: ``Historically, that approach has \n     not worked. The progressives failed to gain more than a brief \n     ascendancy and the Carter and Clinton presidencies were \n     marked by striking policy failures.'' The reason for these \n     failures, as Broder paraphrased Schambra, is that ``this\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\n     highly rational comprehensive approach fits uncomfortably \n     with the Constitution, which apportions power among so many \n     different players.'' Broder then adds this: ``Democracy and \n     representative government are a lot messier than the \n     progressives and their heirs, including Obama, want to \n     admit.''\n       In a memorial essay honoring Irving Kristol--Bill Kristol's \n     father--in the Wall Street Journal last year, James Q. Wilson \n     wrote that the law of unintended consequences is what causes \n     the failure of such comprehensive legislative schemes. \n     Explains Wilson: ``Launch a big project and you will almost \n     surely discover that you have created many things that you \n     did not intend to create.'' The latest example of the truth \n     of Mr. Wilson's observation can be seen by anyone watching \n     the new health care law increase premiums, add to the federal \n     debt, cause millions of individual policy holders to lose \n     their policies, cause businesses to postpone adding new jobs, \n     and inflict huge unfunded Medicaid mandates on states--all \n     consequences the sponsors of the law strenuously argued were \n     never intended (although, I have to say, they were all \n     predicted by Republicans).\n       Wilson also wrote that neoconservatism, as Irving Kristol \n     originally conceived of it in the 1960s, was not an organized \n     ideology or even necessarily conservative but ``a way of \n     thinking about politics rather than a set of principles and \n     rules. It would have been better if we had been called policy \n     skeptics.''\n       This skepticism of Schambra, Wilson and Kristol toward \n     grand legislative policy schemes helps to explain how during \n     the 2010 election the law of unintended consequences made \n     being a member of the so-called ``party of no'' a more \n     electable choice than a member of the so-called party of \n     ``yes, we can.''\n       James Q. Wilson also wrote in his essay that respect of the \n     law of unintended consequences ``is not an argument for doing \n     nothing, but it is one, in my view, for doing things \n     experimentally. Try your idea out in one place and see what \n     happens before you inflict it on the whole country,'' he \n     suggests.\n       That is why if the Republican Party aspires to be a \n     governing party rather than merely an ideological debating \n     society, the question ``What are Republicans for?'' still is \n     a question that must be answered.\n       If you will examine the Congressional Record you will find \n     Republican senators tried to answer the question by following \n     Mr. Wilson's advice, proposing a step-by-step approach to \n     confronting our nation's health care and other challenges 173 \n     different times on the floor of the Senate during 2009.\n       On health care for example, we first suggested setting a \n     clear goal: that is reducing Americans' costs so that more of \n     them could afford to buy insurance. Then we proposed the \n     first six steps toward achieving that goal: 1. allowing small \n     businesses to pool their resources to purchase health plans; \n     2. reducing junk lawsuits against doctors; 3. allowing the \n     purchase of insurance across state lines; 4. expanding health \n     savings accounts; 5. promoting wellness and prevention; and \n     6. taking steps to reduce waste, fraud and abuse.\n       We offered these six proposals in complete legislative \n     text, totaling 182 pages for all six steps. The Democratic \n     majority ridiculed the approach as ``piecemeal,'' in part \n     because our approach was not comprehensive.\n       Take another example. In July of 2009, all 40 Republican \n     senators announced agreement on four steps to produce low-\n     cost, clean energy and create jobs: 1. create the environment \n     for 100 new nuclear power plants; 2. electrify half our cars \n     and trucks; 3. explore offshore for natural gas and oil; and \n     4. double energy research and development for new forms of \n     clean energy.\n       This step-by-step Republican clean energy plan was an \n     alternative to the Kerry-Boxer national energy tax that would \n     have imposed an economy wide cap-and-trade scheme, driving \n     jobs overseas looking for cheap energy and collecting \n     hundreds of billions of dollars each year for a slush fund \n     with which Congress could play.\n       Here is still another example, a bipartisan one. In 2005 a \n     bipartisan group of us in Congress asked the National \n     Academies to identify the first 10 steps Congress should take \n     to preserve America's competitive advantage in the world so \n     we could keep growing jobs. The Academies appointed a \n     distinguished panel that recommended twenty such steps. \n     Congress enacted two-thirds of them. The America COMPETES Act \n     of 2007, as we call it, was important legislation, but it was \n     fashioned step-by-step.\n       This style of governing squares with my experience as \n     governor of Tennessee during the 1980s. My goal was to raise \n     family incomes for what was then the third-poorest state. As \n     I went along, I found that the best way to move toward this \n     goal was step-by-step--some steps larger, step steps \n     smaller--such as changing banking laws, defending the right-\n     to-work, keeping debt and taxes low, recruiting Japanese \n     industry and then recruiting the auto industry, but also \n     building four lane highways so that suppliers could deliver \n     parts to the auto plants just-in-time, and then a 10-step \n     Better Schools program--step one of which made Tennessee the \n     first state to pay teachers more for teaching well. I did not \n     try to turn our whole state upside down at once, but working \n     with leaders of both political parties, I did help it change \n     and grow step by step. Within a few years, Tennessee was the \n     fastest growing state in family incomes.\n       What do this approach and these examples have to suggest to \n     Republicans as we look toward a new session of Congress? As a \n     result of the 2010 elections, we have enough clout to stop \n     risky, comprehensive schemes featuring more taxes, debt and \n     Washington takeovers replete with hidden and unexpected \n     surprises. And we have enough clout to suggest alternative \n     approaches for the most urgent problems of the day. In fact \n     we have an obligation to do so if we want to be able to \n     persuade independent voters as well as Republicans that we \n     ought to be the governing party in American after 2012.\n       It is no mystery what our country's focus should be: jobs, \n     debt and terror. Jobs and debt dominated the 2010 election.\n       Applying the step-by-step, rather than comprehensive, \n     approach our first goal therefore should be to make it easier \n     and cheaper to create private sector jobs. A quick list of \n     steps comes to mind: don't raise taxes on anybody in the \n     middle of an economic downturn; repeal one-by-one the \n     mandates on job creators in the health care law; reduce the \n     corporate tax rate; reduce or eliminate the tax on capital \n     gains; defend the secret ballot in union elections; defend \n     states' ability to protect the right to work; create the \n     environment for 100 new nuclear power plants; double research \n     and development for clean energy; build a first class \n     transportation system; repeal the so-called consumer \n     protection agency in the financial regulation law; and enact \n     Korea, Colombia, and Panama free trade laws.\n       I would add repeal the health care law entirely, although \n     this might seem to be a comprehensive act violating the \n     Wilson-Kristol-Schambra step-by-step doctrine. Such a \n     comprehensive undoing carries the risk of scaring \n     independents, but as a practical matter there is no good way \n     to deal with that historic mistake other than by repealing \n     and replacing it with a step-by-step approach reducing health \n     care costs. In addition, most of its provisions do not take \n     effect until 2014.\n       The same step-by-step approach can be applied to the second \n     goal: making annual spending come as close to revenues as \n     soon as possible. Trying to eliminate the annual deficit in \n     the first year would turn the nation upside down. It is at \n     points like this that the photographs of Pelosi and Waxman in \n     the cloakroom become useful.\n       But for a nation that is borrowing 42 cents of every dollar \n     to wait one day longer to begin to address its debt is \n     suicidal. There are steps that can and should be taken \n     immediately, while larger steps are being fashioned:\n       For example, step one could be no new entitlement automatic \n     spending programs. In other words, don't dig the hole any \n     deeper as would the President's budget proposal to shift a \n     half trillion dollars in Pell grants over ten years to \n     mandatory spending.\n       No more unfunded federal mandates on state and local \n     governments. The Democratic governor of Tennessee, which has \n     a $1.5 billion revenue shortfall this year, estimates that \n     the new health care law will impose $1.1 billion in unfunded \n     Medicaid mandates on our state between 2014 and 2019.\n       Caps on discretionary spending. While this is only one-\n     third of the budget, even non-defense discretionary spending \n     increased by an average of 6.2% each year under President \n     Bush and by an average of 15% over the last two years under \n     President Obama. These dollars add up.\n       Take the half trillion in Medicare savings that the new \n     health care law spent on new entitlement programs and use it \n     to make Medicare solvent.\n       Adopt a two-year budget--this would allow Congress to spend \n     every other year on oversight, repealing and revising laws \n     and regulations that are out of date or wasteful.\n       Give the rest of the government's General Motors stock to \n     every American who paid federal income taxes last April.\n       I also support a 2-year earmark ban--Earmarks have become a \n     symbol of wasteful Washington spending; there are too many of \n     them and too many for less-than-worthy purposes. This process \n     needs to be cleaned up, but this is more about good \n     government than saving money since even unworthy projects are \n     paid for by reducing spending in other places; and long-term \n     it turns the checkbook over to the president at a time when \n     most Americans voted for a check on the presidency.\n       Fifteen years ago Republicans captured control of Congress \n     during one of those recurring outbursts when American voters \n     announced that they wanted less of Washington, and more \n     freedom for themselves. That advice was not well heeded, and \n     now we find ourselves the political beneficiaries of another \n     such outburst and an opportunity to lay the groundwork to be \n     a governing party within two years.\n       My hope is that this time, Republicans heed the advice of \n     Wilson, Schambra, and Kristol, that rather than attempt \n     comprehensive conservative schemes, we keep our eye on the \n     goals that matter most--making it easier and cheaper to \n     create private sector jobs; reduce spending closer to \n     revenues; and dealing in a tough, strategic way with \n     terrorism. And that we proceed step-by-step toward those \n     goals in a way that re-earns the trust of the American \n     people.\n       We should give Hebert Croly credit for reminding us in 1909 \n     in the first chapter of his Promise of American Life that \n     this is still the one country in the world where most people \n     believe that anything is possible and that anyone can succeed \n     if he or she works hard. This is a country where your \n     grandfather can tell you, as mine did, ``Aim for\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\n     the top; there's more room there,'' and really believe it.\n       Hopefully, Republicans who were elected in 2010 will follow \n     their instinct not just to oppose the excesses of Croly's \n     progressivism but to offer a new promise of American life. \n     That they will continue to remind Americans that this debate \n     is not some dry, dusty analysis but a contest of competing \n     governing philosophies about how to realize the dream of an \n     upstart, still new nation in which most people still believe \n     that anything is possible. Our argument is that our country's \n     exceptionalism is best realized by the largest number of \n     Americans when we expect less of Washington, and more of \n     ourselves.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the premise of my remarks was that we \ndon't do comprehensive very well in the U.S. Congress. That was \nchallenged by some of the conservatives on the panel today. That was my \npoint. My suggestion was that those who were elected in the 2010 \nelection not make the same mistakes as those elected before made, \nwhich, in my opinion, was not just to head in the wrong direction but \nto try to do it all at once. It is one thing to think comprehensively; \nit is another thing to act comprehensively. There have been multiple \nattempts to repeal the health care law from the day it passed. Our \nefforts at comprehensive immigration and comprehensive climate change \nfell of their own weight.\n  I am tempted, as I am sure most people are, to make comprehensive \nchanges. We talked about some examples with the panel. Take education. \nI suppose I have had about every position on education reform possible. \nI have been for abolishing the Department of Education. I have been the \nU.S. Department of Education Secretary. I have been both.\n  I remember as a Governor in 1981, I went to see President Reagan and \nasked him to swap all of elementary and secondary education for \nMedicaid. In other words, the Federal Government would take all of \nMedicaid and the States would have all of elementary and secondary \neducation.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the State of Minnesota, where there is \na high value placed on education. My own view is that the high value \nplaced on education by the communities of Minnesota does much more to \nassure quality education than anything we could do here. I thought if \nwe got rid of the idea that Washington could make our schools better, \nthose in the communities of Tennessee would feel more responsibility.\n  President Reagan liked that, but it didn't get anywhere. Most big \ncomprehensive schemes don't. Our country is too big and complicated and \ntoo diverse. Our constitutional system separates power into too many \nplaces. And on top of that, we just are not smart enough to figure out \na solution for all the many different things that are happening in this \ncountry.\n  My advice in this address is that those who were elected in 2010 head \nin a different direction. We talked a lot about less government, less \ntaxes. We talked about fewer Washington takeovers. We don't like all \nthe czars and czarinas. There are more of them than the Romanovs ever \nimagined. But as we head in a different direction, I suggest that we go \nstep by step to attempt to re-earn the trust of the American people.\n  There used to be signs that said: Think globally, act locally. I \nthink we might think comprehensively but act step by step. Because if \nwe don't, there are two dangers. One is that we won't succeed. It will \nbe a lot easier, for example, to fix No Child Left Behind, the \neducation law, than it will be to comprehensively reauthorize it. It is \na 1,000-page law filled with provisions backed by those with vested \ninterests--Members of Congress, teachers unions, principals, people all \nover the country. Comprehensively reauthorizing it will be hard to do. \nBut if we want to fix it, we can probably pick four or five or six \nthings we need to fix and maybe, in a bipartisan way, go step by step \nto do that.\n  If we want clean energy, comprehensive, economy-wide cap and trade \nproved too much to swallow here. But we could create an environment for \n100 new nuclear plants. We should be able to encourage electric cars. \nWe should be able to double energy research and development. Those are \nsteps in the right direction.\n  We took steps in the right direction with the America Competes Act. \nWe did that in a bipartisan way.\n  Our overwhelming priorities today are jobs, debt, and terror. We are \nnot likely to solve any of those problems all at once. We might think \ncomprehensively about how to do it, but we need to act step by step.\n  For example, our goal would be to make it easier and cheaper to \ncreate private sector jobs. That should be the first goal. Especially \non this side of the aisle, we believe that raising taxes on anybody--\nanybody--in the middle of an economic downturn makes no sense, because \nit makes it harder to create private sector jobs. But that is only one \nstep.\n  If I were to make my list, I would add to that list: reducing the \ncorporate income tax so our corporations can be competitive in the \nworld, and I would say defend the right to work and the secret ballot \nin union elections. I would also say build a first-class transportation \nsystem. I would also say increase funding for research and development \nat major universities because it is that brainpower that creates jobs \nfor us. So there are many different steps we would take to create a \npro-growth economy. Take the issue of debt. We have a debt commission \nreport today which has attracted all of our attention. We have a \nhorrendous problem with Federal debt. Mr. President, 42 cents out of \nevery dollar we are spending is borrowed. If we try to fix it all at \nonce, the country would collapse. But if we wait another day to begin \nto fix it, we should be ashamed. We can take steps. We can say caps on \ndiscretionary spending. That is a third of the budget. We can say no \nnew entitlement automatic spending programs. Let's not dig the hole any \ndeeper. We could say, let's have a 2-year budget so every other year we \ncan devote the year to reviewing the regulations we have and laws we \nhave and the rules we have, so we can get rid of some of them. We may \nneed some new laws, but let's get rid of some of the old ones.\n  I stood right here on the floor of the Senate a couple years ago and \nvoted against the Higher Education Act. Now, here I am a former \nuniversity president and Education Secretary and so-called education \nGovernor, and education is my passion--I say to the Presiding Officer, \nif another Senator comes to the floor, I will be glad to yield the \nfloor--but I voted against the Higher Education Act. Why did I do that? \nDuring the debate, I got permission to bring to the floor all of the \nregulations that now exist under the current Higher Education Act.\n  You have to ask for unanimous consent to bring demonstrative evidence \non the floor. I had to do that once with Minnie Pearl's hat. I had it \nhere in the drawer, but I could not bring it out unless I asked \nunanimous consent, which I got. And I got it to bring all these \nregulations.\n  And what I said was that I am voting against this act because \nreauthorization of the act would double the stack of regulations.\n  So all of these things have to do with debt, limited government, and \nspreading prosperity and spreading freedom. So my argument is basically \nthat those of us who are in the Republican Party, those of us who this \nyear won more of the elections--we know what it is like to be on the \nother side. Two years ago, we hardly won anything. Two years before \nthat, we got elected one Republican Senator. But those of us who are on \nthe winning side this time I think would do well to head in a different \ndirection. Yes, make it easier and cheaper to create private sector \njobs, get to work on the debt, be strategic and tough about terror, be \nresolute about the direction we are going, but do it step by step. We \nare more likely to be able to persuade people to do it. When we are \nthrough, we may be more likely to persuade them to live under those \nrules and regulations.\n  When you do it comprehensively, when you bite off more than you can \nchew, when you offer a 2,000-page solution to anything--whether it is a \ncomprehensive liberal solution or progressive solution or whether it is \na comprehensive conservative solution--you are likely to frighten--\nwell, you are likely to make angry the people on the other side and \nscare the independent voters half to death. As a result, you will not \nsucceed.\n  We as Republicans have a chance in the next 2 years to prove to the \nNation we deserve to be the governing party.\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\nWe are not today. There is a Democratic President and there is a \nDemocratic Senate and there is a Republican House. So if we want to \nmake progress, we have to work together when we can form a consensus.\n  But if we want the privilege of being more than an ideological \ndebating society and being actually a governing party, we have to re-\nearn the trust of the American people. We have to say: What are \nRepublicans for? I am suggesting that when we say what we are for, we \npick our goals--make it easier and cheaper to create private sector \njobs, reduce spending closer to revenues, be tough and strategic on \nterror--and then we go step by step in that direction, and we take \npeople with us and we gain their support.\n  I have mentioned on this floor before the example of the civil rights \nlaws. Slavery was the greatest injustice in our country's history. It \nplagued us from the day of our country's founding. Our Founders punted \non the subject, and then we tore ourselves apart in a war, and then we \nwaited a century to do much about it. By any intellectual standard, by \nany moral standard, we should have fixed that all at once. But Lyndon \nJohnson, who was the majority leader at the time, knew better than to \ntry to do that. In fact, he knew he could not do that. So starting in \n1958 and then in 1964 and then in 1968 and then in 1975 were the major \ncivil rights laws in the country. We went step by step to realize the \npromise of American life: that all men and women are created equal.\n  Now, it is easy to sit somewhere and say: Well, that went too slow, \nand a comprehensive approach toward civil rights would have been the \nright thing to do. It would have been the right thing to do, but it \nnever would have happened.\n  There is one other problem with it: it would not have been accepted \nby the country. The civil rights laws of 1964 and 1968, during a time \nof Democratic majorities and a Democratic President, were written--\nwhere?--in the office of the Republican leader of the U.S. Senate, \nEverett Dirksen.\n  Now, why did President Johnson do that? Well, you can say he did not \nneed the votes. He had huge majorities in the House and in the Senate. \nWell, it was a little more complicated than that because he had \nsouthern Democrats, and they were against it. So first he needed the \nvotes to pass the bill. But the thing President Johnson understood so \nwell was that he not only needed to pass the bill, he needed the \ncountry to accept it. And as controversial as the Civil Rights Act of \n1968 was--the one written down the hall in the Republican leader's \noffice by a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress--as \ncontroversial as it was, when it was over, Senator Russell of Georgia, \nfor whom a building here is named, went to Georgia and said: I fought \nthis for 30 years, but it is the law of the land, and we obey it. \nLyndon Johnson knew that going step by step in the right direction was \nthe right way to get where our country had to go.\n  So we have some big challenges ahead of us, and some of them we will \nbe able to do in a bipartisan way. I hope we can do that with No Child \nLeft Behind. Let's fix it with four or five or six steps. Arne Duncan \nhas some good ideas. They are very consistent with the ideas of a \nnumber of Democrats and a number of Republicans. That would be a start. \nThe America Competes Act we should authorize at some point. That would \nbe another step we could take. I think we have some steps on clean \nenergy.\n  There are some areas where we will disagree. We are going to have \nsome Republican ideas about making it easier and cheaper to create \nprivate sector jobs that our friends on the other side will honestly \ndisagree with. We are having one of those disagreements this weekend \nbecause we believe it makes no sense to raise taxes on anybody in the \nmiddle of an economic downturn if your goal is to make it easier and \ncheaper to create private sector jobs, and they have a little different \nview. So we will have votes on that.\n  So we will have our differences of opinion. But if we want to be \nsuccessful, we as a country--and if we as a party, the Republican \nParty, want to be successful in earning the trust of the American \npeople to prove we are eligible, qualified, worthy of being a governing \nparty after 2012, then we better set our clear goal: make it easier and \ncheaper to create private sector jobs and go step by step toward that \ngoal, explaining carefully what we are doing, attracting independent \nvoters, keeping independent voters, so that when we pass a law, the \ncountry accepts it, and then we move on ahead.\n  So that is what our discussion was about today, and it is an \nimportant discussion. It is not just some dusty, dry thing. Herbert \nCroly's book in 1909, ``The Promise of American Life,'' is the \nmanifesto for the progressive movement that has ascended in this \ncountry right now. And our idea of less from Washington and more of \nourselves is an intellectual context for the antidote to that. It is \nfor the resurgent movement in America that began with President \nJefferson's yeoman farmer, with his distrust in the Federal Government \nand his skepticism of great big policy schemes imposed from Washington. \nThat is the grand debate of the last century, and it is the one we are \nin the midst of today.\n  So I thank the Senate for giving me an opportunity to present my \nthoughts. I thank my colleagues who attended the Hudson Institute \ndiscussion today. And I especially urge my Republican colleagues to \nremember that if we want to re-earn the trust of the American people, \nwe need to set the right goals and move in that direction, step by \nstep. We will have to be a little patient to get there, but that is a \ngood way to get where we want to go.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from the University of Arkansas on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, back in July of this year, the \nsubcommittee I chair on contracting oversight held a hearing about \nheartbreaking incompetence at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Because of a series of management errors, bungling, neglect, the \ncontracts that were supposed to be executed to make sure we were \nkeeping track of America's heroes in our most sacred place in this \ncountry--we discovered that, in fact, the officials at Arlington \nNational Cemetery were not sure who was buried where.\n  The reaction I have had to that hearing has been so reassuring \nbecause as I travel around Missouri, person after person comes up to \nme, so many veterans, saying: Thank you for getting on top of this \ndisaster at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Since that hearing, when it was very clear there was no direct line \nof authority in terms of managing Arlington National Cemetery--that \nthey had no problem issuing multiple contracts for millions of dollars \nand getting absolutely nothing for it, an acknowledgment that they did \nnot have a system that was adequately keeping track of the location of \nburial for potentially thousands of America's finest--we have continued \nto stay on top of this and have realized that more and more problems \ncontinue to arise.\n  This morning, it was reported nationally that they now found a grave \nsite that has eight different urns buried--eight different urns--\ncremated remains buried in one location with a tombstone that said \n``Unknown.'' And, of course, they have been able to identify some of \nthose remains--gratefully, they have--and they are contacting those \nfamilies.\n  But as a result of the hearing, I filed legislation, along with \nSenator Brown, who is with me on that committee as the ranking member \nof that committee. Together, we filed a bill, with a number of \ncosponsors, setting up some basic oversight of Arlington going \nforward--basic but very important--making sure we have review of \ncontract management, making sure we have compliance with an Army \ndirective, making sure we have a report on the grave site discrepancies \nthat have arisen, so we can be assured that every family in America who \nlooks upon Arlington as the last resting place for\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\ntheir family member can be assured that when they go to visit their \nloved one, they are indeed visiting their loved one. So we filed this \nbill, S. 3860. After we found out about these additional problems that \nhave arisen, I now feel a sense of urgency about this.\n\n  I know my colleagues on the other side have said we are not doing any \nother legislation except making sure we get a tax cut for millionaires. \nI am hoping they will make an exception to the rule because if we do \nnot provide adequate oversight right now, when will we? Is there a \nsubject more important than our oversight and making sure those we \nshould honor the most are, in fact, being treated with the kind of \ndignity and respect they deserve rather than just being thrown in a \ngravesite that says ``Unknown''?\n  So I am going to make a motion tomorrow--we will be in session \ntomorrow--for unanimous consent to pass this legislation. I know I am \nbeing impatient. We are supposed to let these things sit on the \ncalendar for months and months, and we are to hope that nobody puts a \nsecret hold on it, and we are to get frustrated not knowing who has a \nhold on it or why. We have 38 members of the judiciary who have been \nsitting on the calendar who came out of committee unanimously. But, no, \nwe can't take those up. We can't do anything until we do unpaid tax \ncuts for millionaires.\n  I am hoping my Republican colleagues will give the millionaires a \nrest tomorrow. I am hoping they will get off the case of helping the \nmillionaires and the billionaires so we can unanimously pass this bill. \nThat is the best we can do right now to make sure our loved ones--\nbecause they are all of our loved ones. We love the men and women who \nare buried at Arlington National Cemetery, from John F. Kennedy to the \nsoldiers none of us has ever met. We love these Americans, and we need \nto do everything we can to make sure there is proper oversight of what \nis going on at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  So, tomorrow, I am hoping we get an exception to the edict that we \ngot from our friends on the Republican side of the aisle. I am hoping \nthey will allow this bill to go through by unanimous consent because, I \nwill tell my colleagues, I am not comfortable going home for my \nChristmas holidays with my family until I am sure we have done \neverything we can for the families who lost loved ones who reached a \nfinal resting place on this Earth at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, last night, Chicago and America lost a \nhero. Ron Santo was a Chicago Cubs legend and an inspiration to anyone \nwho has ever faced a tough, uphill battle in life.\n  During his 15-year career with the Cubs, Ron Santo batted .277 with \n342 home runs and 1,331 RBIs. He was a nine-time All Star and a five-\ntime National League Gold Glove winner. In each of four seasons, he \nbatted .300, drove in 100 runs, and led the league in walks.\n  What the public didn't know for most of his career is that he lived \nevery day with a life-threatening illness.\n  Ron Santo hid his diagnosis from the public for 10 years. He said he \ndidn't want anybody to feel sorry for him. He didn't want to be held to \na different standard. He wanted to be judged the same way every other \nballplayer is judged--by the numbers. By that standard, Ron Santo \nearned his spot among the greats.\n  We can't know how much better he might have been if he hadn't \nsuffered from diabetes, in an era that suppressed the long ball or \nmaybe for a team that, God bless them, never once saw postseason \naction, but it doesn't matter. Simply put, Ron was the best third \nbaseman in Cubs history and maybe in the game.\n  The last decade in Ron's life brought challenges that would have \nsidelined many others. In 2001, Ron lost the lower portions of both \nlegs to diabetes. He earlier survived a bout of cancer and endured more \nthan two dozen surgeries. In his later years he walked on prosthetic \nlegs that slowed his gait but not his dedication to the Cubs or his \nwork for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation where he served on \nthe board of directors.\n  On October 3, as he had for the last 32 years, he hosted the annual \nRon Santo Walk to Cure Diabetes in Chicago to raise awareness and \nfunding for research into a cure.\n  Baseball may one day see a third baseman with the playing skills of \nRon Santo, but it is hard to imagine that we will ever again see a \nballplayer with greater love or loyalty for a city, its team, and its \nfans.\n  His broadcast partner, Pat Hughes, was quoted this morning saying: \n``Ron Santo absolutely loved the Cubs. The Cubs have lost their biggest \nfan.''\n  But Ron Santo's love affair with the Cubs started at an early age. \nBorn in Seattle, he watched the Game of the Week on TV and remembers a \ngame from Wrigley Field with Ernie Banks. He said there was something \nabout that ballpark and the Cubs fans.\n  When it came time to sign up, this great prospective ballplayer was \noffered a lot of money by a lot of clubs, but he wanted to be a Chicago \nCub. He could have made a lot more money at the end of his career as \nwell by leaving Chicago. Instead, in 1974, Ron Santo became the first \nplayer to invoke his privilege under the league's ``5-and-10 rule,'' \ndeclining a trade to the California Angels because he wanted to finish \nhis career in Chicago. That kind of dedication to a team and its fans \nis something you hardly ever see anymore. It is something I remember \nfondly from my youth, and I will bet the Presiding Officer does too.\n  Since 1990, Ron Santo lived out his love for the Cubs as commentator \nin the booth, providing color commentary on WGN Radio Cubs broadcasts. \nSports Illustrated writer Rick Reilly described Ron's commentary this \nway. He said Ron Santo ``loves them Cubs like the Pooh Bear loves \nhoney. He does not call a game, he lives it. He cheers so much that it \nsounds like his play-by-play partner Pat Hughes is broadcasting from \nMurphy's Bar.''\n  In the words of broadcaster Pat Hughes, he ``never had a better \npartner.''\n  Ron Santo's boisterous 7th inning stretch renditions of ``Take Me Out \nto the Ball Game'' at Wrigley Field, a tradition that he carried on \nafter the passing of Cubs legend Harry Caray, could make anyone smile--\nmaybe even a White Sox fan.\n  One other thing that I always thought was interesting. They used to \njoke about it. I was fortunate to be invited to go up to the broadcast \nbooth at Wrigley Field. What a treat for a baseball fan to be up there \nwith Ron Santo and Pat Hughes and to do an inning. I mean, if there is \nany psychic reward with this great job, it is that. I would study up on \nall the stats and all the ballplayers' names and what happened in the \npreceding week and think about who is coming and I would be all loaded \nup, and here is Ron Santo.\n  At this point it is instinctive. He is announcing a game and talking \nto people and getting ready for the next commercial and all of these \nthings are going on, and they were kidding him constantly. There was \none ongoing joke that I never knew the origin of, and it wasn't until \nthey started writing these articles about his life that it finally came \nout. It seems that there was an incident that occurred on opening day \nin the year 2003. Ron Santo, for all his great qualities, didn't \nbelieve that an expensive toupee was necessarily worth the money. So he \nwore a toupee that clearly was a bargain. His toupee caught fire in the \nShea Stadium press box in New York on opening day 2003 after he got too \nclose to an overhead space heater. They kidded him about that for the \nnext 6 years. What a good-natured man he was, to take that kidding and \nto just go on and say: Let's get back to the game--typical of a great \nfellow with a great sense of humor who doesn't take himself too \nseriously.\n  Ron Santo was considered for entry into Major League Baseball's Hall \nof Fame an astonishing 19 times. The last time was 2008. Sadly--\nwrongly, in my view--he never made it to Cooperstown. But he took that \ndisappointment\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\nthe same way he took so many other bad breaks in life, with dignity and \ngrace.\n  In September 2003, the Cubs retired Ron Santo's number, 10. It now \nhangs at Wrigley Field along with the numbers of former teammates Billy \nWilliams and Ernie Banks. Ron Santo famously said that day: ``This is \nmy Hall of Fame--Wrigley Field.''\n  But ``This Old Cub'' deserved more. Like his fellow Cubs whose \nretired numbers also hang proudly on Wrigley Field foul poles, Ron \nSanto should have been in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. That he \nnever made it is the only regret he could have had about his career.\n  Ron Santo was a ballplayer who lived large, played through \nunimaginable pain, broadcast the game with all his heart, and left an \nindelible mark on Cubs fans everywhere. Whether he was staring down an \nopposing pitcher or staring down diabetes, he gave it his all every \nday. The Cubs, Chicago, and America will miss Ron Santo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the \ndebate we are having on the fundamental question of what type of tax \nrelief will be considered by the Senate.\n  Not too often does a debate offer such clear differences in \npriorities between the two parties. We have before us a sensible \npackage, put together by Chairman Baucus, which would ensure that any \nfamily in America who makes up to one-quarter of a million dollars in a \nyear would get a permanent tax cut instead of one that expires a few \nyears down the road, as the Bush tax cuts will do.\n  If Republicans would work with us, we could give businesses \ncertainty, middle-class families tax relief, and create jobs at this \nvery moment. Solving these issues has, at least from my perspective, \nbroad bipartisan support. Everybody says they want to give business \ncertainty, they want to give middle-class families tax relief, and they \nwant to create jobs. So if we have that agreement, both sides should be \nable to come to support this proposition.\n  Both sides have agreed we should move forward extending tax cuts for \nmiddle-class families, do more to create jobs, and ensure that the \nalternative minimum tax doesn't ensnare more than 30 million Americans \nthis year. Unfortunately, the question isn't, Who is going to cut your \ntaxes? That is not the question. The question is, Whose taxes are going \nto be cut?\n  We could pass this bill today, give middle-class taxpayers certainty, \ntake care of the AMT, the alternative minimum tax problem, which \nprotects, right now, in terms of how we have responded to it to create \nrelief from that--and we want to extend that relief not only to 30 \nmillion people in the country but 1.6 million New Jerseyans whom we \nhave saved from being bit by that AMT. Failure to act would mean they \nwould pay an additional tax bill of up to $5,600.\n  These are middle-class families who were never intended to pay a tax \nthat was meant originally for those in our country who paid nothing \ntoward the common good. Hence, the Congress created an alternative \nminimum tax, so those using the deductions in the code who paid nothing \nto the common good, to the Nation's defense, and its well-being had to \npay something. But since that was 20, 25, 30 years ago, it was never \nindexed. We have now seen that has been biting middle-class families. \nIn the case of middle-class families in New Jersey subject to the AMT, \nthey would be bit by another $5,600.\n  We also need to extend the desperately needed unemployment benefits \nto the 2 million Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own. That is all in this package. We could pass a number of job \ncreation measures, such as an extension of Build America Bonds which, \ntrue to its name, puts people to work rebuilding communities across \nAmerica. My proposal is to give them the tools they need to put people \nto work on projects that deliver safer and cleaner water to families \nthrough private activity bonds--something that gets the private sector \nputting up money in a way that creates jobs. Unbelievably, my \nRepublican colleagues have pledged to stop this bill, to do that by \nwhat we call a filibuster, to insist that instead of a simple majority \nof the 100 Senators, there have to be 60. All these benefits, permanent \ntax benefits for middle-class families making one-quarter of a million \ndollars or less, the opportunity to create jobs, the opportunity to \ntake care of a couple million Americans who lost their jobs, the \nopportunity to bring the private sector back again, the opportunity to \ngive the private sector certainty, none of that is good enough for \nthem. They will not simply vote against it; they are seeking to block \nthis bill, by using the filibuster, from even being considered by the \nSenate.\n  The difference in the priorities between our two parties is rather \nclear. Republicans would rather that taxes increase for all Americans \nthan allow tax rates for millionaires and billionaires to revert to \nClinton-era prosperity levels. So all of us have to face an increase in \ntaxes in order to give an extra tax benefit to the wealthiest in our \ncountry.\n  It happens to be a fact that the wealthiest in the country still see \na tax cut under this bill, and it will be bigger than a middle-class \nfamily's tax cut. We are simply asking not to extend additional tax \ncuts on top of the tax cuts they will already receive. So everybody in \nAmerica gets a tax cut under our proposal. As a matter of fact, that \ntax cut, instead of expiring a few years down the road, stays \npermanent. But, no, they want to give an additional tax cut to those \nwho are millionaires, multimillionaires, and billionaires. Simply put, \nRepublicans believe it is more important to deliver massive tax breaks \nto CEOs than to the people who work for them. They argue that \nmillionaires paying tax rates at the levels they paid in 2000 would \ndecimate the economy. The problem is, that position is simply not \nsupported by the facts or the experience of the last decade.\n  People who have worked hard and built personal wealth should be \napplauded for their success. I applaud people who, through their hard \nwork, creativity, and ingenuity, have created wealth. They should be \napplauded and admired. I admire them. People who work hard and prosper, \nthey love their country too. They are in the best position to be \nhelpful to their country in this tough economic time. Many of them are \nwilling to contribute if we ask. We know from experience that reverting \nto the tax rates that the wealthiest and most successful paid during \nthe Clinton-era prosperity will certainly not break our economy. As a \nmatter of fact, it was that era that balanced the budget for the first \ntime in a generation, created record surpluses, low unemployment, low \ninterest rates, and had the greatest peacetime economy in over a \ngeneration. It certainly didn't break our economy.\n  So I just don't understand why my colleagues on the Republican side \nof the aisle continue to oppose what is good for America, for our \nchildren, and for our future. We are on the eve of the holidays. \nMiddle-class families are sitting around the kitchen table at night \nwondering how they are going to afford to buy the gifts for their \nchildren this year. Middle-class families are wondering how they are \ngoing to make the next mortgage payment, how they are going to pay \ntuition for their college-age children next semester. These are tough \nconversations around that kitchen table.\n  I can assure you those Republicans who are fighting for millionaires \nand billionaires are not worried this holiday season. Yet we are being \nasked to give them an additional tax windfall while middle-class \nfamilies are struggling. Our Republican colleagues are playing Santa \nfor the millionaires and Scrooge for the middle class.\n  Those who make over $1 million, they want to give them a big fat \ncheck, averaging $104,000, with a bow on it. For our children, they \nwant to give them a big fat $4 trillion bill to be paid back with \ninterest for generations to come. I guess that is their version of \nhappy holidays, America.\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\n  Does it make sense to anyone but our Republican colleagues who, once \nagain, are telling us that rewarding the wealthiest helps us all, that \nthat wealth somehow trickles down and creates jobs? I say: Show me the \njobs. We cut taxes for that universe of taxpayers, the highest income \ntaxpayers in the Nation, and they said it would create jobs. Well, show \nme. Where are they? In the year the Bush tax cuts were passed, \nunemployment was under 5 percent. After nearly a decade under Bush's \ntax policy, unemployment has doubled. It now stands at nearly 10 \npercent. Now they are saying we need to reward the rich again and it \nwill create jobs. Well, in my view, the Bush Republican tax cuts for \nmillionaires and billionaires has been the biggest failed jobs program \nin our Nation's history. But what it did do is add enormously to the \ndebt.\n\n  I have listened to those who have come here talking about the \nconsequences of debt. Yet they are rushing to add to that debt in \ndramatic ways, all for the wealthiest people in our country. So my \nquestion to my Republican colleagues who believe that only debt-\nfinanced tax cuts for millionaires can fix the economy is this: Where \nis the prosperity that President Bush promised to the middle class when \nthese cuts were passed a decade ago?\n  In fact, let's look at that decade. The Bush decade will go down in \nhistory as one of the worst decades the middle class has ever faced. \nWhile the wealthiest saw their incomes swell and their taxes plummet, \nmiddle-class salaries remained stagnated. Families' costs, such as \nhealth care and college tuitions, skyrocketed, and jobs disappeared \noverseas. The stock market sputters along at the same levels it \nachieved under the Clinton-era tax rates. Middle-class wages have \ncontinued to lose ground to inflation and health care costs, and \nmillions more now live in poverty than before these tax cuts were \npassed.\n  When the unregulated greed on Wall Street led to millions of \nAmericans losing their jobs, Republicans said: You are on your own--\nliterally. Literally, on this very floor--while leading a filibuster \nagainst an extension of unemployment benefits, and asked, How is it you \ncan do that to these people who, through no fault of their own, face \nthe unemployment line--one Republican retorted: Tough--and the rest of \nit you can fill in the blank--to pleas from families desperate for \nhelp.\n  If Republicans were truly in this debate to create jobs and protect \nthe middle class, then why did the Republican leader introduce a bill \nthat is actually a tax increase on millions--a tax increase on \nmillions--of middle-class American families? Yes, a tax increase. That \nis right. The Republican bill offered by their leader spends $1 \ntrillion more. Yet the vast majority of Americans would see their taxes \nincrease if it were to become law. Why? Because President Obama's tax \ncut for 95 percent of Americans--for so many middle-class families--was \nnot a large enough priority to make it into their package. Gutting the \nestate tax was but additional middle-class tax relief was not.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--the one entity both \nDemocrats and Republicans depend upon for the scoring of our efforts, \nfor thinking about what are the best job-producing initiatives and \nwhatnot--has found the most effective way--this is them, through their \nstudies--to create jobs. They say the ``biggest bang for the buck'' is \nextending jobless benefits, and ranking right behind in terms of \neffectiveness are payroll tax cuts and small business tax incentives.\n  The chairman's bill contains all of that--all that the Congressional \nBudget Office has said are the biggest creators of jobs.\n  The Republican leader's bill contains none--zero--of those \ninitiatives. The Congressional Budget Office has determined the \nRepublican package does not contain even one of the most effective \nideas for job creation. So if Republicans are in this debate to create \njobs, why don't they include the proposals that economists are telling \nus are the most effective in creating jobs?\n  We know Republicans have said no to everything. We know the \nRepublican leadership's top priority is not middle-class families but \ndefeating President Obama. But we cannot tolerate the harm their \npolitical strategy will do to middle-class families. They are even \nwilling, for the sake of their political strategy--which is to have \nthis President fail, which means not whether the President fails but \nwhether the country fails--to hold hostage permanent middle-class tax \nrelief, for multimillionaires and billionaires.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember those who are struggling this \nholiday season to keep their homes, to find a job, and to provide for \ntheir families. I urge my Republican colleagues during this kind, \nforgiving time of year to open their hearts and change their political \nplaybook. Their political playbook maybe has brought them some success, \nbut it puts middle-class families at enormous risk. There is no reason \nthe Senate cannot have a bipartisan vote or a simple majority vote on \nmaking reality permanent tax cuts of $250,000 or less for our families \nand to give businesses the certainty they need by creating an extension \nfor those who are unemployed, which will create opportunities for the \nprivate sector and Build America Bonds to get us working again. That is \nall in this package. It will give relief from the alternative minimum \ntax.\n  That is the vote we are going to have--all of that. Saying no to that \nin order to help the wealthiest people in the country--those we applaud \nfor their hard work and ingenuity, but those who are willing, I \nbelieve, to help their country and have the best wherewithal to do so--\nis just simply a political game book that should be ultimately \nabandoned. If not, in this vote, Republicans will have abandoned the \nmiddle class of this country at a time in which they need our support \nthe greatest.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8475-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8475-S8476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING VELMA BISHOP\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and offer my \ncondolences for the passing of a great Nevadan, Velma Bishop. A \nnaturalized U.S. citizen from Canada, Velma labored diligently in many \ncharitable and civic opportunities and programs. She was a wonderful \nmother and a wife of 45 year to her beloved late husband, Gail \nAlexander Bishop. Not only will her local, religious, and political \ncommunities miss her impact, but so will the great multitudes of people \nshe has been able to touch through a life devoted to service. It is my \ngreat honor to recognize her life's work before the U.S. Senate today.\n  The State of Nevada will miss Velma's can-do spirit. She sacrificed \nmuch of her personal time volunteering with special-needs children and \norphans. Many people with no biological relation nonetheless knew her \nas ``mom.'' Her arms were open for anyone; her kind spirit will always \nbe remembered. She was also a very involved member of her local \ncongregation in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n  Velma worked diligently to raise money for nonprofit concerns and \neven found time to manage various campaigns for the Democratic Party of \nNevada. She never shied away from voicing northern Nevada's needs. \nUntil recently, she continued playing an active role in the Gail Bishop \nChapter of the Nevada Alliance for Retired Americans, aptly named after \nher late husband. Her involvement in the public service back home found \nher befriending many of the underrepresented or overworked. She battled \ncourageously on their behalf. Among her many mourners is the former \nRep. Jim Bilbray, D-Nevada.\n  I join with my friends back home in Nevada to honor the wonderful \nlife of Velma Bishop. For 81 years she has immersed herself in \nenhancing the lives of others. I am grateful to recognize her \nachievements, and with a heavy heart, know that many people join Susan, \nSteve, and Kate in missing their ``mom.''\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8476-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant Jason T. Smith\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of SGT Jason T. Smith. Sergeant \nSmith, assigned to the 1st Explosive Ordnance Company, based in \nIwakuni, Japan, died on November 19, 2010, from wounds he received \nwhile serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Helmand \nProvince, Afghanistan. He was 28 years old.\n  A native of Colorado Springs, CO, Sergeant Smith graduated from \nDoherty High School in 2000. Upon graduation, Sergeant Smith enlisted \nin the Marines and was quickly recognized as a skilled and composed \nsoldier. He served three tours of duty: two in Iraq and one in \nAfghanistan all with decoration.\n  During his 10 years of service, Sergeant Smith distinguished himself \nthrough his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to take on one \nof the most dangerous and skillful jobs in the Marines--defusing bombs. \nFellow soldiers respected his intensity, and they relied heavily on his \nleadership. Sergeant Smith was also a gifted teacher, and Marines under \nhis command cite his marksmanship instruction as a high-point in their \ncareer.\n  Sergeant Smith worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the \nmost dangerous areas of Iraq and Afghanistan. He is remembered by those \nwho knew him as a consummate professional with an unending commitment \nto excellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated son, brother, \nand as a loving husband to his wife. In his free time, Sergeant Smith \nenjoyed fishing and playing basketball.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Sergeant \nSmith's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a \nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  He braved the chaos of combat zones throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. \nAnd though his fate on the battlefield was uncertain, he pushed \nforward, protecting America's citizens, her safety, and the freedoms we \nhold dear. For his service and the lives he touched, Sergeant Smith \nwill forever be remembered as one of our country's bravest.\n  To Sergeant Smith's entire family--I cannot imagine the sorrow you \nmust be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss will be \neased by your pride in Jason's service and by your knowledge that his \ncountry will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8476-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LIVABLE COMMUNITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a number of \norganizations from my home State of Utah that have demonstrated vision \nas they plan for the needs of our future. Utah is one of the fastest \ngrowing States in the country. Our rapid population growth is \nattributed to both the area's high birth rate and to in-migration. We \nhave a strong economy and have continued to attract workers during the \nrecent economic recession. Yet even as we grow, our transportation \nsystem has not buckled under the pressure of explosive development. \nRegional and community planners, as well as business and political \nleaders have been looking forward to plan and meet the transportation \ninfrastructure needs of our growing population. Our transit system of \nbuses, vans, light rail and commuter rail is unparalleled and I am \nproud of the role I played in bringing TRAX and FrontRunner, our light \nrail and commuter rail services to the Wasatch Front. Last Thursday, \nNovember 25, 2010, marked 10 years that TRAX has been serving our \ncommunities. This expanding network has brought new possibilities to \nour residents and creates an economic rebirth in each community it \ntouches.\n  There are a number of lessons that other areas can learn from the \nsuccess of Utah's transit expansion. Planning for the needs of a \nchanging population should be the standard, rather than the exception \nin every community. Recently, Utah was again recognized for its \ninnovative planning. Last month the U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, HUD, announced a $5 million award to support the \ncreation of more livable and sustainable communities along the Wasatch \nFront. This funding will support development of a regional housing plan \nthrough a new initiative intended to build economic competitiveness by \nconnecting housing with good jobs, quality schools and transportation. \nThis grant is part of a new Federal Partnership for Sustainable \nCommunities, which brings EPA, HUD, USDA and DOT together to ensure \nthat the agencies' policies, programs, and funding consider affordable \nhousing, transportation, and environmental protection together. I \nsupport the efforts of this interagency collaboration designed to get \nbetter results for American communities and to use taxpayer money more \nefficiently. I salute the Utah organizations whose vision brought this \nimportant grant to our State. The Utah consortium behind the grant is \nmade up of the following partners--the Wasatch Front Regional Council, \nMountainland Association of Governments, Envision Utah, the Utah \nDepartment of Transportation, UDOT, Utah Transit Authority, UTA, Salt \nLake County, Salt Lake City, University of Utah's Metropolitan Research \nCenter and Bureau of Economic and Business Research, the Utah Chapter \nof the American Planning Association and other public and private \nsector partners. These visionaries joined together to apply for this \ngrant through a nationwide competitive process to implement the growth \nstrategies and vision in the region.\n  Over the past decade, public, private, academic and community leaders \nin Utah developed quality growth strategies for the Salt Lake \nmetropolitan region. In 2010, they developed and adopted a regional \nvision, the Wasatch Choice for 2040, which is a blueprint for our \nregion's future. The sustainable communities grant Utah received will \nhelp make that blueprint a reality.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Dodd of Connecticut has introduced \nlegislation that would create more of these grants, and go a step \nfurther by creating an Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities. \nThis office would oversee efforts to help local communities plan for \nand create better and more affordable places to live, work, and raise \nfamilies. The legislation would incentivize communities to make \nregional plans like Utah's Wasatch Choice for 2040 and would fund \nsustainable development projects. I believe that with effective \npolicies to encourage sustainable development, our communities will cut \ntraffic congestion; reduce greenhouse gas emissions and gasoline \nconsumption; protect rural areas and green spaces; revitalize existing \nMain Streets and urban centers; and create more affordable housing.\n  While I strongly support many of the ideas in this legislation, I \nhave not added myself as a cosponsor, because of some concerns that \nhave been raised. First and foremost, during this time of out of \ncontrol spending, I feel it would be irresponsible of me to support the \nlegislation without a plan to pay for the new spending it would create. \nIt is my hope that some sort of a livable communities component will be \nincluded in a much needed transportation authorization bill that \nCongress should consider next year. This discussion of the future of \nthe highway trust fund should also address the important of local \nplanning efforts. I would also like to see a greater voice for small \nbusinesses and affected industries that would no doubt be greatly \naffected by the policies set in an effort to encourage sustainability. \nThere are many important interests that need to be considered and \nincluded in the discussion.\n  The partnership between the Utah Transit Authority and our local, \nregional and State transportation planning organizations is a great \nexample for many States. I feel confident that Utah will use the \nlivable communities grant we are going to receive to continue to lead \nthe nation in transportation and infrastructure planning. I urge my \ncolleagues to give full consideration and take the time to learn and \ndebate the ideas proposed in my friend Senator Dodd's legislation, S. \n1619, the Livable Communities Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8476-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8476-S8477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8477-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/03/senate-section/article/S8477-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:22 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

Res. 694\n\n       Whereas Iran is a multicultural society comprised of Shia \n     and Sunni Muslims, as well as Baha'is, Christians, Jews, \n     Zoroastrians, Persians, Azeris, Gilakis and Mazandaranis, \n     Kurds, Arabs, Lurs, Turkmen, Armenians, Balochis, Bakhtyaris, \n     and others, and many of these communities have coexisted for \n     thousands of years;\n       Whereas the Baha'i community is the largest non-Muslim \n     religious minority in Iran, whose teachings emphasize \n     multiculturalism, equality of men and women, interdependence, \n     and humankind living in peace;\n       Whereas vast numbers of Iranians recognize the many \n     contributions Baha'is have made to their society despite \n     facing government-sponsored persecution;\n       Whereas, in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2006, \n     2008, and 2009, Congress declared that it deplored the \n     religious persecution by the Government of Iran of the Baha'i \n     community and would hold the Government of Iran responsible \n     for upholding the rights of all Iranian nationals, including \n     members of the Baha'i faith;\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\n       Whereas, according to the February 2010 United Nations \n     Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review of Iran, ``The \n     Secretary-General noted reports about Baha'is subjected to \n     arbitrary detention, false imprisonment, confiscation and \n     destruction of property, citing a significant increase in \n     violence targeting Baha'is, including torture or ill-\n     treatment in custody.'';\n       Whereas, in August 2010, the seven former leaders of the \n     Iranian Baha'i community were sentenced to a 20-year prison \n     term, later reduced to a 10-year sentence, following over two \n     years of arbitrary detention without trial;\n       Whereas numerous independent observers and legal experts, \n     including the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \n     Rights, have raised serious questions about the lack of due \n     process or fairness of their trial;\n       Whereas over 43 Baha'is continue to be imprisoned in Iran \n     as of November 2010 solely because of their religious \n     beliefs;\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability \n     and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) calls on the \n     President to impose ``sanctions on certain persons who are \n     responsible for or complicit in human rights abuses committed \n     against citizens of Iran or their family members'';\n       Whereas, on March 15, 2010, Ms. Rozita Vaseghi was arrested \n     and has since been held in solitary confinement at the \n     detention center of the Ministry of Intelligence unit in \n     Mashhad;\n       Whereas the seven leaders of the Baha'i community, Fariba \n     Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, Behrouz \n     Tavakkoli, Saeid Rezaie, Vahid Tizfahm, and Mahvash Sabet, \n     were arrested between March and May 2008 and have remained in \n     detention;\n       Whereas, on June 14, 2010, the trial of these seven leaders \n     concluded after four hearings and on June 30 the court issued \n     a 20-year prison sentence for each which was subsequently \n     verbally changed to a 10-year sentence;\n       Whereas, on October 12, 2009, Christian pastor Youcef \n     Nadarkhani was arrested in northern Iran and faces a death \n     sentence for apostasy after he questioned the Muslim monopoly \n     on religious instruction his children were receiving in \n     school;\n       Whereas, in recent years, there has been a significant \n     increase in the number of incidents of Iranian authorities \n     raiding church services, detaining worshippers and church \n     leaders, and harassing and threatening church members;\n       Whereas official policies promoting anti-Semitism have \n     risen sharply in Iran, particularly since President \n     Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005;\n       Whereas, on July 23, 2009, riot police and security forces \n     injured and arrested 20 Sufi practitioners in Gonabad who \n     then received sentences of flogging or imprisonment in May \n     2010;\n       Whereas, in January 2009, Jamshid Lak, a Sufi of the \n     Gonabadi Dervish order, was flogged 74 times after being \n     charged in 2006 with slander after reportedly publicly \n     complaining of ill treatment by the Ministry of Intelligence;\n       Whereas, in July 2008, plain clothes security officers \n     raided the home of Isfahan Iranian Christians Abbas Amiri and \n     Sakineh Rahnama during a meeting, and both Amiri and Rahnama \n     died of injuries suffered during the raid;\n       Whereas these individuals were targeted solely on the basis \n     of their religion; and\n       Whereas the Government of Iran is party to the \n     International Covenants on Human Rights: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored \n     persecution of religious minorities in Iran and its continued \n     violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Iran to immediately release \n     the seven leaders of the Baha'i community and all other \n     prisoners held solely on account of their religion, including \n     Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif \n     Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, Mrs. Mahvash \n     Sabet, Mr. Vahid Tizfahm, Ms. Raha Sabet, Mr. Sasan Taqva, \n     Ms. Haleh Roohi, and Ms Rozita Vaseghi;\n       (3) calls on the President and Secretary of State, in \n     cooperation with the international community, to continue to \n     condemn the Government of Iran's ongoing violation of human \n     rights and demand the immediate release of prisoners held \n     solely on account of their religion, including Mrs. Fariba \n     Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. \n     Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, Mrs. Mahvash Sabet, Mr. \n     Vahid Tizfahm, Ms. Raha Sabet, Mr. Sasan Taqva, Ms. Haleh \n     Roohi, and Ms Rozita Vaseghi;\n       (4) urges the President and Secretary of State to consider \n     implementing further sanctions against officials directly \n     responsible for egregious human rights violations, including \n     against the Baha'is;\n       (5) calls on the United States Government to continue to \n     support an annual United Nations General Assembly resolution \n     condemning severe violations of human rights, including \n     freedom of religion or belief, in Iran;\n       (6) calls on the United States Government to press for a \n     resolution condemning severe violations of human rights in \n     Iran, including freedom of religion or belief, at the United \n     Nations General Assembly and at the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 5281 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5281) to amend title 28, United States Code, \n     to clarify and improve certain provisions relating to the \n     removal of litigation against Federal officers or agencies to \n     Federal courts, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Removal Clarification Act of 2010 is an \nimportant piece of legislation that will\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\nclarify a Federal agency or officer's ability to remove State judicial \nproceedings to Federal court. The bill has strong support from both \nsides of the aisle, and was passed by the House of Representatives \nwithout opposition. I have worked with Senator Sessions on an amendment \nto further clarify the rules governing removal to Federal court of \nState judicial proceedings when judicial orders including subpoenas are \nissued to Federal agencies or officials.\n  Existing law allows removal to Federal court of any ``civil action or \ncriminal prosecution'' that is ``commenced in a State court'' against a \nFederal agency or officer. However, there is a question whether a \nsubpoena directed toward a Federal agency or officer itself constitutes \na ``civil action or criminal prosecution'' that allows removal under \nsection 1442. While some courts have allowed removal in these \nsituations, others have not. Compare Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. \nv. Williams, 62 F.3d 408, 413-15, D.C. Cir. 1995 with Indiana v. Adams, \n892 F.Supp. 1101, S.D. Ind. 1995, Alabama v. Stephens, 876 F.Supp. 263, \nM.D. Ala. 1995, Price v. Johnson, 600 F.3d 460, 5th Cir. 2010 \n(dismissing appeal of district court's refusal to allow removal of \nsubpoena proceeding against congresswoman).\n  The Removal Clarification Act of 2010 resolves this split in \nauthority by amending section 1442 to clarify that the section allows \nremoval of any proceeding in which a judicial order, including a \nsubpoena for testimony or documents, is sought from or issued to a \nFederal agency or officer.\n  Earlier versions of this bill did not expressly address whether \nremoval under the new statute would be limited to just the subpoena \nproceeding, in a case that is otherwise purely between private \nlitigants but in which a Federal agency or officer has been subpoenaed, \nor whether the whole case would be removed. Members in both the House \nand Senate agree that in cases involving only the issuance of a \nsubpoena to a Federal agency or officer, only the subpoena proceeding \nshould be removed and the remainder of the civil action or criminal \nprosecution should remain in State court.\n  Some courts that currently allow removal of a subpoena proceeding \nhave made it their practice to remove only that proceeding if the rest \nof the case is not otherwise removable. I cite e.g., Pollock v. \nBarbarosa Group, Inc., 478 F. Supp.2d 410, W.D.N.Y. 2007; In re \nSubpoena in Collins, 524 F.3d 249, D.C. Cir. 2008; Colorado v. Rodarte, \n2010 WL 924099, D. Colo. 2010. Other courts, however, have held that \nthe entire case should be removed, even if no Federal officer was a \ndefendant in the underlying suit and the case is not otherwise \nremovable. I cite e.g., Swett v. Schenk, 792 F.2d 1447, 1450-51, 9th \nCir. 1986; Ferrell v. Yarberry, 848 F.Supp. 121, E.D. Ark. 1994. \nMoreover, while these cases at least hold that the district court may \nremand the case to the State court once the subpoena proceeding is \nresolved, other courts hold that once a case is removed under section \n1442, there is no authority to remand the case to the State court even \nafter the Federal issue is resolved. I cite e.g., Jamison v. Wiley, 14 \nF.3d 222, 238-39, 4th Cir. 1994.\n  To make clear that removal of a subpoena proceeding, or other minor \nproceeding, is limited only to that proceeding if the case is not \notherwise removable, the Senate amendment to this bill adds a second \nsentence to section 1442(c) that provides: ``If removal is sought for a \nproceeding described in the previous sentence, and there is no other \nbasis for removal, only that proceeding may be removed to the district \ncourt.''\n  The language of 1442(c) is intended to be broad because it seeks to \nencompass not only subpoenas for testimony or documents, but also any \nother kind of judicial process that state courts could direct to \nFederal officers in relation to the performance of their official \nduties. The parenthetical clause in the first sentence of 1442(c) \nspecifying that the proceeding need not be ancillary is added because \nsome states allow subpoenas to be issued, or direct other judicial \norders toward persons, before a complaint has even been filed. This was \nthe situation in the Price v. Johnson case, which occurred earlier this \nyear. When such pre-suit proceedings occur, they cannot be described as \nancillary because there is nothing for them to be ancillary to.\n  Although the language in the first sentence of section 1442(c) is \nbroad, I should make clear that it does not encompass all judicial \nproceedings. A proceeding in which a ``judicial order . . . is sought \nor issued'' means a minor proceeding, such as a subpoena proceeding, \nbut does not include the complaint for relief itself. The second \nsentence of section 1442(c) would therefore not apply to a case in \nwhich a complaint for relief or a criminal prosecution has been brought \nagainst a Federal agency or officer, or a case that is removable under \nany other section of the United States Code. If the Federal agency or \nofficer is a defendant in the underlying case, the normal rule, as \ndescribed in section 3726 of Wright & Miller's Federal Practice and \nProcedure, would continue to apply:\n\n       Because Section 1442(a)(1) authorizes removal of the entire \n     case even if only one of the controversies it raises involves \n     a federal officer or agency, the section creates a species of \n     statutorily-mandated supplemental subject-matter \n     jurisdiction. The district court can exercise its discretion \n     to decline jurisdiction over the supplemental claims if the \n     federal agency drops out of the case, or even if the federal \n     defendant remains a litigant. Whether the supplemental claims \n     should be remanded if the federal officer's ``anchor'' claim \n     is dismissed or settled, or if the supplemental claims have \n     been asserted against non-federal parties, depends on \n     considerations of comity, federalism, judicial economy, and \n     fairness to litigants.\n\n  Changes made by this bill to section 1442 are not intended to \ndisplace ``the requirement that federal officer removal must be \npredicated on the allegation of a colorable federal defense.'' I cite \nMesa v. California, 489 U.S. 121, 129, 1989. This legislation also does \nnot displace the settled rule that ``the invocation of removal \njurisdiction by a Federal officer does not revise or alter the \nunderlying law to be applied. In this respect, it is a purely \nderivative form of jurisdiction, neither enlarging nor contracting the \nrights of the parties.'' I cite Arizona v. Manypenny, 451 U.S. 232, \n242, 1981.\n  The new time limit created by section 1446(g) allows a Federal agency \nor officer subpoenaed to seek removal either within 30 days of \nreceiving, through service, notice of when the subpoena is requested or \nissued or 30 days of receiving, through service, notice of when the \nsame subpoena is sought to be enforced. This new subsection allows a \nFederal agency or officer to remove a pre-suit subpoena proceeding to \nFederal court before any complaint is filed, and also effectively \nallows a Federal officer who has been subpoenaed to wait until the \nsubpoena is sought to be enforced before seeking removal.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for working with me to clarify the House's \nbipartisan bill. I also thank Representative Hank Johnson for working \nwith us to explain the purposes and intricacies of this procedural \nissue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I further ask the amendment which is at the desk be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the clerk \nread a pay-go statement for the record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
