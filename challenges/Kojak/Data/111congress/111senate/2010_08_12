Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity, \nand I think I speak on behalf of all of our colleagues, certainly in \nsentiment if not my exact words, about our friend and former colleague, \nTed Stevens. On Tuesday we were all deeply saddened to learn about his \ntragic passing.\n  Ted's dedication to his Nation began with his valiant service in \nWorld War II and endured through six decades of public service. Ted \nhelped secure statehood for his beloved Alaska and never stopped \nfighting for the people of the Pioneer State for over 40 years as its \nsenior Senator.\n  Our thoughts are with Ted's wife Catherine and the entire Stevens \nfamily and all of those who lost their lives and were injured in this \nweek's sad accident.\n  Mr. President, I want to personally add the thoughts of Senator Reid. \nI spoke with him last night. We spoke about Senator Stevens and \nremembered him fondly. Senator Reid particularly noted to me one of his \nprize possessions was a Hulk tie that Senator Stevens had given him, \nand he proudly still has it with him.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the history of our country, no one \nman has done more for one State than Ted Stevens. His commitment to the \npeople of Alaska and his nation spanned decades, and he left a lasting \nmark on both. From his early military service as a pilot in World War \nII, to his involvement in the statehood of `The Last Frontier,' to his \nfierce support and defense of our Nation's military, Ted Stevens was \nalways there, fighting for what he believed in, and usually winning. He \nwas a force to be reckoned with, and we will miss him greatly. We \nextend our deepest sympathies to Catherine and the entire Stevens \nfamily, and to the families of the friends who were lost in this \nterrible accident.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable en bloc, and that any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 617) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 617\n\n       Whereas Theodore ``Ted'' Fulton Stevens, who began serving \n     in the Senate 8 years after Alaska was admitted to Statehood, \n     represented the people of the State of Alaska with \n     distinction in the Senate from 1968 to 2009 and played a \n     significant role in the transformation of the State of Alaska \n     from an impoverished territory to a full-fledged State \n     through the assistance he provided in building energy \n     facilities, hospitals and clinics, roads, docks, ferry \n     terminals and airports, water and sewer facilities, schools, \n     and other community facilities in the State of Alaska, which \n     earned him recognition as ``Alaskan of the Century'' from the \n     Alaska Legislature in 2000;\n       Whereas Ted Stevens distinguished himself as a transport \n     pilot during World War II in support of the ``Flying Tigers'' \n     of the Army Air Forces, flying supplies to China over the \n     treacherous ``Hump'' route in the eastern Himalayan mountains \n     and earning 2 Distinguished Flying Crosses and other \n     decorations for his skill and bravery;\n       Whereas Ted Stevens, after serving as a United States \n     Attorney in the territory of Alaska, came to Washington, \n     District of Columbia in 1956 to serve in the Eisenhower \n     Administration in the Department of the Interior, where he \n     was a leading force in securing the legislation that led to \n     the admission of Alaska as the 49th State on January 3, 1959, \n     and then as Solicitor of the Department of the Interior;\n       Whereas, in 1961, Ted Stevens returned to the State of \n     Alaska and, in 1964, was elected to the Alaska House of \n     Representatives, where he was subsequently elected as Speaker \n     pro tempore and majority leader until his appointment to the \n     Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator \n     E.L. Bartlett on December 24, 1968;\n       Whereas Ted Stevens, the longest-serving Republican Senator \n     in the history of the Senate, served as President pro tempore \n     of the Senate from 2003 through 2007 and as President pro \n     tempore emeritus from 2008 to 2009, and over the course of \n     his career in the Senate, Ted Stevens served as assistant \n     majority leader, Chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics, \n     Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, \n     Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, Chairman \n     of the Committee on Appropriations, and Chairman of the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation;\n       Whereas Ted Stevens worked tirelessly for the enactment of \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et \n     seq.), which provided for the return of approximately \n     44,000,000 acres of land in the State of Alaska to the Aleut, \n     Eskimo, and Indian peoples and created Native Corporations to \n     secure the long-term economic, cultural, and political \n     empowerment of the Native peoples of the State of Alaska;\n       Whereas Ted Stevens was a leader in shaping the \n     communications policies of the United States, as he helped to \n     establish the spectrum auction policy, negotiated the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104; 110 Stat. \n     56), authored the Digital Television Transition and Public \n     Safety Act of 2005 (47 U.S.C. 309 note; Public Law 109-171), \n     and passionately advocated for the connection of rural \n     America to the rest of the world and to improve the lives of \n     the people of the United States through the use of \n     telemedicine and distance learning;\n       Whereas Ted Stevens was a conservationist who championed \n     the safe development of the natural resources of the United \n     States, as illustrated by his authorship of the Trans-Alaska \n     Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.), the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), which established the 200-mile \n     exclusive economic zone and led to a reduction in the \n     dominance of foreign fishing fleets in the fisheries of the \n     United States, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-479; \n     120 Stat. 3575), which established conservation measures \n     designed to end overfishing, and the High Seas Driftnet \n     Fisheries Enforcement Act (16 U.S.C. 1826a et seq.), which \n     provided for the denial of entry into ports of the United \n     States and the imposition of sanctions on vessels carrying \n     out large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive \n     economic zone of any nation;\n       Whereas Ted Stevens was an advocate for physical fitness in \n     his personal life and in his legislative accomplishments, as \n     illustrated by his authorship of the Ted Stevens Amateur and \n     Olympic Sports Act (36 U.S.C. 220501 et seq.), his \n     encouragement of providing equality to female athletes \n     through the enactment of title IX of the Education Amendments \n     of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), and his leadership in \n     improving physical education programs in schools by ushering \n     through the Carol M. White Physical Education Program (20 \n     U.S.C. 7261 et seq.);\n       Whereas Ted Stevens unconditionally supported the needs of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States through visits to \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in ever major military \n     conflict and war zone where United States military personnel \n     have been assigned, including Vietnam, Kuwait, Bosnia, \n     Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and in his role as Chairman \n     and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Defense \n     Appropriations for more than 20 years; and\n       Whereas Ted Stevens was well respected for reaching across \n     the aisle to forge bipartisan alliances and enjoyed many \n     close friendships with colleagues in both political parties \n     and with his staff, who were deeply loyal to him: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep \n     regret the announcement of the death of the Honorable \n     Theodore ``Ted'' Fulton Stevens, former member of the Senate;\n       (2) the Secretary of the Senate communicate this resolution \n     to the House of Representatives and transmit an enrolled copy \n     of this resolution to the family of the deceased; and\n       (3) when the Senate adjourns today, the Senate stands \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     Honorable Theodore ``Ted'' Fulton Stevens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "12", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/12/senate-section/article/S6996-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6996-S6999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EMERGENCY BORDER SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6080, received from the \nHouse and at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6080) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for border security for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2010, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, I come to the floor to seek \nUnanimous Consent to pass a smart, tough, and effective $600 million \nbill that will significantly enhance the security and integrity of our \nNation's southern border--which currently lacks the resources needed to \nfully combat the drug smugglers, gunrunners, human-traffickers, money \nlaunderers and other organized criminals that seek to do harm to \ninnocent Americans along our border.\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\n  The Senate first passed this bill last week by unanimous consent. \nLast week's vote ended an impasse over how to pay for this package that \nall of us agree needed to be passed as soon as possible.\n  At first, the House proposed a border security bill that was not \nfully paid for and, thus, was unacceptable to many in the Senate.\n  And, here in the Senate, many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle wanted to pay for this bill by diverting critical funds from \nthe stimulus bill, The Recovery Act. This too was unacceptable because \nborder security does not need to come at the expense of programs that \ncreate jobs for millions of Americans. As important as border security \nis, we should not be taking away jobs from firemen in Buffalo and \nteachers in Syracuse in order to hire more agents in El Paso. That is \nthe worst kind of robbing Peter to pay Paul that was simply an \nunacceptable way to pay for increased border security.\n  Instead of raising the deficit--which we do not do in this bill--or \ndiverting vital stimulus funds, the Senate ultimately agreed to pay for \nthe border package by increasing visa fees on companies who hire \nforeign workers in a manner contrary to the original intent of the H-1B \nvisa program.\n  After the Senate reached this compromise and unanimously approved \nthis border package last week, the House approved the same substantive \nborder package by voice vote on Tuesday.\n  But, regrettably, the House was unable to simply pass the Senate \nbill. According to House rules--because the Senate's offset did not \noriginate in the House--it had to be approved by the House first, \nbefore the Senate's passage. So today, I again seek the unanimous \nconsent of my colleagues to approve this border security bill and to \nfinally provide President Obama and Secretary Napolitano with the boots \non the ground and the resources necessary to combat the crime and \nviolence that currently exists on our southern border.\n  I would like to thank the original cosponsors of this legislation: \nSenators McCaskill, Reid, Inouye, Murray, Feinstein, Bingaman, Udall of \nNew Mexico, Casey, Merkley, Lincoln, Udall of Colorado, Begich, and \nBurris.\n  I would also particularly like to thank Senators McCain and Kyl for \njoining on as cosponsors prior to the Senate's original approval and \nfor recognizing this bill as being significant border security \nlegislation.\n  In addition to providing many vital resources for securing our \nsouthern border--all of which I will detail in a moment--this bill is \nalso enormously important because it will clear the path for restarting \nthe bipartisan discussions we absolutely need to have on how best to \nrestore the rule of law to our entire immigration system.\n  Although we all agree that we must secure our borders, we will never \nfully resolve the problem of illegal immigration until we fix the \nentirety of what is wrong with our immigration system.\n  But those of us who currently support comprehensive immigration \nreform also believe in providing all of the resources our experts on \nthe ground are telling us they need to secure the border right now. \nThat is why this bill has received the support of the entire Senate.\n  We know that keeping our borders safe from dangerous gang members, \ndrug dealers, and human traffickers is critical to restoring the \npublic's confidence that the entirety of our focus with regard to \nimmigration policy is geared toward restoring the rule of law to what \nhas been a lawless system in the past.\n  That is why I commend the President and Secretary Napolitano for \ntheir tireless work in advocating for the passage of this package to \ngive our people on the ground the tools they need to secure the border.\n  Here are all of the vital resources our border security package will \nprovide:\n  First, we provide over $250 million to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol \nagents and 500 CBP officers to permanently patrol our southern border. \nThese new agents will form a ``strike force'' that will be deployed in \ndifferent areas of the southwest border depending on where the need is \ngreatest at any particular moment. We will finally have the capability \nto deploy our manpower in a way where we can continuously and \nimmediately change our tactics to respond to changes in the tactics of \nsmugglers and traffickers.\n  Second, we will provide funding to deploy more unmanned drones to fly \nalong our southern border to provide our agents on the ground with \nreal-time information on unlawful border crossings.\n  We are currently deploying seven of these unmanned drones on our \nborder. They have been proven to be very effective because they provide \nour border patrol agents with vast force multiplication through their \nability to identify the exact locations of larger groups that disperse \ninto smaller groups upon encountering border patrol agents on the \nground.\n  These additional drones will help us gain operational control over a \nmuch larger segment of our southern border than we otherwise would have \ncontrolled because they provide miles of surveillance capability that \nis technologically impossible to achieve through other means.\n  Third, we will provide funds to improve communications capabilities \nbetween Federal border enforcement agents and state and local officers \nalong the border. The issue here is crime. Officers with different \nareas of expertise and jurisdiction need to be able to communicate in \norder to have the best information possible to break up smuggling and \ntrafficking rings that are embedded in local communities. These \nimproved communication capabilities will lead to countless more \napprehensions and prosecutions of big-time smugglers and traffickers.\n  As an example, if our border patrol suddenly begins encountering a \nsurge of illegal border crossers from El Salvador with identical \ntattoos on their arms, it is important that they provide this \ninformation to State and local law enforcement on the ground so that we \ncan immediately begin sharing intelligence to determine whether \nindividuals with this description have recently been arrested. This \ncoordination will help us determine the exact criminal intent of this \ngroup and their methods of operation so that they can be effectively \ncombated.\n  Fourth, we will provide funds to construct forward operating bases \nfor the border patrol to use that are actually located on the border \nitself rather than hundreds of miles away.\n  It is extremely inefficient for border patrol to apprehend \nindividuals along the border and then have to drive hours to place that \nperson in detention in a far-away base. These forward operating bases \nprovide locations much closer to the border where detainees can be \nbrought for processing so that patrol agents on the ground can spend \nmuch more time combating illegal activity on the border.\n  Fifth, we will provide funds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nto conduct investigations of drug-runners, money-launderers, and human \ntraffickers along our border. It is almost impossible to find out the \nsources and uses of smuggling and trafficking funds without strong \nintelligence and investigation capabilities. This bill will provide ICE \nwith the resources it needs to hunt down the major players in these \ncartels who are responsible for the majority of the illegality on the \nsouthern border.\n  Finally, we will provide over $200 million to increase the number of \nATF, DEA, and FBI agents on our border and to bolster the number of \nprosecutors and court resources along our border so that wrongdoers can \nbe immediately brought to justice.\n  We will dramatically reduce the incidences of illegal smuggling of \nguns, drugs, and currency along our borders so that the American people \ncan feel far safer living in many of our border communities than they \ndo today.\n  The best part of this border package is that it is fully paid for and \ndoes not increase the deficit by a single penny. In actuality, the \nCongressional Budget Office--the CBO--has determined that the bill will \nyield a direct savings to taxpayers of $50 million.\n  The emergency border funds we are passing today are fully paid for by \nassessing fees on certain types of companies who hire foreign workers \nusing certain types of visas in a way that Congress did not intend.\n  I want to take a moment to explain exactly what we are doing in the \nbill a little further because I want everyone to clearly understand how \nthese offsets\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nhave been designed. There has been some discussion about this proposal, \nand I think we ought to lay it on the table and explain it clearly.\n  In 1990, the Congress realized the world was changing rapidly and \nthat technological innovations, such as the Internet, were creating a \nhigh demand in the United States for high-tech workers to create new \ntechnologies and products. Consequently, Congress created the H-1B visa \nprogram to allow U.S. employers to hire foreign tech workers in special \ncircumstances when they could not find an American citizen who was \nqualified.\n  Many of the companies that use this program today are using the \nprogram in exactly the way Congress intended; that is, these companies, \nsuch as Microsoft, IBM, and Intel, are hiring bright foreign students \neducated in our American universities to work in the United States for \n6 or 7 years to invent new product lines and technologies so that \nMicrosoft, IBM, and Intel can sell more products to the American public \nand hire more American workers. Then at the expiration of the H-1B visa \nperiod, these companies apply for these talented workers to earn green \ncards and stay with the company.\n  When the H-1B visa program is used in this manner, it is a good \nprogram for everyone involved. It is good for the company, it is good \nfor the worker, and it is good for the American people who benefit from \nthe products and jobs created by the innovation of the H-1B visa \nholder.\n  Every day companies such as Oracle, Cisco, Apple, and others use the \nH-1B visa program in the exact way I have described, and their use of \nthe program has greatly benefited the country.\n  But recently some companies have decided to exploit an unintended \nloophole in the H-1B visa program to use the program in a manner that \nmany in Congress, including myself, do not believe is consistent with \nthe program's intent.\n  Rather than being a company that makes something or provides a \nservice and simply needs to bring in a talented foreign worker to help \ninnovate and create new technologies, these other companies are \nessentially creating multinational temp agencies that were never \ncontemplated when the H-1B program was created.\n  The business model of these newer companies is not to make any new \nproducts or technologies such as Microsoft or Apple does. Instead, \ntheir business model is to, first, bring foreign tech workers into the \nUnited States who are willing to accept less pay than their American \ncounterparts; two, place these workers into other companies in exchange \nfor a consulting fee; and, three, transfer these workers from company \nto company in order to maximize profits from placement fees.\n  In other words, these companies are petitioning for foreign workers \nsimply to then turn around and provide these same workers to other \ncompanies who need cheap labor for various short-term projects.\n  Don't take my word for it. If you look at the marketing materials of \nsome of these companies that fall within the scope covered by today's \nlegislation, their materials boast about their ``outsourcing \nexpertise'' and say their advantage is their ability to conduct what \nthey call ``labor arbitrage''--labor arbitrage; they say it--which is, \nin their own words, ``transferring work functions to a lower cost \nenvironment for increased savings.''\n  The business model used by these companies within the United States \nis creating three major negative side effects. First, it is ruining the \nreputation of the H-1B program, which is overwhelmingly used by good \nactors for beneficial purposes. Some of our colleagues have legislation \nto curtail H-1B because of these types of abuses.\n  Second, according to the Economic Policy Institute, it is lowering \nthe wages for American tech workers already in the marketplace. And, \nthird, it is also discouraging many of our smartest students from \nentering the technology industry in the first place. Students can see \nthat paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for advanced schooling is \nnot worth the cost when the market is being flooded with foreign \ntemporary workers willing to do tech work for far less pay because \ntheir foreign education was cheaper and they intend to move back home \nwhen their visa expires to a country where the cost of living is far \nless expensive.\n  This type of use of the H-1B visa program will be addressed as part \nof comprehensive reform, and it is likely going to be dramatically \nrestricted--certainly, if I have something to do about it. We will be \nreforming the legal immigration system to encourage the world's best \nand brightest to come to the United States to create new technologies \nand businesses that will employ countless American workers but will \ndiscourage businesses from using our immigration laws as a means to \nobtain temporary and less expensive foreign labor to replace capable \nAmerican workers.\n  Let me say, in our proposal, the extra duty only goes on companies \nthat are more than 50 percent foreign workers and 50 percent H-1B \nworkers. The only companies that are 50 percent H-1B workers are those \nthat are just doing the policy that I proposed--far, far from what we \nenvisioned when H-1B was passed.\n  I say to those companies: If you do not change your ways--you should \nnot be doing what you are doing, and this duty is appropriate for that \npurpose.\n  I do want to clarify a previous remark which mischaracterized these \nfirms where I labeled them as ``chop shops.'' That statement was \nincorrect, and I wish to acknowledge that. In the tech industry, these \nfirms are known as ``body shops.'' That is what I should have said, and \nthat is what they are.\n  While I wholly oppose the manner in which these firms are using H-1B \nto accomplish objectives that Congress never intended, it would be \nunfortunate if anyone concluded from my remarks that these firms are \nengaging in illegal behavior.\n  But I also want to make clear that the purpose of this fee is not to \ntarget businesses from any particular country. Many news articles have \nreported that the only companies affected by this fee are companies \nbased in India and that ipso facto the purpose of this legislation is \nto target Indian IT companies. It is simply untrue that the purpose of \nthis legislation is to target Indian companies. We are simply raising \nfees for businesses that use the H-1B visa to do things that are \ncontrary to the program's original intent, and that will be on any \ncompany from any country that does it.\n  Visa fees will only increase for companies with more than 50 workers \nwho continue to employ more than 50 percent of their employees through \nthe H-1B program. That was never even close to anyone's thought when H-\n1B was passed. Congress does not want the H-1B program to be a vehicle \nfor creating multinational temp agencies where workers do not know what \nprojects they will be working on or what cities they will be working in \nwhen they enter the country. The fee is solely based upon the business \nmodel of the company, not the location of the company.\n  If they are using the H-1B visa to innovate new products and \ntechnologies, that is a good thing, regardless of whether the company \nwas originally founded in India, Ireland, or Indiana. But if they are \nusing the H-1B visa to run a glorified international temp agency for \ntech workers in contravention of the spirit of this program, I and my \ncolleagues believe they should have to pay a higher fee to ensure that \nAmerican workers are not losing their jobs because of the unintended \nuses of the visa program that were never contemplated when the program \nwas created. This belief is consistent regardless of whether the \ncompany using these staffing practices was founded in Bangalore, \nBeijing, or Boston.\n  Raising the fees for companies hiring more than 50 percent of their \nworkforce through foreign visas accomplishes two important goals: \nFirst, it will provide the necessary funds to secure our borders \nwithout raising taxes or adding to the deficit. Second, it will level \nthe playing field for American workers so they do not lose out on good \njobs in America because it is cheaper to bring in a foreign worker than \nhire an American worker.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what objective folks around the world are \nsaying about the impact of this fee increase.\n  In an August 6, 2010, Wall Street Journal article, Avinash Vashistha, \nthe CEO of a Bangalore-based offshoring advisory consulting firm, told \nthe Journal the new fee in the bill ``would accelerate Indian firms'' \nplans to hire\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nmore American-born workers in the U.S.'' What is wrong with that?\n  In an August 7, 2010, Economic Times article, Jeya Kumar, a CEO of a \ntop IT company, said this bill would ``erode cost arbitrage and cause a \nchange in the operational model of Indian offshore providers.'' \nExactly. That is what we want.\n  The leaders of this business model are agreeing that our bill will \nmake it more expensive to bring in foreign tech workers to compete with \nAmerican tech workers for jobs in America. That means these companies \nare going to have to start to hire U.S. tech workers again.\n  This bill is not only a responsible border security bill, it has the \ndual advantage of creating more high-paying American jobs.\n  Finally, I want to be clear about one other thing. Even though \npassing this bill will secure our borders, I again say the only way to \nfully restore the rule of law to our entire immigration system is by \npassing comprehensive immigration reform.\n  In my many meetings with folks on the other side of the aisle to try \nto gain their support for comprehensive reform, I repeatedly heard them \nsay that once we show we are serious about passing border security \nlegislation, they would be able to begin working with us to fix all of \nthe other aspects of our broken immigration system.\n  Make no mistake about it, our entire immigration system is broken. It \nis a patient that needs quadruple bypass surgery. A single bypass \nsurgery of border security alone is important but not enough to cure \nthe patient of its ailment. We also need to enact tough and smart \nimmigration reform that will, A, end the jobs magnet to the United \nStates by requiring that all legal workers show a secure Social \nSecurity card prior to obtaining a job; B, end visa overstays through \nrobust interior enforcement; and, C, require that all persons here \nunlawfully make their presence known to us by registering with the \nFederal Government and then either getting right with the law or \nleaving the country.\n  It is my hope that the bill we are passing today will break the \ndeadlock that has existed in Congress and will clear the path for us to \nfinally resume bipartisan negotiations in good faith on reforming our \nbroken immigration system. I intend to do everything I can to make that \nhappen.\n  But negotiations cannot happen out of thin air. It will take serious \nRepublicans working with serious Democrats to get this done. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in this very important \ntask.\n  With this bill's passage today, we will clearly show we are serious \nabout securing our Nation's borders. It is time for our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join in fixing our entire broken immigration \nsystem.\n  The urgency for immigration reform cannot be overstated because it is \nso overdue. The time for excuses is now over. The time to get to work \nis now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6080) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "12", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/12/senate-section/article/S6999-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n\n                         tribute to jack keeney\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to mark the coming \nretirement of a legend in the Department of Justice--John C. ``Jack'' \nKeeney.\n  As a former prosecutor, and through decades of oversight of the \nDepartment of Justice on the Judiciary Committee, I have developed an \nimmense appreciation for the dedication and skill of the Department's \ncareer prosecutors and attorneys. When politics have threatened to \ninfect the good work of the Department in the past, I have emphasized \nthe importance of the Department's career professionals. I know \nAttorney General Holder shares my regard for the Department's \nhardworking career prosecutors. With more than 6 decades of Federal \nGovernment service and well over a half century of pioneering work in \nthe Department's Criminal Division, Jack Keeney has come to embody the \nideal of a career Justice Department attorney.\n  Jack Keeney served in the Army Air Corps in World War II, during \nwhich his plane was shot down. He survived a Nazi POW camp. He went to \ncollege and law school under the GI Bill and joined the Justice \nDepartment in 1951. He has diligently served every administration since \nPresident Truman.\n  At the Justice Department, Jack Keeney worked on internal security \nmatters in the 1950s, prosecuted organized crime in the 1960s under \nAttorney General Robert Kennedy, and helped to expand the Department's \nwhite collar prosecutions as Chief of the Criminal Division's Fraud \nSection beginning in 1969.\n  In 1973, he was appointed Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the \nCriminal Division, a position he has now held for close to 4 decades. \nHe has on numerous occasions served as Acting Assistant Attorney \nGeneral and has long been the senior career official supervising some \nof the Justice Department's most important and most sensitive matters, \nincluding organized crime, public corruption, and electronic \nsurveillance.\n  Jack Keeney has received almost every conceivable honor for \nexceptional government legal work, including the Attorney General's \nAward for Exceptional Service, the District of Columbia Bar's Beatrice \nRosenberg Award for Outstanding Government Service, and the \nPresidential Rank Award for Distinguished Service.\n  The Department of Justice is defined by the career professionals who, \nday in and day out, exemplify dedication, integrity, and a commitment \nto justice. Jack Keeney has personified these qualities for the past 6 \ndecades. The Department and the country are better for his exceptional \nservice. I thank him for his service and wish him well in his well-\ndeserved retirement. I hope that generations of lawyers at the Justice \nDepartment will be inspired by his example and seek to follow in his \nfootsteps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "12", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/12/senate-section/article/S6999-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AUTHORIZING SIGNING OF DULY ENROLLED BILLS AND/OR JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.
