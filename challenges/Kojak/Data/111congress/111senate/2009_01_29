The senior Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           The Guest Chaplain\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I am very pleased that Rabbi \nDaniel Fellman could join us today as guest Chaplain to deliver the \nopening prayer for the Senate.\n  Rabbi Fellman, a native of Omaha and a respected religious leader, \ncurrently is assistant rabbi at Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple in New \nBrunswick, NJ. He is a much admired teacher who has served on the \nfaculty\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nat the Yavneh Day School in Cincinnati and numerous religious schools. \nHe served as student rabbi in congregations in Natchez, MS; Petoskey, \nMI; Joplin, MO; and LaSalle, IL. He also served in summer rabbinic \npositions in Nebraska and at the University of Cincinnati Hillel. In \nCincinnati, he helped foster interfaith understanding as a member of \nthe steering committee of the Catholic-Jewish Educators Dialogue of the \nAmerican Jewish Committee.\n  Rabbi Fellman received his undergraduate degree in political science \nfrom Colorado College. He earned a master of arts in Hebrew letters \nfrom Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, \nand he was ordained in June 2005.\n  On a more personal note, however, Rabbi Fellman is an Eagle Scout, \nand, like me, Boy Scouts taught him the importance of dedication and \nservice to the community.\n  While he is still young now, I have counted him as a friend for a \nlong time. During my first campaign for Governor in 1990, I was \ngrateful when a teenage Daniel Fellman often showed up with his father, \nUniversity of Nebraska at Omaha political science professor Dick \nFellman--who is with us today, and his mother--to volunteer.\n  One night Daniel Fellman, a relatively green driver then, got into an \nautomobile accident. There were no serious injuries sustained, but news \nreached one of my closest aides and my campaign manager the next \nmorning before Daniel arrived in the office. That was my great friend, \nthe late, great Sonny Foster.\n  The next morning, when Daniel did arrive at our campaign office, \nSonny greeted him: Hello, Crash. Ever since, to me and a few others, he \nhas been ``Crash Fellman,'' but now he is Rabbi Fellman. We understand \nit is a nickname, always given and received by a smile.\n  I thank Rabbi Fellman and his parents and his family for being here \ntoday and for his words of prayer this morning. May they guide us to do \nwhat is right for America and for the world.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     Economic Stimulus Legislation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Republicans have had an opportunity \nthis week to highlight a number of our better ideas to ensuring low-\nincome children receive quality health care. We will continue to offer \nour plans to improve this program. I think there is certainly a \npossibility of finishing the SCHIP bill today, which will let us turn \nto the economy next week.\n  We all know the economy is clearly the top issue on the minds of all \nAmericans. I think we all agree we need to act to strengthen our \neconomy and to create jobs. Unfortunately, the bill produced by the \nDemocratic Congress falls short on a number of important fronts. First, \nit does not fix the main problem, which is housing. We need to address \nthat issue, and my colleagues will have better ideas to stimulate home \nownership. Next, we need to let taxpayers keep more of what they earn. \nFinally, we should not be spending taxpayer dollars we do not have on \nprograms we do not need.\n  We have seen a lot of reports recently on what is in the bill--\neverything from buying cars for Federal employees, to beautifying ATV \ntrails, to spiffing up the headquarters building at the Department of \nCommerce. In a time of trillion-dollar deficits, we cannot afford \nWashington business as usual. We should insist on the highest \nstandards. Are these projects really necessary? Will they stimulate the \neconomy? Will they create jobs? Should we ask the American people to \nfoot the bill? Republicans believe that letting individuals and \nbusinesses keep more of what they earn will have a quicker stimulative \neffect than having the Government spend it on projects, particularly \nones that are likely to be delayed for 3 to 4 years.\n  We look forward to offering amendments to improve this critical \nlegislation and move it back to the package President Obama originally \nproposed--40-percent tax relief, no wasteful spending, and a bipartisan \napproach.\n  Republicans have better ideas to dramatically improve this bill that \nwill go at the problem, create jobs, and stimulate the economy. We have \nbetter ideas to address the housing crisis, which is where this problem \noriginated. But in order to pass these and other commonsense \namendments, we will need support from our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle. Fixing our economy requires innovative ideas, commonsense \nsolutions, and bipartisan cooperation. It is clear from last night's \nvote in the House that the only thing that is bipartisan about this \nbill is the opposition to it. It simply does not meet the standard of \nbipartisan cooperation set by President Obama and welcomed by \nRepublicans in Congress.\n  Republicans stand ready to work with our friends across the aisle to \ncreate truly bipartisan legislation which will actually stimulate the \neconomy and create jobs, and we are ready to start next week.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we had a good day on the Children's Health \nInsurance Program bill yesterday. We considered 10 amendments; we \nconducted 6 rollcall votes. All in all, I think it was a very \nproductive day because we are very close to finishing and passing the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--reauthorizing it--so it can be \nsent to the House. My expectation is the House will then take the \nSenate bill and send it to the President so we can get it signed very \nquickly.\n  This morning, at about 10 a.m., we expect Senator Hatch to come to \nthe floor to offer his amendment regarding the definition of an unborn \nchild. I know Senator Boxer, and perhaps some other Senators, wish to \nbe here to address that issue and speak on that as well.\n  Last night, Senator Coburn offered two amendments and spoke about \nanother, and we hope to work with him to process those amendments.\n  For the information of Senators, we are working to set up a series of \nvotes on amendments, perhaps later this morning. A specific time has \nnot been set. My guess is it will be quite late this morning. Frankly, \nwe are working to finish this bill this afternoon. This bill is moving \nalong very quickly, and I urge Senators to bring any remaining \namendments they may have to the floor so we can wrap it up.\n  This is a wonderful program. There aren't very many people who \ndisagree with the Children's Health Insurance Program as enacted by \nCongress back in 1997. It was wonderful work on the part of Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and the late Senator John \nChafee. They worked very hard.\n  It is very interesting, there were very serious discussions on the \none hand, with many Senators who thought this should be another \nentitlement program for children; on the other hand, some Senators \nthought, no, this should not be an entitlement program, it should be a \nblock grant program. That was the compromise; that States get a big \nchunk of money, to be matched by State payments to provide health \ninsurance for the working poor--for kids of families who are just above \nthe income levels set for Medicaid. It has worked very well. It is very \nimportant, and I am very happy, frankly, and proud of the attempt that \nwas begun back in 1997 by the Senators I mentioned.\n  We had hoped to get this approved a couple years ago, late in 2007, \nbut unfortunately those two efforts were vetoed by President Bush. But \nhere we are today. This is 2009--a new era, a new opportunity--and I \nthink most Senators are quite proud of the efforts we are making to \nhelp more kids get better health insurance.\n  I hope Senator Hatch gets to the floor soon so he can offer his \namendment and then we can proceed.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 80\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up the Hatch amendment No. 80.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Vitter, \n     Mr. Brownback, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Bennett, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 80.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To codify regulations specifying that an unborn child is \n                 eligible for child health assistance)\n\n       On page 76, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 116. TREATMENT OF UNBORN CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Codification of Current Regulations.--Section \n     2110(c)(1) (42 U.S.C. 1397jj(c)(1)) is amended by striking \n     the period at the end and inserting the following: ``, and \n     includes, at the option of a State, an unborn child. For \n     purposes of the previous sentence, the term `unborn child' \n     means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of \n     development, who is carried in the womb.''.\n       (b) Clarifications Regarding Coverage of Mothers.--Section \n     2103 (42 U.S.C. 1397cc) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Clarifications Regarding Authority to Provide \n     Postpartum Services and Maternal Health Care.--Any State that \n     provides child health assistance to an unborn child under the \n     option described in section 2110(c)(1) may--\n       ``(1) continue to provide such assistance to the mother, as \n     well as postpartum services, through the end of the month in \n     which the 60-day period (beginning on the last day of \n     pregnancy) ends; and\n       ``(2) in the interest of the child to be born, have \n     flexibility in defining and providing services to benefit \n     either the mother or unborn child consistent with the health \n     of both.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, America's Founders built their case for \nindependence on the foundation of self-evident truths; not party \nplatforms or partisan positions, not opinion polls or intellectual fads \nbut self-evident truths. Our Creator, they said, endows us with \ninalienable rights, including the right to life. Government, they said, \nexists to secure those rights. They believed that when America was \nborn, and I still believe that today. I offer this amendment in that \nsame spirit. The conviction about the essential dignity of our fellow \nhuman beings motivates the Civil Rights movement here at home and the \nhuman rights movement abroad. No matter what our income, race, sex, \nreligion, location or age, we all have our humanity in common.\n  I came to the Senate with the conviction and tried to act on that \nconviction ever since by working to protect children's lives and \npromote children's health. These go hand in hand. That is why I worked \nso hard with Senator Kennedy and others to originally pass the \nchildren's health program and bill. It was kind of a miracle that we \nwere able to get it done over 10 years ago when we did it. It was done \nin the Finance Committee and became the glue that held both the \nRepublicans and Democrats together on the first balanced budget in over \n40 years.\n  As I said, I came to the Senate with very strong convictions. Again, \nI have tried to act on those convictions ever since by working to \nprotect children's lives and to promote children's health because I \nbelieve they go hand in hand. Elaine and I have 6 children, 23 \ngrandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren, and we speak for children, \ngrandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond, all over America.\n  I cannot understand those who insist that we establish hundreds of \nprograms to help millions of people by spending billions of dollars but \nwho do not believe the lives of those very same people should be \nprotected.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is about promoting children's \nhealth. My amendment does exactly that. A child in the womb is just as \nalive, just as human as that very same child will be after he or she is \nborn. The CHIP program exists to help States promote children's health. \nThe children who need help might be in a house or an apartment, in a \ncity or out in the country, in a large family or single-parent home, in \na crib or in the womb. That just seems to me, well, self-evident.\n  Since October 2002, a regulation issued by the Department of Health \nand Human Services has defined a child as anyone from conception to 18 \nyears of age. It may sound a little odd to call someone who can drive, \nvote, or serve in the military a child, but it is the most natural \nthing in the world to say that when those very same individuals were in \nthe womb, they were children.\n  Under this HHS regulation, States have had the option of providing \nCHIP coverage to children before as well as after birth. My amendment \nwould codify that regulation to continue helping States protect the \nhealth of children.\n  I would point out to my colleagues that so far, 14 States have \napproved plans to provide CHIP coverage to children before birth. Those \nStates include Arkansas, California, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, \nTexas, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  I also wish to clarify that my amendment would also provide health \ncoverage to pregnant women. Some have claimed that under this HHS \nregulation, pregnant women would only get CHIP coverage for conditions \nspecifically related to their pregnancy. I want to assure my colleagues \nthat my amendment will ensure that States have the option of providing \nservices to benefit either the mother or the child or both.\n  My amendment also clarifies that States may provide mothers with \npostpartum services for 60 days after they give birth. Mothers have \nhealth needs before and after they give birth and their children have \nhealth needs before and after they are born. My amendment ensures that \nthe CHIP program continues to meet those very important needs.\n  I urge my colleagues not to put the health of children at greater \nrisk by sidetracking my amendment with a bogus debate over abortion. \nThis is about children and their health, not abortion.\n  America itself is built on the foundation of inalienable rights which \nwe receive from God. Government exists to secure those rights. Those \nrights do include the right to life, and they specifically include the \nright to life. My life, your life, the life of each of my Senate \ncolleagues did not begin when we were born. Each of us was just as \nalive, just as human the day before our birth as the day after--or as \nwe are today. Our efforts to promote children's health, including \nthrough the CHIP program, flow from that self-evident truth.\n  My amendment will continue allowing States to promote the health of \nchildren and their mothers before as well as after those children are \nborn. I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, with great respect for my friend from \nUtah, I rise to oppose his amendment, not only as a Senator but as a \nmom and a grandmother. What the Senator is seeking to do essentially is \nseparate the woman from the child she is carrying, separate her from \nher pregnancy. I think I can speak with authority here. I know my \nfriend is a grandpa and a dad and has a magnificently beautiful family, \nbut I gave birth to two kids. I can assure my friend that when you \ncover the pregnant woman, you are covering that child from the time \nthat child is a fetus to the time that child is born.\n  I would just say that it appears to me as if this amendment is a \ndiversionary amendment from this very important bill to expand and \nimprove the health of our children, including the health of our moms \nwho are pregnant, a diversion to a debate about when does life begin--\nlet's fight about abortion. You know what, we will have many \nopportunities to have that argument. When we have that argument over \nRoe v. Wade, I think pro-choice will prevail. But this is not the place \nto have that argument. This is a place where my friend from Utah and I \nshould walk down this aisle being very happy that under this law that \nis before us, this bill that is before us, States absolutely can choose \nto cover a pregnant woman. This is a big step forward, and this is very \nimportant.\n  Again, I think the idea behind this amendment is to divert us from \nthis\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\nvery important bill. In my State, it will expand coverage to more than \nhalf a million kids and many pregnant women.\n  The debate over when life begins and all of that is a very \nphilosophical debate. My religion may teach something other than my \nfriend's. I totally respect every view on that subject. I also respect \nthe women of this country and the view they bring through their moral \ncode and their religion and whatever else they bring to the table as \nhuman beings. On the day we debate that, I will be out here debating \nit, but I am not going to get into this debate with my friend today \nover when life begins. Today is a day where we are going to work on \nmaking sure that our children are covered with health insurance and \nthat our pregnant women are covered with health insurance. The good \nnews I bring to the Senate today is that under this bill, pregnant \nwomen will be covered by this. This is very important.\n  Again, to try to separate the woman from the child she is carrying, \nfrom the fetus in her womb, is nonsensical. Maybe my friend sees it \nanother way. But when you take care of a pregnant woman, you are taking \ncare of her fetus, you are taking care of her pregnancy, you are \nworking hard to make sure that baby is healthy.\n  I just became a grandma 3 weeks ago, and my daughter had excellent \nhealth care. I want to assure my friends on the other side of the aisle \nthat as she was being treated, so was the child she was carrying, my \nbeautiful grandson.\n  Let's not take a beautiful bill and start fighting over an issue that \nhas been a philosophical argument forever--what is the point at which \nlife begins? My religion teaches me one thing. My friend's religion may \nteach him another. Who is right? Who is wrong? All we, as humankind, \ncan do is to give our best effort to figure that out. But in this bill, \nwhat we are trying to do is bring health insurance to pregnant women, \nbring health insurance to our kids. To divert it with this subject is a \ndisservice to the bill that is before us.\n  I know my friend is passionate on this point. I totally respect him \nfor that. But I hope we will defeat this amendment because it is a \ndiversion. It is a fight about Roe v. Wade. It is a fight about whether \na woman has a right to choose, and it does not belong on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as always, I care for the Senator from \nCalifornia. We are good friends. You know, I hasten to point out that \nher own State of California has approved unborn child State plans. \nLook, this amendment by definition has nothing to do with abortion \nsince women who seek help covering their unborn children's health are \nnot women seeking abortion. They are separate, and the Senator should \nnot try to mix them. This is not an issue about abortion. This is an \nissue about a living, unborn child and her or his mother.\n  I might add that 14 States have approved unborn child State plans, \nincluding the States of Arkansas, California, Illinois, Louisiana, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, \nTennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin have all approved unborn \nchild State plans.\n  I agree with the Senator, the bill has worked beautifully, the CHIP \nbill, for the last 10 years. I know. I wrote every word in it and did \nso with Senators Kennedy, Rockefeller, Chafee, and others, as a matter \nof fact. But I don't think anybody doubts that I carried the ball in \ngetting that bill through the Finance Committee and the whole Congress.\n  I see a one-sided attempt here to change the bill in ways that will \nmake it less effective and not cover as many children as it should. \nSome argue the legislation already gives States the option to cover \npregnant women, so this amendment is not necessary. But the distinct \ndifference between this amendment and what is in the underlying bill is \nthat this amendment allows States to cover children before birth. \nChildren have health needs as much before as after they are born, so \nlegislation to promote children's health ought to cover them. Let me \nemphasize that this is a State option, not a State requirement.\n  Some argue this amendment is an attempt to inject, as I think the \ndistinguished Senator from California has argued, the abortion issue \ninto a bipartisan effort to protect children's health through the \nauthorizing of the CHIP program. The truth is exactly the opposite. As \nI said when introducing my amendment, this has nothing to do with \nabortion. It has everything to do with promoting children's health, and \nany reasonable person ought to be concerned about the unborn as much as \nthey are the born and, of course, the mother involved. This amendment \ntakes care of all three.\n  I feel very strongly about this. I do not think anybody should try to \nmake this an abortion issue--not myself, not the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, or anybody else, for that matter. I don't see how \nanybody can vote against an amendment that protects the life of the \nunborn child after having read the Constitution about its great desire \nto protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That is what \nthis amendment is all about.\n  I feel strongly about it. I hope our colleagues will support it, \nbecause it would be a great thing to help this bill along. I would feel \nmuch better if this was amended. I have to admit, I do not feel good \nabout the approach that has been taken by my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  The fact is that Senator Grassley and I carried the ball for the last \n2 years, working with Senators Reid, Baucus, Rockefeller, Durbin, and \nothers; working with the House, Speaker of the House Pelosi, Rahm \nEmanuel and others who were there, including Steny Hoyer.\n  We worked closely together to do CHIPRA I. We got an overwhelming \nvote in the Senate. On CHIPRA II, we got an overwhelming vote in the \nSenate, enough to override the President's veto in the Senate. I do not \nthink that would have happened but for the bipartisan effort we put \ntogether. We had a solid, strong vote in the House, but not enough to \noverride the President's veto.\n  Now, I have heard people run down President Bush for his vetoes on \nCHIP. I think President Bush followed the advice of some very young \nadvisers in the White House who basically gave him bad advice. Had he \nallowed CHIPRA I or CHIPRA II to go through, we would not be having \nthis awful debate today; we would all be together. The whole Congress \nwould have been together, and this whole effort would have been truly \nbipartisan. We could have set a bipartisan tone right off the bat, \ninstead of this partisan tone that has been set by bringing up the bill \nwithout even talking to the two lead Republicans who in 2007 worked so \ncarefully, honestly, and diligently to try and bring about a bipartisan \nresolution for a new CHIP bill.\n  And, by the way, we took a lot of flack in the process from some in \nthe administration and some on our side for supporting the legislation \nin 2007. We took it. We took it gladly. And our colleagues on the other \nside saw us take it. They saw us stand firm. They saw Senator Grassley \nand myself stand on the floor, along with a whole host of others, in a \nbipartisan way, putting together what would have made CHIP even better \nfor the next certainly 5 years.\n  This bill only funds the CHIP program for 4\\1/2\\ years, because if \nthey had gone the extra half year, it would have priced the bill out of \nthe marketplace. But I have to say, we are going to have to come up \nwith that money anyway, and end up going that extra half year. So \neverybody better understand all that is being done today by my friends \non the left, ignoring people, like me and Senator Grassley, who have \nworked so closely with them--and they have a right to do that. I can \nlive with that, as I vote against their partisan bill.\n  All I can say is they have a right to do it. But it is the wrong \nthing to do. It is the wrong way to start off this Congress after the \nPresident himself has shown such a propensity to want to work together. \nI have to say, I was there when the President came and spoke to our \ncaucus last Tuesday. He was impressive. He was friendly. He was making \nevery effort to be bipartisan. But he apparently had not fully examined \nthe stimulus bill that has been passed only in a partisan way by\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\nthe House. I would call people's attention to the Wall Street Journal \nyesterday and their editorial on all the bad things that are in the \nbill; or Investors Business Daily and their editorial, and how that it \nis not a stimulus bill at all, but a great big potpourri of long-wanted \nliberal programs that are not going to stimulate the economy the way \nthey should.\n  I am not saying there is not any stimulus in the bill, but there is \nnot much compared to the cost of the bill. When you add interest to the \nbill, it is well over $1 trillion. Of course, you know, they keep \ninterest off because that would make it over $1 trillion. But interest \nis going to have to be paid regardless.\n  Now, this particular bill on the floor right now is one where I have \na tremendous interest, namely, children and children's health. I am \ngoing to continue to take great interest in it.\n  I want to caution my colleagues on the left that they are making a \ntremendous mistake here. I think we could have had 95 votes for CHIPRA \nII or CHIPRA I. That would send a tremendous message that has not been \nsent around here in a long time.\n  Now, the CHIP program, so everybody understands, already covers \nchildren before birth at the States' option. I read off the States that \nhave made that an option, including the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia's State.\n  This is not a new policy. It is already working. This amendment \nsimply continues that policy by codifying the HHS regulation. Women who \nwant their babies need this assistance. Women in California and other \nStates want this. Please do not deny this type of basic humane \nassistance or help for women and their children with a fake argument \nabout abortion. Let's have an abortion debate on another day. Everybody \nknows I am pro life. I feel very strongly about that. I will stand up \nfor the pro-life position. But it has nothing to do with what we are \ndebating here today. Let's help children and their mothers now.\n  Let's codify what a whole raft of States have said we ought to do, \nincluding the very important State of California, one-seventh of the \nwhole economy, one-seventh, I should say, in size in the world economy \ntoday, and a State I have a lot of regard for.\n  Fourteen states have gone along with this regulation. And, frankly, I \ndo not see one good argument against protecting unborn children and \ntheir mothers who want those children covered through the wonderful \nchild health insurance program. This is a very important set of issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my friend from Utah says he wants an \nhonest debate, and then he says, and I am quoting him--not word for \nword--he says, pregnant women are not covered in this bill. That is a \ndishonest debate.\n  States have the option to cover pregnant women, just as under the \nBush regulation they have the option to cover the unborn child. Okay? \nSo let's straighten it out.\n  My colleague has mentioned my State several times. My State was so \nanxious to cover pregnant women that they did cover them under the \nunborn child regulation which was put into place by George Bush, \nbecause he injected the whole abortion debate into the CHIP program.\n  What we do is we get away from that. In this bill we talk about \ncovering pregnant women. So for anyone to stand up here and suggest \nthat the only way to cover pregnant women is by codifying George Bush's \nregulation that, by the way, this Chamber voted down twice--let's be \nclear.\n  My colleague says that this is a left-right issue. This is not a \nleft-right issue at all. When my colleagues voted on this a couple of \ntimes before, it was bipartisan to reject the Allard amendment, which \nwas to codify the very law that my friend is suggesting we do today. I \nwill predict we will defeat this by a much bigger margin, because of \nthe elections that were just held.\n  I say again, with all respect, anyone who in their heart wants to \ncover pregnant women, which means covering the child they are carrying, \nshould be very proud of this bill. Because that is what we do. So to \nstand up here and say we have to codify George Bush's wording on this, \nwhich was ``unborn child,'' saying if we do not pass this amendment, \npregnant women and their babies are not covered, this is a straw man or \na straw person. Pregnant women are covered. The fetus is covered from \nthe minute that woman goes to the doctor until the minute she gives \nbirth, and through all of those times in between. It is the ability of \nthe States to do it. But we refuse in this bill, and I hope we will \ncontinue this, to put forward such a divisive issue and an argument \nthat does not belong on this bill.\n  If my friend was right, if he stood up here and said, right now \npregnant women are not covered, I would go over there and say, well, \nlet's work out some wording to make sure they are covered. But we do \nnot have to do that. They are covered.\n  What my friend wants is to codify what George Bush put into play, a \npolitical decision to inject abortion politics into a children's health \nbill. I think it is a sad day for the children of this country to be \ndrawn into a debate. And, again, mentioning my State several times, \nwhen my State had no choice. If they wanted to cover pregnant women, \nthey had to cover them under this. Guess what. Now they will not have \nto do it, because this bill corrects the problem.\n  So I have to say, when my friend says it is a left-right debate, it \nhas nothing do with left-right, and he knows it. In my State, some of \nthe strongest pro-choice constituents are Republicans, and some of the \nstrongest pro-life constituents are Democrats. This is not a left-right \nissue. It is an issue we all address in our own way using our own \nlogic, our religion, our moral values, and we come to a conclusion.\n  Do not inject it into this bill. I hope we reject this, because this \nis now the second abortion-related amendment my Republican friends have \noffered in as many days. If that is what they think this election was \nabout, I think they are missing something. People want our kids to have \nhealth care. They want our families to have health care. They want to \nsolve the economic problems.\n  Today we learned there are even more jobless claims. Millions of \npeople are unemployed. And we are having our second abortion-related \nvote. I think if this party, this Grand Old Party does that, I see \nseveral colleagues who may say, well, it is your right, it is your \nprivilege, I will debate you. I think we will prevail today.\n  But if every single bill we bring forward turns into an abortion-\nrelated debate, I do not know where my colleagues are coming from. \nBecause let me reiterate, every pregnant woman has the right to have \nthis health care option should their State choose it.\n  We do not need to change the language and codify a very divisive \namendment which was a regulation under George Bush. It should be a new \nday around here. We should not have to have this division. But I have \nalready heard they may offer more abortion-related amendments on this \nchildren's bill.\n  Who knows what is to come? But you know what, I think my leader, \nHarry Reid, is right. Let them come at us with these amendments. Let \nthe American people see the priorities, when everyone knows every \npregnant woman is eligible for coverage. To now indicate they are not \nunless my friend's amendment passes is simply, if I could say, an out \nand out falsehood. It is not true. It is not true.\n\n  I have the bill. I will read the section, if my friend needs me to.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the last two votes we \nhad on this very same subject where those trying to inject the abortion \nissue failed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n        U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 110th Congress--2nd Session\n\n       As compiled through Senate LIS by the Senate Bill Clerk \n     under the direction of the Secretary of the Senate.\n\n\n                              Vote Summary\n\n       Question: On the Amendment (Boxer Amdt.

Again, I want my colleagues to understand, we are \ndebating a children's health care bill. Happily, I can say every \npregnant woman in this country is eligible for health care. It is a \nwonderful thing. We avoid the divisive language of my friend's \namendment which is codifying something George Bush put into place. It \nwas not supported in the Senate. It was not supported twice. I respect \nhis right to offer it as many times as he wants and let the American \npeople see what we are debating. My State wanted so much to cover \npregnant women, they said: We will go along with this language. But now \nthey will not have to. They don't have to get engaged in an abortion \ndebate, when you are serving children. I view this, frankly, as a \nneedless debate. If the issue is covering pregnant women and their \nchildren, we have taken care of it. If this amendment is about \ninjecting abortion and when life begins, it definitely succeeds.\n  I hope the Senate will speak loudly and clearly, regardless of how \none feels about when life begins because that is not a partisan issue. \nEverybody comes\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\nto their own conclusion. This is an attempt to inject the abortion \ndebate into a children's health care bill. It is diversionary. It is \nunnecessary. We should be so proud this bill covers every pregnant \nwoman. It is one of those moments we could walk down the aisle together \nsaying isn't it wonderful because pregnant women will get health care. \nThat will lead to healthier children. We all know that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is not an injection of abortion into \nthe debate. This is a children's health bill. I was the original author \nof the one that worked so well for over 10 years. A raft of States have \ndetermined that they should take care of the unborn through their CHIP \nprograms. It is not an issue of abortion. In the world view of those \nwho support abortion, the fact is, they don't want to give recognition \nto the unborn child. That is their right, if they want to feel that \nway. I think it is ridiculous. It is unspiritual. It is ignoring life \nitself. But to make that part of this debate is the wrong thing to do. \nWe are trying to protect children.\n  The distinguished Senator from California said: All women are going \nto be protected by this bill. That is not true. It is a state option so \nthey are covered only if a State decides to cover low-income, pregnant \nwomen. We want to make sure that if the state has the option to not \njust cover the woman but the unborn child as well. Anybody with brains \nought to want to do that and ought to avoid the whole issue of \nabortion, which I am trying to do by protecting the mother and the \nunborn child and codifying the 2002 regulation.\n  Section 111 of the bill says there is a State option to cover low-\nincome pregnant women under CHIP through a State plan amendment. Some \nStates have chosen to do that. But why not recognize the rights of the \nunborn child? To try and make this into an abortion debate because they \njust don't believe the unborn child lives is another thing. The point \nof my amendment is to ensure States continue to have the option in the \nfuture to cover unborn children, plain and simple, without any \nambiguity. We codify the 2002 regulation into law. Frankly, it is about \ntime we do things like that in a children's health bill. But to make \nthis abortion argument is--I hate to say it--completely wrong.\n  I am concerned not only with mothers, but I am also concerned about \nthose unborn children who deserve the best health we can give them. My \namendment gives the States the right to do that by codifying this \nimportant regulation. I know some supporters of abortion rights are \nafraid this will legitimize the fact that the unborn child is alive and \nis a human being. That is another argument. I agree that argument is \nright; that unborn child is alive, it is a living human being inside \nthe mother's womb. The point of when the spirit enters the body is a \nlegitimate question, I suppose, to some. But why would we be afraid to \nprotect the rights of that unborn child? Why would we be afraid to do \nthat? Why are folks so afraid if we legitimize the understanding that \nthis unborn child actually is a living being, that somehow or other it \nis going to destroy their political world? It isn't going to do that.\n  This is a children's health bill. I take a tremendous interest in it. \nI not only want to protect the pregnant woman, I want to protect that \nunborn child. I don't know of any pregnant woman who wants her child \nwho would not want this type of protection. To make this into a bogus \nargument is the wrong thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I want to respond to this, my \nfriend is so eloquent, and he is such a great debater, but I have to \nbring us back to reality. If you are standing here today because you \ncare about kids and you want to make sure pregnant women get all the \nhealth care they need so if there is trouble in the pregnancy, if there \nis a problem--there are so many miraculous things that can be done, and \nI have seen some of those in my own family, the things they can do to \nmake sure a child is healthy. If the purpose of my friend, out of his \nlove for his children and all children, which I know he has--if my \npurpose in supporting this bill is to make sure children are healthy, \nif that is our purpose, we could be very proud of this bill.\n  This bill says--and I will reiterate this as long as I have to--every \nsingle poor pregnant woman in America today is eligible for health care \nduring her pregnancy, from the first day to the last day. Then, of \ncourse, a poor child would continue to get that health care. So anyone \nelse who says that isn't true simply hasn't read the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record, so my friend can't \nsay something that is without rebuttal, page 50 of the bill, section \n2112, which talks about low-income pregnant women to be covered through \na State plan amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Subtitle B--Focus on Low-Income Children and Pregnant Women\n\n     SEC. 111.

and\n       `(B) for children under 19 years of age under this title \n     (or title XIX) that is at least 200 percent of the poverty \n     line applicable to a family of the size involved.\n       `(2) No chip income eligibility level for pregnant women \n     lower than the state's medicaid level.--The State does not \n     apply an effective income level for pregnant women under the \n     State plan amendment that is lower than the effective income \n     level (expressed as a percent of the poverty line and \n     considering applicable income disregards) specified under \n     subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(III), (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), or \n     (l)(1)(A) of section 1902, on the date of enactment of this \n     paragraph to be eligible for medical assistance as a pregnant \n     woman.\n       `(3) No coverage for higher income pregnant women without \n     covering lower income pregnant women.--The State does not \n     provide coverage for pregnant women with higher family income \n     without covering pregnant women with a lower family income.\n       `(4) Application of requirements for coverage of targeted \n     low-income children.--The State provides pregnancy-related \n     assistance for targeted low-income pregnant women in the same \n     manner, and subject to the same requirements, as the State \n     provides child health assistance for targeted low-income \n     children under the State child health plan, and in \n     addition to providing child health assistance for such \n     women.\n       `(5) No preexisting condition exclusion or waiting \n     period.--The State does not apply any exclusion of benefits \n     for pregnancy-related assistance based on any preexisting \n     condition or any waiting period (including any waiting period \n     imposed to carry out section 2102(b)(3)(C)) for receipt of \n     such assistance.\n       `(6) Application of cost-sharing protection.--The State \n     provides pregnancy-related assistance to a targeted low-\n     income woman consistent with the cost-sharing protections \n     under section 2103(e) and applies the limitation on total \n     annual aggregate cost sharing imposed under paragraph (3)(B) \n     of such section to the family of such a woman.\n       `(7) No waiting list for children.--The State does not \n     impose, with respect to the enrollment under the State child \n     health plan of targeted low-income children during the \n     quarter, any enrollment cap or other numerical limitation on \n     enrollment, any waiting list, any procedures designed to \n     delay the consideration of applications for enrollment, or \n     similar limitation with respect to enrollment.\n       `(c) Option to provide presumptive eligibility.--A State \n     that elects the option under subsection (a) and satisfies the \n     conditions described in subsection (b) may elect to apply \n     section 1920 (relating to presumptive eligibility for \n     pregnant women) to the State child health plan in the same \n     manner as such section applies to the State plan under title \n     XIX.\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n       `(d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       `(1) Pregnancy-related assistance.--The term `pregnancy-\n     related assistance' has the meaning given the term `child \n     health assistance' in section 2110(a) with respect to an \n     individual during the period described in paragraph (2)(A).\n       `(2) Targeted low-income pregnant woman.--The term \n     `targeted low-income pregnant woman' means an individual--\n       `(A) during pregnancy and through the end of the month in \n     which the 60-day period (beginning on the last day of her \n     pregnancy) ends;\n       `(B) whose family income exceeds 185 percent (or, if \n     higher, the percent applied under subsection (b)(1)(A)) of \n     the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved, \n     but does not exceed the income eligibility level established \n     under the State child health plan under this title for a \n     targeted low-income child;

Let no one stand and say that unless we support the \namendment of the Senator from Utah, a pregnant woman and the child she \nis carrying will not get coverage. That is false. What my friend wants \nis to codify George Bush's regulation that he correctly pointed out my \nState adopted. Why did my State adopt it? They were forced to adopt it \nif they wanted to cover pregnant women. They had to use that language \nof the unborn child. This is all about the abortion debate. It has to \nbe. Under this bill I support, every pregnant woman is covered or is \neligible for coverage. Under the amendment my friend is offering today, \nevery pregnant woman would be eligible. So it is just about the \nlanguage. That is the fact.\n  Let me repeat that. Under the bill, every pregnant poor woman is \neligible for coverage. Under the amendment of my friend, every poor \npregnant woman is eligible for coverage. What he insists on is that you \nhave to separate the woman from the child she is carrying in order to \nmake a political point about when life begins. This is not the \nappropriate time to have that debate. Believe me, I look forward to the \ndebate. We have had it on the Senate floor. Tom Harkin had an amendment \na couple of times to say that Roe v. Wade ought to be codified. It \nshould not be overturned. We had votes on that. By the way, we did win \nthat vote. But that is not what this is about. This is about making \nsure every pregnant woman gets coverage. Instead of being happy about \nit, my friend is agitated about the language and wants to write it in \nhis way so we can then get into a debate about when life begins.\n  How you would ever separate a pregnant woman from the child she is \ncarrying goes against nature. I have had two kids. I know. It is all \nabout health care to the pregnant woman. When the child is born, it is \nabout health care to the woman and, yes, the baby. My friend can stand \nhere all he wants and say I am the one who is injecting abortion into \nthis debate. I am not the one offering a divisive amendment. I am not \nthe one raising the subject matter of when a fetus is a separate life \nfrom the mother. That is for another time. We have work to do. We have \npeople struggling in this country. My friend attacked the stimulus \nbill.\n  By the way, that debate is coming as well. But the one area I know we \nshould be able to work together on is making sure our kids are healthy. \nWe should walk down the aisle together being very pleased we have taken \ncare of that in this bill. Believe me, the more people lose their jobs \nand they can't get another one, the more this program is going to be \nnecessary.\n  I hope we can have a vote on this in the near future. I guess I would \nlike to ask my friend if he wants to continue this debate. I can stay \nall day. But I didn't know what his plan was.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't want to continue it all day. I do believe there \nare some people who want to speak on this side. I will just make one or \ntwo comments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor at this time and retain my right to \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let's not pit mothers against their \nchildren. This is not an either/or situation. Let's protect both \nmothers and their unborn children. In fact, the purpose of this bill is \nto provide health care coverage to low income, uninsured children. The \nSenator and I simply disagree. This amendment concerns unborn children \nand covering them. She seems to think it is about abortion. I don't. \nHer own State is covering unborn children through the regulation of the \nprior administration. Thirteen other States are as well.\n  Mr. President, I think I have made the case. Let me say that I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Robert Casey be also listed as a prime \ncosponsor on this amendment, along with the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I feel very blessed to have these two very strong \nDemocrats willing to support a recognition that these unborn kids are \nhuman beings, they are human life, and that a child health insurance \nprogram bill ought to cover them.\n  With that, Mr. President, I know Senator Bunning is here and I will \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might have a moment before Senator \nBunning speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. Because some of the things that \nare said around here--and, by the way, we will have a whole list of \nRepublicans helping us to defeat this, so I am\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\nnot going to name people. But let me say this: To stand up and say we \nare pitting a woman against her child when we support this bill that \nmakes eligible for coverage every pregnant woman is simply a hurtful \nand untrue remark, especially to say it to someone who adores her \nchildren and her grandkids, and I take great offense. It is the \nopposite.\n  This amendment separates a woman from her child because instead of \nsaying you are going to cover a pregnant women, you are saying you are \ncovering the unborn child. And what about the woman? She is not even \nmentioned. I take offense at that line of attack.\n  We say when you cover a pregnant woman, you cover her child, you \ncover that fetus from the moment that woman goes to get health care. \nWhat my friend does is separate the woman from her child by saying we \nare going to give the child health care while the child is in the womb \nand do not even mention the woman--do not even mention the woman. So \nwho is separating the woman from her child?\n  Again, it is very clear that this is about the abortion debate. And \nas many times as my friend says it--and he raises my State again, so \nlet me say again, yes, many States did provide health care under this \ndefinition of unborn child. They had no choice because President Bush \nput a regulation in place, and if my State wanted to help pregnant \nwomen, they had no choice but to help them under that particular \nregulation.\n  Well, what we are doing today is saying to States: You do not have to \nget into the abortion debate. If a woman is poor and she is eligible \nfor Medicaid, and she is pregnant, she gets the health care as well as \nthe baby she is carrying.\n  So do not say that those of us who vote against this amendment are \nseparating women and children. It is the total opposite. For whatever \nreason, under that old regulation, the child was mentioned and not the \nwoman. That defies science. That defies reality. You treat the woman \nand the child she is carrying.\n  So, again, I take offense at this. I do not want to be jumping up \nevery time, but I will if there is something said here that is not \ntrue. I have total respect for the other side on the abortion debate--\ncomplete respect for them. And that is what this is about, and they \nknow it. Because if they only cared about the pregnant woman and her \nchild, they are taken care of in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank you very much, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am not entering into this debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hatch's amendment \nbe set aside so that I may offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is set aside.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 74\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 74.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 74.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To eliminate any exceptions to the prohibition on States \n receiving an enhanced Federal matching rate for providing coverage to \n children whose family income exceeds 300 percent of the poverty line \n     and to use the savings for the outreach and enrollment grant)\n\n       Beginning on page 75, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through page 76, line 2, and insert the following:\n       ``(B) Increased funding for outreach and enrollment \n     grants.--\n       ``(i) Appropriation.--In addition to amounts appropriated \n     under subsection (g) of section 2113 for the period of fiscal \n     years 2009 through 2013, there is appropriated, out of any \n     money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the amount \n     described in clause (ii), for the purpose of the Secretary \n     awarding grants under that section.\n       ``(ii) Amount described.--The amount described in this \n     clause is the amount equal to the amount of additional \n     Federal funds that the Director of the Congressional Budget \n     Office certifies would have been expended for the period \n     beginning April 1, 2009, and ending September 30, 2013, if \n     subparagraph (A) did not apply to any State that, on the date \n     of enactment of the Children's Health Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2009, has an approved State plan \n     amendment or waiver to provide, or has enacted a State law to \n     submit a State plan amendment to provide, expenditures \n     described in such subparagraph under the State child health \n     plan.''.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCollins from Maine and Senator Hatch from Utah be added as cosponsors \nto this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I appreciate their support.\n  When SCHIP was created, I supported the bill and felt it filled a \nneed in our health care system. The bill focused on providing health \ninsurance to low-income children whose parents made too much money to \nqualify for Medicaid but did not have private health insurance.\n  Many States have done a good job of keeping the focus of their SCHIP \nprograms on low-income children, including Kentucky that only covers \nchildren below 200 percent of poverty. However, other States have \nexpanded their SCHIP programs to cover children in families most of us \nwould not consider low income. Some States are even covering adults, \nincluding parents and childless adults. These expansions erode the \noriginal intent of the program.\n  The Baucus SCHIP bill we are considering today further expands the \nSCHIP program, including allowing States to cover children in families \nup to 300 percent of the poverty level. That is $66,000 of income a \nyear for a family of four.\n  Personally, I think 300 percent is too high for SCHIP, and the focus \nof this reauthorization bill should be reaching those kids who are \ncurrently eligible for the program but are not enrolled.\n  The Baucus bill also allows States choosing to cover children above \n300 percent of poverty to still get Federal money for their efforts but \nonly at their lower Medicaid matching rate, not the higher SCHIP \nmatching rate.\n  Two States--2 out of 50--however, get a special exemption under this \nbill and will get their higher SCHIP matching rate for covering \nchildren above 300 percent of poverty, specifically New York and New \nJersey.\n  New York wants to cover families up to 400 percent of poverty or that \nis $88,000 a year for a family of four. New Jersey currently covers \nfamilies up to 350 percent of poverty or $77,000 a year for a family of \nfour.\n  These are certainly not low-income families, and I feel strongly the \nStates should not get additional Federal money for covering families \nmaking up to $88,000 a year.\n  My amendment is fairly simple. It simply removes this exemption for \nNew York and New Jersey so they have to play by the same rules all the \nother 48 States play by. If they go above 300 percent of poverty, they \nget their Medicaid matching rate but not the higher SCHIP rate.\n  As I have said, I think 300 percent is too high, and if I were \nwriting the bill, I certainly would not allow States to get any Federal \nmoney if they were covering families over 300 percent of poverty. \nHowever, that is not the bill before us. So my amendment tries to \nequalize the playing field between the 50 States and be a little more \nfiscally responsible with taxpayers' dollars.\n  Under my amendment, New York and New Jersey can still choose to cover \nchildren above 300 percent, they just will not get the higher SCHIP \nmatching rate. If the people in New York and New Jersey want to cover \nfamilies making up to $88,000 a year, they should be the ones paying \nfor the coverage, not requiring my citizens in Kentucky and other \ncitizens in all the other 48 States across America to foot the bill.\n  Finally, my amendment takes the savings from reimbursing New York and \nNew Jersey at the Medicaid matching rate and directs that money to more \noutreach and enrollment dollars so we can get everybody who is eligible \nfor SCHIP enrolled. We are having difficulty doing that. Kentucky only \nhas 85 percent. I do not know how much some of the other States have. \nBut we ought to be able to get to 100 percent of coverage. The other \nmoney that is saved by that would allow them to seek out those eligible \nchildren under SCHIP.\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\n  The SCHIP reauthorization should be about making sure low-income \nchildren who are eligible for SCHIP are covered, not about covering \nchildren in families making up to $88,000 a year.\n  So with my amendment, you have two options: more money for outreach \nand enrollment and requiring all States to play by the same rules or \nrequiring the people of your State to pay more taxes so that New York \nand New Jersey can cover families who make $77,000 or $88,000 a year.\n  To me, the choice is simple, and I hope the other Members of the \nSenate can support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the distinguished \nSenator's amendment. I am proud of him and very pleased to support his \namendment on New York and New Jersey, and I rise in support of that \nBunning amendment. He is right. Why on Earth should States be rewarded \nby getting a higher CHIP match rate for covering kids over 300 percent \nof the Federal poverty level? That is around $64,000 for a family of \nfour.\n  Now, when we wrote the CHIP bill in 1997, with Senators Kennedy, \nRockefeller, and Chafee, CHIP was created to cover children of the \nworking poor, the only ones left out of the whole financial system--not \nchildren from families of four whose income is $77,000 like New \nJersey's CHIP program or $88,000 like the CHIP waiver the state of New \nYork has filed. And that does not even count some of the income \ndisregards that may raise the income level to over $100,000. It is \nridiculous.\n  My colleague is right. Senator Bunning is right. These two States \nshould not receive the higher CHIP matching rate. I strongly support my \ncolleague's amendment, and I congratulate him for bringing it to the \nfloor. I hope our colleagues will work to support that amendment \nbecause it makes a lot of sense.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sessions be added \nas a cosponsor to the Hatch amendment No. 80.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the CHIP \nReauthorization Act, and to urge my colleagues to improve CHIP and \ncover an additional 4.1 million kids.\n  I voted to create this program in 1997, and I have watched with great \nsatisfaction as the number of uninsured children in our country has \ndropped. Thanks to CHIP, my State can provide health insurance to about \n11,000 kids every month. As a result, these kids have every chance to \ndo their best in school and live long, healthy, productive lives.\n  This is a great achievement, but we have more work to do. South \nDakota still has about 18,000 uninsured kids. Half of these kids meet \nthe income requirements for Medicaid and CHIP but remain uninsured. \nWith health insurance premiums doubling in the past 8 years and \nunemployment on the rise, more families cannot keep up. Fortunately, \nthis bill helps these families when they need it the most and allows \nStates to cover more kids and provides bonus payments for focusing on \nlow-income kids. I am especially pleased that the bill allows children \nwhose private insurance does not include dental coverage to enroll in \nthe CHIP dental program.\n\n  I understand some of my colleagues object to allowing States to end \nthe 5-year waiting period for covered legal immigrant children and \npregnant women in Medicaid and CHIP. This debate is not about whether \nto provide coverage but, rather, to end the 5-year wait these future \ncitizens must endure. A sick child does not have 5 years to wait, and \nit is not in the spirit of our Founding Fathers to force legal \nimmigrants to wait 5 years for services they desperately need. I urge \nmy colleagues to remember that other than Native Americans, we are a \nnation of immigrants.\n  On a personal note, I am pleased to join in the debate on CHIP this \nyear, as I missed much of the 2007 debate while recovering from my AVM. \nThat experience taught me the infinite value of good health insurance \nand great health care, a lesson from which I hope we can all learn.\n  This bill, which is fully paid for over the reauthorization period, \nis exactly what low-income families need during this time of economic \nuncertainty. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the CHIP \nReauthorization Act.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 47\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that children do not lose their private insurance \n    and that uninsured children can get access to private insurance)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last night, Senator Coburn sought to bring \nup his amendment No. 47. At that time, we asked him to withhold so we \nmight look at the amendment because we neglected to get the Coburn \namendment No. 47 until that moment. He spoke on the amendment. We have \nlooked at the amendment. So on behalf of Senator Coburn, I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendments be temporarily laid aside \nand that Senator Coburn's amendment No. 47 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. Coburn, for \n     himself and Mr. Thune, proposes an amendment numbered 47.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, January 27, 2009 \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan \nbe recognized for 5 minutes and then Senator Grassley, who I expect \nwill be here at that time, be recognized for up to 10 minutes, and then \nI will be recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are debating the subject of children's \nhealth care at a time when our economy is in desperate trouble. Most \nall of us understand that 20,000 people today and 20,000 people \ntomorrow will have lost their jobs. Think of that. We are experiencing \n20,000 people a day losing their jobs in this country right now during \nthis economic difficulty. It was one thing at a time when the folks at \nthe bottom of the economic ladder had a job and then had to worry about \nthe issues understanding second job, second shift, second mortgage. But \nnow it is not even that. Now they do not have a job at all.\n  Last month, over half a million people lost their jobs. As that \nhappens, the question is about the necessities of life. How do you \nprovide for the necessities of life? How about your children's health \ncare?\n  I don't know what is second or third in everybody's life. I don't \nknow what might be in second, third or fourth place in people's lives. \nBut I know what ought to be in first place, and is for most people, and \nthat is their children, their well-being, the health of their children.\n  This legislation deals with that subject, trying to provide health \ncare to children who do not have health care, expanding the number of \nchildren under the Children's Health Insurance Program. Nearly seven \nmillion children are now enrolled. This expands it.\n\n[[Page S1017]]\n\nFour million additional children who do not have health care would \nreceive health care under this expansion. It makes a lot of sense.\n  In my State, we have 3,500 children receiving benefits under the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. There are another 14,000 who are \nuninsured in North Dakota. So surely this ought to represent one of the \nsignificant priorities for the children of our country and for the \nchildren of our individual States.\n  I have come to the floor talking a lot about health care for American \nIndians. I have put up a couple charts on the floor talking about Avis \nLittle Wind. She lost her life. I have talked about Ta'Shon Rain Little \nLight. She was 6 years old. She lost her life.\n  The fact is, these are children for whom we would expect health care \nwould be available, and it was not. Multiply that by a million or 10 \nmillion children who determine whether their health care needs are met \nwhen they are sick by whether their parents have money in their \npockets. That ought not be a criteria by which we treat sick children \nin this country ever--not ever.\n  One hundred years from now, we will all be gone and historians will \nlook back and evaluate us--who we were, what we did, what our values \nwere if you take a look at what we decided to spend money on, what kind \nof a budget did we have. Historians 100 years from now can take a look \nback and evaluate, at least in part, what our value system was. What \ndid we think was important? What was valuable to us? What was most \nimportant to us?\n  The question that is begged by this legislation is, Are our children \nimportant to us? Do we care about our children's health? Don't tell me \nchildren are important if you are not willing to do almost anything \nnecessary to provide for your children's health.\n  We must do this. This is not difficult. A lot of issues come to the \nfloor of the Senate that are difficult and complicated and complex. You \nhave to try to evaluate all the nuances to try to figure how do we put \nthis together. This is not any of that. This is not difficult in terms \nof the mechanics, how it works. We know it works. It is not difficult \nin terms of the value system. Can you name two other things we do on \nthe floor of the Senate that are more important than preserving the \nhealth of our children or treating a sick child who has no other \noptions to get treatment or go to a doctor or go to a health clinic? \nName something more important than that for your children or for the \nchildren you love.\n  This is not difficult, and we should not make it difficult. What we \nought to decide is that this is a priority for this country. It is a \nlong-delayed priority. We passed it twice, and President George W. Bush \nvetoed it twice. But its delay ought not concern us at this moment. \nWhat ought concern us now is that we move and move quickly to address \nthis problem and say to America's children: You rank at the top of our \npriorities, yes, in our personal lives and also in our public lives. \nYou rank at the top, and we are going to provide health care to \nAmerica's children who are uninsured.\n  That ought to represent the best of our country and the best of what \nwe can do in both political parties that serve in the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for up to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for the benefit of my Members, I do not \nthink I will use 10 minutes, but it is always dangerous for me to say \nthat.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley and Mr. Levin pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 344 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, the SCHIP legislation the Senate is \nconsidering this week purports to provide more health insurance for our \nNation's poorest children. But in truth, the bill shortchanges the \nneediest of children in States such as Mississippi. Instead of paying \ntaxpayer dollars for our poorest children, those who need health \ninsurance the most, the bill we are considering today gives taxpayer-\nfunded health insurance to middle-class families in wealthy States. The \nSCHIP bill we will be voting on today does nothing to ensure that all \nAmerican children under 200 percent of the poverty level have health \ninsurance. In fact, the bill diverts this important program, which I \nhave supported for years, away from its intended purpose. SCHIP was \ndesigned to cover low-income children between 100 percent and 200 \npercent of the poverty level. That comes to $22,000 to $44,000 per year \nfor a family of four. These families require assistance under SCHIP \nbecause they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but they are not \nable to afford private health coverage for their children. This was the \nintent of SCHIP.\n\n  What we ought to be doing in this bill is prioritizing low-income \nAmerican children and making sure as many uninsured poor kids as \npossible are covered under the increased funding we are going to \nprovide. Instead, this bill allows States to expand their programs \nwithout demonstrating they have covered the poorest children first. In \nmy State of Mississippi, for example, SCHIP covers 65,000 children, but \nthere are another 30,000 children below 200 percent of the poverty \nlevel who are without health insurance. This bill would not cover those \nchildren, even with the expanded funding.\n  Other States that are similarly situated include Iowa, Nebraska, \nNorth Dakota, North Carolina, and Arkansas. I urge the Senators from \nthose States to join me in an effort to correct this inequity. I urge \nall Senators to make this bill better so we make sure we include \npoorest of the poor children first.\n  In the past decade since SCHIP was created, the number of uninsured \npoor children has decreased from 28 percent to 15 percent. But we \ncannot, in the face of that success story, neglect the remaining 15 \npercent. Many of them are in the States I have mentioned.\n  Fifteen percent of America's poorest children still do not have \nhealth care, and we are debating a bill that would expand SCHIP beyond \nits intended purpose, to cover higher income families and other adults.\n  SCHIP allotments in fiscal year 2009 will be $5 billion. Under this \nbill we would almost double that amount to $9 billion per year. But \nonly an additional $79 million is needed to cover these poor uncovered \nchildren in States such as Mississippi. If we are going to almost \ndouble the size of the program, we ought to make sure poorest of the \npoor are covered.\n  If this bill were really about health care for poor children, we \nwould guarantee each State sufficient funds to cover every child in a \nfamily below 200 percent of the poverty level. It is that simple. And \nwe would do that before moving on to cover more affluent families in \nthe more affluent States.\n  Senator Cochran and I have submitted an amendment that would do that. \nOur amendment would prohibit States from receiving funds to cover \nindividuals above 200 percent of the poverty level until we can \nguarantee that 90 percent--not 100 percent but 90 percent--of the \npoorest children nationwide are covered.\n  The result of our amendment would be that the more affluent States \nwould simply have to wait if they want to cover middle-class children, \nif they want to cover families making as much as $88,000 a year or \nmore. They would have to wait until the poorest of the poor children in \nMississippi and Arkansas and North Carolina and North Dakota and \nNebraska and Iowa are covered.\n  I have been watching the votes this week. It appears the leadership \nhas locked in a majority to resist amendments of this nature. I thought \nthe bill was about making it easier to cover children under 200 percent \nof the poverty level--between 100 percent and 200 percent. If \namendments such as that of Senator Cochran and myself are not agreed \nto, we have to wonder is the real intent of this legislation to replace \nour private health care system with a government-run system at the \nexpense of people who need help the most?\n  One of my colleagues yesterday said we are ruining SCHIP. I have to \nconcur with that, if this legislation is not amended. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in bringing the focus of SCHIP back where it \nbelongs, on helping poor children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S1018]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise in full support of renewing and \nimproving the Children's Health Insurance Program. In Arkansas we know \nthis program as ARKids First, Part B. In my part of the country, the \nprogram ensures that low-income children get the doctor visits and \nmedicines they need when they are sick and the checkups they need when \nthey are healthy. This program has been highly effective, and I believe \nthe bill before us will build upon that success.\n  Let me tell one story. In 2007, this program covered more than 64,000 \nArkansas children and more than 4.4 million children nationally. There \nis a young boy named Connar in a little town called Poyen, AR. Poyen is \nin Grant County. The population of the whole town is 272 people. It is \non a State highway--229--in part of our State that is challenged in \ngetting health care to its citizens. At 5 years old, he had very \nserious hearing problems. He underwent multiple surgeries to restore \nhis hearing. Without the Children's Health Insurance Program, his \ngrandmother would have never been able to afford the appointments and \nmedical care. The good news is, today, after these surgeries and after \nhis treatment, he has overcome his hearing loss and his related \ndevelopmental delays.\n  What that means is he will now be able to enter kindergarten with \nother kids his age. We prepared him for a lifetime of success through \nthis program. That means he will not have to have special education, he \nwill not have to have other programs available to him for him to \nfunction in society. We made the downpayment on his future with the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  But he is lucky because that same year, 2007, there were 9.4 million \nchildren who went without access to doctors, lifesaving prescription \ndrugs, immunizations, preventive screenings, and the basic medical care \nthey need. That is 1 out of every 9 children in this country who \nslipped through the cracks between Medicaid and private insurance.\n  Since then, since 2007, pink slips have multiplied and, more than \never, parents are making the tough decision to provide their family \nwith a roof over their heads and forgo health care coverage. When these \nkids don't get medicine and proper medical care, we see them in \nemergency rooms in a lot of pain and at a greater cost to the taxpayer.\n  As you know, there have been studies--one I am familiar with in the \nState of Arizona, but there have been many other studies--that compare \nwhat this program costs to the cost of not having the program. It is \nactually cheaper to the taxpayer, much cheaper to society in the big \npicture to have this program get these kids the medical care they need \nwhen they need it.\n  This body will have an important vote to cast this week that will \ndetermine who will see a doctor and who will not. Will children such as \nConnar receive the critical care they need or will we abandon them, \nabandon him like we have 9 million others?\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to turn this moral \nissue into an ideological debate. Children deserve a healthy start in \nlife regardless of the parents' wealth. Senators Baucus and Rockefeller \nhave produced a compassionate and cost-effective bill that provides \nthis opportunity for millions of children. That is what I want for the \nchildren in my State of Arkansas and for the children of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a few moments ago the Senator from \nMississippi, Senator Wicker, offered an amendment. Basically, it is \ndirected at the so-called August 17, 2007, directive that President \nBush promulgated. That directive issued strict guidelines to States \nregarding Children's Health Insurance Program enrollment, focusing on \npotential crowdout, and mandated that States adopt more restrictive so-\ncalled crowdout policies. Among the policies in that August 17 \ndirective was a requirement that the States prove that at least 95 \npercent of the children below 200 percent of the poverty level have \nsome coverage before they can enroll higher income children. The \namendment offered by the Senator from Mississippi would, in the same \nvein, prohibit States from receiving the Federal match for individuals \nunder the program above 200 percent of the Federal level unless they \nenrolled 90 percent of all children under 200 percent.\n  That is an impossibly high standard, one that cannot be met. \nCertainly, the 95 percent in the August 17 directive could not be met. \nThat is why that directive was never put into effect.\n  It is too tight. It would not work. Yesterday, this body voted \nagainst an amendment which would set the requirement at 80 percent, and \nthe amendment before us sets the requirement not at 80 percent but a \nmuch higher rate; that is, 90 percent. These are impossible standards \nfor States to meet. It is virtually impossible for a State to meet 90 \npercent. Even mandatory provisions--let's take auto insurance. The \ntakeup rate in States is not 90 percent. Even where it is 90 percent, I \nthink the average is like in the eighties somewhere. This is not \nmandatory. The CHIP program is not mandatory. It is an optional program \nfor States. It is optional whether a person wants to participate in \nCHIP or participate in the private market. It is totally optional. So \nit is impossible for a State to achieve a 90-percent rate. That is a \nstandard which is much too high.\n  Also, another reason it is so difficult for States to reach a 90-\npercent rate is because of the economic downturn we are facing. With \nthe downturn we are facing, people are leaving employment, regrettably, \nthey are being laid off, which means they are losing health insurance. \nThe more people who are laid off, the more people lose health \ninsurance, the more difficult it is for a State to show that it is \nmeeting a 90-percent requirement.\n  That is just a mechanical effect of this amendment. The practical and \npersonal effect is that this is going to hurt kids because the \namendment has the effect of denying Federal dollars to States when they \ncannot meet an impossibly high so-called takeup rate. Therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues to not vote for this amendment. It is not a good idea.\n  It does try to attempt to address something called crowdout, which \nhas been debated here on the floor for a long time. Frankly, this \ncrowdout debate is missing the mark here. We are not keeping our eye on \nthe ball. The ball really is, how do we get more kids covered under the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program?\n  For all of the reasons Senators have indicated, my gosh, we want our \nkids to be healthy. Healthy kids go to school. Healthy kids in school \nperform better in school. If they perform better in school, they are \ngoing to do better when they graduate. We want healthy kids. The more \nwe have healthy kids, the more likely it is we are going to have \nhealthy families and more productive families and be able to address \nsome of the adverse consequences the recession now presents to us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, or what folks around here call \nSCHIP. This program was created by a Republican Congress in 1997 to \nhelp low-income kids get health insurance. The program expired in 2007, \nand Congress has worked to pass temporary extensions through March of \nthis year. I am glad the Senate is now working on a longer term bill to \nextend this vital program.\n  I am a cosponsor and a strong supporter of the ``Kids First Act,'' S. \n326, which extends the current SCHIP program. This bill provides health \ncoverage to low-income kids and will give\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\nStates the resources they need to continue to operate their SCHIP \nprograms.\n  To help more low-income children get health coverage, the bill \nprovides $400 million over the next 4.5 years for States and other \nqualified entities to improve outreach and enrollment for low-income \nchildren. These funds will target the low-income children SCHIP was \nmeant to help. The bill also enhances private options that provide more \naffordable and efficient care by encouraging premium assistance so that \nparents can have enough money for private health insurance for their \nchildren.\n  The Kids First Act also focuses on kids, not adults. Some States \ncurrently spend SCHIP money on adults when this money was meant for \nchildren. The bill takes the money spent on adults and uses it to \ninsure children. The Kids First Act requires that all States phase out \nnonpregnant adults, including parents, and not allow the addition of \nany new nonpregnant adults to the program.\n  American children are the top priority and primary focus of the bill \nI support. The bill maintains existing law, which ensures that scarce \nresources go to covering American citizens first.\n  The bill does all these things, and it does them in a fiscally \nresponsible way, without raising taxes. An economic recession is no \ntime to raise taxes or expand Government programs and inefficient \nbureaucracies.\n  I have seen the potential for what SCHIP can do to help low-income \nkids in my home State of Wyoming. Wyoming first implemented its SCHIP \nprogram, Kid Care CHIP, in 1999. In 2003, Wyoming formed a public-\nprivate partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming and Delta \nDental of Wyoming to provide the health, vision, and dental benefits to \nnearly 6,000 kids in Wyoming. These partnerships have made Kid Care \nCHIP a very successful program in Wyoming.\n  All children enrolled in the program receive a wide range of benefits \nincluding regular check-ups, immunizations, well-baby and well-child \nvisits, emergency care, prescription drugs, hospital visits, mental \nhealth and substance abuse services, vision benefits, and dental care. \nFamilies share in the cost of their children's health care by paying \ncopayments for a portion of the care provided. These copays are capped \nat $200 a year per family.\n  Wyoming is also engaged in an outreach campaign targeted at finding \nand enrolling the additional 5,000 kids that are eligible for Kid Care \nCHIP but are not enrolled.\n  I am proud of the great job Wyoming is doing implementing its \nprogram. I also want to note that Wyoming will get the same amount of \nmoney under the Kids First Act that I support as compared to Senator \nBaucus' bill, H.R. 2.\n\n  Unfortunately, all these descriptions apply to the Kids First Act, \nwhich is not the bill before us today. The bill before us today is a \nvery partisan bill that fails to focus on low-income, American kids \nfirst.\n  Senator Baucus' bill, H.R. 2, would encourage middle-class families \nto drop their existing health insurance plans and instead get on the \ntaxpayer dime. That is just not right; we need to put low-income \nchildren first.\n  Under H.R. 2, 2.4 million children will lose their private health \ninsurance coverage and be forced to enroll in Government-run programs, \nwhere they may not have access to the physician and other health \nprovider services that they need. The bill will also make it easier for \nboth legal and illegal aliens to get covered under SCHIP.\n  Another important big difference is that the taxpayers will get to \nkeep fewer of their hard-earned dollars if this SCHIP bill is enacted. \nAt a time when the country faces a severe recession, raising taxes is \nnot a good solution for any problem.\n  I am disappointed Senator Baucus and the Democratic leadership in the \nHouse and the Senate and the White House turned SCHIP into a partisan \nexercise. Along with the American people, I too was looking forward to \nchange. I was encouraged by President Obama's call for change and was \nready to work with him to make sure we could focus on the 80 percent we \ncould agree on.\n  I was also encouraged by my discussions with Senator Daschle when he \ncame before my committee as a nominee to become the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services. He committed to working with me and the other \nRepublicans on my committee so together, we could work on a bill to \nreform our health care system. He promised bipartisanship and said he \nwould convince my Democratic colleagues on the committee to work \ntogether to develop bipartisan solutions to our Nation's health care \nproblems.\n  Unfortunately, with this SCHIP bill, the Senate is taking a step away \nfrom the process Senator Daschle described. The ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Grassley, as well as Senators Hatch and \nRoberts, among other members worked hard for a number of years on a \nbipartisan bill, but that bill is not the bill before us today.\n  Rather than following the example set by Senators Grassley, Hatch and \nRoberts, the sponsors of this bill chose to focus on the partisan \nissues that highlight the 20 percent upon which it is impossible to \nagree. I hope this is not the first taste of how the next 2 years will \nbe here in the Senate.\n  I will close my remarks, but I just want to remind folks that we can \ndo better. In general, if we work together on bipartisan bills, we can \nproduce a better product. I think the bill before us today should focus \non covering low-income, American kids first, and I hope that as we \ncontinue working on health care reform, we can work together rather \nthan against each other so we can put the best policies possible before \nthe American people.\n  We can do better, we must do better. Following Wyoming's lead of \nusing the private market, we would insure every American kid whose \nfamily is uninsured and below 300 percent of poverty. I think that is a \ngood answer for the family. We can do it without spending more. We can \ndo it so kids are not thrown out mid-year because their parent or \nparents make a little more. They would be insured all year. So we would \nincrease their eligibility from 200 percent of poverty to 300 percent, \n$40,000 a year to $60,000 a year, for a family of four and cover every \nuninsured American kid. But we will see that amendment voted down so \nstatistics will look better. The current bill is a good statistics \nbill, it increases the number covered dramatically to include adults \nearning up to $120,000 a year in some instances and it is easier to \nfind more people to sign up, at the taxpayer's expense. No, let's \nconcentrate and force States to find the poor that are lost and \nneglected.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 74\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak again on \nbehalf of children of New Jersey and others in the country and the \nworking families in my home State who seem to be under attack by some \nof our colleagues here on the floor. I did not know there are different \nvalues to the importance of the health care of a child regardless of \nthe happenstance of where they live, but it seems some think so.\n  On behalf of these children and families, I rise strongly to object \nto Senator Bunning's amendment. In New Jersey, we cover over 130,000 \nchildren and, yes, we cover children to a higher percentage of the \nFederal poverty level. But there is a reason for that, and I will go \nthrough that right now. But there are only 3,300 New Jersey children \nwho are covered under that higher Federal poverty level from the \n130,000 who are covered below the poverty level Senator Bunning and \nothers would want to maintain. So we are talking about 3,300 children \nbut 3,300 children whose health and development and well-being depend \nupon the ability of States such as New Jersey to do this.\n  The families who are covered at this level are paying toward this. \nThey are not getting a free ride. They are paying $128 each month in \npremiums and between $5 and $35 in copays each and every month. So this \nis not a free ride. These families in New Jersey are working, and they \nare working at some of\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\nthe toughest jobs we have. But they work at jobs in which they do not \nhave health care coverage, and they are working at jobs that do not \ngive them enough in the context of what it costs to live in New Jersey \nto afford health care insurance. So somehow those people have to be \npenalized when you listen to the other side.\n  Now, let me talk to those who want to talk about fairness. New Jersey \nfollowed the law. The former administration approved New Jersey's \nwaiver to continue insuring kids at up to 350 percent of the Federal \npoverty level because they understood the reality that a family living \nin New Jersey--to make essential elements of their costs for housing, \nfood, transportation, childcare, and, yes, insurance--just was far \nbehind others in the Nation who, in fact, could achieve those goals for \na lot less money. So the Bush administration gave a waiver. They gave a \nwaiver. They understood it.\n  New Jersey needs to cover children up to 350 percent because New \nJersey families face higher living costs and they get less return on \ntheir Federal dollar. Let me talk about that. I hear my colleagues \nbemoaning the fact that my State allegedly wants some sort of special \ntreatment, that because we want to provide health benefits to children, \nwe are somehow taking advantage of the Federal Government. That is \nsimply ridiculous.\n  Let me put it in perspective. For every $1 a New Jersey taxpayer pays \nin Federal dollars toward the Federal Government, our State only gets \nback 65 cents. My colleague from Kentucky, who was on the floor and \nwhose amendment we are debating now and who rails about New Jersey--his \nState gets $1.51 for every $1 Kentuckians send to the Federal Treasury. \nSo they get more back than, in fact, they pay.\n  Let's talk about fairness. The reality: One size does not fit all. As \nshown on this chart, for a family in New Jersey, living in Middlesex \nCounty, whose monthly income is about, roughly, $4,600, for their \nhousing, it is going to cost them $1,331; for food, it is about \n$645.70; for childcare, it is $844.80; for their transportation, it is \n$393.80; for their taxes, it is $479; and for their health insurance, \nit is almost $1,800. So what do they end up with? They end up with a \nnegative amount in terms of their budget. These are people who are \nworking--working--trying to sustain their families. But they end up in \nthe negative if they try to provide health insurance for their \nfamilies. So the answer is, they cannot provide health insurance for \ntheir families unless they get some help. Yes, one size does not fit \nall.\n  So let's look at that same family. For that family in New Jersey to \nget the same ability in terms of their purchasing power as a family in \nLouisville, KY, that needs about $55,808--for that same family, whose \nhappenstance is that they live in New Jersey versus Louisville, KY, for \nthe same exact things, they need $77,000, roughly, in purchasing power.\n  Now, why do I have to hear an argument that says those families, in \nfact, whether they be in Kentucky or Arizona or Oklahoma or Georgia or \nTennessee or Utah or in all these other States, who, in fact, deserve \nto have their children covered--they deserve to have their children \ncovered, and I am fighting for their children to be covered as well--\nbut why do I have to listen to that, in fact, their children are more \nvaluable than my children in New Jersey who need this amount of money \nto be able to meet the same goals and dreams and aspirations and health \ncare that they have? So they can get benefits under the bill, but my \nchildren in New Jersey should be denied? That is the core of the \nargument here. One size does not fit all. I would love for a family in \nNew Jersey at $55,000 to be able to make ends meet. That is simply not \nthe fact. So we need to ensure all children are covered within this \nclass.\n  I am simply baffled and I find it embarrassing that some in \nWashington--those who have some of the best health care coverage in the \nworld--would propose to jeopardize coverage to some of America's \nneediest families.\n  In this economy, in this recession, we cannot allow our children to \nbe the silent victims. It is morally wrong to jeopardize the health \ncare of these children. What have they done? What have they done to \ndeserve this? It is even more outrageous during a time when jobs and \nhomes are being taken away from their parents.\n  Where is the moral compass in this Chamber? I hear my colleagues \nspeaking eloquently about how our children are our most precious asset, \nand they certainly are. But they are also our most vulnerable asset. Is \na child in New Jersey worth less than a child in other parts of the \ncountry simply because of the happenstance of where they live and the \ncosts that are necessary in order for them to meet the same quality of \nlife?\n  So I hope my colleagues, as other amendments have been rejected, will \nonce again reject this amendment. This is about being for the value of \nlife. You cannot fulfill your God-given potential if you do not have \ngood health. You cannot say you are profamily when, in fact, you would \ntake away the insurance necessary for that family to be able to realize \ntheir God-given potential. This is about all children, regardless of \nwhere they happen to reside, the happenstance of what station in life \nthey were born into, that if they fall into this criteria that, in \nfact, they should be covered.\n  That is why this amendment should be defeated. I hope, after having \nconsidered amendment after amendment after amendment on the same \nfundamental issue, we can finally move to final passage of this bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as we were completing our last vote last \nnight, I explained to the Members of the Senate what our schedule would \nbe the next few days. Following my statement, Senator Leahy and I \nengaged in a discussion on the Senate floor about the timing for a vote \nfor Attorney General-designee Eric Holder.\n\n  Chairman Leahy expressed an opinion that he and I share: that with \nthe many difficult challenges facing the Obama administration, and \nparticularly the Justice Department, it is imperative for the Senate to \nconfirm Attorney General-designee Holder as soon as possible.\n  Unfortunately, while it was my strong preference to conduct the vote \nthis week--as I explained to Senator Leahy on more than one occasion I \nwas hoping we would do that when we completed work on CHIP, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--I had to inform him that I had a \nconversation just a few minutes before I made my remarks on the floor \nwith Senator McConnell, and Senator McConnell said he didn't want to \nmove forward until Monday. In the conversation with Senator McConnell I \nwas pleasant, as most of our conversations have been, and I believed I \nneeded to explain to the Senate what the proposal was and what we were \nplanning on doing. The one thing I didn't do is explain to Senator \nLeahy first--and I should have done that--that we weren't going to be \nable to complete it after the Children's Health Insurance Program--on \nthe same day at least; we would have to wait and do it later because in \nthe Senate the power of the minority is significant.\n  I have privately discussed this with Chairman Leahy, that it was an \noversight on my part. He wasn't informed of the arrangement I had \nreached with Senator McConnell before I announced it on the Senate \nfloor. So I apologize to my friend from Vermont, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. He has been a good friend, he and Marcel, for so \nmany years, and I am very sorry about the misunderstanding.\n  Chairman Leahy and I, along with virtually every Senator, agree that \nwe must confirm this exceptionally qualified and talented nominee--and \nthat includes Republicans who feel the same way--as quickly as possible \nso we can begin the critical work of rebuilding the Justice Department \nto fight terrorism, crime, and protect the constitutional rights of all \nAmericans. There is no one who has been more of an advocate for having \na strong, powerful, fair Justice Department than Senator Leahy. So I am \nsorry about that confusion, and if I embarrassed him in any way, again, \nI tell him I am sorry.\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, it is such a delight to see \nthe Presiding Officer in the chair, the distinguished new Senator from \nthe great State of North Carolina whom, every time I look at her \nwonderful smile, I think: That smile was born and bred in Florida. We \nare so happy to have the Presiding Officer here as a part of the Senate \nrepresenting the great State of North Carolina.\n  Madam President, I, of course, am going to vote for S. 275, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. This reauthorization is a long \ntime coming. We went through the trauma of having it vetoed by the \nPresident last year. We attempted to override that veto and got a close \nvote but didn't get enough. So here we are. We will have the votes this \ntime.\n  My particular additional interest in this is because in my life \nbefore the Senate, I had the privilege of being the elected State \ntreasurer in Florida, which is also--was then--under Florida law at the \ntime, the State insurance commissioner. In that capacity, I chaired \nwhat is known as the Florida Healthy Kids Program. It was a very \ninnovative way in which we would reach out through the school system to \nmake health insurance more affordable for children under the theory \nthat if a child is sick, a child is clearly not going to learn. We know \nby all of the sociological studies that if a child does not get the \nproper medical observation and treatment during those formative years, \nit can manifest itself in so many more complicated ways later on in \nlife which, just from a societal point of view, becomes a much greater \nexpense on society; whereas, if children can get the proper health \ncare, it is not only a good, humanitarian commonsense, Judeo-Christian \nkind of practice, but in an overall cost to society it is much more \nefficient and economical.\n  We saw in this innovative program in the 1990s in Florida, the \nHealthy Kids Program, where we could make insurance available to \nchildren through the school system according to their parents' ability \nto pay. We piggybacked it on top of the School Lunch Program because \nalready there, you had a determination of a family's financial means \nand capability. What we saw was that it spread like wildfire throughout \nthe Florida school system in each of the counties, and it became not \nonly very popular, it became very effective.\n  Here we have a program where we are applying that concept for the \nwhole country. It started back a couple of decades ago. We are \nreauthorizing it, and we are enhancing it. It makes good common sense. \nIt clearly makes good health sense. It makes good economic sense. And \nin America, where we want to give the best of every opportunity for our \nchildren, it fulfills that dream and that desire as well. For these \nreasons, it is hard for me to believe anyone would vote against the \nreauthorization of this program.\n  I commend our leadership, that they have brought up this bill \nbasically as the first bill for us to pass.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nlegislation that is long overdue, the reauthorization of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, known as CHIP.\n  For those of us who have children who are young, in school, bringing \nhome all kinds of unbelievable colds, sniffles, and all the other \nsickness, we realize our children today need health care. How wonderful \nit is, as a nation, that we have gathered to put together a \ncomprehensive package that will help increase the number of children \nwho can be covered.\n  As a mother myself, as a daughter, as a wife, as the wife of a \nphysician, better understanding the opportunity we have as a nation to \ndo this makes me extremely proud because I see other mothers at school \nwho cannot afford to provide health insurance for their children.\n  A close friend of my boys was injured on the playground the other day \nand was taken by emergency vehicle to the hospital. He was OK. But the \nmother came up to me later and said: You know, I am working as hard as \nI can, but I can't afford health insurance. What am I going to do? I \ncan't pay for this.\n  We have the opportunity in this job in the Senate to make an impact \non the lives of working families across this great country.\n  This is a bipartisan program that for the last 12 years has allowed \nus to make health care coverage more accessible for millions of \nchildren, coverage that is critical to the lifelong health of a child \nand to a family's peace of mind.\n  In conjunction with Medicaid, CHIP has been tremendously successful \nin reducing the number of uninsured children in my State and across \nthis country. We have done much work on this bill over the course of \nthe last couple of years to improve upon it, to talk about what we can \ndo to make it a better bill. And here we now come to the floor of the \nSenate with an opportunity to pass something that will be monumental in \nthe lives of working families.\n  Since the program's inception, the number of children without health \ncare coverage has dropped by one-third. I am proud that Arkansas has \nbecome a national leader in reducing its number of uninsured children \nfrom 21 percent in 1997 to 9 percent today. Now more than 70,000 of \nArkansas's children currently receive coverage through CHIP which we \nknow in Arkansas as Our Kids First, a great program that helps working \nfamilies all across our State. Unfortunately, passage of SCHIP had been \nheld hostage for the past 2 years due to President Bush's two vetoes \nwhich we tried to override and were unsuccessful.\n  At this critical time in our Nation's history, when working families \nare struggling, they are faced with economic crisis all over this \ncountry, I believe we have a moral obligation to extend this program \nand provide health care coverage to millions of children who are now \nuninsured.\n  Can you think of anything more important to the households of these \nworking families than to ease their minds, to create peace of mind by \nsaying to them: You are now eligible for a program that can help you \nprovide health insurance for your children.\n  It is interesting, when we talk about things that make us happy or \nthings that make us feel fulfilled, as we grow older, we realize it is \nless and less about us and it is more and more about our children. It \nis no different from my family to any other family across this great \nland, to parents across this country who want desperately to be able to \nprovide for their children. Here is our opportunity to help them.\n  As parents, we are no different. Whether you are unemployed or \nwhether you are a Senator, what gives you that fulfillment is to be \nable to see your children fulfilled, to see them healthy with access to \nthe kind of health care that will help them reach their potential \nbecause we know that unhealthy children are less likely to learn, they \nare less likely to become healthy adults. They are certainly going to \nbe more costly to the system if they depend on emergency services, not \nto mention the chronic diseases that can occur because they are \nneglected from getting the health care that they need early on.\n  There are so many good things in this bill and so many good things \nthis bill does. Peace of mind comes to mind, first, because I think of \nthose parents who are unable to provide that health insurance.\n  The bipartisan SCHIP bill provided by the Senate Finance Committee is \nessentially the same bill that passed overwhelmingly in the last \nCongress. As I mentioned before, we have discussed this bill, and we \nhave tried to work out compromises. Is it 100 percent of what everybody \nin this body wants?\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\nNo, it is not. But no bill ever is. Are we going to miss an opportunity \nto help working families across this country because it is not 100 \npercent of what every one of us wants? I hope as Senators, as parents, \nwe are not so blind that we would let that happen. It builds \ntremendously upon the success of the program by giving States more of \nthe tools they need while preserving their flexibility to strengthen \ntheir programs and, ultimately, cover more children.\n\n  I would remind you, Mr. President, and I would remind all my \ncolleagues, that we all have worked to keep flexibility in this bill. \nWe also must keep in mind that many of the provisions in this bill are \noptions to the States. Not a mandate that the State must cover but an \noption that gives States the flexibility to be what they are and to \naddress the specific needs they may have in addressing both the chronic \nconditions of their children and, more importantly, covering the \npopulation of children who need coverage most in their States.\n  CHIP reauthorization will allow States to preserve coverage for the \nchildren currently enrolled while reaching an additional 4.1 million \nlow-income children. I don't know of a greater way, quite frankly, that \nwe could show other countries who we are and what our value system is \nthan to reach out and cover 4.1 million more low-income children; to \nexpress to the world where we put our values, where we want to make an \ninvestment--an investment in future leaders, a future workforce, the \nfuture leaders not just of our country but in the global community as \nwell.\n  This proposal would also provide much-needed funding to States for \noutreach and enrollment efforts to enroll many of those who are \ncurrently uninsured. This is critically important to me in my State of \nArkansas, where two out of three uninsured children are eligible for \nARKids First or Medicaid but are not enrolled. We need the resources to \nreach out and ensure that these children and their families understand \nwhat these great programs are and what they would mean to their \nchildren.\n  It also takes additional steps to ensure infants and toddlers get a \nhealthy start by providing care for expectant mothers. At the age I was \nwhen I delivered my twins, people thought I was Methuselah, but nobody \never missed the opportunity to tell me how very important it was to \ncare for myself if I loved my children, and I did. I did everything I \npossibly could to ensure that I could bring those children into this \nworld as healthy and happy as possible. It was a blessing to me. There \nare other mothers out there--expectant mothers--who want desperately to \nensure that they can do everything possible to bring their children \ninto this world healthy and happy, and the key is prenatal care.\n  I have long been a supporter of improving access to health care \ncoverage for expectant mothers. I understand how important it is, both \nas a mother myself but, more importantly, looking at what it means to \nus as a country to ensure that we bring as many children into this \nworld as healthy and happy as we possibly can--not only because it is \nvital to the health of both the mother and the infant but also because \nit often reduces future health care costs, which we know can be high in \npremature births. In fact, it was reported in 2005 that the \nsocioeconomic costs associated with preterm birth in the United States \nwere at least $26.2 billion. Every year, more than 500,000 infants are \nborn prematurely, and that is nearly one out of every eight babies.\n  I can remember delivering my children in the Medicaid section of the \nUniversity Hospital where my husband worked, and I remember going \nupstairs to the NIC unit, and I took my dad with me. My dad was a dirt \nfarmer. He is no longer with us, but he is here in spirit with me \ntoday, as he always is. But he was a dirt farmer in east Arkansas, and \nI took him with me to the NIC unit. I had never seen my daddy cry \nbefore then. But he looked at those premature babies, and he said: What \nis their life going to be like?\n  The more we can provide the kind of health care that expectant \nmothers need, we will not have to ask that question. We can ensure that \nbabies will be born healthy and happy.\n  As I mentioned before, it is of particular concern for me because \nalso, in recent reports, more than 14 percent of our births in Arkansas \nare premature, ranking it among the States with the highest incidence \nof preterm births. By taking these needed steps to improve access to \ncare for expectant mothers, I am confident we can make strides to \nimprove health outcomes for them and for their children.\n  The Finance Committee proposal also includes incentives to ensure \nthat States reach out to the lowest income kids first and phase out the \nadult waivers that have been existent under the previous \nadministration.\n  In addition, the bill provides the Federal authority and resources to \ninvest in the development and testing of quality measures for \nchildren's health care. This provision will help ensure that States and \nother payers, providers, and consumers have the clinical quality \nmeasures they need to assess and improve the quality and performance of \nchildren's health care services. Making determinations on children's \nhealth care based on studies that have been done on adults doesn't make \nsense. It is critical that we focus on those quality measures based on \nour research and study of children and applying it in the appropriate \nway.\n  Additionally, it allows some States to use income eligibility \ninformation from other Federal programs, such as school lunch programs, \nto speed the enrollment of eligible children into the CHIP program or \ninto Medicaid. We have the income information about these families for \nthe school lunch program, which is critically important to the well-\nbeing of our children, so why wouldn't we want to ensure that those \nsame families, meeting those same eligibility requirements, could move \nquickly into the CHIP program to get the other health care needs of \ntheir children met? This would certainly simplify the administrative \nprocess for States, and it would reduce paperwork burdens that are put \nupon hard-working, low-income families.\n  This bill would also provide greater access to much-needed dental \ncare for lower income children and would ensure that children enrolled \nin CHIP would have access to mental health care that is on par with the \nlevel of medical and surgical care that they are currently provided.\n  The dental portion, the wraparound, is twofold. I can remember when I \nfirst visited one of the very first Head Start Programs in my \ncommunity, and I saw these children lined up with little Styrofoam cups \nthey had decorated. They had a donated toothbrush and a free sample of \ntoothpaste. They were so proud each day to be able to walk to the \ncommunity sink there in the Head Start facility and brush their teeth.\n  Dental care is essential. It is absolutely essential. All you have to \ndo is look at children of low-income families whose teeth are rotten, \nwho aren't getting dental care, who aren't getting supervision or not \nbeing taught the life skills they need. When those teeth are rotten, \nthey hurt, they make those children sick, they are unable to eat, they \nget no nutrition, and then we wonder why they cannot focus in the \nclassroom or why they cannot learn. This dental wraparound program is \nexcellent for ensuring not only that children will get the dental care \nthey need, but the wraparound portion of it ensures that we will not \nsee crowding out; that families who have private insurance which \ndoesn't cover dental can then get their dental coverage in a wraparound \npackage and maintain the other private insurance they have. Those are \ncritical needs and critical sensitivities we have looked at in this \nbill to ensure that we are doing the most we possibly can for the \nchildren of our country.\n  As you can see, this bipartisan bill is a step in the right direction \nto provide care and coverage for our most precious resource--our most \nprecious asset in this great country--and that is our Nation's \nchildren. We have to look no further than the children of this country \nto understand that all of what we do today means nothing if we have not \ngiven them the ability to carry on the great lessons of this great \ncountry we are blessed to be a part of. And if they do not reach their \npotential, whether it is because they haven't gotten dental care, they \nhaven't gotten immunizations, they haven't gotten the proper kind of \nhealth care they need to be able to learn and flourish and reach their \npotential, we will have done an injustice to our country.\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\n  As we move forward, I wish to encourage my colleagues to support this \nimportant piece of legislation in the same bipartisan spirit that was \ndemonstrated when it was created 12 years ago. We are not here to \ncreate a work of art. We are here to create a work in progress. After \n12 years, we have come to understand the importance of what has changed \nin our communities, what has changed in our economy, what has changed \namong our working families, and to meet the needs that exist in today's \nworld. After 2 years of waiting, we cannot fail our Nation's children \nyet again.\n  I hope every one of us in this body will think of a child who was \nborn 2 years ago, unable to access CHIP coverage--a family with a child \nborn 2 years ago. If we fail to do it now, and they have to wait 2 more \nyears, they have missed 4 years of critical development in their life \nwithout health care. We will never, ever be able to reverse that.\n  This is the time. Now is the time. We have talked and talked, we have \nreached out to one another to come up with the best possible solutions \nwe could, but now is the time to pass this bill. In a time when more \nand more Americans are struggling to find affordable health care, it is \nup to us to put politics aside, not only for the future of our Nation \nbut for the well-being of millions of our children across this great \nNation. It is not just our future. Most importantly, it is their \nfuture. They are depending on us, and it is time we fulfill our \ncommitment to them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the Bunning \namendment, which I hope we will be able to vote on a little while later \nthis afternoon.\n  It is a very simple amendment that sets the maximum amount for \neligibility under the SCHIP program at 300 percent of poverty. In other \nwords, we set the poverty level in this country three times that amount \nthat would be the qualifying level for a family to qualify their kids \nunder the SCHIP program. That is a lot more than what was originally \nintended when the SCHIP program was put in effect, but it is a level \nthat represents the maximum for all but two States in the country.\n  Most States are somewhere around 200 percent of poverty. My State of \nArizona is exactly at 200 percent of poverty. The State of the chairman \nof the committee, who is from Montana, is now at 175 percent, although \nI understand there is legislation that will take that up to 250 \npercent. So with the States bunched around primarily the 200 percent of \npoverty level, some now at the 300 percent, that represents a good \ncompromise on where the limit should be set, and we need to set the \nlimit for a variety of reasons I will go into in a moment.\n  Let me tell you what the implications of the amendment would be. \nThere are only two States that would have to cut back under the \nprogram. In fact, they would not have to actually cut back in the \ncoverage of children, they would simply follow the same rules as \neveryone else, and their reimbursement would be at the Medicaid rate \nrather than the higher SCHIP rate for these higher income kids. So they \ncould still cover them; they just don't get quite as much reimbursement \nfrom the Federal Government in order to do it.\n  Now, there would be some savings as a result of these two States not \nhaving Federal funding at the SCHIP level, and that additional savings, \nunder the Bunning amendment, could be put into outreach and enrollment \ngrants to help find eligible, uninsured, low-income children. The \nreason for that is, the whole point of the program is low-income \nchildren. Yet there are millions of low-income children who are not \nenrolled in the program. We have to find them, we have to get them \nenrolled. That will cost some money. So the savings that are achieved \nin this amendment would go toward that end.\n\n  The third and basic point here is that the Bunning amendment ensures \nwe keep our promise to preserve the SCHIP coverage for low-income \nchildren and ensure parity amongst the States. If we have a limit of \n300 percent, not all of the States would want to go to 300 percent but \nthey would know they could do that. If they wished to keep it below 300 \npercent, they would be paying less. They would be receiving less from \nthe Federal Government, but it would be uniform for everyone.\n  As I said, I think Senator Bunning is wise to set it at this level, \neven though that means the average family of four has $66,000 in \nincome. That is hardly low income or poverty level. But $66,000 of \nincome would cover families who clearly could use the help. It is \nobviously very generous. It is clearly way above poverty, so I do not \nthink Senator Bunning goes very far in limiting this to 300 percent of \npoverty. These numbers translate to 200 percent of poverty is $44,000 \nincome per year. Of the two States that are above the 300 percent, one \nis New Jersey at 350 percent. That translates into $77,175 a year. The \nother is New York at $88,200 per year.\n  We can all have some disagreements in this body, but nobody can argue \nthat $88,000-plus in income is a poor family, is a poverty or low-\nincome family. That is not what this program was designed to cover.\n  Add to that, you can add in $40,000 for expenses for transportation \nand clothing and housing and so on, and you can actually get above \n$120,000 in income and qualify for this low-income program for kids. \nThat is not right.\n  One thing I know that folks in Arizona, folks in New Mexico, folks in \nMontana all say when they look to Washington is: We know we need to pay \nincome taxes, we know we need to spend money on things, but stop \nwasteful Washington spending. I think sometimes they may view our \nspending as more wasteful than it is, but the reality is there is a lot \nof wasteful spending here. This is a lot of spending beyond what was \nthe original intent of the legislation.\n  When I talk in Arizona about low-income kids, people nod their heads \nand say, yes, we need to help low-income families with kids. If I said \nto them so that means $120,000 a year--most of the families in Arizona \ndon't make $120,000 a year, let alone calling that low income. It is \nnot. If only for truth in advertising purposes, we should support the \nBunning amendment and, again, he sets the level at 300 percent of \npoverty or $66,000. In one sense you would have a tough time defending \nthat as a low-income program. But that is where he set it. At least \nnobody can contend that he is trying to be too cheap here. Mr. \nPresident, $66,000 a year for a family of four to qualify for a low-\nincome poverty program I think is quite generous.\n  I think I indicated I would answer a couple of questions here about \nwhy we need to do this. One argument for the folks in New Jersey is we \nhave a higher cost of living in those States. Of course it is not twice \nas high. It does not cost twice as much to buy a car in New York or New \nJersey or Arizona, so that argument only goes so far--and it is about \n``this'' far.\n  Second, what these States have done is cover more kids at higher \nincome levels because it is easier. Think about it. You expand the \nprogram to cover a lot of high-income kids. You can find those kids. It \nis the very low income we are having the trouble finding. Those are the \nones who need to get registered in this program, but they are hard to \nfind. They are in our Indian reservations, in our inner cities, and \nmaybe some out in farm country in Montana or wherever. That is who we \nshould be focused on here.\n  It is easy to say let's raise this up to families making $88,000 a \nyear. Sure, you can find those kids. But the fact you are then \nenrolling more kids in the SCHIP program doesn't mean you are getting \nthe ones who need the care the most.\n  There is another problem with that. The Congressional Budget Office \nnotes that with these higher income family kids, there is a one-to-one \nratio from adding a child onto SCHIP and losing health insurance \ncoverage in the private sector. For every one child who is added on, a \nchild loses health insurance coverage from an employer. The ratio \ngenerally is between 25 and 50 percent, but at the higher income level \nit reaches a one-to-one ratio. This is the crowdout effect we were \ntalking about before. It doesn't do us any good to add somebody to the \nGovernment-run program if the only effect of that is to cause them to \nlose their insurance policy from their family's employer. You\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\nhave not helped anybody in that case. All you have done is transferred \nthe expense from the employer to the taxpayer.\n  In the case of these high-cost States such as New York and New \nJersey, the people of New Mexico or Arizona or Montana, for example, \nare paying twice as much for those kids as they are for the kids in \ntheir own State.\n  We are sending money from Arizona to New York. Arizona has it at 200 \npercent of poverty, or a $44,000 income level. New York has twice that, \n$88,000. The net effect of that is Arizonans are simply sending money \nto New York to take care of the New York kids. That is not fair. That \nwas not what this program was originally designed to do. What Senator \nBunning has done is say let's cap it, not at some low level but the \nrelatively high level of 300 percent of poverty, $66,000 a year. If \nthey want to cover kids higher than that, they can, but they are \nreimbursed at the somewhat lower Medicaid rate than the SCHIP rate, and \nhe takes the savings from that and helps us fund the kids who need the \ncoverage, the low-income kids.\n  I cannot for the life of me see why any of us, except perhaps the \nfour Senators from New Jersey and New York, would not support this \namendment. The only two States that would suffer at all under this \namendment are those two States because they have chosen to go far above \nwhat the other States provide in terms of coverage. They can still \ncover the kids, as I said, they just don't get quite as much money from \ntaxpayers in other States to do that.\n  Why wouldn't those of us from the other States support the Bunning \namendment? It is going to be very hard for some people to go home to \ntheir constituents when those folks say, Why didn't you support the \nBunning amendment? Why should I have to pay money for somebody making \n$88,000 in New York State to cover these higher income kids when that \nprobably means that their employer takes the obligation he has and \nmoves it over to the taxpayers? This is not very logical.\n  The Bunning amendment is a modest attempt to get the program back to \nits original intent, slightly less expensive, to generate some funds to \nget the low-income kids in, and have more equity among the States.\n  I cannot think of an amendment that would more reasonably try to deal \nwith all these problems, and I do urge my colleagues, for a moment \nhere, let's put partisanship aside. The President has urged us to do \nthat. We don't have to have just partisan votes on all of these \namendments--all the Democrats vote no, all the Republicans vote aye. \nThat doesn't get us anywhere. I hope my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will put on their independent thinking hats. If they need to \nsay something to the leadership or whatever--look, this is a reasonable \namendment, I am going to support it--then do that. We do not have to be \nin lockstep here. It may be that there is a Republican amendment that \ndeserves to be supported. This is one.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's approach this independently. This is a \ngood amendment. Let's support it. I hope my colleagues will consider \ndoing that when we vote on the Bunning amendment a bit later on this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, basically the Bunning amendment is the \nfourth amendment that would put a cap on eligibility. Yesterday the \nSenate rejected the Cornyn amendment that would cap it at 200 percent \nof poverty, a Roberts amendment with a cap of $65,000, and a Murkowski \namendment with a cap of 300 percent of poverty. All these amendments, \nincluding the Bunning amendment, have the same flaw; that is, they \nwould raise the possibility of kicking kids off the Children's Health \nInsurance Plan; that is, they are diminishing amendments. They do not \nadd, they subtract. The kids currently on the Children's Health \nInsurance Plan are taken off. That is not something I think we want to \ndo.\n  The specific amendment in question here will have that effect. It \nwill basically say that because the States that have been mentioned \nhere essentially get a match rate according to the Children's Health \nInsurance Plan, that because of the amendment--the amendment says they \nwill get less, they will get the Medicaid match rate, which is less \nthan the Children's Health Insurance Plan; therefore, those kids cannot \nparticipate.\n  Theoretically there could be some participation because the match \nrate in Medicaid, which I think is around 15 percent lower--in the case \nof let's say New York or New Jersey--than the Children's Health \nInsurance Plan match. But still the effect is the same. If this \namendment were to go into effect, children currently in, say, New \nJersey who receive the Children's Health Insurance Plan match rate will \nprobably get kicked off. A lot will be kicked off the Children's Health \nInsurance Plan because the match rate is lower, down to the Medicaid \nrate.\n  That is not right. The fact is all of these amendments, including the \nBunning amendment, are restrictive. It is constrictive. It is a \nreducing amendment. It pressures to take children off the Children's \nHealth Insurance Plan rather than add children.\n  People talk about 200 percent of poverty, 300 percent of poverty, et \ncetera. I think New Jersey is at 350 percent of poverty. One \ninteresting point there is they are at that rate, A, because they asked \nfor it and, B, because President Bush's administration gave a waiver \nand said, yes, go ahead and do it. President Bush, his administration, \nand the Republican Secretary of HHS, said, yes, New York, go ahead and \ndo that. That is fine. You should do that.\n  One can guess why they may have granted that waiver. The reason is \nbecause when you talk poverty levels, such as 200 percent of poverty, \nthat is a national figure. It is not a different number for each State, \nit is what is the national number. New Jersey, I think, has the highest \nper capita income of any State in the Nation. Clearly, the Federal \npoverty level which applies to New Jersey probably does not match what \nthe realities are in that State. The realities are if you take a family \na little bit above the national median income, a family in that State, \nin New Jersey, is probably facing the same economic pressures and \ndifficulties--paying for health insurance, providing for the kids and \nthe kids' medical bills--as would the average family in a State where \nthe median income is the same as the national median income. That is \nprobably why New Jersey asked for that waiver and probably why the \nRepublican Secretary of Health and Human Services granted that waiver. \nBut that is where we are. That is history. It makes sense.\n  The fact is, this amendment says, no, we are going to undo that, even \nthough New Jersey is used to it, even though New Jersey applied for the \nwaiver and lawfully was granted the waiver, we say: No, no, not that \nanymore. We are going to reduce the match rate you and New Jersey get \nand it is again going to have the pressure of hurting kids in that \nState and taking kids off the Children's Health Insurance Plan. That is \nnot the right thing to do.\n  I therefore respectfully urge Senators to not support this \nrestrictive amendment which does not add kids to the Children's Health \nInsurance Plan. Rather, it takes kids off the Children's Health \nInsurance Plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of supporting the \nBunning amendment. What I say will have some rebuttal to what the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee has said just.\n  Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Plan were created to \ncover low-income children. An income of more than $63,000 for a family \nof four is not low income. I know the Senators from the State of New \nYork and New Jersey will argue that $63,000 is low income in their \nStates. I know they will talk about the cost of living in those States.\n  As an example, the median home price in Des Moines is greater than \nthat in Binghampton, Buffalo, or Rochester in the State of New York.\n  The underlying bill says all States can cover above 300 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level. I think that should be limited, as it was in \nthe second bill that was a bipartisan bill passing the Senate in 2007. \nBut if we are going to allow States to cover above 300 percent, all \nStates should be treated equally, and an exception for two States--and \nI might emphasize only two States--is not fair, and it is not\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\nright. This amendment strikes that exception so all States are treated \nequally.\n  I urge support for the Bunning amendment that we will vote on in a \nlittle over an hour. I hope Senators coming to the Senate floor will \ntake that into consideration. Treating all States favorably is \nessential.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 83\n\n  (Purpose: To provide H.R. 3963 (CHIPRA II) as a complete substitute)\n\n  The amendment I am going to introduce is the exact contents of the \nbill we call the 2007 bipartisan bill No. 2 because that is the No. 2 \nbill vetoed by President Bush. This amendment I am offering today, I am \ndoing so with Senator Hatch because he was there with me through all of \nthat discussion in 2007 that brought us to a bipartisan bill.\n  The amendment is the bill that, 2 years ago, Speaker Pelosi called \n``a definite improvement on the first bill,'' meaning the first bill \nthe President vetoed. This amendment I am going to soon lay before the \nSenate is a bill I believe is the best bipartisan compromise we could \nput together to cover as many low-income children as possible. This \namendment is that 2007 bill that told States they could not cover \nchildren above 300 percent of poverty level in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. Why do we concentrate so much on that level and not \nabove that level?\n  In 2007, we thought letting States cover children above the national \nmedian income diverted attention from the mission of Medicaid and the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which was obvious then and still \nobvious today; that is, that we ought to be putting the emphasis on \nlow-income children.\n  The underlying bill allows States to cover children up to any income \nlevel and, as I said, includes a special grandfathering exclusion for \nNew York to cover children and families with incomes up to $83,000 per \nyear. The second bipartisan children's health insurance bill--that is \nthe amendment before us or that I will put before us now--returns the \nfocus where it has been since 1997 in the CHIP bill. The emphasis is \nupon getting low-income children into a plan so they have the health \ncare they need.\n  This amendment is the bill that includes a policy to address the \nproblem of crowdout that was the subject of an amendment yesterday. It \nis a policy that is not in the underlying bill, which brings me to the \nquestion: What exactly went wrong with the crowdout policies that so \nmany of us voted for in 2007?\n  Certainly, it is not because the Democrats have put forward a policy \nthat addressed crowdout in a better or more efficient manner. \nCertainly, it is not because the Democrats have new analyses that \ncrowdout is no longer occurring, especially in the expansion of public \nprograms. When Children's Health Insurance Program dollars go to higher \nincome children who already have private coverage, that money could \nhave gone to low-income children. Make no doubt about it, 4 million new \npeople being covered does not take care of the problem of covering low-\nincome children. There are still going to be millions out there who \nwill not be covered whom we ought to have a focus on.\n  The second bipartisan children's health insurance bill of 2007 that \nis now the amendment I am going to lay before the Senate returns the \nfocus to low-income children. Finally, this amendment-to-be is the bill \nthat we voted on in 2007 which did not have the divisive legal \nimmigrant issue in it. The underlying bill today has $1.3 billion of \ncoverage for legal immigrants, more than 100,000 of whom already have \nprivate or public coverage, dollars that could have gone to cover more \nlow-income children.\n  The second bipartisan children's health insurance bill--that is the \namendment I am going to lay before the Senate--now returns the focus to \nlow-income children. Now, today in the Senate, there are 43 Democrats \nand 12 Republicans, of which I am one, who were Members of the Senate \nin 2007 and voted for this bill that my amendment is going to \nrepresent.\n  Those 43 and 12 Republicans who are still here--that is 55 of us--if \nwe would stand together, we could still do great things. We could show \nthat bipartisan amendments still mean something in the Senate. When the \nvote count ended, we would probably have more than 70 votes for this \namendment. Instead, I know if I call for a vote on this amendment, 43 \nayes that were cast in 2007 would become ``no'' votes.\n  After watching the difficulty those 12 Republicans, including this \nRepublican, faced by voting aye and sticking together because we \nthought we were doing good policy, watching 43 ayes turn to noes on the \nvery same policy is a bitter pill to swallow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and to call up amendment No. 83.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 83.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support this amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa. Essentially, what we are doing is \nstriking the Baucus bill being considered on the floor and replacing it \nwith the CHIPRA II bill that passed overwhelmingly in this body in \n2007, enough votes to override a Presidential veto. Not one Democrat \nvoted against this bill. Not one.\n  But what my good friend, Senator Grassley, and I are offering is a \nbill that represents a solid bipartisan agreement that we worked out \nwith Senators Rockefeller and Baucus. I do not blame Senator Baucus for \nthe mess we are in right now, or this partisan approach to CHIP, \nbecause he represents his side. But I do believe there has been a real \nlack of effort by some on the Democratic side to work with us after all \nof the time that we spent trying to make sure we had something that \nwould work in the last Congress.\n  What we have is a true bipartisan agreement where we were there from \nstart to finish. Senator Grassley and I, Senators Baucus and \nRockefeller, and those in the House--we spent hours together, months \ntogether, working out the details of this bill. We spent morning, noon, \nand night for 6 months to get the bill to that point. It was built on a \nfoundation of tough agreements and tough decisions. We were part of the \nprocess from the very beginning and stayed with the process until the \nvery end. That resulted in a true bipartisan agreement.\n  The bill passed overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate by a \nveto-proof margin in the Senate. Senator Grassley and I worked our guts \nout, put our hearts and souls into both CHIPRA I and CHIPRA II. We were \nproud of our work with Senators Rockefeller and Baucus because that \nwork not only reauthorized the CHIP program for 5 additional years, it \ncovered more low-income uninsured children. It retained the original \ngoal of the original CHIP program, which, by anybody's measure, has \nworked very well over the prior 10 years.\n\n  The bill before us today does not represent that agreement. We talked \nto our colleagues at the beginning and then we were not included in the \ndiscussions that evolved into the CHIP bill recently considered by the \nFinance Committee and now on the Senate floor. We were not even \ninvited. It seems to me once we were not needed anymore we were more or \nless thrown by the wayside because our votes were no longer needed.\n  This is not the way to start off the 111th Congress, especially after \nthe last campaign where our President said he wants to work in a \nbipartisan way, he wants us to get together, he wants us to be able to \nwork with each other, he wants us to accomplish a great deal for this \ncountry.\n  I think I am known for bipartisan work around here, and I certainly \nhave taken a lot of flack for some of the President's Cabinet people I \nsupported, and supported right off the bat, because they were qualified \npeople. I believe the President should have his\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\nchoice as long as they are qualified and not otherwise disqualified.\n  Well, I am going to support this amendment of Senator Grassley's, \nwhich represents the true bipartisan agreement of 2007. Now, let me \nmention a few of the highlights in CHIPRA II.\n  The amendment states there will be no Federal CHIP dollars for \ncoverage of children over 300 percent of poverty; that is around, \n$63,000 for a family of four. Now, to be honest with you, when we did \nthe original CHIP bill, we wanted it to be 200 percent of poverty \nbecause those kids were the only ones left out of the health care \nsystem, the children of the working poor. We did it so we would have \nenough money to try and cover all of the kids who really qualified for \nCHIP. Even with that, we found we were not able to get to all of them. \nSo you can imagine, with the current economic difficulties, we are \ngoing to have even more pressure to get to more and more kids. If we \nstart allowing states to cover over 300 percent of poverty, which at \nleast one State does and another is in the process of doing, it is not \ngoing to be long until this program becomes a Federal Government \nboondoggle where everybody will expect money from the Federal \nGovernment for health coverage.\n  This amendment eliminates the earmark to allow New York to cover \nchildren up to 400 percent of poverty, $84,800. By the time they use \nincome disregards, some estimate that families could be making over \n$100,000 a year and still qualify for the CHIP program.\n  Now what does that do? That takes money from the 6 million kids who \nare low income and uninsured. It is crazy. Yet that is what this bill \nallows. Senator Grassley and I had to agree to go to 300 percent, which \nis over $63,000 for a family of four in 2007. But to now go to 400 \npercent of poverty, admittedly New York City is an expensive place, but \nNew York's rural areas are not that different from other States, except \nthey are taxed to death in the State of New York. But that should not \nbe the problem of everybody in the country.\n  This amendment includes the bipartisan crowdout policy that addresses \nthe issue of families giving up private coverage in order to enroll in \na public program. Our amendment would require a number of studies on \ncrowdout, would improve data collection on the coverage of low-income \nchildren, would require all States to adopt these ``best practices'' to \nreduce crowdout, and would provide the Secretary with the authority to \nhold States accountable for covering low-income children.\n  With regard to crowdout, we did our best to stop it so people would \nnot drop their health insurance that they can afford so their kids \nwould qualify for the CHIP program. That is one of the problems with \ncovering higher income families, because, naturally, if parents find \nthey are going to be better off opting for CHIP coverage as opposed to \nprivate health coverage, they are going to crowd-out lower-income \nchildren from CHIP coverage. That is what this bill really does.\n  It is a shame because it means less money and less health coverage \nfor those who are truly needy, those for whom this bill was meant.\n  If we covered the children of the working poor, the only ones who \nwere formerly left out of the health care system, we could probably do \na much better job if we kept it to 200 percent of poverty. But Senator \nGrassley and I agreed to go to 300 percent of poverty in the interest \nof a bipartisan agreement even though each of us felt that probably was \na mistake.\n  This amendment does not include the controversial legal immigrant \nprovision allowing States to claim a Federal match for coverage of \nlegal immigrant children and pregnant women.\n  Look, I started the Republican senatorial Hispanic task force. I \nbrought Hispanic leaders from the country to Washington at least twice \na year to help us understand how we could better assist Hispanic \npeople. We brought together Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. I \nhave a long reputation of trying to help Hispanic people.\n  Under our immigration laws, sponsoring families who brought others to \nthis country legally entered an agreement to take care of those \nindividuals for 5 years. It has worked. The current bill on the floor, \nthe partisan bill, wipes that all out. In the process, how many \nchildren who are U.S. citizens are going to be left out because we have \nexpanded this program in ways that will not take care of them?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know he has an amendment pending relative to taking \ncare of providing prenatal care to make certain that children are born \nhealthy in the United States. I would like to ask the Senator if he is \narguing now that we should not provide maternal care for pregnant women \nwho are legal immigrants to the United States with the full knowledge \nthat the lack of that care may mean the child will be born sick and the \nchild will be a citizen of the United States?\n  Mr. HATCH. Heavens no.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator arguing we should not provide obstetrical \ncare to pregnant legal immigrant women?\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly not. And as the Senator knows, many States today \nprovide that care to legal immigrants through CHIP or otherwise. And \nlet me emphasize that all expenses are supposed to be provided by the \nsponsoring families for 5 years. If that was the wrong time or it \nshould have been shortened, I would have worked with the distinguished \nSenator to do that. But that was the deal. That was the rule. That was \nwhat we worked on. That is what we thought would work. That is what we \nthought was fair.\n  What I don't want to do is have our own children who are U.S. \ncitizens be without care while we cover those who were supposed to be \ncovered by their sponsor families who brought them to the United \nStates.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, if a person is here legally \nthough not a citizen, is a legal immigrant mother, is it not true that \nher child born here will be a legal citizen?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, it is true. And they would be covered by CHIP.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Then if we deny care----\n  Mr. HATCH. What about those who were brought in who are not legal \ncitizens? I am not against helping them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't think there should be a provision for \nundocumented illegals.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may take my time back, I am not against any children \nreceiving help. A lot of these children get help through our system of \nhealth care. But I am talking about a CHIP bill that cannot take care \nof our current children who are U.S. citizens and now we have included \na provision that would allow legal immigrants to be covered before the \n5 year waiting period.\n  I might add, many States today provide coverage to legal immigrant \nchildren. Many States do that. I commend them for doing it. But I am \nworried about having a bill that can get broad bipartisan support that \nliterally first covers our children who are U.S. citizens. This bill \ndoes not do that. Let's be honest about it, it doesn't. Today, there \nare as many as 6 million or more low income, uninsured children who are \nU.S. citizens who do not have health coverage some of whom could \npotentially not be covered by CHIP because legal immigrant children \nwill now be covered through CHIP. It is my hope that their family \nsponsors will take care of them. And if not, these legal immigrant \nchildren and pregnant women are still going to be taken care of by the \nStates. I don't know of any pregnant woman who goes to an emergency \nroom and who isn't going to be taken care of.\n  I think this is a principle that is very important. We should be \ndoing what we can do. But what is more important is that we agreed to \nnot include the legal immigrant provision in CHIPRA II. It \noverwhelmingly passed, and every Democrat voted for it. Now we come up \nwith a partisan approach that basically undermines that agreement. I am \nvery concerned about it. Frankly, I think Senator Grassley is right in \nbringing up this amendment.\n  But don't let anybody fool you. There isn't a child I don't want to \nhelp. In fact, the way this bill arose, two families from Provo, UT, \ncame to me. Both husbands worked; both wives worked. Both husbands and \nwives worked. Neither family, at that time in 1994, earned more than \n$20,000 combined income a year. Yet they were working poor who wanted \nto work and not be on the dole, but they couldn't afford insurance for \ntheir children, who were\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\nthe only kids, the working-poor kids, the only kids left out of the \nprocess. So we came up with CHIP to try to resolve that issue. Even \nwith that, we were not able to do everything we wanted to do, but it \nworked amazingly well. I don't know anybody who denies that fact. I \ndon't know anybody who would dispute me on this statement. I would like \nto see them try.\n  The fact is, the bill worked well. Over the last 2 years, in a \nbipartisan way, we worked to try to solve some of the problems that \narose, even with a good working CHIP bill. We worked in good faith. All \nof a sudden, we find a bill brought up here without any input from us \nthat is a partisan bill, that makes it even more difficult to cover all \nthese kids.\n  Everybody knows I believe in health care, and I believe we ought to \ncover everybody. I would like to do it, but I don't want to do it by \nbankrupting the country or making those who do work have to take care \nof those who don't. I am a very strong believer in helping those who \ncannot help themselves but would if they could, but I am not very \nexcited about helping those who can help themselves but won't. \nUnfortunately, we have a few of those types of people in this country.\n  What galls me is that I know the President wants to work in a \nbipartisan way. But the House just acts like, so what, we are just \ngoing to do what we want to do. I can understand that type of thinking \nbecause they were irritated with some members in the House, even though \nwe ended up with a very strong vote in the House. It just wasn't enough \nto override the veto. They were irritated with some of those who didn't \nagree with CHIPRA I or CHIPRA II. But in the Senate, we had, as I \nrecall, 69 votes--more than we needed to override a veto. The reason we \ndid is because it was bipartisan.\n  I don't know how many people are going to vote for CHIPRA II at this \ntime, but I just remind my colleagues that every Democrat voted for it \nwhen it came up. Frankly, even if we didn't get it passed because the \nHouse sustained the veto, it was a tremendous victory.\n  I am not going to spend the rest of my life griping about it. But the \nfact is, it is a shame that with a President who wants to be \nbipartisan, the first thing out of the box, the first real bill out of \nthe box happens to be a bill that they know Senator Grassley and I \nworked hard on, that we carried a lot of water on, that we took a lot \nof flak for in 2007. Then we find out they are going to do something \nthat is just plain partisan, that isn't going to work as well, and it \nis going to cost the American people a lot more.\n  I hope everybody in this body will support Senator Grassley's and my \namendment on the CHIPRA II bill. If they don't, personally, I can live \nwith it, but I won't be happy. I think what is going on is not fair, \nand it is a direct slap in the face to those of us who worked so hard \nwith our friends on the other side. And they are friends. I mean, they \nare all friends. I care for them. But this is a particularly important \nbill to me. Right now, it looks as if it is turning into just a \npartisan exercise.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n            Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. If I could interrupt this very interesting debate, as in \nexecutive session, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, February 2, \nat 3:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the \nnomination of Eric Holder to be Attorney General of the United States; \nthat there be 3 hours of debate with respect to the nomination, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between Senators Leahy and \nSpecter, chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, or \ntheir designees; that at 6:15 p.m., the Senate vote on confirmation of \nthe nomination; that upon confirmation, if there be confirmation, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that there be no further \nmotions in order, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:10 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a series of votes in relation to the \nfollowing pending amendments in the order listed: Coburn No. 47, \nBunning No. 74, and Hatch No. 80; further, that no amendments be in \norder to these amendments prior to the votes; that there be 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided between the votes; and that all votes after \nthe first vote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the pending \nmatter before us.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think I answered the question as well as I would \nlike to. The question was, Do we want any children of pregnant women, \nlegal immigrant children, not to be helped? Twenty-one States already \npay for that. I think most of the others do through emergency rooms. \nThey don't go without health care. But what is happening here is that \nwe are taking what 21 States are actually doing and we are basically \njust alleviating them from having to do that, that which they are \ncapable of doing and wanted to do, and just taking it over by the \nFederal Government when, in fact, these problems were solved in a way \nthat was reasonable, with not only families taking care of people they \nbrought into this country for 5 years under their obligation but also \nbecause the States would take care of them with State money. I wanted \nto make that clear. I do appreciate working with my colleagues on the \nother side, but I am a little disappointed that it has turned out this \nway.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me preface my remarks by saying a word \nof tribute to the Senator from Utah. I hope he doesn't leave the floor \nbecause this may be historic, but I thank him personally for his \nsupport of this SCHIP bill through the years. I know it has not always \nbeen easy. Sometimes he has been a lone voice. And though we may \ndisagree about one aspect or another, I greatly admire the fact that he \nhas stood up and supported this. I hope at the end of the day he will \ncontinue to because bipartisan support for this program is very \nimportant. I salute him.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I thank him for his gracious \ncomments. He knows our friendship means a great deal, and also with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee. I think he is a very fine man \nwho has done a very good job on this committee. But I am going to have \na difficult time supporting this bill without some bipartisan approach \nthat would work a lot better than this is going to work. But I thank \nthe Senator again.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  I want to try to bring this down to the bottom line. This really is a \ndebate about children's health coverage. This is not a debate about \nimmigration. I hope my colleagues will be willing to have that debate \nabout immigration, and soon, because it is long overdue in this \ncountry.\n  Much of this debate is focused on the idea that this provision in the \nbill would call on undocumented immigrants to abuse the system and that \nour financially strapped system would be run down by an influx of these \nundocumented immigrants jumping onboard.\n  Let me make it clear: Undocumented immigrants have never been \neligible for the major benefit programs in America, and this law does \nnot change that. We are talking about legal immigrants, people who are \nin the United States legally, people who are working and paying taxes, \npeople who are more than likely to become tomorrow's citizens.\n  It is a different group. These are not those hiding in the shadows \nbecause they are here illegally. These are people who have legal \ndocumentation as to their presence in the United States. They can go to \nwork. They pay taxes. What we are talking about is making certain the \nchildren of these legal immigrants have a chance to be healthy. It is \nlikely many of those children are already U.S. citizens, and many will \nbecome U.S. citizens. Their being\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\nunhealthy does not make sense for that family, and it certainly does \nnot make sense for our Nation.\n  Legal immigrants were able to get some assistance, but the 1996 \nFederal welfare law restricted those benefits by enacting a 5-year \nwaiting period. This was during the Gingrich era. The policy was \ninstated over 10 years ago, and almost immediately we started changing \nit, realizing it really did not work as well as planned. Congress and \nmany States recognized we had gone too far and we were causing serious \nharm to seniors and persons with disabilities and vulnerable families \nthroughout the country.\n  Over time, and with the support of Presidents from both political \nparties--President Clinton and President George W. Bush--Congress \nrestored eligibility to many but not all lawfully residing immigrants \nwho needed Social Security assistance or food stamps. We have not yet \nrestored health care services to these individuals and families. We \nhave attempted to do so in the past.\n  During the debate on Medicare Part D prescription drugs for seniors, \nthe Senate version of the Medicare bill included this same language. We \nall know how successful the effort was. It passed this Chamber with a \nstrong bipartisan vote of 76 to 21. When there was an attempt to change \nit, water it down, it was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 65 to \n33--a strong bipartisan vote.\n  In addition to longstanding support from Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents, the removal of legal immigrant barriers to health care is \nalso backed by diverse stakeholders. The National Governors Association \nand the National Conference of State Legislatures are on record \nsupporting the approach of this bill.\n  In addition, the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform \ncalled for lifting restrictions on legal immigrants' eligibility for \npublic benefits shortly after the 1996 restrictions went into place. \nThe arguments for such a policy are overwhelming.\n  According to a 2003 factsheet from Families USA, extending health \ninsurance to this population actually saves the health care system of \nAmerica a lot of money. Covering uninsured children and pregnant women \nthrough Medicaid can reduce unnecessary hospitalizations by 22 percent. \nPreventing unnecessary hospital visits results in substantial savings \nin uncompensated care. Women without access to prenatal care are four \ntimes more likely to deliver low birth weight babies and seven times \nmore likely to deliver prematurely with complications.\n  Avoiding these pregnancy complications is not only the humane thing \nto do, it is the economic thing to do. It produces great savings to the \nsystem. Like all of us, when immigrant kids are insured--legal \nimmigrant kids are insured--their families make better decisions when \nit comes to the use of health care. They are twice as likely to have \nseen a primary care doctor in the last year as those who are uninsured. \nThey are three times more likely to have preventive well-child visits. \nThey are more likely to get a flu shot.\n  In contrast, uninsured immigrant children are four times as likely to \nhave used an emergency room more than once as immigrant children who \nare covered. ER care is expensive, sometimes unnecessary. We can avoid \nit by doing the smart thing in providing health insurance for the \nchildren of these legal immigrants.\n  So I say this: There is a lot of debate in this Chamber, and has been \nover the last several days, about families, family values, life, \nrespecting life. Those are all valuable concepts and principles. But \nisn't that the bottom line in this debate? If you really do respect \nfamilies and family values, if you really do respect life and children, \nwhy would you deny basic health insurance to these children? They are \nthe children of legal residents of the United States, people paying \ntheir taxes, who want the best for their kids, like we all do.\n  That is why this is so important. We have come at this in the last \ncouple days--and I salute the chairman of the Finance Committee for his \npatience. We have come at this from 10 different directions. It is \nstill the bottom line. The bottom line is, if you value these kids, if \nyou want them to be healthy, if you want to give them a fighting chance \nfor a good life so they can be happy, healthy, and good citizens of the \nUnited States, don't deny them this health care.\n  No child should have to wait 5 years for health care. Five years is a \nlifetime to a child with a medical problem. Many of these conditions \nhave long consequences if we do not treat them early. So let's make \nsure we do the right thing. As someone said in some of the debate the \nother day, children are contagious. You cannot say, well, we are going \nto put in a classroom those citizen kids with those legal resident \nkids, and the legal resident kids do not get to go to the doctor. They \nhave to wait until they are really sick or the parent, in desperation, \nhas to take them to an emergency room, and it does not affect the whole \nclassroom. It does.\n  We are literally in this together. Our children and grandchildren are \nin this together. Our country can do better. I hope we defeat these \namendments and stick with this basic bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much thank the Senator from \nIllinois for his statement in several respects. One is that he \ncomplimented the Senator from Utah. That was the proper thing to do \nbecause the Senator from Utah has done a lot and led the way for \nchildren's health care. I thank the Senator for making that point very \nclear. It is true, Senator Hatch has been one of the real leaders in \nhelping to protect kids. He worked a few years ago on the original \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and he, Senator Rockefeller, and \nthe late Senator John Chafee were several of the prime movers to get \nchildren's health insurance passed in 1997.\n  I would like to say a word or two about the pending amendment offered \nby my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley. He mentioned--and, \nfrankly, some of the speakers have mentioned--a lot about partisanship \nand seeking bipartisanship, and so forth. We all want to work together. \nThat is clear. Frankly, to be honest, I do not like the word \n``partisanship.'' I do not like the word ``bipartisanship'' because \nthat connotes there are two sides trying to force something together. \nI, rather, think we should--without sounding corny about it--just try \nto do what is right.\n  The amendment offered by my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, will \nhave the effect of taking about three-quarters of the million children \noff the Children's Health Insurance Program or, to state it more \naccurately, if you take the current bill before us, we will \nadd approximately 4 million children to the approximately 6 million \nchildren who are currently covered. We are told 10 million kids would \nbe covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n  Remember, the Children's Health Insurance Program is for low-income \nkids of the working poor. These are families who are not as poor as \nthose who qualify for Medicaid. It is just the next level up, the \nworking poor. They have had a real tough time making ends meet. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is aimed at that group, at the \nworking poor.\n  Under the legislation before us, not only will the 6 million who \ncurrently have children's health insurance coverage receive that care, \nbut 4 million more will be covered under the bill for a total of 10 \nmillion.\n  Cutting to the chase, the bottom line, the effect of the amendment \noffered by Senator Grassley will be to deny coverage to three-quarters \nof a million people who otherwise would be covered under the bill or, \nto state it in very gross terms, if the total under the bill is 10 \nmillion covered, that means under the Grassley amendment it would be \n9.25 million covered; that is, about 750,000 kids could not be \neligible. These are kids who currently in these times need help. These \nare kids with families where, most likely, the parent is having a hard \ntime finding work or is maybe laid off, really struggling.\n  We know real wages have not gone up in this country at all in the \nlast decade. Times are tough for a lot of people. They may have lost \ntheir house or are losing their house or they may find their rent has \ngone up even more. There are a lot of reasons people are facing tough \neconomic times. These are the people we want to help.\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\n  Now, if these kids in working poor families do not get health \ninsurance, we all know the consequences. One is deferred health care. \nThey are not going to go to a doctor for checkups. They will not get \ntheir checkups. One is deferred medication. They do not get their \nmedication. They will get sick more likely.\n  When they get sick, what happens? Well, if they get real sick, they \nprobably have to go to the emergency room. What happens there? They get \nemergency care, deferred care. It is expensive care. It is postponed \ncare.\n  Then what happens? Well, they get the care in the emergency room, but \nthen what is the followup? They will not be seeing a doctor. They will \nnot be seeing a pediatrician. They will not be seeing an internist, \nsomebody who is a primary care doc, a family doc, who could follow up \nto make sure the child is doing well.\n  What else happens? Well, the costs in the emergency room are passed \non to somebody else. Who are they passed on to? We all know they are \npassed on to the hospitals, they are passed on to the doctors, who then \nhave to charge their private paying patients more. For those, frankly, \nwho are so concerned about private health insurance--and we all are \nvery much--the net effect of denying children coverage under the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is not only deferred care, it also \nmeans increased premiums for the private health insurance market. That \nmakes it sort of a vicious circle: the higher the premiums go, the \nharder it is for people, for families to get private health insurance. \nIt is a big problem.\n  You might ask, who are the 750,000 people the Grassley amendment \nwould deny participation in the Children's Health Insurance Program? \nReally, his amendment basically strikes the bill on the floor and \nreplaces it with what is called CHIP II. There is a big loss of \ncoverage for perfectly legal immigrants. These are people in our \ncountry, frankly, who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans. \nThey stood in line in some country legally to get to the point where \nthey would enter our country. They are going through the process \nlegally. They pay property taxes when they are in America, if they own \nreal property. They, hopefully, pay some income taxes. That means they \nwould have a decent job. They certainly pay sales taxes in this \ncountry. These are working people in our country.\n  They have served in our armed services. I am sure there are some over \nin Iraq, some in Afghanistan right now. These are perfectly legal folks \nin our country. The only difference is, they have to wait a little \nlonger to get full citizenship. But they are in line doing all that \nthey need to do under our law to get full citizenship.\n  They go to public schools in America. Legal immigrants go to school. \nThose are public programs. So it seems to me, if you have public \nprograms, such as schools and the other public programs like that, then \ncertainly children's health insurance should be fully available to them \nas well.\n  But, again, just as a basic reminder, the effect of the Grassley \namendment is to deny health insurance to about three-quarters of a \nmillion people compared with the underlying bill. I do not think we \nwant to deny coverage to the kids of the working poor who do need \nhealth insurance, especially during these very difficult economic \ntimes. So, therefore, I urge Senators not to support that amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from New Jersey \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will take a minute to salute the \nleadership of the Senator from Montana on the Finance Committee. He has \ndone a masterful job trying to keep things together as we get ourselves \nback to a more stable economy. I congratulate him for the work done and \nask him to continue to exert the effort and leadership he has thus far.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to protect the well-being of more \nthan 3,000 children in New Jersey.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 74\n\n  A particular focus as we seek to stimulate an economic revival is to \npreserve and protect the Children's Health Insurance Program which has \nhelped millions of kids get to a doctor for regular checkups to keep \nthem well and get them the medicines or treatment they need.\n  However, instead of continuing that safety net or strengthening it, \nthe Senator from Kentucky is targeting 3,000 children in my State, \nputting their coverage at risk. It is an assault on equity in our \ndiverse country. Incomes vary and certainly costs of living differ and \nFederal assistance to States reflects their subsistence needs.\n  This amendment will deprive children of essential health care. These \nchildren are from working families who are producing income--modest as \nit may be--not enough to take care of all their needs but, \nnevertheless, essential in their family circumstance.\n  I wish to note that while our economy is going deeper and deeper into \na recession, there is an attack on children's well-being by a Senator \nwhose State in 2005 was the ninth largest recipient of Federal \nassistance. His State--Kentucky--receives 90 cents more for every \ndollar they pay to the Federal Government than New Jersey does. With \nthe way my Republican colleagues are talking, one might think too many \nchildren in New Jersey are receiving health insurance.\n  While this assault is taking place, it is important to plead our case \nin the Senate. Right now, the number of children in New Jersey without \nhealth coverage is far above the national average. In fact, more than a \nquarter of a million kids in my State do not have health insurance, and \nnow the Bunning amendment would put more children in my State at risk \nof losing their health insurance.\n  One of the other serious problems with this amendment is it intimates \nthat costs among States are identical in each case. The Federal poverty \nlevel cannot be applied, for instance, equally in New Jersey and \nKentucky. In New Jersey, we have the twin problems of very high costs \nof living and very high health insurance costs. The cost of living in \nthe State of New Jersey is 30 percent higher than the national average. \nIn fact, only two other States have a higher cost of living than New \nJersey. Nearly all the families who rely on this program to get medical \ncare for their children still have to pay copays, monthly premiums, and \nother out-of-pocket expenses.\n  This amendment is a bomb intended to disrupt the process the entire \ncountry desperately wants to see accomplished--and that is protecting \nchildren's health.\n  Given New Jersey's contribution when it comes to filling other \nStates' needs, I find it particularly offensive. We know other States \nhave different needs than we do, and we join in supporting these needs. \nIf there is a natural disaster in a particular State, for example, the \nother 49 chip in. That is what our Republic demands.\n  Time and time again, New Jersey's taxpayers are asked to shoulder the \nburden to help other areas of the country that are in need, and for \nevery dollar New Jersey gives to the Federal Government, we only \nreceive 61 cents back. As a matter of fact, we are last in the list of \nStates. Compare that with Kentucky. For every dollar Kentucky pays to \nthe Treasury, it gets back $1.51.\n  Whether it is the Universal Service Fund for phone service, Essential \nAir Service in aviation or other programs, New Jersey gives far more \nthan it gets back.\n  The Bunning amendment is contrary to everything we are trying to \naccomplish on the floor this week. More than 3,000 children in New \nJersey are depending upon us now to protect their health. Whether it is \nillness, disease, violence, toxic pollution, terrorism or other \nthreats, it is our job to protect our children, particularly when they \nare holding out their hands in need. Children in New Jersey are \ndepending on the Members of this institution to oppose the Bunning \namendment.\n  Two years ago, on a bipartisan vote, the Senate rejected a similar \namendment that was offered by the Senator from Kentucky. It is an \nassault he continues with. I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment \nonce again. Do it with a flourish, and do it with emphasis, because we \nhave to stop States picking on other States in our moments of great \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 47\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to address one of the amendments \nthat will be coming up. There is a series of votes at 3:10 this \nafternoon. That is about 25 minutes from now. The first vote scheduled \nwill be on the Coburn amendment No. 47. That is the amendment that \ndeals with premium assistance.\n  Essentially, this amendment requires States to substitute premium \nassistance for the traditional Children's Health Insurance Program and \nMedicaid for children above the income eligibility determined by a \nState as of January 1, 2009. Basically what that says is this: If a \nState decides it wants to cover more children--let's not forget, when \nthis program was enacted in 1997, the decision was that this would be a \nblock grant program to give States the option, first, as to whether \nthey want to participate in the program and also the option to design \nprograms the way they think makes most sense in their States.\n  In 1997, the debate was should this be an entitlement program, such \nas Medicaid, where children of the working poor are entitled to get \nhealth insurance, as people are entitled to get health care under \nMedicaid. This Congress made the decision, no, it should not be an \nentitlement program, it should be a block grant program.\n  What does that mean? It means Congress, roughly every 5 years, \nreauthorizes the Children's Health Insurance Program. It provides money \nfor the programs and money is allocated to the States under a formula. \nObviously, larger population States would get more dollars than lower \npopulation States. But there is a match; that is, the Federal \nGovernment will pay a certain percentage for the program and the States \npay another percentage. Under the formula, the Federal Government pays \na little more than do the States.\n  Nevertheless, that is what Congress decided in 1997, and this \nlegislation before us basically continues that same approach. It is a \nState option. States can decide for themselves what children they want \nto include. They can determine what level of poverty applies.\n  The Coburn amendment says: OK, let's say some States currently set \ntheir eligibility rates for low-income children, let's say, at 175 \npercent of poverty. That is not unlikely. There are a lot of States \nthat are in that neighborhood. In fact, my State of Montana, until this \nlast year, had 175 percent of poverty. They passed a referendum raising \nthat to 250 percent of poverty.\n  This legislation says if a State wants to increase its eligibility \nrate, any increase that is in effect after January 1 of this year means \nthat the State cannot put those children into the Children's Health \nInsurance Program but, rather, must take the money and apply it to \npremium assistance.\n  What does that mean? That means that money has to go to families to \nbuy private health insurance coverage for their children. They cannot \ngo into the program. But that money they get has to buy private health \ninsurance. The fancy term is ``premium assistance.''\n  The amendment goes further. It says, in addition to that, when you \nhave to buy private health insurance, with premium assistance, you have \nto wait 6 months. You cannot get it right away. You have to wait 6 \nmonths. So there is going to be a period, 6 months, where kids will \nhave no health insurance. Not only are they not covered under the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, but they cannot get health \ninsurance.\n  What if somebody gets sick during that 6-month period? They cannot \nget insurance in the public program. They cannot get private health \ninsurance. They have to wait. Tell me what sense that makes. I cannot \nunderstand how that makes any sense at all. The first requirement makes \nno sense to me. It is wrong, in my view. The second adds insult to \ninjury.\n  For those reasons, I strongly encourage Members not to support the \nCoburn amendment. It has a very restrictive effect. It makes it very \ndifficult for kids in working poor families to get health insurance. \nLet's not forget we are in difficult times. These are recession times. \nPeople do not have jobs. Health insurance is very expensive, extremely \nexpensive in the private market. There is discrimination in the \nindividual market. Insurance companies can discriminate against you. If \nyou have a preexisting condition, they can say: no health insurance. If \nyou have a history of medical care, they can say: Sorry, you have been \nsick too much; we are not going to cover you, and for other reasons.\n  Let's say a child falls into this category; that is, the State raises \neligibility and this child is currently in a family that is 175 percent \nof poverty, now at 250 percent of poverty. They are still the working \npoor. That is a very poor family. Let's say that person applies for \nhealth insurance because they lost their job. Let's say the insurance \ncompany applies normal preexisting rules in the market. Not only can \nthat person not get health insurance in that 6-month period, they may \nnot get it at all.\n  I strongly urge Members not to support this amendment. The practical \neffect of this amendment is to significantly discourage health \ninsurance for poor kids, kids belonging to working poor families. I \nurge the amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 83\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are a lot of amendments around here \nflying fast and furious. Frankly, we have read them in the past several \nminutes. I have one amendment in my hand. We received that a few \nminutes ago. It is hard to go through it quickly. I am not complaining. \nThat is sometimes the way the Senate operates.\n  As a consequence, I think I overstated, after my staff read the full \namendment, the number of kids that the Grassley amendment would cover \ncompared with the underlying bill.\n  As I mentioned earlier, current law covers about 6 million children. \nThe bill before us would add approximately 4 million more--roughly 10 \nmillion. I stated the amendment offered by Senator Grassley from Iowa \nwould have the effect of reducing coverage by about three-quarters of a \nmillion people. I said about 750,000 fewer kids would be covered if the \nGrassley amendment were adopted to this bill.\n  It looks as if I have overstated that figure. We checked with CBO. On \nthe other hand, we don't know what the right figure is. CBO does not \nknow. While I probably overstated the figure, it is probably less than \nor fewer than 750,000 kids, but we don't know how much less.\n  Looking at the bill rationally, analytically, clearly the Grassley \nsubstitute will cover fewer kids. Why? Because the Grassley substitute \ndoes not allow coverage for legal immigrants who have not waited 5 \nyears. That clearly means there are a lot of kids in that category. \nObviously, there are going to be fewer kids covered.\n  Second, the Grassley amendment uses the formulation in the second \nvetoed bill in 2007, and that second vetoed bill is more restrictive \nthan the first vetoed bill. If we look at those two different \ncategories, first, legal immigrants, and, second, with the definition \nof coverage under the second bill, compare the two with the underlying \nbill and a good number of kids will not be covered.\n  We do not know exactly how many, but it will be quite a few. We \npretty much think it will not be 750,000 fewer, but it is going to be \nquite a bit fewer.\n  I apologize to my good friend from Iowa for making that mistake. It \nwas an honest mistake. Things happen fast around here, and that was our \nfirst impression looking at the amendment. After we called CBO and \nstudied it further to find the exact number, we realized I was \nincorrect in the statement I gave. But again, we don't know what the \nexact number is.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment, No. 74.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 74\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the next amendment is the Bunning \namendment. I think under the agreement Senator Bunning is recognized to \nspeak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Bunning amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have had to modify my amendment \nslightly because CBO says directing more money to outreach and \nenrollment creates a score. So I have taken the outreach section out.\n  However, the amendment is still very simple. It removes the exception \nfor New York and New Jersey to cover families above 300 percent of \npoverty and get the highest SCHIP matching rate. Instead, they would \nget the lower Medicaid matching rate covering these families like every \nother State in the Union. So you have a choice today: Require the \npeople of your State to pay more taxes so New York and New Jersey can \ncover families who make $77,000 or $88,000 or treat every State the \nsame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Bunning amendment is the fourth amendment this week \nthat would put a cap on the eligibility of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, a cap to prevent kids from entering the program. \nYesterday, we rejected a Cornyn amendment with a cap of 200 percent of \npoverty, a Roberts amendment with a $65,000 cap, and a Murkowski \namendment with a conditional cap of 300 percent of poverty. Now the \nBunning amendment would set a hard cap at 300 percent of poverty. We \nshould vote this down for the same reasons we voted the others down; \nthat is, because it deprives kids of getting health insurance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to table the Bunning amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nHatch amendment No. 80.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment would codify the 2002 HHS \nregulation which gives States the option of providing CHIP coverage to \nchildren before as well as after birth. Fourteen States have already \napproved plans to provide CHIP coverage to children before birth: \nArkansas, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Oklahoma, \nOregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  This amendment also allows States to provide health services to the \nmother for 60 days after the birth of her child. In addition, the \namendment also would provide health coverage to pregnant women for \nissues not relating to the pregnancy. This amendment will continue \nallowing States to promote the health of children and their mothers \nbefore and after birth by codifying the 2002 HHS regulation.\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\n  I am happy to have a number of cosponsors on this amendment, \nincluding the distinguished Presiding Officer. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Hatch amendment would codify the \ndivisive Bush regulation that only covers the unborn child but not the \nmother. In other words, they separate the two. What we do in the \nunderlying bill is we cover both. We cover the pregnant woman and the \nchild she is carrying. There is no reason to have this amendment. Look \nat page 50 of the bill. It clearly states that prenatal care will be \ndelivered to that pregnant woman. This is about adding abortion to this \ndebate. It doesn't belong in this debate. It is not necessary. We have \nalready voted this down twice. I trust we will vote it down now.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The need to provide health care coverage for expectant \nmothers is clear and the State Children's Health Insurance Program \nreauthorization being considered allows States to provide coverage to \npregnant mothers.\n  While I support the policy of providing health coverage to pregnant \nmothers in the pending legislation, this amendment is an effort to \nadvance a political cause rather than provide a medical necessity.\n  This amendment has no practical effect in terms of health care \ncoverage for pregnant women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am aware of only a couple more \namendments that require rollcall votes before we go to final passage.

Second, shortly we will hear \nfrom Senator Coburn on his substitute amendment No. 86, and I expect \nthis amendment may also require a rollcall vote. In addition, I hope we \ncan address two amendments by the ranking Republican member, Senator \nGrassley, and I have some hope that we will be able to address those \namendments with voice votes. I am hoping the remaining amendments may \nonly require voice votes. So Senators should be aware that we are \ngetting close to finishing this bill.

Madam President, in deference to my colleague from \nOklahoma, I won't speak on the amendment at this point, but I will \nbriefly state its purpose.\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\n  The purpose of this amendment is to help American taxpayers pay for \ntheir children's health care to the same degree we are forcing them to \nhelp pay for the health care of noncitizen children in this underlying \nbill. Specifically, it would provide all eligible American families \nwith an above-the-line Federal income tax deduction for each child \ncomparable to the average Federal share of the benefit provided to any \nnoncitizen child under the SCHIP legislation.\n  I will speak more about the bill following Senator Coburn's \nintroduction of his amendment, but for now I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 86\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that American children have high-quality health \n               coverage that fits their individual needs)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 86.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself, Mr. \n     Burr, and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 86.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the bill we are considering is designed \nto help low-income kids have coverage and have care. What do we know \nabout the kids who are in those programs and the care they have? Here \nis one of the things we know: They don't have access to 60 percent of \nthe doctors in this country because the reimbursement rates are so low \nthey won't be seen. That is the first thing. No. 2 is they don't have \naccess to the best drugs because a lot of Medicaid programs and SCHIP \nwon't pay for the best drugs for those children.\n  I got to thinking about this bill and what it does and what it is \nintended to do. What is in agreement in the Senate is that we want all \nof the kids covered. We want every child in this country to be able to \nhave access to quality care with no limitation of their choice of who \ntheir doctor is going to be--the one the child and the parent feel the \nmost comfortable with--because we know if that is the case, they are \ngoing to be most compliant. So we want them to have the greatest care, \nand we want every one of them to be able to have access to care.\n  This bill brings up Government payments under SCHIP to 300 percent of \nthe poverty level--60,000 bucks, essentially. Anybody making, \nessentially, over that wouldn't be benefited by this bill but everybody \nunder it. It adds $70 billion worth of taxes to the American people to \nbe able to do that. As it does it, it takes 2 million kids who are \npresently covered by insurance off insurance and gets 2 million out of \nthe 8.9 million or 9.8 million kids who aren't covered today with \nanything. So we are going to spend $70 billion to get 4 million kids, a \nlittle less than 4 million kids covered, of which we are going to \nabsorb the costs that are already being paid by businesses for those \nkids right now.\n  By the way, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators McConnell, Enzi, \nCornyn, DeMint, Johanns, Kyl, Alexander, Graham, Burr, Chambliss, \nThune, and Barrasso as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. So maybe it is instructive for us to look at what we are \ndoing right now and say: What could we do with that money? Right now, \nwe have 31 million kids in America who don't have private coverage. In \nother words, we have 31 million out of the 78 million kids who don't \nget to choose where they want to go, don't get to have the best drugs, \ndon't get the referral to the best centers, don't get the referral to \nthe best doctors because they are on a Government-run program. So 8.9 \nmillion kids aren't even covered by any program right now, and not all \nof those 8.9 million kids are in families who are at 300 percent of the \npoverty level or less. This is based on 2005 numbers, and we know it is \ngreater now, but these numbers for the number of children are accurate \nright now. We are spending $67 billion to do that.\n  What does that mean? That means we are spending $2,160 each to cover \n22 million kids. Well, if you divided the 31 million kids who are out \nthere into this number, you would get $2,160 available for every child \nat 300 percent of the poverty level who is not covered right now by \ntheir parents, and that includes Medicaid and SCHIP. So you have $2,160 \nto work with.\n  Now, the average price in the individual market in this country is \nless than $1,200 a year. Some will say: Well, that coverage is not as \ngood. Well, let's make it $1,700, which is $300 more than what our kids \ncost. Let's make it $1,700, or let's make it $1,800, or let's make it \n$2,160. What could we buy for $2,160 for every kid at 300 percent of \nthe poverty level or less who is not on the program? What we could buy \nfor all of them is a top-grade policy outside of Government-run \nprograms that would give insurance to 100 percent of the children who \ndon't have insurance and give them 100 percent access to every quality \ndoctor in this country on a competitive basis and give them access to \nthe drugs the Members of Congress' kids have access to and the same \ndoctors to whom the Members of Congress have access.\n  The important point is, we have a government-run program and the \nadministrative costs and the inefficiencies of it cost more than \nprivate insurance, than if we would just go out and buy every one of \nthese guys an FEHPB--Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan--a top-\ndrawer plan. Why would we run it through the Government? Why would we \ntake away choice? Why would we take away access by running it through a \ngovernment-run program and one that is highly inefficient?\n  There is another thing we should know. The rate of fraud in private \ninsurance products is about 3 percent. The rate of fraud in Medicaid is \n10.4 percent, and in SCHIP it is 14 percent. So because the Government \nis running the program and we can't run it well and we don't run it \nwell, we are losing about 11 percent or 11 cents out of every dollar \nthat we are trying to get to kids because we can't run efficient or \neffective programs.\n  So wouldn't it be smarter, rather than to have all of this \ngobbledygook government, to make sure that every kid in this country \nwhose parents don't make $60,000, who isn't covered with insurance \ntoday, has access to a top-drawer health insurance policy that gives \nthem 100 percent access, gives them 100 percent quality, and gives them \n100 percent access to the drugs and the physicians they want? Who is \ngoing to argue with that?\n  As a matter of fact, several of my colleagues are cosponsors of the \nHealthy Americans Act, and that is exactly what it does. It is going to \nbe very interesting to see if they are cosponsors of this bill but yet \ndon't vote for this for kids. And that is a bipartisan bill. So if it \nis good enough for all of America and if it is good enough for the \nMembers of Congress and their kids and if it is good enough for Federal \nemployees, why can't we give that to the children of this country who \ndon't have health insurance? Why can't we do that? We can't do it \nbecause it doesn't fit into the partisan rancor of Washington.\n  This is a commonsense proposal that doesn't cost a penny more than \nwhat we spent in 2005. And we cover all of the kids, not just 4 million \nmore; we cover 8.9 million more with the same amount of money. All the \nchildren have access.\n  It is not a child's fault if their parents can't afford or don't have \na job that gives them access to 100 percent of physicians or access to \nthe best medicines or access to equal care. It is not the child's \nfault. So if we are going to spend this much of the American taxpayers' \nmoney, why don't we get value for it? Why don't we decide we want value \nfor this money?\n  So if you take all the kids out there--31 million--on what we spent \nin 2005, you can spend $2,160 on every one of them--every one of them--\nand get them a top-drawer health insurance policy. Top drawer. Top of \nthe line. That is almost double what the charge is for an individual \npolicy now. So we could spend almost twice as much to get that same \ncoverage. Why would we\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\nnot do that? What is going to keep us from helping all the kids?\n  I will tell my colleagues the other aspect of it. We are also not \ngoing to raise taxes $71 billion if we do this plan. Let me say that \nagain. President Obama said your taxes won't be raised. This bill \nraises $71 billion--granted, from tobacco products, which I don't have \nany objection to--but let's save the $71 billion on tobacco products \nfor something else when we can efficiently buy our kids health care and \nbuy them a health insurance policy.\n  Another key point: As somebody who has cared for Medicaid kids and \nMedicaid moms, when you have the ``Medicaid'' stamp on your forehead, \nit is not equivalent care. When we give all these children access to a \nprivate insurance policy of their own, it is no longer a Medicaid \nprogram, it is their insurance policy. Providers will never know how \nthey got that policy. They will never know if it was an employment-\nbased policy, an individually bought policy, or a policy that comes \nthrough SCHIP and Medicaid.\n  What we do is we take the demeaning qualities and characteristics of \nhaving to be dependent through a government program, and we throw that \nout. So the bias goes out, the discrimination goes out, and the self-\nesteem goes up.\n  What will happen if this passes? The first thing that will happen is \nwe will save $70 billion. The second thing that will happen is not 4 \nmillion kids--actually, it is a net 2 million kids will get coverage--\n8.9 million kids will get coverage, and we will do it with the same \namount of money we spent in 2005. Every child will be covered. There \nwill be a real choice of who is going to be your provider. Right now \nyou get hustled into whoever will take care of you in these programs. \nSome are great and some are not. Confidence will be restored. There \nwill be increased quality of outcome and increased access to \nspecialists who now today cannot afford to see a Medicaid or SCHIP \npatient because their overhead is so great.\n  Finally, $70 billion--I know we are talking about $1 trillion in the \nstimulus package--doesn't seem like much, but $70 billion is a lot of \nmoney. If you look at it, it is about $2,000 per man, woman, and child \nover the next 5 years that we will save in this country.\n  If the goal of SCHIP and all the speeches we have heard all week long \nis to care for kids, to make sure kids have access, to make sure they \nhave care, if that is the goal, then anybody who is not going to vote \nfor this amendment is not secure in saying they want to cover all the \nkids. This one will.\n  This substitute allows the Secretary to develop autoenrollment. There \nis $100 million in this amendment so we can have outreach, trying to \nget kids coverage. This takes away the negative consequences of \napplying for Medicaid or applying for SCHIP when your parents cannot \nafford to get you coverage.\n  The other thing it does is there is a compensation in terms of making \nsure we help people who have insurance keep their insurance by \ncompensating to keep them on their employer's insurance, which costs a \nwhole lot less. It costs maybe $200 or $300 a year. But the most \nimportant thing it does is it provides liberty and freedom and equal \naccess for every child in this country.\n  They are going to say this will not work. But notice there is not \ngoing to be a point of order filed against this amendment because this \namendment does not cost any money. It saves money. It does not cost a \npenny. It will not cost us and will cover so many more children.\n  My question to my colleagues, as we wrap up the SCHIP bill, is: Do \nyou want to do it right? Do you want to do it better? Do you want to \ncover all the kids. Or do you want to play the games of Washington and \npolitical gamesmanship and partisanship and say: Yes, I care about the \nkids, but I couldn't do the right thing, the easy thing, the \ncommonsense thing, the things that are associated with order, priority, \nand common sense that says: Gosh, we can buy and get better coverage \nfor less money; why wouldn't we do that?\n  We are going to hear all the reasons. We may not hear any because \nmost of the amendments I offered nobody will debate them. They know \nthey have the votes to defeat them so they will not debate. They will \nnot come out and say why this would not be a good idea.\n  The American taxpayers ought to think: Here is a great opportunity \nfor us to save a ton of money and do something very good socially: \ncover innocent children with quality health care that they do not have \naccess to today, with no increase in cost--with no increase in cost. \nYet we are going to see a vote where they are going to say no. Then we \nare going to know if you care about kids and whether you care about \naccess for kids.\n  I will end my debate at this time and yield to my colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Burr.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Vitter as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, we are at a point where the rubber meets \nthe road. We are challenged daily in this institution and across the \ncountry by the American people to find solutions to real problems. In \n1997, we found a problem. It was called uninsured children. In the \nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, I was one of those who crafted the \noriginal SCHIP program. It was the right way to go at that time.\n  Health care has changed a lot since 1997. We have continued to \nreauthorize SCHIP. We have talked about expansions. As a matter of \nfact, we debated, over the last couple days, why an expansion of \neligibility actually hurts low-income children, the ones below 300 \npercent of poverty. Why does a State want to increase the eligibility \nincome of beneficiaries under SCHIP? It is because there are some kids \nwho are hard to get to. They are hard to find to give them health care. \nRather than leave anything on the table, states would like for us to \nmake it easier by expanding the pool of eligibility so we can take \nhigher income kids and put them in the program.\n  In 2008, there were 7.4 million kids enrolled in SCHIP. It is a 4-\npercent increase from 2007, but it is a little bit misleading because \nwithin that 7.4 million, the monthly average was 5.5 million kids \nenrolled in SCHIP. What that implies is there are 1.9 million kids who \nsort of rotate in and rotate out of SCHIP because they possibly migrate \nfrom one State to another. So they are not permanent enrollees.\n  Throughout these days, we have heard Members say our objective is \nthat we want to cover as many kids as possible. Now we have Members \nstanding and saying, as many kids as possible is not what the goal \nshould be of the Senate. The goal should be every child under 300 \npercent should be covered.\n  Dr. Coburn did a very good job of spelling out for us that we have \nquite a large pool of individuals. We have 49 million kids under 300 \npercent of the poverty level. Of the 78 million kids in America, 22.1 \nmillion are currently under Federal programs--Medicaid and SCHIP; 8.9 \nmillion kids are uninsured.\n  We have a proposal in front of this body. That Baucus proposal is to \nraise taxes of $70 billion-plus and to cover 5.7 million of the 8.9 \nmillion uninsured. Actually, that is not the case because of the 5.7 \nmillion, 2 million are currently covered by their parents' insurance. \nWe are actually going to increase the rolls by 3.7 million children for \n$70 billion-plus. We still leave quite a few kids out there without \ninsurance, without coverage. Even though their families have too much \nmoney for Medicaid, and they are not enrolled in SCHIP.\n  This is the time to reform this program. This is the time to say \nlet's design a program that catches 100 percent of the kids at 300 \npercent of poverty and below. This is the time to totally rethink how \nwe deliver this care.\n  As a matter of fact, the proposal that Dr. Coburn has made not only \ncan be funded without the $70 billion tax increase and cover 100 \npercent of the kids, but it actually saves the American taxpayers $144 \nbillion over 5 years. There is the part you did not hear from Dr. \nCoburn. We actually save $144 billion over 5 years.\n  You see, the current Baucus proposal on the table is going to \nincrease enrollment of uninsured children under 300 percent of poverty, \nand it is going to cost $74 billion. If you add that to the number of \nuninsured who remain in the pot, which is 2.9 million, under the way \nthey have approached this bill, it\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\nwould cost roughly $70 billion more to cover that pool of 2.9 million. \nSo, in fact, for my colleagues, if you want to know what we have done \nin this amendment, as Dr. Coburn said, we have come up with a health \ncare proposal that covers 100 percent of the uninsured children under \n300 percent of the poverty level, and in doing it, we have saved the \nAmerican taxpayers $144 billion over the next 5 years if--if--the goal \nis to cover 100 percent of the uninsured children under 300 percent of \npoverty. We only save $144 billion if that is the intent to cover all.\n\n  If the intent is to cover all, why in the world would you spend $144 \nbillion more dollars if you can do it with today's dollars?\n  Congress--the Senate and the House--has been deficient since the \nbeginning of this program because we do not cover all the kids. Yet I \nremember that was the objective the day we wrote the bill. Let's get on \na path to cover all.\n  We are also deficient in the fact that the way SCHIP is structured, \nwe rely on the 60 percent of all health care providers who actually see \nthis population. Forty percent of the health care professionals in this \ncountry restrict access to Medicaid beneficiaries or SCHIP \nbeneficiaries. We have now limited the pool of professionals to 40 \npercent.\n  With the changes in this amendment, we now open the pool to 100 \npercent. We increase the choice of a child with Medicaid and SCHIP, and \nwe have now put them in a product where 100 percent of the health care \nprofessionals, in fact, will invite them in and be their medical home \nor their primary doctor, their pediatrician. Without this amendment, we \nwill continue to serve less than 100 percent of the 300 percent of \npoverty and below, and we also limit the number of health care \nprofessionals who are going to see these children, that generation whom \nwe feel incredibly committed to make sure are successful, not just in \nlife but in health.\n  This does not need to go on, but I do wish to make this point to my \ncolleagues. This is not another amendment. I know we have had votes on \namendments for the last 2 days, and we routinely come down here and it \nis pretty much a party-line vote, although I learned earlier in this \ndebate that when one Republican votes for it out of committee, it is \nnow bipartisan. I am not sure that is the definition President Obama \nhad of ``bipartisanship'' when he gave a wonderful inauguration speech \non these Capitol stairs. Given that one Republican did vote for the \nbill, it is now bipartisan.\n  This amendment is about the next generation. It is about the most at-\nrisk children in this country. It is about a real option and a real \nchoice, where that population has full coverage, sees any doctor, \nenters any medical delivery point in the system, and saves $144 billion \nover what we would have to spend under the current method. It does not \neliminate SCHIP. As a matter of fact, we reauthorize SCHIP for 2 \nadditional years while the Secretary is able to put together the \narchitecture for this product to be in the marketplace.\n  This is a real opportunity for this body to change the direction and, \nmore importantly, to fulfill the promise that is made over and over on \nthis Senate floor, that what we are doing is to make sure every child \nin America has health care coverage. If we adopt this amendment, if we \nvote yes for Tom Coburn's amendment, we will have completed that \npromise we made to America's children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise for three or four purposes that \nI will do in succession.\n  No. 1, I would like to define bipartisanship for the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. No. 2, I want to give a statement in support of the \nCoburn amendment. No. 3, I would like to bring to final debate my \namendment 83, if the majority manager would like to vote on it at that \ntime--and that would be a voice vote--and then I would have my last \namendment to introduce, which is amendment No. 71 that I would speak \nabout.\n  First of all, I think I know something about establishing \nbipartisanship in the Senate. I was part of a bipartisan proposal 2 \nyears ago that maybe Senator Burr didn't like, but it was very \nbipartisan. It is kind of an institutional thing, bipartisanship, as \nfar as I practice it in the Senate and as Senator Baucus has practiced \nit, up until this particular amendment. What you do to get to be \nbipartisan, you sit across the table from each other, Republican and \nDemocrat--and maybe more than one Republican, maybe more than one \nDemocrat--with expert staff, and you build up a piece of legislation \nthat is eventually put before the committee as a Baucus-Grassley bill \nor as a Grassley-Baucus bill, depending on who is in the majority. Then \nwhat you do is you make up your mind that you are going to be arm in \narm defending that through the committee process, through the Senate, \nthrough conference, and all the way to the President. And you try to \nmaintain 65 to 70 votes within the Senate. That is the way I define \nbipartisanship.\n  It is a little bit like if you and your wife were going to buy a new \ncar for that old jeep that you drive around. If you said it is going to \nbe a family affair, you would be sitting down with your wife and \nasking: What kind of a car do you want? What color do you want? What \naccessories do you want? You wouldn't go up to your wife, I hope, and \nsay: Honey, we are going to buy a new car. This is what we are going to \nbuy and it is a mutual decision. You wouldn't do that. You would work \nwith your wife to decide what kind of car you want.\n  So if you want bipartisanship in the Congress of the United States--\nand I am sure that is what our President was talking about during his \ncampaign--you have to work together to get it. But it is not like this \nissue was handled--or maybe I can speak more accurately about the \nstimulus issue that will be up next week--where 48 hours or 24 hours \nbefore it comes up, Republicans are given a document and are notified \nthat this is what we are going to do.\n  So I say to the Senator from North Carolina, that is my definition on \nwhat bipartisanship is. I don't know whether you agree with it, but at \nleast that is what I have tried to practice, and I think Senator Baucus \nhas basically tried to practice that as well.\n  Mr. BURR. If the Senator will yield, that is the definition I \nunderstand exactly. But that is not the process we completed on SCHIP \nor the stimulus package. My hope is the President will win at the end \nof the day.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, one of the reasons I said I came to \nthe floor was to speak about the Coburn amendment and to say why I am \ngoing to vote for it. This amendment, which has been the product of \nSenator Coburn's and Senator Burr's speeches a few minutes ago, \npresents a fundamental choice about how we will go forward with health \ncare reform in this country. Now, I wish to emphasize ``how we will go \nforward with health care reform,'' which is maybe the next health care \nissue that is going to be before our Senate.\n  The underlying bill covers 4 million kids. It leaves 2 million kids \nwithout coverage. Why? Well, as CBO has told us so often, if you ask \nState government to go out and cover kids, as we do in Medicaid and the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, States need more and more Federal \ndollars to do so. So let's face it, that is exactly how this bill \nworks. We throw billions of dollars at the States, and the States go \nout and find kids and pay for their health care. The more money we \nthrow at the States, the more kids they cover. The less money we throw \nat States, the fewer kids they cover.\n  The Coburn amendment takes a totally different approach. This \namendment generally follows the successful way that the Medicare Part D \nbenefit works. By the way, let me say parenthetically about Medicare \nPart D, which has been law now for 4 or 5 years, it is about the only \nFederal program I know about that has come in under budget. I am not \ntalking about just for 1 year, I am talking about the projections CBO \nmade for it at that time for the 10 years into the future. I don't have \nan exact figure in mind now, but maybe 6 months ago I used a figure \nthat was in the billions of dollars that it was under what we \nanticipated spending.\n  So we are talking about a Coburn amendment that follows the pattern \nof Part D Medicare, which works, and it\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\nis financially a protection for the taxpayers' dollars. If the Federal \nand State governments work together to create a healthier market, the \nprivate sector will be more efficient in covering kids. That is the \nPart D model. That is the model we have before us in the Coburn \namendment. It is the private sector, on the one hand, in that \nphilosophy, versus the public sector on the other hand.\n  I wish my colleagues had more time to fully develop this with the \nCongressional Budget Office because the contrast this amendment paints \nis one we are going to be facing in the health care reform. So I wish \nto emphasize that the next health care debate we have is going to be \nhealth care reform and we ought to have that debate and we ought to \nbring about the reform that is necessary.\n  So let's think of that as laying the groundwork for a lot of debate \nthat we are going to have in the upcoming issue of health care reform. \nBasic questions: Do we want a government-run solution? Is growing our \nGovernment bureaucracy in the area of health care the pathway to \ncovering all Americans? Or do we want governments to help the market \nwork better; or possibilities of Government and private partnerships? \nDo we want to harness the ingenuity that is out there in the private \nsector in covering all Americans?\n  Now, I don't answer those questions, but those are questions \neverybody in this body, and I hope grassroots America, will look at in \nthe coming months. With this vote, I am giving you a partial answer to \nmy approach to these questions.\n  I would like to go on to, hopefully, what will lead us to a vote on \namendment No. 83, I believe is the number of the amendment, but before \nI do that, I would like to speak about an issue that came up when I was \noff the floor earlier this afternoon. The chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, my friend, Senator Baucus, characterized the \nGrassley-Hatch amendment I offered earlier as not covering 750,000 \nindividuals as compared to the underlying bill. This is about my \namendment 83.\n  Now, I understand Senator Baucus later came to the floor to \nacknowledge that his characterization of the Grassley-Hatch amendment \nwas incorrect and he apologized, and I thank him for that. However, the \nchairman is still inaccurate, from my point of view, in some \ncharacterizations of the Grassley-Hatch amendment, and that is what I \nwish to go into.\n  The chairman stated my amendment would cover fewer individuals \nbecause it does not include the legal immigrant provision. I would like \nto draw all my colleagues' attention, but particularly Senator Baucus' \nattention, to footnote ``f'' on the enrollment table of the \nCongressional Budget Office production on the underlying bill. Footnote \n``f'' states:\n\n       The Medicaid and SCHIP figures and the Medicaid SCHIP total \n     may include some legal immigrant children and pregnant women \n     who receive health insurance provided through State-funded \n     programs.\n\n  In other words, the so-called new enrollments of legal immigrants are \nactually individuals who are currently insured with State or local \nfunds. In terms of additional enrollment figures, the chairman notes \ncorrectly that we don't have a CBO table. He is correct that we don't \nknow the actual enrollment numbers resulting from the Grassley-Hatch \namendment.\n  I would reiterate what I said earlier. The amendment we are going to \nbe voting on is the same bill that 55 Members of this body--and they \nare presently Members of this body--voted on and successfully passed by \na wide margin in 2007. So I have to ask the question, before we vote on \nmy amendment: If it was good enough then, why isn't it good enough now?\n\n  If the majority doesn't want to vote on this now, I will go on to \noffer my other amendment. Do I ask for the question, Madam President, \non amendment No. 83?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not the pending amendment.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, there is no reason we can't make it the \npending amendment. But I would like to say, first, very briefly, that I \ndeeply appreciate the remarks by my good friend. I know all of us are \ntrying to get the right numbers, the accurate numbers. It is a search \nfor the truth, and CBO has not given us the right number, so it is hard \nto know exactly what the effect will be.\n  It seemed to me, somewhat logically, that the inclusion of legal \nimmigrants would mean probably more people covered, even though some \nmay be covered some other ways. We don't know the number, but that is \nsort of the effect. Therefore, I say to my colleagues, I think it is \nbetter to include more people, more kids, in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program and not fewer.\n  With respect to the vote on the last bill, where 55 Members of the \nSenate supported it, and the Senator's question: If not then, why not \nnow, the answer is because now the underlying bill is a little better. \nIt covers more kids. It is better to cover a few more kids than not to \ncover a few more kids. So that is why it is not right now where it \nmight have been right then.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to the \nGrassley amendment. Notwithstanding the other amendments, I ask that we \nproceed to the Grassley amendment at this point.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 83\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is now pending.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 83) was rejected.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 71\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would, first of all, like to give my \nrationale for an amendment I am going to present to the Senate before I \nactually present it. It will be amendment No. 71, though.\n  Congress has known for some time that the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram faces expiration March 31 of this year. We all knew Congress \nwould have to act quickly once the new session got underway. The \nmajority had three different options they could have taken in moving \nforward. First, they could have simply picked up one of the two vetoed \nbills and quickly passed it. It would have received bipartisan support. \nI would have preferred the second bill over the first, but I could have \nprobably found a way to support the first bill. Either of those bills \nwould have moved quickly and would have had significant bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The second option the majority could have taken was to do a short-\nterm extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program while we \nworked on broader health care reform. That is what this amendment does. \nIt is a six-quarter extension of SCHIP through the end of the next \nfiscal year.\n  Now, I do understand there is a point of order against this \namendment. This amendment actually should have been done on the \nstimulus bill, where everything and the kitchen sink appears to be \ngoing, but that is a debate for next week. It would have been a drop in \nthe bucket on that bill.\n  If the underlying bill is enacted, it will provide coverage to many \npeople who were previously uninsured--approximately 4 million \nchildren--by the year 2013. While I don't want to denigrate the \naccomplishments of this bill, everyone in this Chamber knows we need to \nroll up our sleeves and get to work on covering the other 42 million \nuninsured Americans who will not benefit from this bill--millions of \nwhom are children this bill does not provide coverage for.\n  I wish to focus on that task. I want us to work in a bipartisan \nmanner to get coverage for all Americans, and everything in that \nprocess so far has been bipartisan, but it is something we are going to \nhave to deal with on SCHIP again. So I am willing and ready to do the \nhard work it is going to take. We could have set aside SCHIP while we \nfocused on that most important task of full-fledged health care reform. \nInstead, the majority has chosen a third option: to bring up a bill \nthat walks away from the bipartisanship of 2007 and threatens \nrelationships moving forward with broad health care reform. I want to \nemphasize ``threatens'' because so far everything has been bipartisan \nin meetings and discussions and everything.\n\n  I have made no secret of my disappointment in the changes made in the \nunderlying bill. It is very important that people watching the debate \nunderstand how totally unnecessary a\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\npartisan fight is. The majority had bipartisan bills they could have \nbrought up for consideration. I had an amendment earlier that would \nhave replaced the underlying bill with the second of those earlier \nbills. The majority could have done a simple extension of SCHIP while \nwe worked together on covering 46 million uninsured, not just the 4 \nmillion covered by this legislation. That is what this amendment does. \nIt is the last chance for cooler heads to prevail.\n  It was reported recently that the Speaker of the House said, ``We won \nthe election. We write the bills.'' Seeing the majority take that \napproach on the Children's Health Insurance Program, an issue that \nalways had broad bipartisan support, does not give me comfort moving \nforward on health care reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup my amendment, No. 71. I do not know how much debate there will be on \nit, but I have nothing more to say on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 71.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To extend the State Children's Health Insurance Program for 6 \n   quarters in order to enact bipartisan, comprehensive health care \n                                reform)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very simply, I do not agree with this \namendment. Why? Because here we are. It is about 5 o'clock. We are on \nthe verge of passing a 4\\1/2\\ year reauthorization of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. We are on the 2-yard line. We are about ready \nto put this ball across the goal to score a touchdown, to get this \npassed. This amendment sets us back several yards, quite a few yards. \nWe are on the 2-yard line for a 4\\1/2\\ year reauthorization. If this is \nagreed to, we are back to the 50-yard line.\n  I think it is better to get this bill past the goal line and pass \nthis 4\\1/2\\ year\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\nlegislation. I urge we do not adopt this amendment that sets us back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to emphasize that I do not \ndisagree with what he said, he said it accurately, but here is the \npoint I am trying to make. In just a few months, we are going to be \nworking on health care reform and we are going to be working, within \nthose few months, on how the Children's Health Insurance Program fits \nin with it. We are going to be going through this exercise once again, \nso we wasted a lot of time here for nothing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I hope not for nothing. This is pretty \nproductive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 71) was rejected.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 85\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments about \nDeMint amendment No. 85. This is an amendment that I believe is very \nimportant to American families, taxpayers. Here in Washington, there \nseems to always be enough money to help those who cannot take care of \nthemselves. Most of the time, that is a good thing because we certainly \nwant to have those safety nets for those families, particularly \nfamilies who need health care for their children. The difficulty is \nthat those families who are working and are struggling and are being \nindependent often have to pay the price for that.\n  I have personal family experience that drives this whole issue home. \nAs we consider the expansion of the children's health bill to expand it \nto folks with higher incomes, I realize that affects my own family.\n  My oldest son is married with a child, expecting another. He is back \nin graduate school, doing some part-time work, struggling to make ends \nmeet and pay for his own health insurance. As they expect their second \nchild, with that high-deductible policy, they are paying for most of \ntheir health care themselves.\n  As he heard about the debate on this issue as well as some of the \nother bailout issues, he mentioned to me--he said: Dad, it is hard in \nmy situation to make enough money to pay for our own health care. I \nwant to be independent, but I realize the tax dollars I do pay are \npaying for the benefits of others who are often making more than I am.\n  He has friends in school who are on welfare and food stamps and \nMedicaid, taking everything they can from the Government. But most \nAmericans, most middle-class Americans and even those who fall below \nmiddle class, are struggling today to make ends meet on their own and \nnot be dependent on the Government. The amendment I have introduced \ntries to achieve some level of fairness to those American taxpayers who \nare working and trying to make ends meet.\n  My son could qualify for SCHIP, this children's health program. \nCertainly while he is in school he is below 200 percent of poverty. But \nright now he pays for his own health care. We even charge him taxes on \nthe amount he has to spend for his own health care. Then his regular \ntaxes have to go to help all his friends who are living off the \nGovernment dole.\n  If we are going to help families with children, we ought to be fair \nabout it. This bill we are considering expands the children's health \nplan. The current law in America certainly covers American citizens, \nbut the Federal money is not allowed to be used for noncitizens. That \nis basically part of our immigration deal. When folks come here and \nthey are sponsored, the agreement is that for 5 years they take care of \nthemselves and they are not a burden on the American taxpayer.\n  But the bill we are debating today changes that law. It gives \nbenefits, health care, to noncitizens at the expense of middle-class \nworking Americans. I do not want to take that away. That is not what \nthis bill is about, my amendment. I am not changing anything this bill \nalready offers.\n  But what this amendment does is it gives every American family with \nchildren, qualifying children under the children's health plan we are \ndebating, an above-the-line deduction of up to $1,500. And what it is, \nit gives American citizens the same benefit we are giving non-\nAmericans, noncitizens, in this underlying bill.\n  We do not ask the Government to pay for their health care. We say, as \na matter of fairness, we are not going to make them pay income taxes on \nwhat they have to spend on health care for their children. That is what \nthis is about, a deduction for the cost of health care for children.\n  We phase this out as income goes up. If a family qualifies for the \nAMT, they cannot get this deduction. So this is about middle-class \nAmericans, people who are actually out there today trying to make it on \ntheir own without Government help, paying for their own health care. We \nare not going to charge them taxes on the cost of their health care \nwith this amendment.\n  Specifically, the DeMint amendment, a taxpayer fairness amendment, \nwould allow American families, citizens and legal immigrant families, \nthe ability to receive a tax deduction of up to $1,500 for each child \nto cover health care-related costs.\n  This deduction, per child, is comparable to the average Federal share \nof the benefit provided to any child under this SCHIP bill, the \nunderlying child health care bill. But no family who is already \nclaiming SCHIP or Medicaid or any Federal health plan would be able to \nuse this deduction.\n  This deduction is for Americans with that spirit of independence who, \nregardless of how little they are making, want to pay their own way. \nAnd let's not penalize them for it. Let's not tax what they have to pay \nfor health care and then give it free to someone else. Let's not make \nthem pay taxes to help pay for someone else's health care and still \nleave them out in the cold.\n  This is a matter of basic fairness. I encourage my colleagues, \nRepublican and Democrat, if the whole point of this legislation is to \nhelp struggling families with children make sure they have health care \nfor their children, let's be fair to American citizens and at least \ngive them an equal benefit that we are giving to noncitizens. Let's not \nmake middle-class working Americans pay for health care for noncitizens \nwhile we are basically taxing the struggling American worker who is \ntrying to pay for it on their own.\n  I think a vote on this amendment will be coming up relatively \nshortly. Again, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the DeMint \ntaxpayer fairness amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Buy American\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning the Washington Post has a \nfront-page story that says ``Buy American Rider Sparks Trade Debate, \nProviso Limits Steel and Iron from Abroad.'' This is a story about a \nprovision that is in both the House stimulus bill and the Senate \nstimulus bill that encourages, to the extent we are stimulating \ninvestment in infrastructure projects--building roads and bridges and \ndams and schools and repairing libraries and so on in order to try to \nput people back to work--that the acquisitions to come from American \nsources, where possible. If you are going to buy steel, buy iron, skid \nsteer loaders, any number of different kinds of equipment, it ought to \nbe coming from American factories so that we put people back on factory \nfloors and back to work.\n  The Washington Post has editorialized in opposition to this. The \nstory\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\nitself almost sounds a bit like an opinion piece. It talks about \n``opponents say it amounts to a declaration of war against free trade'' \nand ``will spark retaliation'' and so on.\n  I wanted to make a comment about this, because I think it is an \nimportant issue and one we ought to discuss. If today is like most \nother days recently, 20,000 people will have lost their jobs; 20,000 \npeople will come home tonight and have to tell someone in the family \nthat they lost their job. And 20,000 people every day are losing their \njobs, 500,000 to 600,000 people a month. We don't know exactly what the \nmenu is to try to put this economy back on track, but we know that \ndoing nothing is not a solution. So the Congress is putting together a \nstimulus proposal, an economic recovery proposal to try to do things \nthat would put people back on payrolls.\n  The quickest way to restore confidence is to put people back to work \nso they are earning a salary, have a job, and can provide for their \nfamilies. And in the context of creating legislation that would put \npeople back to work, building roads and bridges and building water \nprojects and repairing schools and so on, the question is, we should \nspend American taxpayer money on U.S.-made products in order to make \nthese repairs and build these projects. It's just common sense.\n  The Washington Post story had a number of things attached to it that \nwere not accurate. I want to talk about it for a moment. This provision \nin the Senate bill says that public works projects that are funded by \nthis stimulus bill should use American steel, iron, and manufactured \ngoods. That is not radical. We ought not be embarrassed to suggest that \nwe try to use, where we can, products that are built in this country so \nthat we put people back to work on the manufacturing floors and the \nplant floors building these products. That is the purpose of this \nlegislation.\n  The Washington Post suggests that the proposal has few exceptions. \nThat is not true. The proposal has a broad public interest exemption, \none that allows the administration to waive the ``Buy America'' program \nif it deems it to be in the public interest to waive it. There are \nexceptions where the products are not available. There are exceptions \nwhere using domestic material would increase the cost of the project by \nover 25 percent. There are plenty of exemptions and exceptions here--\npublic interest, 25 percent, not available. But in circumstances where \na domestic product is available, where it is available at a price that \nis within the bounds of reason, and where we want to try to find a way \nto acquire products that are made in this country in order to put \npeople back to work, that is a perfectly reasonable and important thing \nto do.\n  The Washington Post also suggested and had other people suggest as \nwell that asking that we would purchase iron and steel and manufactured \nproducts in this stimulus bill made in America would somehow violate \nour trade agreements. That is simply untrue again. The Federal grant \nprograms that are in this stimulus bill to the States for \ninfrastructure investments, construction, repair and so on are not \ncovered by our international trade agreements. So it is not true that \nwhat we are doing here would somehow violate trade agreements.\n  I had a reporter say to me: Some economists have said this harkens \nback to 1920s protectionism. I said: Give me a break. I am so tired of \nthat nonsense. It cannot possibly be a sober economist. This country \nhas a $700 billion a year trade deficit. We buy $2 billion more each \nday than we sell to foreign countries. We consume 3 percent more than \nwe produce. We have a giant trade deficit. How could anyone in their \nright mind suggest this country is protectionist? It is absurd. How can \nanybody decide that when we put together a stimulus package to try to \nput people back to work, that we ought not buy things, to the extent we \ncan, that are manufactured and produced in this country? It makes no \nsense to me.\n  The Washington Post also indicated that the foreign Governments could \nretaliate if we did this. Again, we have a $700 billion trade deficit, \nso it's hard to see how our trade imbalance could be less favorable.\n  But at any rate, let me say that Mr. Sarkozy in France said last \nmonth, with respect to their stimulus package, they want to make sure \nthey are purchasing things that are made in France. It is a perfectly \nlogical thing.\n  No, this is not creating a trade war. This is an emergency situation \nin which each of our countries is trying to put people back to work. \nThat is a perfectly logical thing to do.\n  The Washington Post story also pointed out that the previous stimulus \npackage, of which a fair amount was provided in tax cuts, went to \nstimulate manufacturing in China. A fair amount of it went to Wal-Mart. \nEighty percent of the products in the Wal-Mart store shelves are made \nin China. So we are not going to stimulate economic jobs by purchasing \nChinese goods. I am not suggesting somebody ought to stop their car at \nthe moment and not walk into Wal-Mart. That is not my point at all. My \npoint is, if we want to put people back on payrolls to try to put this \ncountry back on track and give people some confidence at a time when \n20,000 people are losing their jobs every single day, the way to do \nthat, with the hundreds of billions of dollars that are in this bill, \nis to say, at least try to buy things that are made in America. That is \nnot unfair. It is not selfish. It is the right thing to do.\n  It is only in areas of the rarified air of our Nation's capital and \nsome other areas where we have ground our heads to such a point that we \ndon't understand what is logical. I understand it is a global economy. \nI fully understand that. There are circumstances where you perhaps \ncannot buy a product that is made here because there aren't any made \nhere. There are circumstances where the domestic product's price is \ntruly exorbitant. We don't want to do that. I understand all of that. \nAll of that is provided for in this Buy American provision. Yet you see \nfolks out in the hallways here having an apoplectic seizure over what \nsome economist is saying about something that is so fundamentally sound \nin terms of what we ought to be doing to try to strengthen the economy \nof this country, to reach out to American citizens and say: We \nunderstand a job is important for you. We understand you have lost your \njob. We understand it wasn't your fault, and we will see if we can help \nyou get a job back on the plant floor, back on the factory floor \nsomeplace, producing products made in this country. It is a fair thing \nto do and a critically important thing to do, if the result of this \nstimulus program is going to do as advertised, and that is put \nAmericans back to work.\n  We have been through a long and tortured trail in recent months \ntrying to determine what has happened and what needs to happen to try \nto fix what is wrong. What unites all of us is, none of us has been \nhere before. We have never seen the convergence of the collapse of our \nfinancial system, the largest names in American finance sitting there \nwith toxic assets in their financial bellies trying to figure out how \nthey overcome the dreadful mistakes of the last 10 years with asset \nbubbles and a carnival of greed. At the same time that we see this \ncollapse at the top of the financial system, we read about the subprime \nloan scandal and the nearly unbelievable circumstances of bad business \nthat created it.\n\n  In addition to that, we read about companies that have taken massive \nquantities of money from the American taxpayers in the form of TARP \nfunds, in the form of the Federal Reserve Board. By the way, it is \nabout $7.5 trillion that has now been committed in the name of the \nAmerican taxpayer in ways that I don't think is written in the \nConstitution. But we have watched all this happen and we still see what \nis going on on Wall Street. We hear about airplanes on order. We hear \nabout bonuses. We have watched that for the last 10 years and wondered, \nhow on Earth can this kind of house of cards continue to exist? The \nanswer is, it couldn't and it doesn't, except there is a lot for this \nCongress to do with respect to oversight, investigation, and to require \naccountability.\n  One piece of business, an attempt to try to deal with the wreckage of \nthis economy from this past decade of excess, one piece of business is \nto try to see if we can stimulate the economy to put people back to \nwork. It is interesting how at the top everybody is interested in \nbringing a pillow and some aspirin to say: Are you comfortable? Can we \nhelp you? That is what happens\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\nif you are a big bank. But how about at the bottom, the people who lost \ntheir job and their house. Anybody around to say: We want to help you?\n  In a stimulus program, if we put together construction projects, \nprojects to create an asset for this country's future, and if we say: \nWe would like you to see if you can buy the products with which you \nwill produce those assets here in America so we can put people back on \nthe payroll and get them working once again, that is not radical; that \nis the right thing to do. If there is a big, old dust storm and a whole \nlot of angst about asking people if they can buy in this country during \nthis stimulus, that is too bad. That is exactly what we should do.\n  It is my intent, with respect to this legislation--I believe the \nintent of many others--that we continue to keep this provision in the \nstimulus bill as it moves through the Congress.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so that the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, can call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 63\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 63.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment Numbered 63.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify that new paperwork and enrollment barriers are not \n created in the Express Lane Enrollment option and that income may be \n determined by Express Lane agencies based on State income tax records \n                              or returns)\n\n       On page 99, beginning on line 8 strike ``through'' and all \n     that follows through ``application,'' on line 10, and insert \n     ``in writing, by telephone, orally, through electronic \n     signature, or through any other means specified by the \n     Secretary and''.\n       On page 108, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       ``(H) State option to rely on state income tax data or \n     return.--At the option of the State, a finding from an \n     Express Lane agency may include gross income or adjusted \n     gross income shown by State income tax records or returns.''.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 63, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send a modification of the amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 99, beginning on line 9 after ``mation'' insert \n     ``in writing, by telephone, orally, through electronic \n     signature, or through any other means specified by the \n     Secretary or by''.\n\n       On page 108, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       ``(H) State option to rely on state income tax data or \n     return.--At the option of the State, a finding from an \n     Express Lane agency may include gross income or adjusted \n     gross income shown by State income tax records or returns.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to briefly describe the import of \nthis amendment, as modified.\n  Express Lane enrollment seeks to address the problem that up to 6 \nmillion children in this country are eligible but are not enrolled in \neither Medicaid or CHIP and that the vast majority of these children \nare enrolled in other Federal programs at the same time.\n  Eligibility for other Federal programs--here I am speaking about food \nstamps or the National School Lunch Program or the WIC Program--\nenrollment in those programs is at lower levels of income eligibility \nthan Medicaid and CHIP, so those children identified by those other \nFederal programs as low income are virtually, by definition, eligible \nfor Medicaid or for CHIP.\n  I have worked with Senator Baucus and my colleagues in the Finance \nCommittee to write a provision in the bill which will provide a State \noption to utilize Express Lane eligibility to enroll children into the \nCHIP program.\n  This amendment provides a very simple technical clarification that \nparents may consent to their children's enrollment in CHIP or Medicaid \nthrough various means established by the Secretary, including orally, \nthrough electronic signatures, and otherwise. Without this \nclarification, a child could be determined eligible through Express \nLane, but a parent might have to go to a State Medicaid agency to sign \na form instead of providing an electronic signature or authorizing \ncoverage over the phone. This is the exact kind of needless \nbureaucratic hurdle Express Lane is intended to prevent.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 85\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to address two pending amendments. \nThe first one I will address is the DeMint amendment which provides for \na deduction for health care costs for certain children.\n  Essentially, the DeMint amendment allows for a deduction for health \ncare costs of children who are not in a Federal program, either \nMedicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, up to $1,500. That \nis up to the average federally funded program, which I understand is up \nto $1,500.\n  On the face of it, that might sound like something people might want \nto do, to give an extra tax deduction for children's health care \nexpenses. The trouble is, we are here today trying to make sure that \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program works and works better. A lot \nof effort has gone into this legislation, and there have been a lot of \namendments from various Senators trying to improve on the bill.\n  First, this is not a tax bill. The Tax Code does allow employees who \nreceive health care benefits from their employer to not count that as \ntaxable income. That is true. It is a big provision in the Tax Code \ntoday. I think it amounts to roughly $250 billion, $260 billion a year. \nThe employer is able to take the deduction of employer health care \nexpenses, whatever the expenses might be, and there is no limit today \nin current law. All health care that is provided by the employer is not \ntaxable income to the employee. In fact, when we deal with health care \nreform, we will have to look at that. We do not want to move away from \nemployer-provided coverage. That is something the American public is \nused to. They understand it. Companies are used to it. They understand \nit.\n  Some have suggested abolishing that tax and basically saying \nindividuals have to find their own insurance, irrespective of \nemployment. I do not think that is a good idea, and I think that is the \njudgment of the Congress.\n  Senator DeMint wishes to add a tax provision basically providing the \nchildren who are not covered by either the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram or Medicaid, as I understand the amendment, with a deduction \nfor health care expenses up to $1,500 every year. I do not think this \nis the time and place to be coming up with single rifleshot, arbitrary \ntax amendments on a nontax bill. These provisions have to be considered \ntogether. These tax provisions have to be considered together, \ncertainly in the context of health care reform. We take up various ways \nto give incentives to people to get health insurance, especially in the \nprivate market, in the individual market right now because right now it \nis very difficult for some people in the individual market to get \nhealth insurance. We will probably provide health credits to assist \npeople in the private market.\n  We also could look to the employer exclusion and see if that can be \nmodified. All this should be addressed in the context of comprehensive \nhealth care reform. We need comprehensive health\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\ncare reform in this country. We already know how much we pay for health \ncare in this country. We pay twice as much per capita than the next \nexpensive country. We have 46 million Americans not covered by health \ninsurance. It is an abomination. We are the only industrialized country \nin the world that does not provide a mechanism to provide health \ninsurance for its people. That makes no sense. The United States is \nslipping, frankly, in a lot of areas. Look at our financial banking \nsystem. It is crumbling. In Davos, Switzerland, we have been roundly \ncriticized as a country for letting this happen to us. Of course, the \ncredit markets seized up. It is very complex. The fact is, it has \nhappened and we Americans have let it happen.\n  We also have to reform our health care system and reform it in a way \nso Americans can get health care more easily than they can now, make \nsure they are all covered, improve the costs, and improve our delivery \nsystem. Our delivery system is in the dark ages. We in America \ncompensate doctors and hospitals on the basis of volume, not on the \nbasis of quality.\n  Many of us have ideas. We have to put all this together into \ncomprehensive health reform. I wrote a white paper months ago. I don't \nmean to pat myself on the back, but most people feel that is the best \nbeginning to get comprehensive health care reform. Others have a lot of \nideas to add to it, subtract from it. But it is probably a pretty good \nfoundation of where we have to reform our health care system. That is \nwhere we should take up provisions such as the DeMint amendment. That \nis where we should decide whether it makes sense to change the Tax Code \nto get better health care, outside of the children's health care \nprogram.\n  This is not an amendment addressed to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. This is an amendment that has to do generally with children, \nirrespective of income of families. This amendment has nothing to do \nwith income of families. It says basically if you are not covered, you \nget a $1,500 contribution. I guess in some sense the proponents of the \namendment could argue this is for upper income people, for moderate \nincome people, for families whose children are not enrolled in the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. That may be. But that issue must \nbe addressed in the context of comprehensive health care reform. That \nis the best place. I do not think it makes sense to adopt this kind of \namendment. Then somebody else will have an amendment for a tax break \nhere, a tax break there, and who knows what. This should be taken up in \ncomprehensive health care reform or a comprehensive tax bill.\n  We are going to take up tax legislation later this year. There will \nbe lots of opportunities to address health care in our Tax Code. But \nthis is not the time and place. I urge Senators to resist the siren's \nsong, resist temptation because this is not the road we should go down, \nnot at this time. There is a time and place for everything. There is a \ntime and place for health care tax amendments. This is not the time and \nplace.\n  Frankly, I think the more we as a Congress are strategic, we plan a \nlittle more, we don't just react to the idea of the instant but think \nthings through a little bit more, we will be a lot better off and we \nwill be serving our people better than we are at this moment.\n  I strongly urge Members to resist this amendment so we can get on to \nhealth care reform and tax reform at a later date. I urge Senators not \nto vote for the DeMint amendment because it, frankly, does not belong \non this bill.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 86\n\n  On another matter, I wish to speak to the Coburn amendment No. 86. \nEssentially, this amendment would get rid of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, abolish it. That is right, abolish it. This is the \nsame program that had such strong support in America. Republicans have \nsupported it and Democrats have supported it over the decade. It \ncurrently serves almost 7 million people, and with the legislation \nbefore us, we will boost that to 10 million people. The same CHIP \nprogram, the underlying bill, as I said, 10 million people, it works. \nIt worked for 12 years. It is effective. People like it. Why? Because \nit works. It is a shared partnership between Uncle Sam and the States. \nIt makes no sense to throw this away because it has worked so well.\n  To be fair, the Senator from Oklahoma wants to not only abolish the \nprogram but replace it with a private system. As I understand it--I \ndon't want to put words in his mouth--a private account system. It \nsounds a lot like Social Security privatization, which is roundly \ncriticized. It is a good thing we didn't adopt that with the shape the \nstock market is in. People putting savings in a private Social Security \naccount would find they would have lost a lot.\n  In the meantime, Social Security is strong, it is there, the benefits \nare there. It is kind of like a defined benefit plan, a defined \ncontribution plan. Seniors can count on it. Social Security is there. \nIt is financed by the payroll tax. The trust fund is in very good \nshape. The Social Security trust fund is not in jeopardy for, gosh, 30 \nyears from now essentially. Seniors know that Social Security is there.\n  In the same vein, families, working poor families, families who do \nnot have the same income as others, should rest assure the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is there. They need that constancy, that \npredictability. Therefore, I urge Senators not to support the Coburn \namendment which essentially abolishes the CHIP program and replaces it \nwith a private system which is precarious at best, certainly given \nthese times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, this does not get rid of the \nsystem, and it certainly does not privatize it. What it does is it \nguarantees every child in this country, all 3l million--which is \nsomething this bill does not do--all 3l million who don't have an \ninsurance policy today will be insured with a plan equal to what we \nhave for our children.\n  What it doesn't get rid of is access. They only have access to 40 \npercent of the physicians now. It gives them access to 100 percent of \nall the physicians. We are defending a system that, first, is only \ngoing to enroll 4 million new kids, is still going to leave 5 million \nnot covered and 2 million of the 4 million they enroll are from those \nwho already have private insurance, and we are going to say we will \nstick with a system to take care of the ones we have now and we are not \ngoing to give real access, and with the not real access comes no choice \nof a physician because we limited the number of physicians who can \nparticipate because of the economics of it.\n  I will tell you what it does get rid of. It gets rid of $70 billion \nof taxpayers' money that we are not going to use to cover every one of \nthese kids. Based on the 2005 numbers, we can buy a premium health \ninsurance policy for all 31 million kids--the 8.9 million who do not \nhave any coverage now and the 22 million who are covered in either \nSCHIP or Medicaid today. We save all the administrative expense. We \nautoenroll them so we don't have to worry about picking up only 4 \nmillion with an additional $70 billion in taxes.\n  To say this is privatization is a total mischaracterization of it. \nWhat it does is it guarantees that all children will not have a \nMedicaid stamp or SCHIP stamp on their forehead that says: Yes, we are \ngiving you coverage but you can't see all the physicians, you can't get \nreferrals to the best because you have a government-run program.\n  Not only do we increase access and quality, we save tremendous \namounts of money, and it will still be a government-run program because \nit will be administered by the Secretary in a way that guarantees these \nkids are autoenrolled. They will have premium health insurance coverage \nand we still save money, even after that. We are spending $2,160 per \nkid now based on 2005 numbers, and we will cover every one of these \nkids and not spend more money than that.\n  To characterize this as getting rid of coverage is wrong. What it \ndoes is greatly create and increase access for children in this country \nto have the same access that our children have. It saves money and \nmarkedly improves quality for those children. Every American child \nought to have access, and what we do is take the money we are spending \nnow and spend it more wisely, and create a system where they all have \ncoverage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in closing today--and I know we have a \nfew votes, but we are about done--I wish to talk about bipartisanship. \nI believe I have a history of getting bipartisan compromises done. Over \nthe last several years, I have worked to deliver important bipartisan \nlegislation on taxes, trade, and health care. We work together, we make \ncommitments, and we sometimes have to say no to Members of our own \nparty who would put their specific interests ahead of bipartisanship. \nIt is tough at times, but when we work together to produce legislation, \nwe are better off for doing so.\n  Lately, I have seen a disturbing change in the way bipartisanship \nappears to be working around the Senate. Last year, on Medicare, we \nwere working together for months--I am talking about for months--on a \nbipartisan bill to extend a lot of things in Medicare. It was jointly \ndrafted. There were many provisions in the bill I strongly supported. \nBut when we came to an impasse on some of the tough political issues, \nthe majority solved the tough issues the way they wanted them and moved \nforward. That is not the way I think bipartisanship should work.\n  Then we have this bill before us today. It is largely the work of \nSenators Baucus, Hatch, Rockefeller, and myself. It should be a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, but it is not. In this case, the \nmajority decided to make some very political changes in the bill and \npresented it to us as a ``take it or leave it'' proposition. Today, I \nchoose to leave it.\n  Some Senators have tried to argue that this bill is 90 percent the \nbill we voted in 2007. I wonder that those Senators don't realize how \ninsulting it is to me to hear that. It is an open admission that the \nmajority unilaterally changed 10 percent of the bill and has presented \nit to me as a take it or leave it; it can still be bipartisan, Chuck \nGrassley, if you will just do what we tell you to do.\n  The stimulus bill coming next week is no better. We were presented \nwith a bill and asked if we wanted to sign on to it and call it \nbipartisan. That approach shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody or \nmuch of a surprise at all. As the Speaker said: We won the election, we \nwrite the bills. I must admit I appreciate why House Republicans \ndecided yesterday they would not sign off on Speaker Pelosi's version \nof bipartisanship.\n  We need to get back to real bipartisanship around here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 94, 95, and 96\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a series of amendments in the \nnature of technical corrections that I have worked out with the ranking \nRepublican Member, so Senator Grassley and I send these to the desk. I \nunderstand they have been cleared all the way around. So I send this \npackage of amendments to the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthey be considered en bloc; that the amendments be agreed to and that \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 85\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about \nmy amendment, No. 85. Senator Baucus commented about it after I brought \nit up. There are a few matters I would like to clear up.\n  The Senator mentioned this is not a tax bill, his children's health \nbill. Yet it is a tax bill. There is a large tax increase on cigarettes \nto pay for this bill, so it is very much dealing with taxes.\n  He also said this is not the place to deal with families with \nchildren who have insurance through their employers or may be paying \nfor their own insurance. This is a time to deal with Americans with \nchildren who cannot pay for health care. The underlying bill itself \nincreases the criteria all the way up to twice the poverty level or \nmore. It is dealing with many families with substantial incomes. It is \ngiving benefits to some families who are not paying for their own \ninsurance at the expense of those who are struggling to pay for their \nown health insurance.\n  My amendment is very appropriate to the underlying bill. It is about \nchildren's health care, and it is about being fair to American \ncitizens. The bill we are considering today gives generous benefits to \nchildren who are not citizens of the United States. They are here and \nmy amendment does not change those benefits. But we should be fair and \ngive equal benefits to American families, workers, taxpayers, who are \npaying for their own insurance.\n  My colleague, Senator Baucus, mentioned many of these families are \ngetting insurance through their employers. But just about all of them, \nif not all of them, have to pay a part of that expense themselves, \nwhich is very difficult. They cannot deduct that money.\n  We need to make sure this bill is fair. My amendment makes the bill \nfair to every family with children. It gives them an above-the-line \ndeduction for up to $1,500 of their expenses, and that is up to the \namount we give to noncitizens in this children's health bill.\n  This is fair to Americans, and it is time we start being fair to \nAmericans. We cannot take money continuously from the middle class to \ndo our good deeds all over the country and then leave middle-class \nAmericans emptyhanded. If they are going to work and struggle to pay \nfor their own health insurance, the very least we can do is not tax the \nmoney they spend to pay for their own health care. Why do we penalize \npeople who are trying to live themselves without government money? Most \nAmericans are doing everything they can to get by without government \nsupport. Let's stop penalizing them. Let's stop asking them to pay for \nall of our good deeds and good intentions.\n  This is a simple amendment that gives a deduction for people who are \npaying for their own health insurance, a deduction that is equal to \nwhat we are giving to noncitizens in this underlying bill.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to think twice, think about \nAmericans, our own middle-class workers. Give them a fair shot. Vote \nfor this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment really is the amendment \nthat is going to take care of our children. It is going to take the \nMedicaid stamp and SCHIP stamp off their foreheads. It is going to \ncreate access to the finest doctors, not just 40 percent of the doctors \nas we see in Medicaid and SCHIP. It is going to give the same care to \nall the children--those at the 300 percent poverty level and under--\nthat we give to our own kids. It does all that not spending the $70 \nbillion in increased taxes that is in this bill and auto-enrolling \nchildren so that we don't just pick up 4 million kids, we pick up all \n8.9 million kids who are not insured.\n  To my colleagues who sponsored the Wyden bill, the Healthy Americans\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\nbill, that is exactly what is in that bill, except we are going to do \nit for children without increasing costs but increasing the quality, \nincreasing the care, and increasing the outcomes. We are going to truly \nmake children on the same level we are in terms of their access. They \nare going to get to choose their doctor rather than have their doctor \nchosen for them. They are going to get a referral to the best rather \nthan to one who will just take them. They are going to get the same \nthing we get, and they deserve it, and we are not going to spend a \npenny more than we are spending today.\n  We don't do away with SCHIP, we don't privatize SCHIP; what we do is \nsay we really care about kids and we are going to give them the same \nthing we have. At the same time, we are going to save the American \ntaxpayers $70 billion.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment phases out the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program as we know it. It strikes the underlying bill \nand phases out the Children's Health Insurance Program over the next 2 \nyears and replaces it with a competitive bidding procedure, somewhat \nsimilar to Medicare Part D, where private plans that want to cover kids \nwill submit bids, submit their plans to Uncle Sam for approval. So \nessentially it totally eliminates the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram over a 2-year period and replaces it with a competitive-bidding \nprocess not too dissimilar from Medicare Part D where private plans \noffer health insurance to participants. I think it is much too much of \na radical departure, and I urge its defeat.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The average improper payment rate across \nthe rest of the Federal Government on every agency--this amendment says \nthat before New York can go to 400 percent, they have to bring their \nimproper payment rates in line with the rest of the Federal Government. \nThe improper payment rate in New York--New York alone--accounts for 50 \npercent of the fraud in Medicaid. Fifty percent of that is in New York \nState alone.\n  So what this amendment would do is it would delay the improper \npayment reporting requirements and limit earmark program expansion \nuntil the Medicaid and SCHIP improper payment rates match the Federal \naverage of improper payment rates. It is meant to help us get back on \ntrack. We just started getting improper payment rates on Medicaid, and \nthey are out of control. We should not be delaying the onset of that, \nand we should put teeth into it so that where it is bad, we don't \nexpand it and make it worse.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is yet another way to throw kids out \nof or off the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is a cap. It is a \ncap, the effect of which is to deny children coverage. It is similar to \nseveral other amendments brought up in the past, where there is \nsometimes a dollar cap, sometimes a percentage cap, and there are \nvarious other ways. This is another one of those caps, and I think it \nis not right to take kids off the Children's Health Insurance Program \nrolls. So I urge its defeat.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think we could voice vote this.\n  Mr. COBURN. I agree. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 49.\n  The amendment (No. 49) was rejected.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 63\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think the next amendment is the Bingaman \namendment No. 63.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, there are about 6 million children in \nthe country who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP who are not enrolled. \nIn many of these cases, these are children who are also eligible for \nand enrolled in other Federal programs that have similar or even more \nsevere requirements for eligibility. To fix this problem, we put a \nprovision in the bill--Senator Baucus and those in the Finance \nCommittee--included a provision for so-called express lane eligibility \nas a way to sign up children for the CHIP program.\n  My amendment simply clarifies that the consent of the parent--not the \ndetermination of eligibility but the consent of the parent--for the \nenrollment of the child in the CHIP program or Medicaid can be \naccomplished through something other than a formal signed document at \nthe Medicaid office. We give the Secretary the discretion to set that \nup. We believe this is a great change and will help us to register the \nchildren who ought to be registered for the CHIP program.\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is where you get the wool pulled \nover your eyes. Here we are, in the last moments of a very partisan \ndebate, and we have one last vote to abandon further compromises we \nmade in 2007. This one weakens fraud protection.\n  In that bill 2 years ago, we reached a carefully crafted compromise, \nbalancing access and program integrity. With this amendment, the \nmajority backs away from that compromise further. In 2007, we agreed \nthat an express lane application would require a signature from the \napplicant acknowledging they were applying for Medicaid or SCHIP. This \nchange eliminates the signature requirement.\n  It is not technical, it is substantive, and it is going to lead to \nfraud. We should vote this down because we don't want to promote fraud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n63, as modified.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. What do you mean there is not a sufficient second?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Now there is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 63, as modified. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Texas \nallows the States with the highest percentage of uninsured children to \nbe given priority for outreach and enrollment.

Monday at about 2 o'clock, we are going to lay down \nthe economic recovery package. That is the stimulus. That will be the \nAppropriations and Finance pieces. After the Holder vote, we encourage \nMembers to speak about the economic recovery package.\n  Tuesday, we are going to have a full day of amendments and I hope a \nnumber of votes.\n  On Wednesday, we have a longstanding retreat that the Democrats are \ngoing to have a short distance from here off campus.

We would hope we would be back by \n4:30 and could start voting on some amendments that were offered that \nday.\n  Next week will be a long, hard slog. It is up to us how long this \ntakes. We hope we can work things out. I have had a number of \nconversations with the Republican leader on a way to expedite what we \ndo. We want to make sure everyone has the opportunity to do what they \nthink is appropriate on this bill.\n  We are going to have some late nights next week. We will do \neverything we can not to have to work next weekend, but I think that is \nstretching things. But we will certainly try.\n  We have had no morning business all week, so, Senators, speak your \nhearts out tomorrow.\n\n\n                              section 214\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, my understanding is that section 214 of \nH.R. 2 applies to pregnant women and children who are citizens of the \nRepublic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or the \nFederated States of Micronesia, and who are lawfully residing in the \nUnited States under the terms of the Compacts of Free Association \nbetween the United States and each of these three Pacific island \nnations.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with my colleague from Hawaii. Section 214 \napplies to pregnant women and children who are nonimmigrants lawfully \nresiding in the United States under the terms of the Compacts of Free \nAssociation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Does the chairman agree with our interpretation?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I agree with the interpretations of the \nSenators from Hawaii regarding section 214.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Senator very much for that clarification.\n  Mr. President, I support the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2009. This legislation increases access to \nhealth care for an estimated 4.1 million children who are currently \nuninsured. The legislation also includes $100 million in new grant \nopportunities to fund outreach and enrollment efforts to increase the \nparticipation of children in Medicaid and the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. By increasing access to health insurance, more \nchildren will be able to learn, be active, and grow into healthy \nadults.\n  Mr. President, the legislation will also provide much needed \nassistance to Hawaii hospitals that care for Medicaid beneficiaries and \nthe uninsured. Hawaii hospitals continue to struggle to meet the \nincreasing demands placed on them by a growing number of uninsured \npatients and rising costs.\n  The legislation extends Medicaid disproportionate share Hospital, \nDSH, allotments for Hawaii until December 31, 2011. This additional \nextension authorizes the submission by the State of Hawaii of a State \nplan amendment covering a DSH payment methodology to hospitals that is \nconsistent with the requirements of existing law relating to DSH \npayments. The purpose of providing a DSH allotment for Hawaii is to \nprovide additional funding to the State of Hawaii to permit a greater \ncontribution toward the uncompensated costs of hospitals that are \nproviding indigent care. It is not meant to alter existing arrangements \nbetween the State of Hawaii and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, or to reduce in any way the level of Federal funding for \nHawaii's QUEST program. The extension included in this act provides an \nadditional $7.5 million for fiscal year 2010, $10 million for fiscal \nyear 2011, and $2.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. \nThese additional DSH resources are intended to strengthen the ability \nof hospitals to meet the increasing health care needs of our \ncommunities.\n  I look forward to the swift enactment of this legislation so that \nchildren have increased access to health care and so that our hospitals \nin Hawaii are better able to care for the uninsured and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to voice my support \nfor the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. In \nvoicing my support, I must note that the bipartisan support that \naccompanied the drafting of this bill's predecessor in the 110th \nCongress was absent in this bill's introduction in the 111th Congress. \nThe legislation was revised without working across the aisle, which has \nresulted in a bill that is not as widely supported as its predecessor. \nChildren's health is the wrong issue on which to push partisan \npolitics.\n  When we last debated the Children's Health Insurance Program in the \n110th Congress, I was proud to lend my support to what I believe was a \ngood, bipartisan bill. I voted in favor of the legislation twice, on \nAugust 2, 2007 and again on September 25, 2007. I was very disappointed \nin President Bush's veto of the legislation resulting in the delay of \ncritical access to health care for millions of children.\n  This important legislation will revise and expand the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, enabling it to provide \naccess to medical coverage to an additional 5.5 million children whose \nparents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford \nprivate health insurance. Nationwide, 7 million children are currently \nenrolled in SCHIP, including 183,981 in Pennsylvania.\n  The reauthorized bill will provide an estimated 4.1 million children \nwith access to health care coverage. To achieve that increase, the bill \nextends coverage to children in families with an annual income at or \nbelow 300 percent of the poverty level, or $66,150 for a family of \nfour. The triple-the-poverty-level rate would bring the Nation in line \nwith Pennsylvania's current plan.\n  It is imperative that we take steps to ensure health care coverage \nfor our most important resource, our children. In a January 12, 2009, \ncolumn in The Washington Post, E.J. Dionne wrote, ``[S]tates have \nenacted budget cuts that will leave some 275,000 people without health \ncoverage . . . By the end of this year, if further proposed [State \nbudget] cuts go through, the number losing health coverage nationwide \ncould rise to more than 1 million, almost half of them children.'' \nCongress can, and should, act to make sure children's health care does \nnot suffer as a result of the economic downturn.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have consistently supported \nproviding\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\nquality health care to children, including prenatal care. To improve \npregnancy outcomes for women at risk of delivering babies of low birth \nweight and reduce infant mortality and the incidence of low-birth-\nweight births, I initiated action that led to the creation of the \nHealthy Start program in 1991. Working with the first Bush \nadministration and Senator Harkin, as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee, we allocated $25 million in 1991 for the development of \n15 demonstration projects. For fiscal year 2008, we secured $99.7 \nmillion for 96 projects in this vital program. Health care initiatives \nlike the Healthy Start program and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram are key to improving the health and well-being of children in \nthis country.\n  The health care work of the 111th Congress will not be complete with \njust the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. This legislation will address the needs of some of the most \nvulnerable children, but Congress must act in a bipartisan fashion to \naddress health reform so that all of America's 47 million uninsured \nhave access to adequate health care.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Children's Health \nInsurance Program and its reauthorization, and I am disappointed that \nthe Senate did not approve the Kids First Act that was offered as an \namendment. This legislation would have provided funding to cover low-\nincome children whose families are otherwise unable to afford coverage. \nInstead of providing health coverage for American children, the Senate \ndecided to consider a bill that will expand government programs, \nincrease the burden on taxpayers, and shift the focus from the primary \nreason for the creation of the SCHIP, which is the coverage of low-\nincome children. Before the Senate considers expanding SCHIP, we should \nensure that all children under 200 percent of the Federal poverty level \nare covered. Under the current program, the State of Mississippi is \nunable to cover all children under the current limit of 200 percent of \npoverty, $44,000 per year. The Senate is now considering legislation \nthat will take tax money paid by Mississippians out of the State and \nallow other States to cover children in families making up to $88,000 a \nyear. The expansion of benefits to legal immigrant children is also a \npoint of serious concern. Under current law, legal immigrants sign a \nstatement that they will not use Federal assistance programs such as \nMedicaid and SCHIP for 5 years. This legislation would waive that 5-\nyear waiting period, thus further expanding this program to \nnoncitizens, while American children remain without health coverage. I \ncannot support any legislation that disadvantages the children of \nMississippi even more. I hope this legislation will be changed in the \namendment process to reflect the original intent of the legislation and \nensure that low-income American children are provided health coverage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Americans are fortunate to have access to \nsome of the best medical facilities and services in the world. Yet, \nshamefully, 2007 U.S. Census data demonstrated that there are 45.7 \nmillion uninsured people in our country, of which, 8.7 million are \nchildren, who do not have the access they need to these services. \nUnfortunately, these numbers will likely increase as the Nation \ncontinues to lose more jobs and the ranks of the unemployed continue to \nrise.\n  How to provide everyone in America access to affordable, quality \nhealth care is the subject of extensive debate. Over the years, though, \nwe have made some progress in making sure that the most vulnerable \nmembers of our communities--including children--can receive basic \nmedical services.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 in recognition of the need to provide \nmedical services for children from middle-income to lower income \nfamilies and has been widely hailed as a successful program. In the \npast 12 years, we have seen that CHIP coverage leads to better access \nto preventative and primary care services, better quality of care, \nbetter health outcome and improved performance in school. CHIP \ncurrently provides health care benefits to more than 7.4 million \nchildren, of which more than 90 percent are from families with incomes \nbelow $35,000 a year for a family of three, or 200 percent below the \nFederal poverty level.\n  Michigan's CHIP program, called MIChild, has had impressive results: \nMichigan currently has the second lowest rate of uninsured children in \nthe Nation, trailing only Massachusetts, which provides universal \nhealth care coverage.\n  While CHIP has been a successful program nationwide, many children \nwho qualify for the program are unable to receive insurance because of \ninadequate funding. In Michigan, approximately 50,000 children are \ncovered under CHIP every month, but there are still 158,000 uninsured \nchildren in my home State, and more than 8 million uninsured children \nnationwide.\n  To help address this problem, I am pleased that the Senate is taking \nup a bipartisan bill--the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2009--that would increase funding for the \nprogram by approximately $32.8 billion over 4\\1/2\\ years. This bill \nwill allow more than 4 million additional children to enroll beyond the \n7.4 million children already in CHIP. For Michigan, this means that \nmore than an estimated 80,000 more Michigan children would have access \nto much needed health insurance.\n  A hardworking mother from Royal Oak, Michigan, wrote: ``As a single \nworking mother, I could not afford the family insurance that my \nemployer offered, and definitely could not afford private [insurance]. \nWithout this insurance I do not know what I would have done. [CHIP] \noffered us options, doctors instead of emergency rooms, less time \nmissed at work and school.''\n  We have a moral obligation to provide Americans access to affordable \nand high quality health care. No person, young or old, should be denied \naccess to adequate health care, and the expanded and improved \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is an important step toward \nachieving that goal.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for the \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. At a time \nwhen our country is moving in a new direction, it is fitting that we \nare considering this important measure among the first bills considered \nthis Congress. I believe the extension of CHIP will stand out as one of \nthe great accomplishments of this body. By passing this legislation, we \nwould state clearly that the health of children in this country is an \nissue too important to be dealt with as business as usual.\n  Last time the Senate considered an expansion of CHIP, the measure \npassed with bipartisan support and represented what can happen when \nmembers from both sides of the aisle come together to form a consensus. \nUnfortunately, providing health coverage for millions of kids was not a \npriority of our former President and he vetoed the measure. By standing \nin the way of this legislation, nearly 4 million children have had to \nwait to receive critical health coverage. With families struggling more \nthan ever to make ends meet, passing this legislation is essential to \nprotecting our Nation's children.\n  This legislation is a matter of priorities, and I see no more \nimportant issue than caring for our kids. Regrettably, there are some \nwho remain opposed to this legislation. I have heard some argue that \nthis bill should be opposed because it raises taxes. Anyone who opposes \nthe bill on these grounds is choosing big tobacco over children's \nhealth.\n  Others have argued against including a provision that allows States \nto waive the 5-year waiting period for legal immigrant children. These \nchildren, who are lawful immigrants and who will eventually be U.S. \ncitizens, already have the ability to receive CHIP services. Requiring \nkids to wait 5 years for health care is unconscionable and could create \nlife-long consequences for children. I have heard some claim that \nallowing legal immigrant children to receive public health care \nservices would violate the conditions on which they entered the United \nStates. This argument is contrary to the position taken by the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, which does not believe an \nimmigrant's use of health care services such as Medicaid and SCHIP \nconstitutes a violation of these conditions. An immigrant can only \nbecome a public charge if they receive direct\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\ncash benefits, such as welfare, for their income. Health benefits are \nexpressly removed from this category. During hard economic times, we \nshould give states the ability to remove the restrictive barriers for \nlegal immigrant children and allow them to receive critical health care \nservices. Investing in early health care for all children is sound \npolicy.\n  I support this bill because I believe it is a travesty that in the \nrichest, most powerful, country in the world, there are more than 47 \nmillion people without health insurance. That is an absolutely shocking \nnumber. It represents roughly one in six people who are going without \nregular trips to the doctor, forgoing needed medications and are forced \nto use the emergency room for care because they have no where else to \nturn. These are our friends, our neighbors, and millions of our \nchildren.\n  The legislation before us will extend and renew health care coverage \nfor over 10 million children. After years of increases to the number of \nuninsured in this country, this is a solid step in the right direction. \nOur recent economic crisis has left more Americans jobless and without \nhealth coverage for themselves and their family members. No one is \narguing that this bill is the solution to our health care crisis, but \nthis bill represents significant progress. It covers 4 million more \nkids and represents the first important step to begin reforming our \nhealth care system.\n  In my home State of Vermont, we have been a national leader on \nchildren's health care. Even before the creation of CHIP, we knew that \nthis was the right thing to do. Because of our early action, Vermont \nhas one of the lowest rates for uninsured kids in the country. This \nbill will get us even closer to the goal of covering the thousands of \neligible kids in our State who remain uninsured. Further, the \nprovisions in this bill will reverse the Bush administration policies \nto cut kids off the program and will ensure that thousands of Vermont \nkids will still have health care.\n  We are faced with many choices here in the Senate. When it comes to \nour Nation's kids, the choice is clear. This is a must-pass bill that \ntakes important steps to cover all children who deserve to have every \nopportunity to lead a healthy and productive life. I urge all my \ncolleagues to stand with the children and support this bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no debate among Republicans \nconcerning access to affordable health care for children--we believe \nevery child should have access to quality affordable health care.\n  Many of us are proud of our role in creating the children's health \nprogram, SCHIP. We think it ought to be reauthorized responsibly.\n  But we are troubled by the direction the program has taken in recent \nyears. It has strayed from its original purpose--the purpose \nRepublicans support--of providing coverage to low-income, uninsured \nchildren.\n  This bill before us would only exacerbate those troubling trends.\n  That is why I offered an alternative--the Kids First Act--to return \nthe children's health program to its original purpose of covering low-\nincome children.\n  Senate Republicans also believe we need to focus scarce resources on \nthose families who need it most. Mr. Cornyn  offered an amendment to \nuse any leftover state funds to help insure children who are eligible, \nbut not enrolled, rather than expanding to high-income beneficiaries.\n  Senate Republicans believe SCHIP should cover those children who \ndon't have insurance yet. Senator Kyl offered a commonsense amendment \nwhich says kids should be able to keep the coverage they have, freeing \nup resources to enroll more children who don't have insurance.\n  Senate Republicans believe that States should cover low-income \nchildren who are not yet enrolled before they expand subsidies to \nwealthier families. Senators Murkowski, Specter, Collins, and Johanns \noffered an amendment to require just that.\n  Regrettably, our friends across the aisle rejected each and every one \nof these commonsense proposals.\n  As a result, we are left with a bill that fails to address the \nfundamental problems facing this children's health program--and that I \ncannot support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe engrossment of the amendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today the Senate can right a wrong. In \n2007, more than 3 million low-income, uninsured American kids were \nwaiting to be included in the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nThose millions of low-income, uninsured children needed doctors visits \nand medicines. But in 2007, President Bush wrongly vetoed the \nlegislation renewing and expanding the children's health program. The \nchance at health insurance for those 3 million kids was lost.\n  We cannot get those 2 years back for those kids, but today the Senate \ncan keep all the children currently in CHIP covered--that is nearly 7 \nmillion--and we can reach more than 4 million more low-income, \nuninsured children who are waiting--waiting on us, colleagues--to do \nthe right thing, who are waiting on us to fulfill the promise of the \nprogram.\n  I strongly urge all of us to give a big vote. The winners are the \nkids.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we all know the rest of this year in \nhealth care we have big things ahead of us. We know the bill before us \ntoday will make the difference for 4 million or so uninsured kids. So 4 \nmillion uninsured Americans down but 42 million uninsured Americans to \ngo. That is not going to be an easy task. If we are going to reform our \nhealth care system to cover all Americans, if we are going to improve \nthe quality of care to provide for all Americans, if we are going to \nbring down the cost of health care for all Americans, we need to work \ntogether.\n  If we are going to work together, we need to get a better \nunderstanding of what bipartisanship really means. It is not, we will \nwrite 90 percent of the bill together and ask the minority to vote for \nthe last 10 percent, like it or not. It is not: here is the bill, does \nthe minority want to sign off on it and let us call it bipartisan?\n  It is, frankly, very difficult for me to believe we can return to \ntrue bipartisanship. But we will finish this bill today, and then I am \ngoing to roll up my sleeves. I am going to sit down with the majority \nto try to improve our health care system for all Americans despite \nrecent evidence that true bipartisanship is elusive here in the Senate.\n  I know the issues in front of us are too important for me to do \nanything less than my very best for all those Americans out there who \nexpect us to solve the problems of the day and make a better America \nfor tomorrow's children and all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendments and requests a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes on this measure.\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Senators Baucus, Rockefeller, Conrad, \nGrassley, and Hatch conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has \nsuccessfully passed the reauthorization of a popular program that has \nreduced the number of uninsured children in our country by over 7 \nmillion. The Children's Health Insurance Program has helped lower the \nrate of uninsured low-income children by one-third since its enactment \nin 1997. That is a huge accomplishment, and has helped address a \nproblem in our country that is unacceptable--the millions of families \nlacking insurance. Moreover, while the bill has a price tag of roughly \n$31 billion over 4\\1/2\\ years, it is fully offset and would cover over \n4 million more uninsured, low-income children. This program, according \nto CBO and numerous economists, is the most efficient method of getting \nhealth care insurance to low-income kids and parents, and that means \nCHIP provides the best coverage available for low-income families.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, CHIP is known as BadgerCare and it \nprovides health insurance for over 370,000 children and 17,000 pregnant \nwomen. My State has done a very good job of covering uninsured \nfamilies, and the positive effects of this program are felt at schools, \nin the workforce, and at home. This bill helps support Wisconsin's \nefforts and provides low-income children in my State with better access \nto preventive care, primary care, and affordable care. The end result \nis healthier families. BadgerCare is vital to the well-being of many \nfamilies in Wisconsin and I am very pleased that this bill supports the \nprogram in my State.\n  I am very pleased that Congress has taken a first step to relieve \nStates from unnecessary and burdensome barriers to enrolling low-income \nchildren. The onerous citizenship documentation requirements \nestablished in the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act, DRA, are keeping \nhundreds of thousands of eligible beneficiaries from the health care \nthey need. This provision has created a serious new roadblock to \ncoverage. As a result of the provision, which requires U.S. citizens to \ndocument their citizenship and identity when they apply for Medicaid or \nrenew their coverage, a growing number of States are reporting a drop \nin Medicaid enrollment, particularly among children, but also among \npregnant women and low-income parents. Health care coverage is being \ndelayed or denied for tens of thousands of children who are clearly \ncitizens and eligible for Medicaid but who cannot produce the limited \nforms of documentation prescribed by the regulations. These children \nare having to go without necessary medical care, essential medicines \nand therapies. In addition, community health centers are reporting a \ndecline in the number of Medicaid patients due to the documentation \nrequirements and are faced with treating more uninsured patients as a \nresult.\n  Over the first year and a half that the documentation requirements \nwere in effect, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported \nthat almost 33,000 children and parents lost Medicaid or were denied \ncoverage solely because they could not satisfy the Federal \ndocumentation requirements. About two-thirds of these people are known \nby the State to be U.S. citizens; most of the remainder are likely to \nbe citizens as well, but have yet to prove it.\n  A study of 300 community health centers, conducted by George \nWashington University, found that the citizenship documentation \nrequirements have caused a nationwide disruption in Medicaid coverage. \nResearchers estimate a loss of coverage for as many as 319,500 health \ncenter patients, which will result in an immediate financial loss of up \nto $85 million in Medicaid revenues. The loss of revenue hampers the \nability of safety net providers to adequately respond to the medical \nneeds of the communities they serve.\n  In addition to consequences suffered by eligible U.S. citizens, \nStates have reported incurring substantial new administrative costs \nassociated with implementing the requirement. They have had to hire \nadditional staff, retool computer systems, and pay to obtain birth \nrecords. States are also reporting that the extra workload imposed by \nthe new requirement is diverting time and attention that could be \ndevoted to helping more eligible children secure and retain health \ncoverage.\n  States are in the best position to decide if a documentation \nrequirement is needed and, if so, to determine the most effective and \nreasonable ways to implement it. States that do not find it necessary \nto require such documentation could return to the procedures they used \nprior to the DRA and avoid the considerable administrative and \nfinancial burdens associated with implementing the DRA requirement. \nMost importantly, these States could avoid creating obstacles to \nMedicaid coverage for eligible U.S. citizens.\n  Despite significant support for allowing States to determine the best \nway to document citizenship, that complete fix is not included in the \nunderlying bill. The restrictions are eased, and this is an important \nfirst step, but I hope we can continue to move forward on this issue \nand return this requirement to a State option.\n  I am also very pleased that this bill will allow States to waive the \nFederal 5-year waiting period for legal immigrant children and legal \nimmigrant pregnant women to become eligible to enroll in the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. The idea that a sick child or pregnant woman \nlegally in this country must wait 5 years to receive the care they need \nis absurd. Timely coverage means that families will have the \nopportunity to both prevent and treat conditions that can dramatically \naffect a child's daily life, and long-term health. And in those tragic \nincidences where a child suffers from life-threatening illnesses like \ncancer, denying that child necessary health care is unacceptable. \nGiving States the option to waive the 5-year waiting period is a \npositive step towards removing barriers to enrollment that are \npreventing our children from receiving the care they need.\n  In the midst of this recession, it is even more important that we \nrenew our commitment to this valued program. We know that for every 1 \npercent increase in unemployment, approximately 1 million Americans \nbecome newly eligible for their State's Medicaid or CHIP programs. \nReauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program will help \nmillions of children and their families stay afloat and continue to \nreceive the health care they need. Over the past few days, my \ncolleagues have shared tragic stories of children who have suffered as \na result of being uninsured, and we have listened to the heartwarming \nstories of families who have--quite literally--been saved by the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. The Children's Health Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization marks an important leap forward in getting \ncoverage to those who need it. I was pleased to support this bill's \nfinal passage, and I look forward to the day that everyone in our \ncountry has access to the basic right of health care.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate voted \nto reauthorize and expand the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nwhich will extend health care to millions of children across the \nNation.\n  Right now, our Nation faces one of the gravest economic crises in our \nhistory, and more and more Americans are having difficulty making ends\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\nmeet--especially when it comes to the rising costs of health care. All \ntoo often it is children who pay the price.\n  For almost 12 years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has \nprovided health care for millions of children from working families \nthat do not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance. \nThese are the children of working families.\n  Millions of Americans have found that as the cost of health insurance \nrises an increasing number of employers are unable or unwilling to \nprovide health insurance to their employees and their families. \nApproximately 45 million Americans, including nearly nine million \nchildren, are living without health insurance, and the number of \nfamilies who do not have health insurance has continued to rise.\n  Currently, the Children's Health Insurance Program provides coverage \nfor 6.7 million children nationwide. This reauthorization provides \nhealth care coverage for an additional 4.1 million children who are \nuninsured today.\n  This bill is largely based on legislation that was twice vetoed by \nPresident Bush. This legislation includes several improvements to the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program that would fund outreach and \nenrollment efforts, allow States to use information from food stamp \nprograms and other initiatives for low-income families to find and \nenroll eligible children, and give States the option to cover pregnant \nwomen for prenatal care vital to healthy newborn children.\n  I also support a provision in this bill that gives States the option \nto cover legal immigrant children and pregnant women under Medicaid and \nCHIP with no waiting period. Under current law, lawfully present \npregnant women and children who entered the country after August 22, \n1996 are barred from Medicaid and CHIP for the first 5 years they are \nin the country. These restrictions have severely undermined the health \nstatus of immigrant families across the Nation.\n  My home State of California has a higher cost of living than most \nothers, a lower rate of employer sponsored coverage, and a higher rate \nof the uninsured. In California, CHIP funds cover approximately 1.4 \nmillion children and pregnant women. Currently, there are approximately \n1.2 million children in California who do not have health insurance, \nand about 694,000 of these children are eligible for CHIP coverage.\n  This legislation not only extends this essential program, but gives \nStates like California the flexibility they need to design a program \nthat best fits the needs of their children.\n  I would like to thank Senators Baucus and Rockefeller and the other \nmembers of the Finance Committee who worked so tirelessly to keep the \nfocus of this bill where it should be--on the children.\n  There is not a man or woman in this chamber who wouldn't do \neverything within their power to ensure the health of their own \nchildren--we should do no less for the children of our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller and I, as the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, have worked \non a bill that will delay for 3 months, basically until June 12, this \ntransition. It is voluntary. That was very important. Because many \nbroadcast companies have made the investment for digital transmission, \nand they will be able to go to that digital transmission. It also \nallows people, even if they have coupons that are expired, to reapply \nand get coupons.\n  But I do wish to serve notice that I will not support another delay \nin implementation. By now people have had the notice, and we have done \neverything to help mitigate the cost of this transition. I talked to \nSenator Rockefeller about that, and I think we are in agreement that \nnow is the time for people to get their coupons and get their boxes \nbecause June 12 this transition will be made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to not only recognize what the \nSenator from Texas has indicated, but also I wish to say that these \nlast couple days, weeks--whatever it is--have been a study in \nbipartisan cooperation. We have been up, we have been down. It wasn't \ngoing to work, it could work, it might work. What we have concentrated \non is going to the people who have concerns and answering every single \nquestion they might have. In a deliberative body such as the Senate, \nwhere we actually do that and people actually know we are trying to \nanswer all their questions, and are answering all their questions, and \nwhen you have a chairman and a ranking member who are in tandem, \nworking together on a very important matter, it counts.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1051-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KENTUCKY ICE STORM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this week people all across Kentucky \nare dealing with the effects of a massive snow and ice storm that \nravaged the entire Commonwealth on Tuesday. This storm has caused the \nworst power outage in Kentucky history--more than 600,000 are without \npower.\n  This number is all the more devastating given that the previous \nrecord had been set only 4 months ago when the remnants of Hurricane \nIke battered Kentucky last fall.\n  The power outages cover the entire Bluegrass State and have caused \nenormous problems, as you can imagine. Many schools and businesses are \nclosed. Many roads are blocked from downed trees or power lines. Most \ndangerous of all, some people are unable to heat their homes in this \ntime of freezing temperatures.\n  Given the severity of the storm, the Governor of Kentucky, Steve \nBeshear, rightly reached out to President Obama to request a Federal \ndeclaration that a major emergency exists. I also contacted the \nPresident to ask that he respond quickly to the Governor's request.\n  I am pleased to say that the President did respond quickly and \ndeclared a Federal emergency in most of Kentucky. Doing that has \ntriggered the release of urgently needed Federal authority and funds \nthat will give the people of my State the help they desperately need.\n  I want to thank the Governor for his quick and decisive action, as \nwell as President Obama for his speedy response. It is making a real \ndifference in the lives of Kentuckians as we speak.\n  Governor Beshear and his team have been working day and night to \nensure all parts of the State are getting the relief they need. Our \noffices have been in close contact since the storm, and I am proud of \nthe leadership he is demonstrating.\n  Most of all, I want to thank the many men and women across Kentucky \nwho are working to aid their communities during this disaster.\n  From the police and firefighters, to the first responders, the power \ncompany employees, the shelters taking in those without power, and the \npeople knocking on doors to check on their neighbors, everyone is \npitching in to make sure Kentucky makes it through this storm.\n  And I am sure that we will. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to \nkeep the citizens of Kentucky in their prayers during this difficult \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1051-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to \nsupport consumer advocates across the country in encouraging the new \nadministration to restore the White House Office of Consumer Affairs. \nFor the past 8 years, the safety and rights of consumers have taken a \nback seat to special interests. We are all aware of troubling reports \nabout unsafe toys for our children, unsafe household products for our \nfamilies, and even unsafe food.\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\n  With a new administration focused on bringing needed change to the \nNation, a new focus on consumer safety should be part of this change. \nDuring the Clinton administration, consumers had an effective advocate \nwith a long record of commitment to protection in Ann Brown, chairman \nof the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. But staff cutbacks in \nthe Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety \nCommission have further undermined effective efforts to protect \nconsumers. Bipartisan legislation has attempted to address these \nchallenges, but more progress is needed.\n  Now is the time for action. The new administration can go a long way \nin restoring the trust of Americans in the safety of the products they \nuse by restoring the Office of Consumer Affairs to its rightful place \nin the White House. I urge the administration to do so, and I ask that \nthe editorial from the January 4 New York Times may be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The editorial follows.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 4, 2009]\n\n                        A Voice for the Consumer\n\n       The time has come to give the American consumer a much \n     stronger voice in Washington. President-elect Barack Obama \n     has already named what amounts to an energy and environmental \n     czar in the White House, and America's beleaguered consumers \n     deserve no less.\n       Mr. Obama should restore the White House Office of Consumer \n     Affairs, which vanished during the Clinton years, and appoint \n     a director who has both the president's ear and the authority \n     to rebuild the consumer protection agencies that were \n     undercut or hollowed out by the fiercely anti-regulatory Bush \n     administration.\n       There is no shortage of agencies ostensibly designed to \n     protect consumers. But without an emergency like killer \n     spinach or lead in children's toys, the Bush administration \n     has mostly failed to hear customers' complaints. The consumer \n     safety net is simply far too weak.\n       The Food and Drug Administration has suffered cutbacks in \n     expert personnel, and still relies too heavily on industry to \n     police itself. Credit-card holders who have been subject to \n     all kinds of Dickensian tricks and traps were finally told by \n     the Federal Reserve that relief is in sight--in 2011. Not so \n     long ago, there was only one official toy tester at the \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission, and oversight generally \n     was so weak that Congress was forced to step in with new \n     protections, which still could be strengthened.\n       It will be up to the Obama administration to bring these \n     agencies back to life. In part this means restoring the \n     morale of government workers who have too often been stymied \n     by the anti-regulators at the top. It will also mean stronger \n     consumer protection policies and hiring more skilled people. \n     It will mean giving one official responsibility for \n     coordinating the entire apparatus.\n       Presidents Johnson and Carter both recognized the need for \n     a strong person to do that job. Both chose Esther Peterson, \n     who during about eight years in office pushed for then-\n     radical ideas like nutritional labeling on food and truth in \n     advertising. As the Reagan anti-government era began, the \n     consumer protection job steadily lost clout until it was \n     shuttered in the late 1990s.\n       During his campaign, Mr. Obama promised consumers that he \n     would help them get a fairer deal. As the victims of lead \n     toys and predatory lenders can attest, they certainly need \n     one. Restoring the Office of Consumer Affairs and appointing \n     a director as strong and capable as Mrs. Peterson would be an \n     encouraging first step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1052-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the 4 years since the federal ban on \nassault weapons was allowed to expire, hundreds of people in this \ncountry have died and been injured by previously banned weapons. The \nBrady Center to Prevent Gun Violence report, ``Assault Weapons: Massed \nProduced Mayhem,'' details the deaths of 165 people and the injury of \n185 people by assault weapons since the ban expired. This includes the \ndeath and injury of 38 police officers. The simple fact is, our \ncommunities are less safe than they were 4 years ago.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives described \nassault weapons in their Assault Weapons Profile as weapons ``designed \nfor rapid fire and close quarter shooting at human beings. That is why \nthey were put together the way they were. You will not find these guns \nin a duck blind or at the Olympics. They are mass produced mayhem.'' \nUnlike semiautomatic hunting rifles, which are designed to be fired \nfrom the shoulder and rely on the accuracy of a precisely aimed \nprojectile, assault weapons are designed to be fired at the hip and to \nmaximize their ability to rapidly shoot multiple human targets.\n  The report also outlines the dangerous weapons race law enforcement \nofficers have been forced to enter in an effort to counter the \nincreasing likelihood that they will be confronted by a criminal \nwielding an assault weapon. In addition to the common criminal, assault \nweapons are highly attractive weapons for terrorists. The ease with \nwhich they can currently be purchased, combined with their designed \nability to inflict as much damage as possible, make them ideal tools \nfor conspiring terrorists. Just last year five men were arrested in New \nJersey with a stockpile of assault weapons, while planning to attack \nthe U.S. States Army base at Fort Dix.\n  Despite the overwhelming support of the law enforcement community, \nthe ongoing threat of terrorism and bipartisan support in the Senate, \nthe assault weapons ban was not allowed to expire. Now, 4 years later, \n19 previously banned military-style assault weapons, some capable of \nfiring up to 600 rounds per minute, are once again pervading our \nstreets and neighborhoods. This Congress we must take up and pass \nsensible gun safety legislation, including reinstating the assault \nweapons ban.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1052-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1052-S1053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BLAIR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the nomination of ADM Dennis \nBlair to be Director of National Intelligence. I do so as a strong \nsupporter of intelligence reform and in the belief that Admiral Blair \nbrings not only a keen understanding of the current challenges to \ninteragency cooperation but an enthusiasm for reform. I am also \nencouraged by his consistent and repeated commitments to keep the \ncongressional intelligence committees fully and currently informed, and \nhis desire to end the stonewalling conducted by the Bush \nadministration. The confirmation process has raised a number of issues \nof concern that I believe have been adequately addressed, although it \nis my hope and expectation that Admiral Blair, if confirmed, will work \nwith me and other members of the committee on these, as well as other \nimportant matters.\n  Admiral Blair has committed to ending the Bush administration \npractice of hiding programs such as the CIA detention program and the \nPresident's warrantless wiretapping program from the full committee and \nhas said that these programs ``were less effective and did not have \nsufficient legal and constitutional foundations because the \nintelligence committees were prevented from carrying out their \noversight responsibilities.'' He has also committed to breaking down \nthe stovepiping of oversight whereby Intelligence Committee members are \ndenied access to important Department of Defense activities. These \ncommitments are a critical first step in ensuring effective oversight \nand in reestablishing a collaborative relationship between our two \nbranches of Government.\n  While I was disappointed with Admiral Blair's refusal, at his \nhearing, to characterize waterboarding as torture, I am confident that \nhe will carry out President Obama's Executive order prohibiting \n``enhanced interrogation techniques.'' I am also assured by his \nstatement that ``the United States must not render or otherwise \ntransfer anyone to a country unless we have credible assurances that \nthey will not be subject to torture or other unacceptable treatment.''\n  His statements on privacy, civil liberties and checks and balances \nhave also been reassuring. He has expressed concern about the U.S. \nGovernment's accumulation of detailed private information on U.S. \ncitizens. He has reaffirmed that FISA is the ``only legal authority for \nconducting surveillance within the United States for intelligence \npurposes.'' He told me at his hearing that he would submit intelligence \nprograms to the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel at the \noutset, so that they are conducted under clear legal authorities. And, \nmore generally, he has stated that he sees it has his responsibility to \n``make clear that protecting the privacy and civil liberties of \nAmericans is as important as gathering intelligence.'' I do have \nconcerns about his statement that he supports immunity for companies \nthat allegedly cooperated with\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\nPresident Bush's illegal warrantless wiretapping program and will urge \nhim to reconsider his position once he is more familiar with the \nprogram.\n  I have found Admiral Blair to be very forthcoming with regard to \nreform. He clearly understands the importance not only of integrating \nthe intelligence community but of developing coherent strategies that \nbring the intelligence community together with other departments of the \nU.S. Government, as well as budgets that reflect those strategies. \nThese efforts have been central to my work in the Intelligence \nCommittee, as I sought--through legislation and classified letters--to \nobtain interagency counterterrorism and other national security \nstrategies from the Bush administration. I am confident that Admiral \nBlair will work to change this longstanding gap in our strategic \ncapabilities. I am also reassured by his statement, at his confirmation \nhearing, that he agrees with the need to bring together the ways the \nU.S. Government obtains information, through the IC as well as through \ndiplomatic reporting and other nonclandestine means. This critical \npriority was the subject of legislation introduced last year by Senator \nHagel and myself and passed by the Intelligence Committee, and I will \ncontinue working to enact that bill.\n  A related issue is the need to ensure that Department of Defense \nintelligence activities are conducted under the policies of the DNI and \nunder chief of mission authorities. In this regard, Admiral Blair has \nnot indicated any new policy positions. On the other hand, he has \nstated that he understands the importance of ``a coherent and \ncoordinated approach to foreign governments and intelligence services'' \nand has promised to ``act quickly to put in place procedures to \naccomplish the directed alignment of foreign intelligence and \ncounterintelligence agreements and to institutionalize it for the \nfuture.'' This is a critical issue, and I look forward to working \nclosely with Admiral Blair, should he be confirmed, as well as other \nmembers of the administration.\n  Another issue on which I expect to work with Admiral Blair, should he \nbe confirmed, is human rights. I have, and no doubt will continue to \nhave, disagreements with him about U.S. engagement with the Indonesian \nmilitary, notwithstanding the lack of accountability for human rights \nabuses. While Admiral Blair has helped clarify his role when he was at \nPacific Command, those substantive differences remain. Going forward, I \nam encouraged by his statement that the intelligence community ``needs \nto emphasize in its relationships around the world that the United \nStates respects and seeks to advance respect for human rights and that \nIC agencies do not condone behavior that violates this core American \nvalue.'' I expect to work with Admiral Blair to ensure that that \nmessage is conveyed convincingly.\n  Finally, I have raised concerns about Admiral Blair's past conflicts \nof interest. He has acknowledged mistakes, including his failure to \nseek counsel before deciding not to recuse himself. I have asked him \nwhether he would seek counsel in the future, including of ethics \nofficers, and he has assured me that he would.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1053-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1053-S1055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am a single, 55-year-old female. I commute Monday through \n     Friday to Boise for work. Currently it costs me approximately \n     one week's pay check (take home pay) per month, just to put \n     gas in the car to make the commute. Needless, to say, by the \n     time rent, utilities, and gas are paid, this leaves very \n     little for anything else--including groceries. Weekends? \n     Unless it is one trip to the grocery store, the car and I sit \n     at home out of necessity, not by choice. Now that summer is \n     here, I do not even have the option of walking to places in \n     downtown Caldwell, as I cannot manage the heat. I guess I \n     have officially become one of the working poor.\n     Cyndi, Caldwell.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hi Mike, I had sent you two times about what is going on \n     with coal to liquid and I receive no reply; what gives?\n       As long as we do not have the technology for hydrogen fuel \n     cars and batteries are not good enough yet, we are still \n     dependant on fossil fuels. Do something constructive and \n     start pushing for coal to liquid. This is the only way, at \n     this time to solve our energy crisis, as I mentioned before, \n     the process is almost identical to cracking oil, clean diesel \n     and all the other chemicals, except for gasoline.\n       I want an answer from you about this subject and no generic \n     answer.\n\n     Ed, Sandpoint.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Thank you for asking us Idahoans on how the gas prices are \n     affecting our lives. I was unable to do a vacation trip to \n     the coast, due to the high prices of gas. Instead of costing \n     $25 to fill my tank; it now takes about $75 to fill it up. I \n     now fill up every time it goes to a half of a tank. I have to \n     decide if I am going to put gas in my car or groceries that I \n     need. I do not do much now, just go back and forth to work \n     and pretty much nothing else. I cannot believe how things \n     have gotten out of hand. Everything has gone up within the \n     last 6 months. I have a home and do not want to risk losing \n     [it]. I have been at my job for the past 8 years and have not \n     gotten any type of raise in the last 4 years. My father is on \n     a limited income, and he cannot afford to put gas in his \n     vehicle, he just barely makes ends meet now. I take him to \n     the grocery store and take him on his errands, when he needs \n     to go somewhere. Thank you for taking the time to ask us how \n     we are doing here in Idaho.\n     Patricia, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I find it empowering that you are involving the people that \n     are so affected by the recent hikes in energy costs, in this \n     case, the price of fuel. I know that I share the pain of \n     trying to keep up with every American that has to depend on \n     gas and diesel to make it to work to survive and, due to \n     inevitable geography, visit loved ones throughout the U.S. I \n     must drive a full-sized truck and trailer to make a living \n     and filling it up yesterday was $124.40. That will last four \n     or five days depending on mileage. My wife commutes from \n     Caldwell to Payette, and even with a new Subaru that gets \n     good mileage, has to fill up every five days as well at a new \n     high price of $650. This is very difficult. Progressing with \n     a plan to save a little money, perhaps work on a much-needed \n     retirement someday has taken a back burner to simply making \n     it to work. Conservatively, we spend around $560 a month in \n     fuel prices. We do indeed need to find a solution, perhaps in \n     house drilling . . . I am not sure.\n       With further concern, both of our fathers are 71 and 74 \n     years old and in failing health. Both lives have been full \n     and, as we all know, the inevitable is upon us. Rising fuel \n     prices make it that much more difficult to see them. This is \n     a long list of complaints which I do not like to do, but this \n     is the voice of a country in desperate need. Thank you for \n     this opportunity, may we work together.\n     Howard.\n                                  ____\n\n       I want to get the attention of Congress. You people need to \n     listen to these letters from Senator Crapo. Who are you \n     representing? I do not believe the Constitution has ``We, the \n     special interest groups'' in it. We, ``The People'' want to \n     drill for oil on our own soil, use hydroelectric power, solar \n     power, wind power, nuclear power, any power that is available \n     to us in this country.\n       We the people are hurting. Do not you guys get it? We are \n     the United States of America! We can accomplish anything. We \n     the people are powerful, resourceful, proud of this land we \n     call America! Remove the road blocks so this innovation can \n     happen.\n       I am not the only frustrated citizen out there. Congress is \n     supposed to represent the people of this nation. [But it \n     seems that they are so disconnected, it is scary. I think \n     Congress should get the same Social Security plan and \n     insurance plan (or lack thereof) we get. Then things might \n     change. You just do not realize how much this rise in gas and \n     food prices are hurting Americans. I wish we the people could \n     vote on this issue. I think you would see a different \n     outcome. We would immediately be drilling for oil on our own \n     soil and finding innovative ways to create our own power. We \n     need to remove the handcuffs that government has put on \n     companies so this innovation could begin. America has always \n     been independent. What happened?\n       Even if the roadblocks were removed today, it is going to \n     take time to get these\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\n     new energy systems up and running. Why are not we starting? \n     Is it going to take people starving to death here in America \n     to get congress's attention? People are having to choose \n     between buying gas and buying food? Here in America?\n       Why are we depending upon getting oil from countries that \n     hate us? That is just not an intelligent strategy.\n     Debbie.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for reaching out to gain the opinions of the \n     people. Charles Krauthammer states his opinion beautifully in \n     the editorial below. The only points I would add is that the \n     world has only so much oil. If the U.S. begins drilling \n     offshore, it will give Americans a continued false sense of \n     confidence and for how long . . . 30 years . . . maybe. \n     Together Americans need to come together and develop \n     technology that is not oil based. We can do it now or we can \n     leave it for our children. There are other ways to help \n     relieve families of the financial difficulties the high cost \n     of oil is creating. I encourage you to focus on them.\n     Marion, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     At $4, Everybody Gets Rational\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n                          Friday, June 6, 2008\n\n       So now we know: The price point is $4.\n       At $3 a gallon, Americans just grin and bear it, suck it up \n     and, while complaining profusely, keep driving like crazy. At \n     $4, it is a world transformed. Americans become rational \n     creatures. Mass transit ridership is at a 50-year high. \n     Driving is down 4 percent. (Any U.S. decline is something \n     close to a miracle.) Hybrids and compacts are flying off the \n     lots. SUV sales are in free fall.\n       The wholesale flight from gas guzzlers is stunning in its \n     swiftness, but utterly predictable. Everything has a price \n     point. Remember that ``love affair'' with SUVs? Love, it \n     seems, has its price too.\n       America's sudden change in car-buying habits makes suitable \n     mockery of that absurd debate Congress put on last December \n     on fuel efficiency standards. At stake was precisely what \n     miles-per-gallon average would every car company's fleet have \n     to meet by precisely what date.\n       It was one out-of-a-hat number (35 mpg) compounded by \n     another (by 2020). It involved, as always, dozens of \n     regulations, loopholes and throws at a dartboard. And we \n     already knew from past history what the fleet average number \n     does. When oil is cheap and everybody wants a gas guzzler, \n     fuel efficiency standards force manufacturers to make cars \n     that nobody wants to buy. When gas prices go through the \n     roof, this agent of inefficiency becomes an utter redundancy.\n       At $4 a gallon, the fleet composition is changing \n     spontaneously and overnight, not over the 13 years mandated \n     by Congress. (Even Stalin had the modesty to restrict himself \n     to five-year plans.) Just Tuesday, GM announced that it would \n     shutter four SUV and truck plants, add a third shift to its \n     compact and midsize sedan plants in Ohio and Michigan, and \n     green-light for 2010 the Chevy Volt, an electric hybrid.\n       Some things, like renal physiology, are difficult. Some \n     things, like Arab-Israeli peace, are impossible. And some \n     things are preternaturally simple. You want more fuel-\n     efficient cars? Do not regulate. Do not mandate. Do not \n     scold. Do not appeal to the better angels of our nature. Do \n     one thing: Hike the cost of gas until you find the price \n     point. Unfortunately, instead of hiking the price ourselves \n     by means of a gasoline tax that could be instantly refunded \n     to the American people in the form of lower payroll taxes, we \n     let the Saudis, Venezuelans, Russians and Iranians do the \n     taxing for us--and pocket the money that the tax would have \n     recycled back to the American worker.\n       This is insanity. For 25 years and with utter futility \n     (starting with ``The Oil-Bust Panic,'' the New Republic, \n     February 1983), I have been advocating the cure: a U.S. \n     energy tax as a way to curtail consumption and keep the money \n     at home. On this page in May 2004 (and again in November \n     2005), I called for ``the government--through a tax--to \n     establish a new floor for gasoline,'' by fully taxing any \n     drop in price below a certain benchmark. The point was to \n     suppress demand and to keep the savings (from any subsequent \n     world price drop) at home in the U.S. Treasury rather than \n     going abroad. At the time, oil was $41 a barrel. It is now \n     $123.\n       But instead of doing the obvious--tax the damn thing--we go \n     through spasms of destructive alternatives, such as \n     efficiency standards, ethanol mandates and now a crazy carbon \n     cap-and-trade system the Senate is debating this week. These \n     are infinitely complex mandates for inefficiency and \n     invitations to corruption. But they have a singular virtue: \n     They hide the cost to the American consumer.\n       Want to wean us off oil? Be open and honest. The British \n     are paying $8 a gallon for petrol. Goldman Sachs is \n     predicting we will be paying $6 by next year. Why have the \n     extra $2 (above the current $4) go abroad? Have it go to the \n     U.S. Treasury as a gasoline tax and be recycled back into \n     lower payroll taxes.\n       Announce a schedule of gas tax hikes of 50 cents every six \n     months for the next two years. And put a tax floor under $4 \n     gasoline, so that as high gas prices transform the U.S. auto \n     fleet, change driving habits and thus hugely reduce U.S. \n     demand--and bring down world crude oil prices--the American \n     consumer and the American economy reap all of the benefit.\n       Herewith concludes my annual exercise in futility. By the \n     time I write next year's edition, you'll be paying for gas in \n     bullion.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing in response to your request for stories about \n     energy prices. I was surprised to see that the average family \n     spends $200 a month on gasoline. Our family is spending $700 \n     a month on gasoline, not including vacations. In a relatively \n     rural area such as Middleton, we travel 15-20 miles for work, \n     church and shopping, and 5-10 miles to schools and any other \n     activities in which our children are involved. Of these \n     five--work, church, shopping, school, and activities, we \n     could cut down on the activities our children are involved in \n     (and we have), but the other four are not an option.\n       Add to this the fact that our property taxes in Middleton \n     were raised by a third, which we are starting to pay for this \n     month, and it makes our budget extremely tight. So tight, in \n     fact, that we have put our home up for sale, and I will be \n     adding substitute teaching onto my busy schedule as a mother \n     of six to be able to make ends meet; well, I should say some \n     of the ends--many needs will still remain unfilled because \n     our budget will be so tight.\n       My suggestions for Congress: 1) Drill for more oil in our \n     own country, being as environmentally friendly as you can; 2) \n     Use much more nuclear power; 3) Find out who is suppressing \n     the technologies that will allow us to move away from \n     dependence on gasoline in our cars.\n       Thank you for inviting us to share our stories and \n     suggestions.\n     Lorena, Middleton.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing [because] you want to know what is going on in \n     the real world. Well, I am here to tell you that it is not \n     easy to do. I am a single mom [who] is raising a teenage son. \n     I am fighting cancer with no insurance because it is too \n     expensive. So it is now down to do I pay the medical bills \n     and keep fighting the cancer or do I put gas in my car to go \n     back and forth to work? Do I put gas in the car or do I put \n     food on the table for me and my son? We are in a war with \n     Iraq but yet we are still importing oil from that country and \n     supporting them after they bombed our country. Where is the \n     smarts in that? We have oil wells here in the U.S. that are \n     capped off and not being used when we could support our \n     country put our own people back to work. We have fuel in \n     reserve for war time, [but we are in war time]. [We should] \n     open the reserves and show them we do not need their oil and \n     the prices would come down per barrel. They say the reason \n     that the cost per barrel is so high is because of the danger \n     of getting the oil out well that is because we are in a war \n     with them.\n       Thanks for listening.\n     Tracy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Every issue needs balance. I ask you to take this letter \n     with all the other to the Hill to give balance to your \n     argument to off-shore oil drilling.\n       Two years ago our family made some changes. We traded in \n     our 10 miles to the gallon SUV and purchased a vehicle that \n     would get 21 mpg. We tuned up our bicycles and ride them at \n     every opportunity, and we walk to places we would have driven \n     years ago. We also use conservation methods and turn off \n     lights, recycle, and encourage everyone we meet to do the \n     same.\n       Mr. Crapo, this is the answer to your call to off-shore \n     drilling. It is conservation, not more oil. It is reducing \n     the size of trucks and cars and homes. It is limiting the use \n     of recreational vehicles that waste millions of gallons \n     daily. It is a new consciousness that we must ultimately \n     learn to live with to survive with our earth and the changing \n     dynamics of our energy use.\n       The call for MORE is only a stop gap. It does little to \n     solve the problem and does everything to get you through one \n     more election. Remember, you are riding on the coattails of \n     the most unpopular President in our history. That alone \n     should cause you concern.\n       I would be surprised if this letter makes the stack that is \n     presented to the Senate. It does little to support your \n     argument but does express the issue the mood of one of many \n     of the voters in your home state.\n       Thank you\n\n     Kirk, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       It is time we stopped building homes no one will buy and \n     started building nuclear power plants, putting up windmills, \n     and using this land these developers have gobbled up to grow \n     corn to feed our families. Building more houses (as in Boise \n     when 9,000 homes are up for sale due to a loss of jobs) is \n     nonproductive in this housing market. This would also put \n     people to work and possibly help with the illegal problem we \n     have in Nampa. These people come here to build houses and do \n     landscaping.\n       When I used to fill my truck for $56 and it would last a \n     month, now it is $82. I live on Social Security Disability. \n     Cutting food, I have already done. Cutting utility costs, I \n     did this month. I cannot cut my meds or my insurance, but I \n     do not go see my Dr. as often as I should.\n     Barbara, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I really appreciate your willingness to step up and getting \n     the information from the people about problems in our \n     economy. This is my story--myself and my family, which \n     includes four children ages from 12 to 5 years, and my wife. \n     We just bought a house that\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\n     made our life a lot easier about 1 year and a half ago. This \n     house is a lot bigger than the one we had. I needed a house \n     that could fit all of us. So I went from a 1,146 square foot \n     home to a 2,000 square foot home, a lot better. But ever \n     since the prices of gas started going up, it has put us in a \n     bind. Right now I am now about 2 months behind on my mortgage \n     and really do not have any way of making it up. So we have \n     the house on the market for a short sale. Since the gas \n     prices are rising, people are not shopping like they used to, \n     so my wife's work is affected hence her hours are cut. I work \n     all the way in Boise and live in Nampa. I have been at my job \n     for 9 years now, and it seems like I am just working to get \n     back and forth.\n       I really think that we should start drilling other places \n     now. The economy is going or is already taking a big hit on \n     everything. Since the price of gas basically controls the \n     price of everything like food and since I have four kids, my \n     grocery bill has [gone] up, also. Another option maybe is to \n     have the oil companies cut the Americans a stimulus check at \n     the end of every fiscal year. They are making a huge profit. \n     That tells me that the price can go down a lot and they can \n     still make a little money. Instead they want to help hurt the \n     economy. In my eyes, they are no better than terrorists.\n       Thanks for taking the time to read my email and hopefully \n     since we the people actually put you guys into these \n     positions to help the economy and keep our country, state, \n     city safe and running like a well-oiled machine, I really \n     hope that something can come of this. I really believe that \n     if gas prices run around $2.50 a gallon they can still make a \n     profit and keep things going in our country with no problem.\n     Jason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1055-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        CONGRATULATING THE WARREN COUNTY PREVENTION PARTNERSHIP\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Bush as \nthe Delaware/Maryland Director for USDA Rural Development where she \noversaw housing, business, water and waste loan programs, community \nfacilities and grant programs for my State of Delaware and neighboring \nMaryland.\n  My staff and I have had the great privilege of working with her on \nrural development projects including economic development, housing and \nthe provision of critical public utilities throughout rural Delaware.\n  She started her remarkable career in politics in 1982 when she served \nas State director for my predecessor, Senator Bill Roth. While Senator \nRoth was known for his many accomplishments on the national level, in \nDelaware, he was best known for providing outstanding constituent \nservices. No one was more responsible for building and sustaining this \nhigh level of service than Marlene. Striving to meet this standard has \nbeen one of my highest priorities as a U.S. Senator and a great \nchallenge for my staff because Marlene set the bar so high. She truly \nrepresents the highest level of excellence in public service. More \nimportantly, Marlene has the heart of a public servant which is a rare \nquality but one that is sorely needed in the world today.\n  First and foremost, Marlene was a proud southern Delawarean. She grew \nup on a family farm near Laurel, DE, graduated as valedictorian of her \nclass at Laurel High School, and subsequently graduated from Delaware \nTechnical and Community College and Salisbury University with a major \nin business administration. In addition to her public service, she has \nbeen, and remains, very active in her church and community, having \nserved as past president of the Georgetown-Millsboro Rotary Club, \nformer vice chairman of the Republican State Committee, a past Honorary \nWing Commander at the Dover Air Force Base, a member of the Laurel \nChamber of Commerce, a board member of the Delmarva Christian High \nSchool, and a member of the Delaware Tech Educational Foundation \nCouncil.\n  She has also received numerous awards, including Outstanding Young \nWomen of America in 1982, Delaware Young Careerist for Delaware \nBusiness and Professional Women in 1985, and the first recipient of the \nWilliam Roth Outstanding Achievement Award in 2004, just to name a few.\n  I have had the great pleasure of working with Marlene Elliott Brown \nfor many years and joined her frequently to announce USDA funding for \nprojects throughout southern Delaware. Her hard work and dedication to \nthe betterment of rural communities has helped enrich the lives of many \nDelawareans. Marlene's vibrant spirit is unwavering and her fervent \ncommitment to public service reflects the desire of an individual \ndevoted to making a difference. She is truly a generous and caring \nfriend who has provided inspiration to many. While representing the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture in Delaware and Maryland, Marlene \nsomehow found time to help train not one but two people who have served \nas my county directors in Sussex County. For that, I will always be \ngrateful.\n  Marlene and her husband still live on a family farm near Laurel where \nshe grew up, and I know that her family, community and our state are \nvery proud of her accomplishments. I want to personally thank Marlene's \nfamily for their willingness to share her with all of us. Marlene is \nquite simply a very good person with a great heart, and I wish her well \non the next stage of her noteworthy career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1055-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1055-S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING AUSTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Orangeburg, SC, has lost one of its \nfinest citizens with the passing of 94-year-old Austin Cunningham. Mr. \nCunningham led a most distinguished life and his contributions to the \npeople and community will be greatly missed.\n  During his life, Mr. Cunningham was a soldier, businessman, community \nleader, writer, lawyer and citizen of the year. His hometown newspaper, \nthe Orangeburg Times and Democrat, summed up his life--Mr. Cunningham \nwas, ``the definition of a Renaissance man.''\n  If there was a business or civic endeavor that would improve the life \nof his town and community, Mr. Cunningham was involved. From putting in \nnew street lights to tackling the war on drugs on the streets of \nOrangeburg, Mr. Cunningham was proof that one person could make a \ndifference.\n  Mr. Cunningham played an instrumental role in helping young, \nunderprivileged, at-risk teenagers find employment and learn the value \nof hard work. In 1984, he was invited to the White House to meet with \nPresident Reagan who thanked him for participating in this program.\n  He was also a patron of the arts who supported and encouraged the \nchoir at South Carolina State University, one of our Nation's foremost \nhistorically Black universities. The university awarded him its \nDistinguished Service Award in 1995.\n  Orangeburg, SC, has lost a fine citizen, friend, and community leader \nwith the passing of Austin Cunningham. His life work deserves \nrecognition on the contributions he made to his fellow citizens.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and citizens of \nOrangeburg,\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\nSC, on the passing of Austin Cunningham.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1056-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMIL SABA\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate Jamil Saba, who served as the sheriff of Dougherty \nCounty, GA, for more than two decades until he retired in December \n2008.\n  Sheriff Saba was born and raised in Albany, GA, which is located in \nDougherty County. He remained there, serving his community proudly. \nJamil served his country in the U.S. Army from 1960 through 1962 and \nbegan his career in law enforcement in April of 1970 as a deputy \nSheriff with the Dougherty County Sheriff's Office. He was later \npromoted to chief investigator in 1972, the job he held for more than a \ndecade until he won election and became sheriff in 1985.\n  As a true leader, Sheriff Saba has served as president of the Georgia \nSheriff's Association and president of the Georgia Sheriffs' Youth \nHomes, as well as on the Georgia Sheriffs' Retirement Board of \nDirectors. He was a board member of the Georgia Public Safety \nCommittee, the Dougherty County Child Abuse Protocol Committee, the \nChild Death Investigations Protocol Committee, Sexual Assault Protocol \nCommittee, and many others.\n  His service efforts and accomplishments at the local level are \nplentiful as well. Jamil was the chairman of the advisory board for the \nAlbany-Dougherty Drug Unit and is a charter member of the Albany Sports \nHall of Fame.\n  Jamil worked tirelessly for Daugherty County as sheriff and plans to \ncontinue serving a cause that touched him the most deeply, the Georgia \nSheriffs' Youth Homes Foundation Board. I want to recognize and thank \nhis wife Donna Jaye Adams and their son, Jim, and daughter, Lauren, for \nmaking the sheriff's job easier and sharing him with the community. I \nhope you all find joy in the coming years together during Jamil's \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1056-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JERRY L.

Lancaster, who served as the sheriff of \nPulaski County, GA, for 28 years and retired on December 31, 2008.\n  Jerry was born and raised in Hawkinsville, GA, which is located in \nPulaski County. He remained there in order to serve his community \nproudly for many years. Jerry worked with the Georgia State Patrol for \nnearly 10 years before being elected sheriff in 1980. As sheriff, he \nstrived to live out the values he was taught as a child--hard work, \nfairness, honesty, respect, and discipline. His gifts to the community \nhave been immeasurable. The level of respect the community has for him \nis evidenced in the fact that he is the longest serving sheriff in the \nhistory of the county and was never defeated in an election.\n  Jerry not only worked tirelessly for Pulaski County as sheriff, but \nhe also gave of his time through his service on the Board of the \nGeorgia Sheriff's Boys' Ranch. He gives credit to his wife Nell Goss \nLancaster for her unfailing support, and I honor and thank her, their \ntwo children and three grandchildren for making Jerry's job easier and \nsharing him with the community.

LEMONDS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate SSG Gary Lemonds, a lifelong citizen of Walton \nCounty, real estate broker, and decorated Vietnam veteran who passed \naway on January 8, 2009.\n  Gary Lemonds served with Company F, 75th Ranger Regiment in Cu Chi, \nVietnam, and was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame on August 25, \n1994, at a ceremony in Fort Benning, GA. His induction was based on his \ninvolvement in a conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic \nof Vietnam. Staff Sergeant Lemonds served as a team leader during an \nambush patrol maneuver on April 9 and April 10, 1969. When an enemy \nforce launched a massive attack, Sergeant Lemonds led his men in an \nassault on the enemy emplacements. He single-handedly charged a bunker \nand destroyed it with grenades, then, sighting another fortification, \nhe crawled through fierce enemy fire and silenced it with his rifle. \nAfter eliminating the hostile entrenchment system, he continued his \npatrol mission. On April 10, 1969, his patrol was attacked a second \ntime. From his patrol position in a bomb crater, he called in artillery \nand air support on the large enemy element. When withdrawing his troops \nto a nearby landing zone for evacuation, he came under sniper fire from \ntwo North Vietnamese soldiers, whom he quickly eliminated with a \ngrenade. Intense enemy fire thwarted the extraction aircraft's first \nlanding attempt, so he directed a gun ship on the enemy location and \neffected a successful extraction.\n  His extraordinary heroism earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, \na Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, three Purple Hearts as well as \nnumerous other awards and medals. He also continued to honor other \nservice men and women well after his tour in Vietnam through his \ninvolvement with the Patriot Guard Riders.\n  Gary is survived by two daughters and a son-in-law, Kimberly Lemonds \nand Jennifer and Jason Needham; his mother Dorothy Lemonds; sister and \nbrother-in-law Glenda and Tom Lewis; grandchildren Jessica Lemonds, \nJohn Cwiek, and Pressley Needham, and a niece and nephew. Along with \nGary, I would like to recognize his family today and thank them for \nsharing their beloved family member with our proud Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1056-4", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1056-S1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JOHN A. BAKER\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to praise a citizen from \nmy State who recently passed away. In December John A. Baker who was \nloved and respected by those who knew and worked with him lost his \nbattle with pancreatic cancer.\n  John A. Baker is survived by his wife Judy of 42 years, son Jesse M. \nBaker Sr., daughter Leslie Cummings, grandchildren Maria Graham, April \nBlakemore, Jesse M. Baker Jr., great grandson Joseph, mother-in-law \nLenora Moore, sister-in-law Susan Wooden, nephews Jim and Mark Wooden, \ngreat niece Marina Lenora Wooden, brother-in-law Charles Moore, nephews \nRichard, Ryan, Mathew, and Kyle Moore. John is also survived by sister \nLena Susort, brother Cecil Baker, nieces Lavonne Ruggles, Mary Beth \nDagit, Barbara Collins and nephew Frank Baker, and several great, great \ngreat nieces and nephews.\n  John A. Baker was like many Alaskans. He was born in Iowa in 1937 and \ngraduated from Everett High School in Everett, Washington in 1949 \nbefore finding his way to our great State. I have to tell you, what was \nWashington and Iowa's loss, was Alaska's gain.\n  John found his way to Alaska after serving in the U.S. Army in \nAustralia during the Korean conflict. Upon coming to Alaska he first \nworked in Ketchikan where he was employed by Ketchikan Soda Works. He \nalso flew part time for Weber Air and worked at Ellis Airlines as a \nmechanic in the landing gear section where he met and later partnered \nwith Chuck Traylor.\n  He and Chuck Traylor formed a floatplane operation, Stikine Air \nService, out of Wrangell in 1962. John held both an airframe and power \nplant mechanic license and was one of our Alaskan bush pilots. After \nselling his interest in the Stikine Air Service he moved to Juneau to \nwork for Channel Flying Service.\n  John met Judy Moore Churchill in 1964, they were married on March 11, \n1966, and moved to Juneau. After 3 years John and Judy returned to \nWrangell where John worked at Wrangell's first television station. In \nconjunction with John's position at the TV station Judy opened Forget-\nMe-Not Florist, which provided many, many flower arrangements that went \nto the grand opening of the brand new saw mill office and other \nbusinesses in town.\n  Always the entrepreneurs and getting tired of never being able to \npurchase milk at the end of the week, John and Judy rented a small \nbuilding from C.V. Hendersen and began a home milk delivery and small \n``cash and carry'' market. As things changed John, along with wife, \nJudy entered\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\nthe field of rentals and real estate where they devoted over 35 years \nof their lives and presently own Grand View Bed and Breakfast which \noverlooks Zimovia Strait and the Elephants' Nose. Also, during this \ntime John continued to occasionally fly for Stikine Air Service and \nworked as a truck driver on the North Slope until his retirement.\n  During this time Judy also served as the business manager for the \nWrangell District of the U.S. Forest Service where she and John served \nas surrogate parents and guardians for many of the new Forest Service \nemployees and couples who came to Alaska to work in the Wrangell Ranger \nDistrict. It was through their wisdom and kindness and John's sense of \nhumor that dozens of young families learned how to assimilate \nthemselves into the Wrangell community.\n  John was a 1961 active Past Master Mason of the Ketchikan Masonic \nLodge No. 19, a member of Ducks Unlimited, Muskeg Meadows Golf Club, \nFriends of the Museum, Wrangell Elks Lodge No. 1595, Pioneers of Alaska \nIgloo No. 15, and a member of Teamsters Local 959. He served on the \nInter-Island Ferry Authority from its inception until 1999. John also \nspent many volunteer hours working as a docent at the Wrangell Museum \nwhen tour ships were in.\n  John was also a man who invested in his community. He served on the \nWrangell City Council five different times including: October 1989-\nOctober 1990; November 1993-October 1994; October 1994-October 1997; \nJanuary 1998-October 1998; and finally from April 1999-October 1999.\n  As I said, the Bakers are well known in Wrangell for helping young \ncouples new to Alaska learn the ways of Alaska as well as for John's \nsense of humor. When asked why he moved to Wrangell he would always \ntell people it was his ``youthful exuberance.'' And when asked in the \n1980s why he had decided to work on the Alaska pipeline instead of \ncontinuing his flying career he simply said ``there are not many old, \nbold, pilots in Alaska--besides work on the pipeline paid more.''\n  Judy and John were always willing to lend a hand and help their \nneighbors and to make their community--Wrangell--a better place for \neveryone to live. John invested himself in southeast Alaska and made \nWrangell a ``better community'' and made all that knew him ``better \npeople.'' He will be missed by his family and friends and most \nimportantly by his loving wife of 42 years, Judy. God grant him his \njust reward, he will be missed in Wrangell and in the hearts of those \nwho knew him--God's speed John Baker, may the wind always be under your \nwings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1057-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO FATHER NORMAN ELLIOTT\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \n90th birthday of one of Alaska's most beloved religious leaders, Father \nNorman Elliott. When people think of Alaska, they think of the natural \nbeauty and skylines defined by mountains; rarely are the religious \nleaders that bind our lives together recognized for their devotion to \nour communities.\n  Father Elliott began his record of service in 1941 by enlisting in \nthe U.S. Army, serving in Europe for 5 years. After the conclusion of \nWorld War II, he returned to school and earned his B.A., followed by a \nmaster of divinity from the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria \nin 1951.\n  He knew from an early age that he wanted to serve as a missionary and \nbegan seeking an appointment overseas, hoping for a post in India or \nthe Philippines. Retired Reverend William J. Gordon, Jr., the Bishop of \nAlaska, convinced him to serve in Alaska, a position that changed his \nlife. Since 1952, he has served all over our State. Father Elliott was \nordained in Anchorage at the All Saints' Episcopal Church, earned his \npilot's license, and then was transferred to Fort Yukon, where he flew \nmissions to nearby villages. He then spent some time in Fairbanks and \nKetchikan before returning to Anchorage, where he forged a strong \nrelationship between the Greek Orthodox Church, the Jewish \nCongregation, and the All Saints' Episcopal Church.\n  He retired in 1990, but between almost daily visitations at the \nProvidence Hospital and the Alaska Native Medical Centers, and his \nservice as Chaplain at the Port of Anchorage, he can hardly be \nconsidered a retiree.\n  For more than 50 years, Father Elliott has been a beloved pastor and \nkey leader in interreligious relationships throughout Alaska. I speak \nfor so many Alaskans in wishing Father Norman Elliott a happy 90th \nbirthday. We extend our best wishes to him for continued good health \nand good works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1057-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1.

A bill to require hedge funds to register with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 3 years ago, I started conducting \noversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission. That oversight \nbegan in response to a whistleblower who came to my office complaining \nthat SEC supervisors were impeding an investigation into a major hedge \nfund.\n  Soon afterward, I came to the floor of the Senate to introduce an \nimportant piece of legislation based on what I learned from that \noversight. The bill was aimed at closing a loophole in securities law \nthat allows hedge funds to operate under the cloak of secrecy. \nUnfortunately, that bill, S. 1402, was never taken up by the Banking \nCommittee in the last Congress.\n  In light of the current instability in our financial system, I think \nit is very critical for the Senate to deal with this issue and do it in \nthe near future. Therefore, I am pleased Senator Levin, who is on the \nfloor, and I worked together to produce an even better version of the \nbill than I introduced previously, and we are now doing that in the \n111th Congress.\n  I thank Senator Levin because he is on a very important oversight \ncommittee as well and does a lot of oversight, as I do. I appreciate \neverything he does in maybe a lot of different areas than I do, but I \nappreciate working together with him on this issue.\n  This new bill, the Hedge Fund Transparency Act, does everything the \nprevious version did, but it does more and does it better.\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\n  As in the previous version, it clarifies current law to remove any \ndoubt that the Securities and Exchange Commission has the authority to \nrequire hedge funds to register--simply to register--so the Government \nknows who they are and what they are doing. It removes the loophole \npreviously used by hedge funds to escape the definition of an \n``investment company'' under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n  Under this legislation, hedge funds that want to avoid the stringent \nrequirements of the Investment Company Act will only be exempt if, one, \nthey file basic disclosure forms; and two, cooperate with requests for \ninformation from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  I thank Senator Levin for not only cosponsoring this legislation but \nalso contributing a key addition to this new version of the bill. In \naddition to requiring basic disclosure, this version also makes it \nclear that the hedge funds have the same obligations under our money \nlaundering statutes as other financial institutions. They must report \nsuspicious transactions and establish anti-money laundering programs.\n  One major cause of the current crisis is a lack of transparency. \nMarkets need a free flow of reliable information to function properly. \nTransparency was the focus of our system of securities regulations \nadopted way back in the 1930s. Unfortunately, over time, the wizards on \nWall Street figured out a million clever ways to avoid transparency. \nThe result is the confusion and uncertainty fueling the crisis today \nthat we see.\n  This bill is an important step toward renewing commitment to \ntransparency on Wall Street and establishing credibility in our \nfinancial sector among the American populace. Unfortunately, there was \nnot much of an appetite for this sort of commonsense legislation when I \nfirst introduced it before the financial crisis erupted. Hopefully, \nattitudes have changed, given all that has happened since the collapse \nof Bear Stearns last March. It is all very obvious to us, and \nparticularly connected with the credit crunch and with the recession.\n  Hedge funds are pooled investment companies that manage billions of \ndollars for groups of wealthy investors, and do it in total secrecy. \nHedge funds affect regular investors. They affect the market as a \nwhole. My oversight of the SEC convinces me that the Commission needs \nmuch more information about the activities of hedge funds in order to \nprotect the markets. Any group of organizations that can wield hundreds \nof billions of dollars in market power every day should be transparent \nand disclose basic information about their operations to the agency \nthat Americans rely on as the watchdogs of our Nation's financial \nmarkets.\n  As I explained when I first introduced this bill, the Securities and \nExchange Commission already attempted to oversee the hedge fund \nindustry by regulation. Congress needs to act now because of a decision \nof a Federal appeals court. In 2006, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals \noverturned an SEC administrative rule requiring the registration of \nhedge funds. That decision effectively ended all registration of hedge \nfunds with the Securities and Exchange Commission, unless and until we \nin Congress take action.\n  The Hedge Fund Transparency Act would respond to that court decision \nby, one, including hedge funds in the definition of investment company; \nand two, bringing much needed transparency to this supersecretive \nindustry. The Hedge Fund Transparency Act is a first step in ensuring \nthat the Securities and Exchange Commission has clear authority to do \nwhat it has already tried to do. Congress must act to ensure that our \nlaws are kept up to date as new types of investments appear.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation hasn't had many friends. These funds \ndon't want people to know what they do or who participates in them. \nThey have fought hard to keep it that way. Well, I think that is all \nthe more reason to shed some light--particularly some sunlight--on them \nto see what they are doing.\n  So I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this legislation, to \nsupport Senator Levin of Michigan and me in this effort as we work to \nprotect all taxpayers, large and small.\n  Once again I thank Senator Levin. And before I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nbackground paper on the Hedge Fund Transparency Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Hedge Fund Transparency Act\n\n       Background: This bill is a revised version of S. 1402, \n     which Sen. Grassley introduced in the 110th Congress. While \n     the previous bill amended the Investment Advisers Act of \n     1940, this bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 \n     (``ICA''). However, the purpose is the same: to make it clear \n     that the Securities and Exchange Commission has the authority \n     to require hedge fund registration. This version also adds a \n     provision authored by Sen. Levin to require hedge funds to \n     establish anti-money laundering programs and report \n     suspicious transactions.\n\n\n                  hedge fund registration requirements\n\n       Definition of an Investment Company: Hedge Funds typically \n     avoid regulatory requirements by claiming the exceptions to \n     the definition of an investment company contained in \n     Sec. 3(c)(1) or Sec. 3(c)(7) of the ICA. This bill would \n     remove those exceptions to the definition, transforming them \n     to exemptions by moving the provisions, without substantive \n     change, to new sections Sec. 6(a)(6) and Sec. 6(a)(7) of the \n     ICA.\n       Requirements for Exemptions: An investment company that \n     satisfies either Sec. 6(a)(6) or Sec. 6(a)(7) will be \n     exempted from the normal registration and filing requirements \n     of the ICA. Instead, a company that meets the criteria in \n     Sec. 6(a)(6) or Sec. 6(a)(7) but has assets under management \n     of $50,000,000 or more, must meet several requirements in \n     order to maintain its exemption. These requirements include:\n       1. Registering with the SEC.\n       2. Maintaining books and records that the SEC may require.\n       3. Cooperating with any request by the SEC for information \n     or examination.\n       4. Filing an information form with the SEC electronically, \n     at least once a year. This form must be made freely available \n     to the public in an electronic, searchable format. The form \n     must include:\n       a. The name and current address of each individual who is a \n     beneficial owner of the investment company.\n       b. The name and current address of any company with an \n     ownership interest in the investment company.\n       c. An explanation of the structure of ownership interests \n     in the investment company.\n       d. Information on any affiliation with another financial \n     institution.\n       e. The name and current address of the investment company's \n     primary accountant and primary broker.\n       f. A statement of any minimum investment commitment \n     required of a limited partner, member, or investor.\n       g. The total number of any limited partners, members, or \n     other investors.\n       h. The current value of the assets of the company and the \n     assets under management by the company.\n       Timeframe and Rulemaking Authority: The SEC must issue \n     forms and guidance to carry out this Act within 180 days \n     after its enactment. The SEC also has the authority to make a \n     rule to carry out this Act.\n       Anti-Money Laundering Obligations: An investment company \n     exempt under Sec. 6(a)(6) or Sec. 6(a)(7) must establish an \n     anti-money laundering program and report suspicious \n     transactions under 31 U.S.C.A 5318(g) and (h). The Treasury \n     Secretary must establish a rule within 180 days of the \n     enactment of the Act setting forth minimum requirements for \n     the anti-money laundering programs. The rule must require \n     exempted investment companies to ``use risk-based due \n     diligence policies, procedures, and controls that are \n     reasonably designed to ascertain the identity of and evaluate \n     any foreign person that supplies funds or plans to supply \n     funds to be invested with the advice or assistance of such \n     investment company.'' The rule must also require exempted \n     investment companies to comply with the same requirements as \n     other financial institutions for producing records requested \n     by a federal regulator under 31 U.S.C. 5318(k)(2).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, history has proven time and time again that \nthe markets are not self-policing. Today's financial crisis is due in \npart to the Government's failure to regulate key market participants, \nincluding hedge funds that have become unregulated financial \nheavyweights in the U.S. economy. So I am joining today with my \ncolleague Senator Grassley of Iowa to introduce the Hedge Fund \nTransparency Act, and I thank Senator Grassley for his leadership on \nthis and in so many other areas involving oversight of our financial \ninstitutions.\n  Hedge funds sound complicated, but they are simply private investment \nfunds in which investors have agreed to pool their money under the \ncontrol of an investment manager. What distinguishes them from other \ninvestment funds is that hedge funds are typically open only to \n``qualified purchasers,'' an SEC term referring to institutional \ninvestors such as pension funds and wealthy individuals with assets \nover a\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\nspecified minimum amount. In addition, most hedge funds have 100 or \nfewer beneficial owners. By limiting the number of their beneficial \nowners and accepting funds only from investors of means, hedge funds \nhave been able to qualify for the statutory exclusions provided in the \nInvestment Company Act and avoid the obligation to comply with that \nlaw's statutory and regulatory requirements. In short, hedge funds have \nbeen able to operate outside of the reach of the Securities and \nExchange Commission.\n  The primary argument for allowing these funds to operate outside SEC \nregulation and oversight is that because their investors are generally \nmore experienced than the general public, they need fewer government \nprotections and their investment funds should be permitted to take \ngreater risks than investment funds open to the investing public which \nneed greater SEC protection. Indeed, the ability of hedge funds to take \non more risk is the very reason that many individuals and institutions \nchoose to invest in them. These investors accept more risk because that \nmight lead to bigger rewards.\n  The compensation system employed by most hedge funds encourages that \nrisk taking. Typically, investors agree to pay hedge fund investment \nmanagers a management fee of 2 percent of the fund's total assets, plus \n20 percent of the fund's profits. The hedge fund managers profit \nenormously if a fund does well, but due to the guaranteed management \nfee, get a hefty payment even when the fund underperforms or fails. The \nanalysis up to now has been that if wealthy people want to take big \nrisks with their money, all else being equal, they should be allowed to \ndo so without the safeguards normally required for the general public.\n  So what is the problem with allowing their investment funds to \noperate outside of Federal regulation and oversight? The problem is \nthat hedge funds have gotten so big and are so entrenched in U.S. \nfinancial markets that their actions can now significantly impact \nmarket prices, damage other market participants, and can even endanger \nthe U.S. financial system and the economy as a whole.\n  The systemic risks posed by hedge funds first became obvious 10 years \nago. Back then, Long-Term Capital Management--or LTCM--was a hedge fund \nthat, at its peak, had more than $125 billion in assets under \nmanagement and, due to massive borrowing, a total market position of \n$1.3 trillion. When it began to falter, the Federal Reserve worried \nthat it might unload its assets in a rush, drive down prices, and end \nup damaging not only other firms but U.S. markets as a whole. To \nprevent a financial meltdown, the Federal Reserve worked with the \nprivate sector to engineer a rescue package.\n  That was just over a decade ago. Since then, according to a recent \nreport issued by the Congressional Research Service, the hedge fund \nindustry has expanded roughly tenfold. In 2006, the SEC testified that \nhedge funds represented 5 percent of all U.S. assets under management \nand 30 percent of all equity trading volume in the United States. By \n2007, an estimated 8,000 hedge funds were managing assets totaling \nroughly $1.5 trillion. The most current estimate is that 10,000 hedge \nfunds are managing approximately $1.8 trillion in assets, after \nsuffering losses over the last year of over $1 trillion.\n  In addition, over the last 10 years, billions of dollars being \nmanaged by hedge funds have been provided by pension plans. A 2007 \nreport by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the \namount of money that defined benefit pension plans have invested in \nhedge funds has risen from about $3.2 billion in 2000 to more than $50 \nbillion in the year 2006. That total is probably much higher now. And \nwhile most individual pension funds invest only a small slice of their \nmoney in hedge funds, a few go farther. For example, according to the \nGAO report, as of September 2006, the Missouri State Employees \nRetirement System had invested over 30 percent of its assets in hedge \nfunds. Universities and charities have also directed significant assets \nto hedge funds. The result is that hedge fund losses threaten every \neconomic sector in America, from the wealthy to the working class \nrelying on pensions, to our institutions of higher learning, to our \nnonprofit charities.\n  A third key developed is that over the last 10 years, some of the \nlargest U.S. banks and security firms have set up their own hedge funds \nand used them to invest not only client funds but also their own cash. \nIn some cases, these hedge funds have commingled client and \ninstitutional funds and linked the fate of both to high-risk investment \nstrategies. These hedge fund affiliates are typically owned by the same \nholding companies that own federally insured banks or federally \nregulated broker-dealers. Because of their ownership, their size and \nreach, their clientele, and the high-risk nature of their investments, \nthe failure of hedge funds today can imperil not only their direct \ninvestors, but also the financial institutions that own them, that lent \nthem money, or did business with them. From there, the effects can \nripple through the markets and impact the entire economy.\n  It is time for Congress to step into the breach and establish clear \nauthority for Federal regulation and oversight of hedge funds. That is \nthe backdrop for the introduction of the Grassley-Levin Hedge Fund \nTransparency Act.\n  The purpose of this bill is to institute a reasonable and practical \nregulatory regime for hedge funds. The bill contains four basic \nrequirements to make hedge funds subject to SEC regulation and \noversight.\n  It requires them to register with the SEC, to file an annual \ndisclosure form with basic information that will be made publicly \navailable, to maintain books and records required by the SEC, and to \ncooperate with any SEC information request or examination.\n  In addition, the bill directs Treasury to issue a final rule \nrequiring hedge funds to establish anti-money laundering programs and, \nin particular, to guard against allowing suspect offshore funds into \nthe U.S. financial system. The Bush Administration issued a proposed \nanti-money laundering rule for hedge funds seven years ago, in 2002, \nbut never finalized it. A 2006 investigation by the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, showed how two hedge \nfunds brought millions of dollars in suspect funds into the United \nStates, without any U.S. controls or reporting obligations, and called \non a bipartisan basis for the proposed hedge fund anti-money laundering \nregulations to be finalized, but no action was taken. Hedge funds are \nthe last major U.S. financial players without anti-money laundering \nobligations, and it is time for this unacceptable regulatory gap to be \neliminated.\n  Our bill imposes a set of basic disclosure obligations on hedge funds \nand makes it clear they are subject to full SEC oversight while, at the \nsame time, exempting them from many of the obligations that the \nInvestment Company Act imposes on other types of investment companies, \nsuch as mutual funds that are open for investment by all members of the \npublic. The bill imposes a more limited set of obligations on hedge \nfunds in recognition of the fact that hedge funds do not open their \ndoors to all members of the public, but limit themselves to investors \nof means. The bill also, however, gives the SEC the authority it needs \nto impose additional regulatory obligations and exercise the level of \noversight it sees fit over hedge funds to protect investors, other \nfinancial institutions, and the U.S. financial system as a whole.\n  The bill imposes these requirements on all entities that rely on \nSections 80a-3(c)(1) or (7) to avoid compliance with the full set of \nthe Investment Company Act requirements. A wide variety of entities \ninvoke those sections to avoid those requirements and SEC oversight, \nand they refer to themselves by a wide variety of terms--hedge funds, \nprivate equity funds, venture capitalists, small investment banks, and \nso forth. Rather than attempt a futile exercise of trying to define the \nspecific set of companies covered by the bill and thereby invite future \nclaims by parties that they are outside the definitions and thus \noutside the SEC's authority, the bill applies to any investment company \nthat has at least $50 million in assets or assets under its management \nand relies on Sections 80a-3(1) or (7) to avoid compliance with the \nfull set of Investment Company Act requirements. Instead, those \ncompanies under the bill have to comply with a reduced set of \nobligations, which include filing an annual public disclosure\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\nform, maintaining books and records specified by the SEC, and \ncooperating with any SEC information request or examination.\n  Finally, our bill makes an important technical change. It moves \nparagraphs (c)(1) and (7)--the two paragraphs that hedge companies use \nto avoid complying with the full set of Investment Act Company \nrequirements--from Section 80a-3 to Section 80a-6 of the Investment \nCompany Act. While our bill preserves both paragraphs and makes no \nsubstantive changes to them, it moves them from the part of the bill \nthat defines ``investment company'' to the part of the bill that \nexempts certain investment companies from the Investment Company Act's \nfull set of requirements.\n  The bill makes this technical change to make it clear that hedge \nfunds really are investment companies, and they are not excluded from \nthe coverage of the Investment Company Act. Instead, they are being \ngiven an exemption from many of that law's requirements, because they \nare investment companies which voluntarily limited themselves to one \nhundred or fewer beneficial owner accepting funds only from investors \nof means. Under current law, the two paragraphs allow hedge funds to \nclaim they are excluded from the Investment Company Act--they are not \ninvestment companies at all and are outside the SEC's reach. Under our \nbill, the hedge funds would qualify as investment companies--which they \nplainly are--but would qualify for exemptions from many of the Act's \nrequirements by meeting certain criteria.\n  It is time to bring hedge funds under the federal regulatory \numbrella. With their massive investments, entanglements with U.S. \nbanks, securities firms, pension funds, and other large investors, and \ntheir potential impact on market equilibrium, we cannot afford to allow \nthese financial heavyweights to continue to operate free of government \nregulation and oversight.\n  When asked at a recent hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee whether hedge funds should be regulated, \ntwo expert witnesses gave the exact same one-word answer: ``Yes.'' One \nlaw professor, after noting that disclosure requirements don't apply to \nhedge funds, told the Committee: ``If you asked a regulator what . . . \nrole did hedge funds play in the current financial crisis, I think they \nwould look at you like a deer in the headlights, because we just don't \nknow.'' It is essential that federal financial regulators know what \nhedge funds are doing and that they have the authority to prevent \nmissteps and misconduct.\n  The Hedge Fund Transparency Act will protect investors, and it will \nhelp protect our financial system. I hope our colleagues will join us \nin support of this bill and its inclusion in the regulatory reform \nefforts that Congress will be undertaking later this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Leahy, \n        and Mr. Kaufman):\n  S. 345 A bill to reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of \n1998 through fiscal year 2012, to rename the Tropical Forest \nConservation Act of 1998 as the ``Tropical Forest and Coral \nConservation Act of 2009'', and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Tropical Forest and \nCoral Conservation Act of 2009, a bill to protect outstanding tropical \nforests and coral reefs in developing countries through Debt for Nature \nSwaps that then-Senator Biden and myself first passed more than ten \nyears ago.\n  This bill reauthorizes a proven program which enjoys the ardent \nsupport of the Treasury Department and State Department for the third \ntime since 1998. It will help developing countries reduce foreign debt \nand provide comprehensive environmental preservation programs to \nprotect tropical forests and endangered marine habitats around the \nworld. This bill will also serve as an important diplomatic tool to \nprovide for our national security.\n  As one of the most successful U.S. conservation assistance programs, \nthe agreements concluded under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act so \nfar will together generate over $188 million to help conserve over 50 \nmillion acres of tropical forests in Asia, the Caribbean, Central and \nSouth America. In addition, private donors, including the Nature \nConservancy, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation \nSociety, and Conservation International, have contributed more than $12 \nmillion to TFCA swaps, leveraging U.S. Government funds. This is an \neffective use of scarce Federal conservation dollars. But the rate of \ndeforestation continues to accelerate across the globe.\n  This bill is an example of how we can use economic incentives and \nopportunities to change behavior and to influence personal and societal \nchoices. Clearly, there are economic opportunities in clean energy \nsources, solar, wind and biofuels, and carbon sequestration and storage \ntechnologies. But improvements in farming and forestry practices may be \namong the lowest hanging fruit in the quest to deal with climate \nchange.\n  During the global climate change discussions in the late 1990s in \nKyoto, the concept of carbon sinks provided by forestry and agriculture \nwas taken off the table. Last year during the Bali discussions, the \ntopic of carbon sequestration through forestry and agricultural \npractices was revived. This is an important development, and it should \nbe embraced by the United States.\n  Also alarming is the rapid rate of coral reef and coastal \nexploitation. The burden of foreign debt falls especially hard on \nnations with few natural resources that often resort to harvesting or \notherwise exploiting coral reefs and other marine habitats to earn hard \ncurrency to service foreign debt. According to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, 61 percent of the world's coral reefs \nmay be destroyed by the year 2050 if the present rate of destruction \ncontinues.\n  The Tropical Forest and Coral Conservation Act expands the current \ntropical forest conservation programs to include the protection and \nconservation of these vital coral ecosystems. This legislation will \nmake available resources for environmental stewardship that would \notherwise be of the lowest priority in a developing country. It will \nreduce debt by investing locally in programs that will strengthen \nindigenous economies by creating long-term management policies that \nwill preserve the natural resources upon which local commerce is based.\n  Both Indonesia and Brazil have been declared eligible for Tropical \nForest Conservation Act funds. Brazil is the second most populous \nnation in our hemisphere. It wields enormous influence over neighboring \nstates in South America and has expressed interest in a leading global \nrole. It would be a diplomatic mistake to hinder our outreach to a \nnation on an issue--conservation--where we have mutual goals. \nSimilarly, we should not encumber conservation cooperation with one the \nlargest democracies in the world, Indonesia. The United States cannot \nafford to squander diplomatic opportunities that allow us to establish \nworking relationships with key agencies in such strategically important \nnations.\n  This legislation has enormous consequences for the existence of \ncritical ecosystems, the health of our planet, the livelihoods of \nmillions of people across the globe, and even the security of Americans \nhere at home.\n  I would like to provide additional information about activities under \nthis act.\n  Fourteen TFCA agreements have been concluded to date in Bangladesh, \nEl Salvador, Belize, Peru, the Philippines, Panama, Guatemala, \nColombia, Paraguay, Botswana, Costa Rica, and Jamaica. With the \nreauthorization of TFCA, the U.S. Government will be able to pursue \nagreements to conserve threatened coral reefs along with tropical \nforests.\n  The Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2009 \nauthorizes appropriations for debt reduction for eligible countries at \n$25,000,000 in fiscal year 2009; $30,000,000 in fiscal year 2010; \n$30,000,000 in fiscal year 2011; and $30,000,000 in fiscal year 2012 \nsubject to appropriations.\n  First, the bill authorizes a Debt Swap option under which a third \nparty may purchase the debt of a TFCA-eligible country in exchange for \nthe creation of a fund to support tropical forest or coral reef \nconservation. The terms of the agreement are negotiated with the \ncountry, the third party and the U.S. Government.\n  Under this option, there may be no cost to the United States \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S1062]]\n\nbecause the financial assistance involved would come from \nnongovernmental or private entities. Third-party funding may be \nleveraged, in part, with U.S. Government appropriated funds.\n  Second, the bill authorizes a debt reduction option in which \nprincipal and interest payments due to the U.S. Government may be \nwholly or partially reduced. In return, the country accepts a new \nobligation to make payments to a conservation fund to be administered \nby a tropical forest or coral reef board within that country.\n  The bill authorizes appropriations to compensate the United States \nTreasury for the reduction in the revenues caused by TFCA debt \ntreatment. However, these funds would be effectively leveraged because \nthe amounts placed by an eligible country in its conservation fund \nwould exceed the cost of debt reduction to the United States Treasury.\n  Third, under the Buy Back option, an eligible country is able to buy \nback its debt at its asset value in exchange for its willingness to \nplace an additional amount based on the purchase price in local \ncurrency in a tropical forest fund.\n  Under this third option, there would be no cost to the United States \nGovernment since the debt is being bought back at its value as \ndetermined under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.\n  The Tropical Forest Conservation and Coral Act applies to \nconcessional loans made under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and \ncredits granted under the Agricultural Trade and Assistance Act of \n1954. It is consistent with established Treasury Department debt \nreduction practices as well as with the Federal Credit Reform Act of \n1990.\n  Within each developing country, the conservation fund would be \nadministered by a commission representing a majority of local \nnongovernmental, community development and scientific and academic \norganizations, representatives of the host government and a \nrepresentative of the United States Government.\n  The conservation fund could be used to provide grants for the \nfollowing purposes: to preserve, maintain or restore the tropical \nforest or coral reef of the beneficiary country through establishing \nparks and reserves; to develop and implement scientifically sound \nsystems of natural resource management; to provide training programs to \nstrengthen the scientific, technical and managerial capacities of \nindividuals and organizations involved in conservation; to provide for \nrestoration, protection and sustainable use of diverse animal and plant \nspecies; to provide research and identification of medicinal uses of \ntropical forest plant life to treat human diseases, illnesses, and \nhealth-related concerns; to develop and support individuals living in \nor near a tropical forest or coral reef, including the cultures of such \nindividuals.\n  Oversight of this program would continue through multiple mechanisms \nincluding the following: funds for this program are subject to periodic \nformal evaluations and annual fund evaluations recently required as \npart of OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool, PART. TFCA Evaluation \nScorecard is completed each year on each TFCA Fund. The Evaluation \nScorecard was developed to provide for consistent, on-going evaluation \nand reporting across local TFCA programs.\n  Local TFCA funds are subject to regular audits. In addition, the \nlocal board or oversight committee monitors performance under each \ngrant agreement to make sure that time schedules and other performance \ngoals are being achieved. Grant agreements include budgets, timelines, \nand provisions requiring periodic progress reports from the grantee to \nthe board.\n  In addition, the U.S. Government uses the annual management budget \nprovided by Congress to fund evaluations of local TFCA programs. \nEvaluations undertaken with these funds include local site visits to \ndetermine that activities are being carried out consistent with the \nterms of the TFCA agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 \nto provide that funds received as universal service contributions and \nthe universal service support programs established pursuant to that \nsection are not subject to certain provisions of title 31, United \nStates Code, commonly known as the Antideficiency Act; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to reintroduce, with my \ncolleague Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, a bipartisan effort to ensure \nthat all universal service programs can continue to operate smoothly \nand effectively. While Congress has annually taken action to deal with \nthis issue, our hope is to enact a permanent solution.\n  For many years, we have fought hard for universal service, including \nthe E-Rate. It is essential for all of the universal service programs \nto operate in a timely manner.\n  The Universal Service Fund is accomplishing its mission, and every \nmember who has worked with us should be proud of the progress of this \nprogram. Our country has a strong telecommunications network, and rural \ncustomers are getting service at affordable rates. Lifeline and Linkup \nprograms help the poorest of customers keep basic telephone access \nwhich is essential in our modern world. Rural health care is helping \nconnect our rural clinics to modern medicine and specialists.\n  In 1996, when the Telecommunications Act passed, only 14 percent of \nall classrooms were connected, while just 5 percent of the poorest \nclassrooms were connected. The latest data is encouraging with 93 \npercent of all classrooms connected and 89 percent of the poorest \nclassrooms connected. Since 1998, West Virginia schools and libraries \nhave received over $101 million in E-Rate discounts. While this is an \nextraordinary success, the need for E-Rate discounts remains because \nschools and libraries face monthly telecommunication costs and Internet \naccess fees. Additionally, every school and library will periodically \nneed to upgrade its internal connections as the demand of technology \ngrows and institutions need greater bandwidth to handle ever increasing \ndemand. At the beginning of the debates in 1996, schools were talking \nabout dial-up access,\n\n[[Page S1064]]\n\nnow every school wants--and needs--broadband.\n  This legislation gives the Universal Service Fund a permanent \nexemption from the Antideficiency Act which will provide sustainability \nand consistency for the program. Over the last few years, we have done \none-year exemptions. Other Federal programs have permanent exemptions \nfor the Antideficiency Act, and it is common sense to grant an \nexemption for the Universal Service Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 349. A bill to establish the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage \nArea in the State of Pennsylvania, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould establish the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area in York \nand Lancaster Counties, Pennsylvania. Since 1984, Congressionally-\ndesignated National Heritage Areas have fostered partnerships between \nthe public and private sectors for undertaking preservation, \neducational, and recreational initiatives in diverse regions throughout \nthe country. Through these efforts, National Heritage Areas have helped \nto protect our nation's natural and cultural resources while promoting \nlocal economic development. Today, I am proud once again to join my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter to propose a bill \nthat would grant national recognition to the Susquehanna Gateway \nregion, an area that has played a key role in the development of our \nnation's cultural, political, and economic identity.\n  As the Senate continues its work in the 111th Congress, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to pass the Susquehanna Gateway \nNational Heritage Area Act soon so that the region can begin to play a \nnational role in sharing America's story.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Susquehanna Gateway National \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) numerous sites of significance to the heritage of the \n     United States are located within the boundaries of the \n     proposed Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area, which \n     includes the Lower Susquehanna River corridor and all of \n     Lancaster and York Counties in the State of Pennsylvania;\n       (2) included among the more than 200 historically \n     significant sites, structures, districts, and tours in the \n     area are--\n       (A) the home of a former United States President;\n       (B) the community where the Continental Congress adopted \n     the Articles of Confederation;\n       (C) the homes of many prominent figures in the history of \n     the United States;\n       (D) the preserved agricultural landscape of the Plain \n     communities of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania;\n       (E) the exceptional beauty and rich cultural resources of \n     the Susquehanna River Gorge;\n       (F) numerous National Historic Landmarks, National Historic \n     Districts, and Main Street communities; and\n       (G) many thriving examples of the nationally significant \n     industrial and agricultural heritage of the region, which are \n     collectively and individually of significance to the history \n     of the United States;\n       (3) in 1999, a regional, collaborative public-private \n     partnership of organizations and agencies began an initiative \n     to assess historic sites in Lancaster and York Counties, \n     Pennsylvania, for consideration as a Pennsylvania Heritage \n     Area;\n       (4) the initiative--\n       (A) issued a feasibility study of significant stories, \n     sites, and structures associated with Native American, \n     African-American, European-American, Colonial American, \n     Revolutionary, and Civil War history; and\n       (B) concluded that the sites and area--\n       (i) possess historical, cultural, and architectural values \n     of significance to the United States; and\n       (ii) retain a high degree of historical integrity;\n       (5) in 2001, the feasibility study was followed by \n     development of a management action plan and designation of \n     the area by the State of Pennsylvania as an official \n     Pennsylvania Heritage Area;\n       (6) in 2008, a feasibility study report for the Heritage \n     Area--\n       (A) was prepared and submitted to the National Park \n     Service--\n       (i) to document the significance of the area to the United \n     States; and\n       (ii) to demonstrate compliance with the interim criteria of \n     the National Park Service for National Heritage Area \n     designation; and\n       (B) found that throughout the history of the United States, \n     Lancaster and York Counties and the Susquehanna Gateway \n     region have played a key role in the development of the \n     political, cultural, and economic identity of the United \n     States;\n       (7) the people of the region in which the Heritage Area is \n     located have--\n       (A) advanced the cause of freedom; and\n       (B) shared their agricultural bounty and industrial \n     ingenuity with the world;\n       (8) the town and country landscapes and natural wonders of \n     the area are visited and treasured by people from across the \n     globe;\n       (9) for centuries, the Susquehanna River has been an \n     important corridor of culture and commerce for the United \n     States, playing key roles as a major fishery, transportation \n     artery, power generator, and place for outdoor recreation;\n       (10) the river and the region were a gateway to the early \n     settlement of the ever-moving frontier;\n       (11) the area played a critical role as host to the \n     Colonial government during a turning point in the \n     Revolutionary War;\n       (12) the rural landscape created by the Amish and other \n     Plain people of the region is of a scale and scope that is \n     rare, if not entirely unknown in any other region, in the \n     United States;\n       (13) for many people in the United States, the Plain people \n     of the region personify the virtues of faith, honesty, \n     community, and stewardship at the heart of the identity of \n     the United States;\n       (14) the regional stories of people, land, and waterways in \n     the area are essential parts of the story of the United \n     States and exemplify the qualities inherent in a National \n     Heritage Area;\n       (15) in 2008, the National Park Service found, based on a \n     comprehensive review of the Susquehanna Gateway National \n     Heritage Area Feasibility Study Report, that the area meets \n     the 10 interim criteria of the National Park Service for \n     designation of a National Heritage Area;\n       (16) the preservation and interpretation of the sites \n     within the Heritage Area will make a vital contribution to \n     the understanding of the development and heritage of the \n     United States for the education and benefit of present and \n     future generations;\n       (17) the Secretary of the Interior is responsible for \n     protecting the historic and cultural resources of the United \n     States;\n       (18) there are significant examples of historic and \n     cultural resources within the Heritage Area that merit the \n     involvement of the Federal Government, in cooperation with \n     the management entity and State and local governmental \n     bodies, to develop programs and projects to adequately \n     conserve, support, protect, and interpret the heritage of the \n     area;\n       (19) partnerships between the Federal Government, State and \n     local governments, regional entities, the private sector, and \n     citizens of the area offer the most effective opportunities \n     for the enhancement and management of the historic sites \n     throughout the Heritage Area to promote the cultural and \n     historic attractions of the Heritage Area for visitors and \n     the local economy; and\n       (20) the Lancaster-York Heritage Region, a 501(c)(3) \n     nonprofit corporation and State-designated management entity \n     of the Pennsylvania Heritage Area, would be an appropriate \n     management entity for the Heritage Area.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to enhance the capacity of the United States to \nundertake global development activities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Whitehouse, \nMurray, Cardin and Dodd, I am introducing a bill to triple the number \nof Foreign Service officers working with USAID.\n  As we take stock of America's image in the world, it's clear that we \nneed to do more to help countries stabilize their society and their \neconomy.\n  Our own security depends on the stability of far-flung places beyond \nour borders.\n  America's generosity and ability to help other countries is becoming \nmore important to the effectiveness of our foreign policy.\n  In the U.S., the responsibility for development falls largely to the \nU.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n  USAID was founded by the Kennedy administration in 1961. It became \nthe first U.S. foreign assistance organization with the primary goal of \nlong term economic and social development efforts overseas.\n  During its first decade, it had more than 5,000 Foreign Service \nOfficers serving all over the world, often in the most difficult of \nconditions.\n  Today--at a time when the U.S. needs to show its leadership overseas \nmore than ever--USAID operates with just 1,000 Foreign Service \nOfficers.\n  With so few people to deploy, our hands are tied and we're missing \nopportunities to build bridges and foster diplomacy.\n  For example, more than seven years after U.S. took military action in \nAfghanistan, the Taliban and al Qaeda continue to undermine progress \ntoward a more stable state.\n  Our military has done a heroic job in Afghanistan. But success in \nAfghanistan also depends on improving the lives of the Afghan people--\njobs, agriculture, stability, and a functional government.\n  We have not done enough to win the hearts and minds of the Afghan \npeople. And the military cannot bear this burden alone.\n  The last time I went to Afghanistan there were only six American \nagricultural experts for the entire country--I think today there are \nonly slightly more.\n  For a nation with an agricultural economy and record poppy harvest, \nwe have been able to lend just a handful of agricultural development \nexperts.\n  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates understands this critical need to \npartner our military efforts with civilian development expertise. Last \nmonth he said:\n\n       The problem is that the civil side of our government--the \n     Foreign Service and foreign-policy side, including our aid \n     for international development--[has] been systematically \n     starved of resources for a quarter of a century or more . . . \n     We have not provided the resources necessary, first of all, \n     for our diplomacy around the world; and second, for \n     communicating to the rest of the world what we are about and \n     who we are as a people.\n\n  Many people on both sides of the aisle agree that USAID is no longer \nequipped to do its job effectively. We simply are not meeting the \ninternational development goals of the United States.\n  USAID has been shortchanged--and America's efforts abroad have \nsuffered as a result.\n  Now we have a lot of needs here at home, to be sure. But one \nimportant lesson of the last few years is that America must be engaged \nif we are to remain a leader in world affairs.\n  The Increasing America's Global Development Capacity Act of 2009 \nwould take the first step toward putting the Agency for International \nDevelopment on firmer footing. As Secretary Clinton said in her remarks \nto USAID employees last week, it is ironic that that our very best \nyoung military leaders are given unfettered resources to spend as they \nsee fit to build a school, to open a health clinic, to pave a road, and \nour diplomats and development experts have to go through miles of \npaperwork to spend ten cents. Secretary Clinton said, and I agree, that \nthis is not a sensible approach.\n  The bill would authorize USAID to hire an additional 700 Foreign \nService Officers this year. This would basically double the current \nnumber of development officers available to work in targeted countries.\n  This is fundamental to rebuilding the agency's capacity.\n  Senator Leahy, Chair of the Foreign Operations Appropriations \nSubcommittee, shares a commitment to rebuilding USAID. I am heartened \nby the Subcommittee's recommended increase in funding for USAID's \noperating expenses for fiscal year 2009. This was a priority for me in \nthe bill, and Chairman Leahy has been very supportive.\n  My bill also would establish a goal of hiring an additional 1,300 \nForeign Service Officers by 2012.\n  After three years, USAID would have more than 3,000 talented, \ncommitted Americans serving in the world's most difficult locations \nhelping to improve the lives of others. It won't be the 5,000 experts \nof the 1960s, but it will be a big improvement from today.\n  With a stronger development work force, we can send talented public \nservants to help improve child and maternal health, treat people with \nAIDS, TB and malaria, provide clean water and sanitation, help farmers \nand women start or improve their business, and assist reformers and \ncivic leaders to build stronger democratic institutions.\n  We all recall the renewed interest in public service that emerged \nafter 9/11--many of those people have answered the call, and I bet \nthere are as many more who would welcome an opportunity to serve.\n  Foreign development assistance is as important a foreign policy tool \nas diplomacy and defense.\n  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is perhaps the most persuasive \nadvocate for rebuilding our civilian development capacity. He argues \nthat we need to engage in non-military ways to pursue global \ndevelopment goals.\n  The civilian instruments of national security--diplomacy, development \nassistance, sharing expertise on civil society--are becoming more and \nmore important.\n  Secretary Gates argues that these tools are good for the world's \npoor, our national security, and our country.\n  I agree.\n  Let us take one concrete step to rebuild that important civilian \ncapacity, which would help improve our ability to help the world's \npoorest countries and people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) foreign development assistance is an important foreign \n     policy tool in addition to diplomacy and defense;\n       (2) development assistance is part of any comprehensive \n     United States response to regional conflicts, terrorist \n     threats, weapons proliferation, disease pandemics, and \n     persistent widespread poverty;\n       (3) in 2002 and 2006, the United States National Security \n     Strategy included global development, along with defense and \n     diplomacy, as the 3 pillars of national security;\n       (4) in its early years, the United States Agency for \n     International Development (referred to in this Act as \n     ``USAID'') had more than 5,000 full-time Foreign Service \n     Officers;\n       (5) in 2008, USAID had slightly more than 1,000 full-time \n     Foreign Service Officers;\n       (6) the budget at USAID, calculated in real dollars, has \n     dropped 27 percent since 1985;\n       (7) this decline in personnel and operating budgets has \n     diminished the capacity of USAID to provide development \n     assistance and implement foreign assistance programs; and\n\n     SEC. 3. HIRING OF ADDITIONAL FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS AS \n                   USAID EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) Initial Hirings.--Except as provided under subsection \n     (c), not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Administrator of USAID (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Administrator'') shall increase by not less \n     than 700 the total number of full-time Foreign Service \n     Officers employed by USAID compared to the number of such \n     officers employed by USAID on September 30, 2008.

A bill to amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the \nRevised Statutes of the United States to prohibit financial holding \ncompanies and national banks from engaging, directly or indirectly, in \nreal estate brokerage or real estate management activities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community \nChoice In Real Estate Act of 2009. I am pleased to have Senator Burr \njoin me in introducing this bill. In previous Congresses, this bill was \nintroduced by former Senators Allard and Clinton, and I am happy to \ncontinue their efforts.\n  The Community Choice in Real Estate Act of 2003 would clarify \nCongressional intent that real estate brokerage and management are not \nfinancial activities and would therefore retain the separation of \ncommerce and banking that was intended during consideration of the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act got many things wrong when it repealed the \nfirewall between the activities of banks and those of the stock market, \nbonds and insurance and allowed these institutions to engage in riskier \nactivities. But one thing that it did get right was maintaining the \nfirewalls separating the financial and commercial sectors.\n  We already have seen the damage to our economy and real estate market \ncaused when banks began to engage in certain previously prohibited \nactivities. If the firewall separating banking and commerce also were \nto be torn down, it would further undermine banks' ability to be \nneutral arbiters of capital and lend based on financial principles and \nwithout bias. The S crisis of the 1980's has already shown us what \ncan happen when federal rules keeping financial services separate from \ncommercial activities are weakened.\n  Real estate brokerage and management have always been considered by \nCongress to be commercial transactions, and not financial matters. This \nwas further reflected when Congress specifically chose not to include \nreal estate activities as one of the powers given to national banks and \nfinancial holding companies as part of Gramm-Leach-Bliley.\n  However, following the passage of that Act, the Federal Reserve and \nthe Treasury Department proposed rules in response to a petition by \nsome financial services entities that would have allowed them to own \nand operate local real estate brokerage and property management \ncompanies.\n  Since fiscal year 2003, Congress has included language in the annual \nappropriations bill for the Treasury Department to prevent the use of \nfunds to implement these regulations. These have only been temporary \nfixes, however, and we ought to resolve this issue once and for all in \nthe 111th Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Begich, and Mr. McCain):\n  S.J. Res. 7. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to the election of Senators; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, our founding fathers did a remarkable \njob in drafting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights. \nTheir work was so superb that in the 217 years since the ratification \nof the Bill of Rights, the Constitution has only been amended 17 times. \nBut every so often, a situation arises that so clearly exposes a flaw \nin our constitutional structure that it requires a constitutional \nremedy.\n  Over the past several months, our country has witnessed multiple \ncontroversies surrounding appointments to vacant Senate seats by \ngovernors. The vacancies in Illinois and New York have made for \nriveting political theater, but lost in the seemingly endless string of \npress conferences and surprise revelations is the basic fact that the \ncitizens of these states have had no say in who should represent them \nin the Senate. The same is true of the recent selections in Delaware \nand Colorado. That is why I will introduce today a constitutional \namendment to end gubernatorial appointments to the U.S. Senate and \nrequire special elections to fill these vacancies, as is currently \nrequired for House vacancies. I am pleased that the recently elected \nSenator from Alaska, Senator Begich, and the distinguished senior \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, have agreed to be original \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  I do not make this proposal lightly. In fact, I have opposed dozens \nof constitutional amendments during my time in the Senate, particularly \nthose that would have interfered with the Bill of Rights. The \nConstitution should not be treated like a rough draft. Constitutional \namendments should be considered only when a statutory remedy to a \nproblem is not available, and when the impact of the issue at hand on \nthe structure of our government, the safety, welfare, or freedoms of \nour citizens, or the survival of our democratic republic is so \nsignificant that an amendment is warranted. I believe this is such a \ncase.\n  In 1913, the citizens of this country, acting through their elected \nstate legislatures, ratified the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. \nOur esteemed colleague Senator Byrd, in Chapter 21 of his remarkable \nhistory of the United\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\nStates Senate, lays out in fascinating detail the lengthy struggle to \nobtain for the citizens of this country the right to elect their \nSenators. The original Constitution, as we all know, gave state \nlegislatures the right to choose the Senators for their states. While \nthe first proposal to amend the Constitution to require the direct \nelection of Senators was introduced in the House in 1826, the effort \nonly really picked up steam after the Civil War.\n  As Senator Byrd recounts: ``In the post-Civil War period, state \nlegislatures became increasingly subject to intimidation and bribery in \nthe selection of Senators.'' Nine cases of bribery came before the \nSenate between 1866 and 1906. And between 1891 and 1905, the state \nlegislatures from 20 different states deadlocked 45 times when trying \nto pick a Senator. At one point, a Senate seat from Delaware remained \nvacant for 4 years because of deadlocks.\n  The political theater occasioned by these Senate appointment fights \ndwarfs even the extraordinary events we have witnessed in recent \nmonths. Senator Byrd quotes from an account by the historian George \nHaynes about efforts to select a Senator in Missouri in 1905:\n\n       Lest the hour of adjournment should come before an election \n     was secured, an attempt was made to stop the clock upon the \n     wall of the assembly chamber. Democrats tried to prevent its \n     being tempered with; and when certain Republicans brought \n     forward a ladder, it was seized and thrown out of the window. \n     A fist-fight followed, in which many were involved. Desks \n     were torn from the floor and a fusillade of books began. The \n     glass of the clock-front was broken, but the pendulum still \n     persisted in swinging until, in the midst of a yelling mob, \n     one member began throwing ink bottles at the clock, and \n     finally succeeded in breaking the pendulum. On a motion to \n     adjourn, arose the wildest disorder. The presiding officers \n     of both houses mounted the speaker's desk, and, by shouting \n     and waving their arms, tried to quiet the mob. Finally, they \n     succeeded in securing some semblance of order.\n\n  Popular sentiment for direct election of Senators slowly grew in \nresponse to events like these. Some states held popular referenda on \nwho should be Senator and attempted to require their legislatures to \nselect the winners of those votes. More and more Senators were chosen \nin such processes, leading to more support in the Senate for a \nconstitutional amendment. Congress finally acted in 1911 and 1912. \nThere was high drama in the Senate as Vice President James Schoolcraft \nSherman broke a tie on a crucial substitute amendment offered by \nSenator Joseph Bristow of Kansas during Senate consideration of the \njoint resolution. A few days of parliamentary wrangling ensued over \nwhether the Vice President's tie breaking role in the Senate extends to \nsuch situations, and that precedent still stands today. In May 1912, an \nimpasse of almost a year was broken and the House receded to the Senate \nversion of the amendment, allowing it to be sent to the States for \nratification. Less than a year later, on April 8, 1913, Connecticut \nbecame the 36th State to ratify the amendment, and it became the 17th \nAmendment to the Constitution.\n  I recount this summary of the history of the 17th Amendment, and \nagain, I commend to my colleagues Senator Byrd's chapter on the \nsubject, first to make the point that even though it seems obvious to \nus that the Senate should be elected by the people, the struggle for \nthat right was not easy or fast. But the cause was just and in the end \nthe call for direct elections was too strong to be ignored. I believe \nthe same result will occur here. It may take time, but in the end, I am \nconfident that the principle that people must elect their \nrepresentatives will prevail.\n  Second, this history shows that the public's disgust with the \ncorruption, bribery, and political chicanery that resulted from having \nSenators chosen by state legislatures was a big motivation for passing \nthe amendment. Gubernatorial appointments pose the same dangers, and \ndemand the same solution--direct elections.\n  Finally, the history indicates that the proviso in the 17th amendment \npermitting gubernatorial appointments to fill temporary vacancies was \nnot the subject of extensive debate in the Congress. The proviso \noriginated in the substitute amendment offered by Senator Bristow. The \nBristow substitute was designed, its sponsor explained, to ``make[] the \nleast possible change in the Constitution to accomplish the purposes \ndesired; that is the election of Senators by popular vote.'' Most \nsignificantly, it deleted a provision in the resolution as originally \nintroduced that year that would have amended Article I, section 4 of \nthe Constitution to remove Congress's supervisory authority to make or \nalter regulations concerning the time and manner of Senate elections.\n  The proviso, explained Senator Bristow, ``is practically the same \nprovision which now exists in the case of such a vacancy. The governor \nof the State may appoint a Senator until the legislature elects.'' \nAlthough significant debate over other provisions in the Bristow \namendment is found in the Record before the climactic tie vote, which \nwas broken by the Vice President, there seems to have been no further \ndiscussion of the proviso.\n  Thus, it appears that the proviso was simply derived from the \noriginal constitutional provision in Article I, Section 3, which gave \nthe power to choose Senators to the state legislatures, but allowed \ngovernors to appoint temporary replacements when the legislatures were \nnot in session. It was unremarkable at the time of the 17th Amendment \nto allow governors to have the same temporary replacement power once \ndirect elections were required. That would explain the apparent lack of \ndebate on the question. The long and contentious debate over the \namendment was dominated by much more basic issues, such as whether the \npeople should elect their Senators at all, and whether Congress should \nalso amend the ``time, place, or manner clause'' of Article I, section \n4.\n  Nearly 100 years later, that proviso has allowed a total of 184 \nSenators to be appointed by governors, and we have a situation in \ntoday's Senate where the people of four states, comprising over 12 \npercent of the entire population of the country, will be represented \nfor the next two years by someone they did not elect. It is very hard \nto imagine that the Congress that passed the 17th Amendment and the \nstates that ratified it would have been comfortable with such an \noutcome. Indeed, some argue that the intent of the 17th Amendment was \nthat temporary appointments to fill early vacancies should last only \nuntil a special election can be scheduled, rather than for an entire \ntwo-year Congress until the next general election. A number of states \nhave adopted that approach, but many have not.\n  That is not to say that the people appointed to Senate seats are not \ncapable of serving, or will not do so honorably. I have no reason to \nquestion the fitness for office of any of the most recent appointees, \nand I look forward to working with them. But those who want to be a \nU.S. Senator should have to make their case to the people whom they \nwant to represent, not just the occupant of the governor's mansion. And \nthe voters should choose them in the time-honored way that they choose \nthe rest of the Congress of the United States.\n  I want to make it clear that this proposal is not simply a response \nto these latest cases that have been in the news over the past few \nmonths. These cases have simply confirmed my longstanding view that \nSenate appointments by state governors are an unfortunate relic of the \npre-17th Amendment era, when state legislatures elected U.S. Senators. \nDirect election of Senators was championed by the great progressive Bob \nLa Follette, who served as Wisconsin's Governor and a U.S. Senator. \nIndeed, my State of Wisconsin is now one of only 4 States, Oregon, \nMassachusetts, and Alaska are the others, that clearly require a \nspecial election to fill a Senate vacancy in all circumstances.\n  The vast majority of states still rely on the appointment system, \nwhile retaining the right to require direct elections, as the \nMassachusetts legislature and the voters of Alaska have done in recent \nyears. But changing this system state by state would be a long and \ndifficult process, even more difficult than the ratification of a \nconstitutional amendment, particularly since Governors have the power \nto veto state statutes that would take this power away from them. \nFurthermore, the burden should not be on Americans to pass legislation \nin their states protecting their fundamental voting rights--the right \nto elect one's representatives is a bedrock principle and\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\nshould be reaffirmed in the nation's ruling charter.\n  We need to finish the job started by La Follette and other reformers \nnearly a century ago. Nobody can represent the people in the House of \nRepresentatives without the approval of the voters. The same should be \ntrue for the Senate.\n  In the several days since I announced my intention to introduce this \namendment, I have heard a number of arguments raised against it. I \nwould like to briefly address them. First of all, some suggest this \namendment is an overreaction to the headlines of the day. But there are \nseveral precedents for amending the provisions of the Constitution that \nrelate to the structure of government based on specific events. The \n22nd Amendment, limiting the presidency to two terms, passed in 1951 in \nresponse to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four-term presidency. The \n25th Amendment, revising presidential succession, was passed in 1967 in \nresponse to confusion that occurred after the assassination of \nPresident Kennedy. If events demonstrate that there is a problem with \nour government structure, sooner or later we must take steps to address \nthose problems. There is no better time to do that than when the \neffects of the structural flaw are most evident and most prominently \npart of the public debate.\n  Another objection I have heard to this proposal is the potential \nfinancial burden on the states that must pay for special elections. As \nsomeone with a reputation for fiscal discipline, I always consider a \nproposal's impact on the taxpayer. But the cost to our democracy of \ncontinuing the anachronism of gubernatorial Senate appointments is far \ngreater than the cost of infrequent special elections. And weighing the \ncosts associated with the most basic tenet of our democracy--the \nelection of the government by the governed--sets us on a dangerous \npath. Besides, the Constitution already requires special elections when \na House seat becomes vacant, a far more frequent occurrence since there \nare so many more Representatives than Senators. I find the cost \nargument wholly unconvincing.\n  Another argument I have heard is that special elections garner very \nlow turnouts, or favor wealthy or well known candidates. They are not \nparticularly democratic, the argument goes. And that may very well be \ntrue. But they are a whole lot more democratic than the election held \ninside the mind of one decisionmaker--the governor. Special elections \nmay not be ideal, but they are elections, and every voter has the \nopportunity to participate. As Winston Churchill said, ``It has been \nsaid that democracy is the worst form of government except all the \nothers that have been tried.''\n  I have also heard the argument that the candidates for the special \nelection will be selected by party bosses because there won't be time \nfor a primary. That is simply not true. Under this amendment, each \nstate can decide how to set up its special elections. My home State of \nWisconsin provides for a special election within about 10 weeks of the \nvacancy, with a primary one month earlier. It's a compressed schedule \nto be sure, because the state doesn't want to be without representation \nfor too long. But it can be done. I would hope that most states would \nwant to hold primaries, but the point of this amendment is to make \nclear that only Senators who have been elected by the people can serve, \nnot to micromanage how the states want to implement that requirement.\n  I believe the core issue here is whether we are going to have a \ngovernment that is as representative of and responsive to the people as \npossible. The time to require special elections to fill Senate \nvacancies has come. Congress should act quickly on this proposal, and \nsend it to the states for ratification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/29/senate-section/article/S1069-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 82.
