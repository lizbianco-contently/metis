The Supreme Court stood that rule on its head and \ndenied stare decisis, which certainly surprised nearly everyone. They \nbecame involved, it appears, in the political process by a 5-to-4 \nmajority, now allowing corporations, including corporations that have \nforeign interests, to become involved in our process. They really have \nopened the door. We have these nameless, faceless individuals spending \nhuge amounts of money--corporate money and other money--where there is \ncertainly no transparency whatsoever. These ads are being run on \ntelevision and radio around the country. No one knows where the money \ncomes from, how much it is. In fact, I repeat, there is no \ntransparency. That is what the debate is about today. We have had a \nvote on this once before. I have the right to call it up again, and I \nwill do so at the appropriate time, but it is important that the \nAmerican people know how\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\noutrageous the Supreme Court's decision was.\n  Would the Chair now announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7304-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when I reflect on the current state of \nfrustration most Americans feel about our political system, I know \nthere are many reasons, not the least of which is the state of our \neconomy. When people are uncertain about their economic future, they \nare certainly unhappy with political leaders because that is whom they \nlook to first and foremost for some assurance that our economy is \nmoving forward and creating opportunity for them in the future. Where \nthere is uncertainty, it is understandable that it translates into \nfrustration with politicians and our political process.\n  But I would tell you that as I reflect on the many years I have been \ninvolved in public life, there is one aspect of this which really needs \nto be addressed, honestly and openly discussed, and that is how we \nfinance our political campaigns in America. I think this is at the \nheart of the current weakness of our political system and a real \nchallenge to its future.\n  I can tell you that most every individual who sits down to make the \ndecision about entering public life has that sobering moment when they \nreflect on the fact that this isn't just a matter of how hard you work \nor how good you are or what your ideas might be. It has a lot to do \nwith how much money you can raise. And if you can't raise enough money \nto deliver your message through radio or TV or social networking and \nall the different varieties of reaching the voters, even the very best \ncandidates don't stand a chance.\n  I came to the Senate succeeding my mentor and great friend Paul \nSimon, who was a Senator from Illinois. Paul Simon would have run \nsuccessfully if he had tried for another term in the Senate, but Paul \nannounced that he just didn't want to go through that arduous battle of \nraising money--literally sitting on the telephone hour after weary hour \ntrying to get through to people to beg for money. That is the plight of \nmost people who decide to be political candidates. So those who do \nengage in that process and accept that challenge know it is going to \nconsume at least half of their waking moments as a candidate--raising \nmoney so that you will be on television in the important close of the \ncampaign. You know as well that you are going to be calling a number of \npeople, some of whom are very gracious and giving without any demand \nfor return and some who just want to call you back at a later time when \nsomething important to them comes up. That item of importance may be at \nthe highest level of principle, but it may not be as well. It may be \nsomething very personal to them about their business or their family \nthat brings them to ask a favor. That is the nature of the political \nprocess.\n  Now insert into that process the new decision by the Supreme Court, \nwhich has decided that not only individuals have the power under our \nConstitution and Bill of Rights to express themselves through the \nexpenditure of money but that now corporations do as well. This \nCitizens United decision by the Supreme Court--a Court which many had \npraised as being a conservative Court bound by precedent--broke \nprecedent, established new standards, and basically allows corporations \nand special interests across America to spend unlimited amounts of \nmoney in political campaigns. Now the hardest working candidate of \neither political party, working night and day to raise money, can be \noverwhelmed and eclipsed overnight by a special interest group or \ncorporation that decides to spend millions of dollars to tell their \nside of the story. And trust me, these corporations won't get up and \nsay: We had a narrow amendment in our self-interest to try to maximize \nour profits, and the incumbent Senator voted against it. That isn't how \nthey will tell the story. They will tell the story about how this \npolitician had basically turned his back on the people who elected him \nor takes a position they do not appreciate. How does the average \nperson--the average candidate--overcome that kind of attack? The \nCitizens United decision by this Supreme Court has turned our political \nsystem upside down.\n  Here is a quote that accurately describes what we are trying to \nachieve with the DISCLOSE Act, which we are going to call up for a \nvote. The DISCLOSE Act addresses the Citizens United decision by the \nSupreme Court. We are going to be voting on this for the second time. \nThe first time we voted on it, not a single Republican would join us in \nan effort for disclosure--disclosure by these special interest groups \nand corporate groups that are buying these political ads. Let me quote \nfrom a Member of the Senate. This Member of the Senate said:\n\n       What we ought to have is disclosure. I think groups should \n     have the right to run those ads, but they ought to be \n     disclosed and they ought to be accurate.\n\n  Who said that? The Senator from Kentucky, who has just come to the \nfloor. The minority leader said that in the context of the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance bill in 2002.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, is not the \nonly Republican who would seem to support the principle behind the \nDISCLOSE Act. The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, the ranking \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said earlier this year:\n\n       I don't like it when a large source of money is out there \n     funding ads and is not accountable. To the extent we can, I \n     tend to favor disclosure.\n\n  The Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, chairman of the Senate's \nRepublican campaign committee, apparently agrees with that sentiment. \nHere is what he said earlier this year:\n\n       I think the system needs more transparency so people can \n     more easily reach their own conclusions.\n\n  I agree. I agree with these statements by Senator McConnell, Senator \nSessions, and Senator Cornyn, and I think the statements they have made \ngive them good reason to vote for the DISCLOSE Act, which they \ninitially opposed and I hope, in reconsideration, might favor.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would bring greater transparency to the source of \ncampaign ads flooding the airwaves before an election so that voters \ncan make good decisions for themselves as to whether the ads are \ntruthful.\n  As a voter, I would want to know who paid for the political ad, and I \ndo not want foreign companies trying to buy our elections. Shouldn't we \nknow if some foreign corporation is buying ads to defeat an American \npolitician? Shouldn't we have that disclosure? That is what the \nDISCLOSE Act says, and those who oppose it oppose that kind of \ndisclosure.\n  As a taxpayer, I don't want big companies with more than $10 million \nin Federal contracts to be able to buy ads to curry favor with those \nCongressmen and Senators who happen to want to help them without \ndisclosing who they are. Is it too much to ask that someone who has a \nvested interest in government contracts and buys ads to influence the \noutcome of an election to elect a Senator or Congressman who will vote \ntheir way at a minimum disclose who they are?\n  As a shareholder of a company, I want to know what political \nactivities the management of that company is spending my company's \nmoney on. If the board of directors or one member\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\nor the CEO decides to spend several million dollars defeating a \ncandidate, should the people who own the company, the shareholders, at \nleast know that and be in on the decision?\n  The DISCLOSE Act would help with all these goals. It would make CEOs \nand other leaders take personal responsibility for their ads. It would \nrequire companies and groups to disclose to the FEC within 24 hours of \nconducting any campaign-related activity or transferring money to other \ncampaign groups. It would prevent foreign companies from contributing \nto the outcome of our election. It would mandate that corporations, \nunions, and other groups disclose their campaign activities to \nshareholders and members in their annual and periodic reports. It would \nbar large government contractors from receiving taxpayer funds and then \nusing that money to buy campaign ads. It would restrict companies from \nsponsoring a candidate. It is all common sense.\n  Let me be clear. I personally think we should go further to change \nthe way we finance campaigns. I am the author and lead sponsor of the \nFair Elections Now Act, which would allow viable candidates who qualify \nfor the fair elections program to raise a maximum of $100 from any \ndonor. These candidates would receive matching funds and grants in \norder to compete with those high-rolling candidates who have personal \nwealth. That would change the system fundamentally, to move toward a \nsystem of public financing. Those who criticize it should take heart \nfrom the States that have brought it to a referendum, which have said \nrepeatedly that they would much rather have public financing and take \nthe special interests out of politics even if it meant imposing a tax--\nas we do, for example, with corporations doing business with the \nFederal Government--a tiny tax, which would generate enough money for \nthe campaigns across the Congress and get us out of this money chase we \nare currently in. It would change the system of politics fundamentally. \nIt would put the average citizen back in the picture, and I think it \nwould begin to restore confidence.\n  Until we change the way we finance campaigns, I do not believe we can \nrestore confidence in our political system to a level that it should \nbe. But in the wake of the Citizens United decision, we are moving in \nthe opposite direction. Allowing companies to spend freely and directly \non political campaigns--we should at least have the transparency that \nis being asked in the DISCLOSE bill. Is it asking too much to require a \ngroup or company to at least mention who is sponsoring an ad so the \nAmerican people know who is paying for it? I don't think it is. Once \nupon a time, many Republicans agreed with me.\n  I will close with one more quote from the Senator from Kentucky, the \nminority leader, from an interview years ago on ``Meet the Press.'' \nHere is what he said: ``Republicans are in favor of disclosure.'' We \nhope they will be in favor of the DISCLOSE Act, which calls for \ndisclosure. You can't state a position much more clearly than the \nSenator did. I hope they still feel that way. I hope Senate Republicans \nwill join us in a meaningful disclosure method for campaign finance \nreform that will move us in the direction of giving the voters more \ninformation so they can decide which candidates they want to support \nand know who is supporting different causes and candidates.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, here we go again, back to the DISCLOSE \nAct. Americans are speaking out. They want us to focus on the economy, \non preventing tax hikes, on creating jobs. What do Democrats do? They \nturn to the so-called DISCLOSE Act, a bill they say is about \ntransparency in elections but which was drafted behind closed doors, \nwithout hearings, without testimony, and without any markups; a bill \nwhich is supposed to be about free speech but which picks and chooses \nwho gets the right to engage in political speech and who does not; a \nbill that is back on the floor for no other reason than the fact that \nour friends on the other side have decided this week is politics-only \nweek in the Senate. Let's be clear from the outset. That is all this \nis--pure politics.\n  Over the past couple of elections, our friends on the other side have \ngotten a lot of help from their union allies and other outside groups--\nso much so, in fact, that they were able to outspend their opponents 2 \nto 1 in 2006 and 3 to 1 in 2008. That is our friends on the other side \nof the aisle. But now, after spending the last year and a half enacting \npolicies Americans don't like, they want to prevent their opponents \nfrom being able to criticize what they have done. They hear Americans \nspeaking out, they see some energy on the other side, and they don't \nwant to take the kind of criticism they have leveled at Republicans for \nthe past 4 years, so they are trying to rig the system to their \nadvantage. That is it. It is quite simple--just to rig the system to \ntheir advantage.\n  The only question here is why our friends on the other side would \nwant to propose something like this when Americans are screaming at \nthem to focus on the economy instead. Just look at the surveys. What \nare Americans most concerned about? It is no secret that Americans want \nCongress to focus on jobs and the economy. Yet, over the last 2 months, \nin the midst of what Democrats are remarkably calling ``recovery \nsummer,'' the President has devoted two of his weekly radio addresses \nto the Nation to making a personal pitch for this bill.\n  Today in the Senate, in the middle of the worst recession in memory, \nthe Democratic leadership has decided to spend the next 2 days on the \nsame failed partisan campaign spending bill aimed at giving Democrats a \npolitical edge. It is truly astonishing. It seems as if the more \nAmericans say they want Democrats to focus on jobs, the more determined \nthey are to press ahead with some piece of legislation aimed either at \nkilling private sector jobs or, in the case of this bill, preserving \ntheir own jobs.\n  Here we are, in the middle of a recession, with 27 States yesterday \nreporting increases in unemployment, 14 million Americans looking for \nwork, and a national debt that is putting the very future of the \nAmerican dream in jeopardy, here we are voting on a bill that amounts \nto little more than an incumbency protection act for Democrats in \nCongress. If Americans are looking for one final piece of evidence in \nthis Congress that Democrats have lost perspective and lost touch with \nAmericans, then this is it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise for a moment to pause and pay \ntribute to the life and accomplishments of a citizen of my home \ncommunity, Judge Conley Ingram. In fact, in a few days a number of \nmembers of our community, his friends and associates over his career in \nlaw and community service, will join to celebrate his life and \nachievements and his birthday. He is a remarkable person whom I admire \ngreatly because he has been a mentor to me and the example I have tried \nto follow. Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend that particular \nprogram, but today on the floor of the Senate, I wanted to memorialize \na true storied jurist of the State of Georgia, probably amongst the top \nthree or four from our State in the history of our State. He is a man \nwho stands shoulder to shoulder with men such as Griffin Bell, the \nformer Attorney General of the United States, and former Assistant \nAttorney General Larry Thompson.\n  Conley Ingram has done about everything you can do as an attorney and \na lawyer. When he graduated from Emory University 59 years ago and went \ninto the service, he taught at the Judge Advocate School in \nCharlottesville, VA. From there, he went on to be city attorney, \nspecial assistant attorney general, juvenile court judge of the County \nof Cobb, and went on to become\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\nsuperior court judge in the County of Cobb. He then founded his own law \nfirm and ran it for a number of years until he became a justice of the \nSupreme Court of the State of Georgia. After leaving there, he went \nwith the storied firm of Alston & Bird and became probably the Nation's \nmost recognized arbitrator and mediator of any attorney in the country. \nAnd not to finish and not to quit, for the last 12 years he has been a \nsenior special superior court judge in Cobb County, GA, serving all the \ntime the citizens of our State.\n  But his greatest service is the example he shows. He has been \nselected our Community Citizen of the Year. He received excellence \nawards for the legacy he has left not just for his work on the bench, \nnot just his work as a lawyer, but his work for the betterment of the \ncommunity, whether it is the Boys Club or the Girls Club, whether it is \nhis church, or whether it is his neighborhood.\n  But for me, there is one special thing to say about Judge Conley \nIngram: He is a man who takes time for everybody. He is a man who is \nwilling to help. He is a man who would rather find common ground in the \ninterest of both parties than have a winner-take-all philosophy of \nlife.\n  Probably the greatest blessing of Conley Ingram's life is his wife \nSylvia, whom my wife Dianne and I cherish as a dear friend.\n  So this week in which our community will celebrate the many \naccomplishments of the 59 years of the practice of law of Judge Conley \nIngram and his life in general, I am proud to stand on the floor of the \nSenate and say: Conley, thank you, not just for what you have done for \nme but what you have done for so many people in our great State and for \nthis great country, the United States of America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7306-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7306-S7309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue of \ncritical importance to the future of our democracy. I have in my hand \nthe majority opinion titled ``Citizens United.''\n  This Supreme Court decision, decided on the narrowest of grounds, is \nof profound importance to our Nation and how the voices of citizens get \nheard or get drowned out. This decision, Citizens United, is a dagger \npoised at the heart of American democracy.\n  Our Nation is unique in world history in that it was founded not on \nnationality of royal bloodlines but on a simple idea, a simple yet \nrevolutionary idea that the country's people are in charge.\n  As was so often the case, Abraham Lincoln said it better than most. \nHe said, the United States is a ``government of the people, by the \npeople, for the people.'' What that means is that we elected officials \nwork for the people. They elect us. They are in charge.\n  But this formula, government by and for the people, cannot survive if \nour elections are not open, free, and fair, and Citizens United ends \nopen, free, and fair elections in America. This decision says that \nunlimited secret and foreign funds can be spent on elections in the \nUnited States of America. Let me restate that. This decision, Citizens \nUnited, says unlimited secret funds can be spent on elections in the \nUnited States of America.\n  This is not just some hypothetical. Reports estimate that over the \nlast few weeks, $24 million has been spent in secret spending, with no \nability to trace who put it into campaigns. The results are negative \nattack ads barraging candidates in State after State after State, \nunder, I am sure, pleasant-sounding names such as Citizens for a Strong \nAmerica or Citizens for Blue Skies or Citizens for a Better Nation, \nfront groups that are using this secret money, allowed by this \ndecision, to drown out the voice of the American citizen in elections \nacross this land.\n  Government is not by and for the people if corporations and even \nforeign corporations and giant government contractors are able to \nhijack our electoral process to run millions of dollars of attack ads \nagainst any candidate or legislator who dares put the public interest \nahead of the company's bottom line.\n  Our Constitution, through the first amendment, puts the highest \nprotection on political speech, recognizing how important it is that \ncitizens be able to debate the merits of candidates and ideas. But the \nessence of the first amendment is that competing voices should be heard \nin the marketplace of ideas. The Citizens United decision gave the \nlargest corporations a stadium sound system to drown out the voices of \nour citizens.\n  Let me give you some sense of this. Take a single corporation in \n2008, Exxon Corporation. Exxon Corporation made a lot of money in 2008. \nIf it had spent just 3 percent of the total net revenue it had that \nyear, that would exceed all the spending by Presidential candidates for \nthe 2008 election. Three percent of a single corporation's net revenues \nwould drown out all the dollars spent by citizens in the Presidential \nrace in the 2008 election. That is the stadium sound system I am \ntalking about.\n  Think about the scale. My Senate race was far and away the most \nexpensive election in Oregon history. Two candidates together spent \nabout $20 million. To translate that back to a single corporation, \nExxon, that would be the amount of money in net profits they made every \n10 hours. You get some sense, then, of the challenge.\n  If you like negative ads, you will love the impact of Citizens \nUnited. Imagine what corporations will do to put favored candidates in \noffice. The sheer volume of money could allow corporations to handpick \ntheir candidates, providing unlimited support to their campaigns, and \ntake out anyone who dares to stand for the public interest.\n  The DISCLOSE Act we are debating is not a perfect solution to this \nattack on American democracy. But it does change one critical feature; \nthat is, secret spending becomes publicly disclosed spending.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have spoken time and time \nagain about the importance of public disclosure and democracy. One of \nmy colleagues from Texas said:\n\n       I think the system needs more transparency so people can \n     reach their own conclusions. In other words, people should \n     know who is funding that campaign ad.\n\n  One of my colleagues from Tennessee:\n\n       To me, campaign finance reform means individual \n     contributions, free speech, and full disclosure. In other \n     words, any individual can give whatever they want as long as \n     it is disclosed every day on the Internet. Otherwise you \n     restrict free speech and favor super rich candidates, \n     candidates with famous names, the media and special interest \n     groups, all of whom can spend unlimited money.\n\n  That is a strong statement by my friend and colleague from Tennessee \nin support of disclosure. The Republican floor leader, speaking in \n1997:\n\n       Public dealerships of campaign contributions and spending \n     and spending should be expedited so voters can judge for \n     themselves what is inappropriate.\n\n  How can a voter judge the content of the ad if they do not know what \nmoney is behind it? So disclosure is something that has been a \nbipartisan concept. Folks have referred to it as sunshine is the best \ndisinfectant. So this bill brings transparency. The DISCLOSE Act makes \nthe CEO of a company stand by its words. The CEO would have to say, at \nthe end of the ad, that they approved this message, just like political \ncandidates have to do right now.\n  It is common sense. If a company is willing to spend millions working \nagainst a candidate, voters, our citizens, have a right to know who is \ninvolved instead of allowing them to hide behind shadowy front groups. \nSimilarly, this bill would require 527 groups, which exist solely to \ninfluence elections, to be transparent about who is funding them. \nVoters have a right to know where ads and campaign dollars come from.\n  A second issue this act takes on is the pay-to-play issue; that is, \nthe concept that groups that are competing for government contracts and \nwinning those contracts have a particular conflict of interest when it \ncomes to spending large volumes on campaigns. So this gets rid of that \nconflict of interest. It says it bars government contractors from \nrunning campaign ads or\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\npaying for other campaign activities on behalf of a Federal candidate.\n  We understand this conflict of interest. We have the Hatch Act. We \nunderstand Federal employees have a conflict of interest. We also \nunderstand government contractors have a conflict of interest. This \nbill also takes on the issue of foreign-owned corporations. It says \nthat if a company is 20 percent foreign owned, it is not eligible to \nallow these massive expenditures on behalf of particular political \ncandidates or causes.\n  Do we want to leave the door open to foreign corporations spending \nunlimited sums here in America to change the course of our Nation? I do \nnot think so. I do not think any red-blooded American wants foreign \ncorporations dictating the future of the United States of America. That \nis what this act is about.\n  Essentially, what the Citizens United decision did, it created a \n``supercitizen'' who can operate in secret with unlimited funds to \ninfluence American elections. A few years ago, I was with my son on the \nfirst floor of the Lincoln Memorial, down under the stairs. I saw a \nquote that had been posted on the wall. It said something to the effect \nof: The greatest threat to the success of our Republic is that the \ncitizens have an equal voice.\n  I said that is an interesting quote coming from a President in \nwartime, in a civil war, dealing with slavery. So I asked the ranger: \nSay, do you know the background of that quote? Because I was surprised \nPresident Lincoln did not say the biggest threat was the war or slavery \nor reuniting the sides or preserving the Constitution. But he said: the \ncitizens' voice, preserving the citizens' voice.\n  The ranger lit up and said: Yes, actually, I do know the background \nto that. He said: During the civil war, President Lincoln was very \nconcerned that the military contracts that were being let by the \ngovernment were resulting in numerous representatives of companies \ncoming to DC and lobbying intensely to get those contracts. He was \nconcerned that voice would drown out the voice of the people.\n  It is no wonder. It fits right with a President who understood the \nheart of the genius of American democracy, that we are talking about \ngovernment by and for the people.\n  Well, Lincoln's concern about that conflict of interest is one that \nshould be magnified many times today in the context of Citizens United. \nCitizens United, that allows unlimited secret donations and foreign \ndonations to influence the course of American elections.\n  President Lincoln reminds us the essence of our Nation, the cause \nthat brought a generation of patriots to challenge the greatest \nmilitary power of the 18th century, the idea that has inspired people \nto leave everything to come to our shores is a government of people, by \nthe people, for the people.\n  So let's say no to secret spending. Let's say no to foreign \ncorporations. Let's say no to the conflict of interest of government \ncontractors using their profits from their contracts to weigh in and \ntry to influence and getting favoritism with candidates. Let's say yes \nto government by and for the people.\n  We need some profiles in courage today to preserve the heart of our \ndemocracy, government by and for the people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor.) The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor in an effort to try \nto get my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in \npreserving our democracy. I heard the Republican leader's remarks that \nwe should be focused on jobs, and we have been, notwithstanding the \nconstant obstruction of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nby using the filibuster countless times in terms of us being able to \nmove forward on jobs.\n  But this legislation is about jobs. Some people might ask: Well, what \ndoes the disclosure of campaign finance have to do with jobs? It has \neverything to do with it because the murky special interests that are \nout there spending unlimited amounts of corporate money are not \nspending it because they just want to participate in our electoral \nprocess without a purpose. They are participating because they have a \npurpose.\n  The purpose is to elect those individuals who ultimately will respond \nto their agenda, which is an agenda that, in many cases, works against \nthe interests of working men and women in this country; works against \nsome of the very essence of legislation we have passed and signed into \nlaw such as equal pay for equal work; works against the very interests \nof what we are trying to accomplish on food safety so none of our \nfamilies will ever get ill because of a product that should have never \nmade it to their table in the first place; works against the interests \nof those in this country who want to work and give a hard day's work \nfor a fair day's wage and at the same time work in conditions that \nensure their safety is preserved and they can go home at the end of a \nlong day to their loved ones and come home safe and secure--those and \nso many other interests. So when we talk about jobs, knowing who is out \nthere spending money for what purpose, particularly for what corporate \npurpose, is incredibly important to how we create jobs, what do we do \nin terms of working conditions, what do we do in terms of wages, what \ndo we do in terms of equity. This is about jobs. It is also about our \ndemocracy.\n\n  Since the Supreme Court made its decision allowing corporate \ninterests and labor interests to spend money unlimitedly--and, by the \nway, in doing so also allow the possibility of foreign corporations, \nmany of which are not just private foreign entities, they are foreign \nentities controlled by a government--the money is flowing. Don't \nbelieve me, even though we have seen since August 15 to last night $21 \nmillion already spent on the Republican side of the aisle in \nindependent expenditures, unknown money, no person, no face, no name. \nThat is why I guess we can't seem to get a vote. But don't listen to \nme. Listen to Michael Toner, former Republican Federal Election \nCommission Commissioner. He said:\n\n       I can tell you from personal experience, the money's \n     flowing.\n\n  For what purpose? Corporations just spending their money for \nsomething other than the pursuit of the bottom line? When have we known \na corporation to spend its money recklessly without pursuing an \ninterest in the bottom line? I haven't seen too many of those. They may \nhave made bad mistakes, but they have never purposely spent money for \nthe purposes of anything other than to improve their bottom line. So if \nthey are spending money in elections, they are spending to make sure \nthey can improve their bottom line. This undermines the very essence of \nour democracy where we want individual citizens and voters to determine \nthe outcome of the elections, not the monied interests.\n  In this process, this was a bipartisan effort originally when \nCongress said: We don't want corporate or labor money to be spent \nunlimitedly in Federal elections. We have had continuous comments since \nthen. Here is the Republican leader, Senator McConnell:\n\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what \n     is appropriate.\n\n  We have changed that view because all we are trying to do is say: OK, \nSupreme Court, you are going to allow the money to flow from the \ncorporations. Let us know who is spending it and on whom they are \nspending it and for what purpose. Then the voters can judge for \nthemselves what is appropriate.\n  We have had others as well who are in the midst of this election \nprocess, such as my counterpart Senator Cornyn, saying:\n\n       I think the system needs more transparency, so people can \n     more easily reach their own conclusions.\n\n  What do we have? Less transparency. So an individual who gives their \nmoney to a candidate, they get fully disclosed. A corporation or a \nspecial interest or a foreign interest gives money, they can hide \nbehind these shadowy groups. They have great names--Americans for this, \nAmericans for that. The problem is, we don't even know if one of those \ngroups that call themselves Americans for X, Y, or Z is actually an \nAmerican corporation. With the loophole created by virtue of allowing \nforeign corporations to now spend in our elections, it is the ultimate \nerosion of our democracy.\n  If Members don't think they will, let me cite a few examples of why \nthey\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\nmight. Imagine if BP could go ahead and influence the elections of a \nwhole host of Senators because they want to determine what our energy \nand drilling policy is by electing those who ultimately share their \nviews. After what they have done in the Gulf of Mexico, after what they \nrefused to do in testifying before a hearing that I will hold next week \nabout the release of the Pan Am 103 bomber and what role they played in \nlobbying for the release of that terrorist that killed Americans they \ncan't even send a witness to our hearing, do my colleagues think they \nwould not be interested in spending millions to determine who can be \nsupportive of what they want?\n  Do Members believe the Chinese wouldn't ultimately make investments \nin candidates who continue to espouse a philosophy that allows jobs to \nbe offshored? Talk about jobs to be offshored to countries such as \nChina where manufacturing is dirt cheap and rights are nonexistent and \nworking conditions virtually don't exist and the environment is not a \nquestion. Do Members think it is impossible for that to happen?\n  Do Members think it is impossible for Hugo Chavez not to be spending \nmoney here through Citgo and saying: Let me support those who support \nthe type of views I hold and who will engage in an energy policy that \nis much different than I can influence with Venezuelan oil?\n  Do my colleagues think there are those in the corporate sector who \nhave been fighting food safety--not all but some--who wouldn't elect \nthose individuals who will ensure that we can't have the food safety \nprocedures to come into the 21st century so that we can ultimately \nensure that our food is safe? No, they would rather have the ability to \ndo what they do and not have to worry about the consequences of safety \nto improve the bottom line.\n  I could go on and on with examples of why foreign interests spend \nwell in our elections to dictate policies that ultimately would inure \nto the detriment of the American people and to the benefit of their \ninterests. That is what we are fighting against. That is what we are \ntrying to undo in terms of the legislation we are considering, to \ndisclose. What a terrible thing, to disclose. We are not even stopping \nthe contributions because the Supreme Court said the contributions can \nbe made by corporations, but at least let's know who is giving them and \nwho they are giving it to and for what ostensible purpose.\n  I see a continuing erosion of our democracy through the present \ncircumstances. I see why we can't get a vote on the other side of the \naisle because, overwhelmingly, they are receiving the benefits of this \nundisclosed, shadowy money that no one knows where it comes from, no \none knows who is giving, for what purposes. Is that really the American \nway? Is that what the average voter wants to see in terms of their \ndemocracy? I don't think so.\n  I urge my colleagues to follow the essence of McCain-Feingold. \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold authored legislation. All of those \nwho made comments about disclosure, it is time to at least simply \ndisclose. It is time to allow the American people to know who is \nengaged in this election, who is spending millions. They are talking \nabout raising and spending nearly $300 million. There are 41 days to \nthe election. We would not know where it came from, who is giving it, \nfor what purpose. That is the ultimate corruption of our system.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to proceed. Let's have the debate and, \nmore importantly, let's cast a final vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe the eloquence of Senator \nMenendez marks a high point in the debate. I don't know that anyone \ncould have expressed what is at stake as well as he did. I will make a \nhumble attempt to build on what he said. Before he leaves the Chamber, \nin a country of, by, and for the people--our country--the people have a \nright to know who is supporting their Senators, who is opposing their \nSenators, who is supporting their Members of Congress, who is opposing \nthem. That is all we are asking. It is simple. It is the American way. \nWe do things in the light. It makes us different than other countries. \nThe DISCLOSE Act is essential. I thank my colleague for his leadership.\n  The DISCLOSE Act is a much needed response to a Supreme Court \ndecision in Citizens United which essentially allows big money to drown \nout the voices of our people. I have always thought and believed--and \nstill believe--that what makes us great is that we try to have laws \nthat level the playing field so people who are extremely wealthy don't \nhave more to say than those of modest means. How do we do that in \neveryday life? We try to have a public school system so we ensure that \nall children get an education. I personally am a product of public \nschools, kindergarten through college. Were it not for that, my family \ncouldn't afford to send me to private schools. How could I have ever \nmade it to a decent job, let alone to the Senate? In all of the things \nwe try to do to try to have a safety net for people who are unemployed, \neverything we do, it seems to me has been to ensure we have a thriving \nmiddle class, that the American dream is there for people who work hard \nfor it.\n  We don't want to get to a situation where simply because a \ncorporation has, frankly, billions of dollars they can spend on \ncampaigns, they can simply do it in secret and there is an ad run \nagainst a sitting Senator on either side of the aisle, and we don't \nhave any clue who has put that money down. As Senator Menendez says, \nthey pick great names: Americans for Justice, Americans for a Better \nTomorrow. They name great names. But who is behind it?\n  Frankly, we could have a foreign country behind that ad if they had a \nsubsidiary in America they control. That foreign country could very \nwell be playing in our elections as we speak with the millions of \ndollars we see coming into the Senate races.\n  In the Citizens United case, the majority of the Court reversed a \n100-year-old law and overruled decades of legal precedent when they \ndecided that corporations and labor unions cannot be restricted from \nspending unlimited amounts in Federal elections because they equated \nany limits with violating free speech. I ask the question in this great \ncountry of ours, where we all have the privilege of living and we all \nhave the privilege and responsibility of voting: Why is it that a \nnameless, faceless entity has more speech than any one of our citizens? \nWhy? Because these corporations are worth trillions of dollars. The \naverage person obviously has nowhere near it. The average income in our \ncountry is about $50,000 for a family now, maybe a little less. How \nwould that person compete with a $1 trillion corporation? The Court \ndoesn't seem to care about that, the majority, a slim majority, when \nthey equate spending limits with speech.\n  What they actually said is that a corporation worth trillions gets to \nhave much more speech than any one of my constituents in California or \nany one person in the whole United States of America. The decision was \nastounding.\n  It defies common sense to conclude that corporations or labor unions \nare citizens in the eyes of the law.\n  I said to my staff: Have you ever called a corporation and asked the \ncorporation to go to lunch with you? Corporations are not people. They \nare entities. How the Court could equate corporations with people is \namazing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes, and \nthen I will finish up. And add that--\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I do not object. Whatever time she needs I \nhope will be added on to the time that has previously been allotted. I \ndo not want to cut short the comments of my friend from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is extremely kind of my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to take 5 minutes and to add \nthat on to Senator Bond's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So the decision was astounding to equate people with \ncorporations and unions, on its face. As Justice Stevens wrote in his \ndissent:\n\n       Corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, \n     no thoughts, no desires . . . they are not themselves members \n     of ``We the People'' by whom and for whom our Constitution \n     was established.\n\n  We all know corporations are important in our lives and they make \nenormous contributions to society, but\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\nthey are not people, and their profit motive keeps them going. That is \nour system, and that is fine. But all we are saying in this debate over \nthe DISCLOSE Act is, if a corporation or a union is going to take out \nan ad against a Senator or for a Senator, or against a challenger or \nfor a challenger, that they simply stand up and say--that is, the CEO \nof the corporation: I am Mr. Smith, and I approved this message.\n  When I make a commercial or any of my colleagues or any of our \nchallengers, they need to do that. You will see that on every \ncommercial: I am so and so, and I approved this message.\n  So all we are saying is, level the playing field--at least that. We \nneed to do a lot more to fix this Supreme Court decision, but at \nminimum let's have disclosure. The Fortune 100 companies had combined \nrevenues of $13.1 trillion during the 2007-2008 election cycle. They \nhad those revenues. If they devoted just 1 percent of that--1 percent \nof that--it would double the federally reported disbursements of all \nAmerican political parties and PACs combined. I think we cannot allow \nour electoral process to be dominated by the special interests.\n  So all we are saying in the DISCLOSE Act is, stand up and be counted. \nLet us know who you are. We have to know who you are. Do not hide \nbehind some shadowy name of a group. Again, these names are all very \nnice: Americans for this and Americans for that. Let us know who you \nare. That is all we are saying.\n  This is a government of, by, and for the people. The people have a \nright to know who is contributing to us, to our opponents, and it is \nvery simple.\n  There could be foreign influence here, again I would say. In our \nbill, we basically say no foreign influence. If you are a domestic \ncorporation who is controlled by a foreign country or a foreign \ncorporation--say if China, say in Venezuela, say anywhere; pick your \ncountry--you cannot take an ad. This is America. We ought to know who \nis contributing these huge, enormous sums. We ought to know who they \nare. Our voters ought to know who they are. The American people deserve \nnothing less.\n  So I would hope when we take up this vote again, there will be no \nmore filibusters over this issue. I have never seen so many \nfilibusters. I have been here a while. Let's go to this legislation. \nLet's hear the other side defend why they think foreign countries or \nforeign corporations should be able to play in our elections. Let them \ndefend it if they want to. That is fine. That is fair. I am sure they \nwill come up with reasons.\n  But yesterday we could not go to the military bill. It has a pay \nraise for our soldiers. That is put on hold because people did not want \nto vote on the DREAM Act. They did not want to debate don't ask, don't \ntell. I do not understand it. Now we have a situation where they are \nfilibustering us being able to go to this very commonsense bill, the \nDISCLOSE Act, which many of my colleagues on the other side have \nsupported in the past--simple disclosure, transparency. I could read \nyou chapter and verse of my colleagues on the other side who were \nfilibustering the DISCLOSE Act in the past saying: We want \ntransparency.\n  So I think this is a pretty open and shut case. The American people \nhave a right to know who is influencing their elections. Just have \nthese corporate executives, these union executives stand up and say: I \nam so and so, and I support this message, and I paid for it.\n  With that, I am happy to yield the floor with great thanks to my \ncolleague for allowing me the opportunity to complete my remarks.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning, all across America families \nare struggling to make ends meet. Their incomes are stagnant, but the \ncost of living keeps rising and the tax burden they face at the \nFederal, State, and local level keeps getting worse--and they are \nthreatening to go higher.\n  Just as troubling, today's ongoing economic uncertainty is crippling \njob creation and hurting small businesses--the real engines of growth \nin our country. Some of our small businesses have told me it is not \nuncertainty, it is the certainty that they know what the Federal \nGovernment has already done in the health care bill this body, \nunfortunately, passed.\n  But what is the answer from Washington to this situation? More job-\nkilling taxes.\n  Let me be very clear: The last thing we should be doing in this \ndifficult economy is raising taxes on American families and small \nbusinesses. It is a recipe for disaster. I do not think anyone believes \nraising taxes on somebody in a recession is a good idea, particularly \non the very small businesses we need to hire more workers and get the \neconomy back on track. But unless Congress acts before the end of this \nyear, that is exactly what will happen.\n  This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, which is why 31 House \nDemocrats have recently written the Speaker of the House urging her to \nact now to stop the tax increases on the American people. As these 31 \nDemocrats said, defying their leadership, raising taxes now could \n``negatively impact economic growth.'' Obviously, that would affect \njobs.\n  Instead of listening to the American people, and even those members \nof his own party, President Obama is trying to convince our Nation that \nthe largest tax increase in history will not hurt them.\n  Whether it is justifying their failed trillion-dollar stimulus bill \nor government takeover of health care, which will cost even more, and \nnow their historic tax increases, the administration is guilty of using \nsome very fuzzy math.\n  Last week, the President took to the airwaves and claimed he \n``opposes tax cuts for millionaires''--a statement he repeated in Ohio \nas well. But the President's plan to increase taxes is on any \nindividual earning $200,000 or more or any couple earning $250,000 or \nmore. I do not know who the President is talking to, but I do not know \nany Missouri families with two working people making $250,000 a year \nwho consider themselves millionaires. In fact, these Missouri families \nwould be surprised that the President lumps them in the same category \nas George Soros, Warren Buffett, and Bill Gates.\n  In fact, the tax on these ``rich'' people, as the President calls \nthem, is a tax increase on small businesses. Under the President's tax \nincrease plan, half of all small business income would be affected, and \nthe President's tax increase plan would affect up to 25 percent of all \nAmerican workers. They are employed by those small businesses, and they \ncertainly will be affected.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal's September 9 article entitled \n``The Small Business Tax Hike and the 3 percent Fallacy,'' IRS data \nshows that 48 percent of the net income of sole proprietorships, \npartnerships, and S corporations reported on tax returns went to \nhouseholds with incomes over $200,000 a year in 2007.\n\n  It is very clear we are talking about small businesses that have a \nmuch broader impact than just 3 percent of all taxpayers, as the spin \nwe hear from the White House puts it.\n  This plan to increase taxes defies common sense. At a time when we \nneed small businesses to expand and to create jobs, President Obama \nplans on raising their taxes. Imagine that. When jobs should be our top \npriority, with unemployment near 10 percent, this Congress and the \nPresident are proposing a historic job-killing tax increase.\n  Bear in mind, according to the Small Business Administration, small \nbusinesses employ half of all private sector employees. They generated \n65 percent or 9.8 million of the 15 million net new jobs produced over \nthe past 17 years. They produce 13 times more patents per employee than \nlarge patenting firms.\n  The President has actually been very clear about his intensions for \nadditional revenue raised by tax increases. As a matter of fact, on \nSeptember 8, in Parma, OH, the President repeatedly said:\n\n       I've got a whole bunch of better ways to spend the money.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I strongly disagree. As Milton Friedman once \nfamously said:\n\n       Nobody spends somebody else's money as wisely as they spend \n     their own.\n\n  I think we have all seen proof of this over the past 21 months, and \nit is not\n\n[[Page S7310]]\n\nworking. The nearly trillion-dollar stimulus plan that was supposed to \ncreate jobs immediately and keep unemployment below 8 percent failed, \nand now our children and our children's children are stuck with the \nbill that will be on their credit cards for a long time. But now the \nadministration is pushing for even more tax increases in order to \nfinance their massive spending spree.\n  Each time I return home, I am reminded of the anger and the distrust \nthat my constituents have for Washington. The people of my State are \nangry. They are on fire. They have every right to be. The people in \nMissouri know that additional tax revenue generated from their hard \nwork will not be used to pay down our national debt but, instead, it \nwill be used for more spending they do not want and the country cannot \nafford. The people in Missouri know they cannot afford these tax \nincreases. They want to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks so \nthey can support their families.\n  On dividends and capital gains, the administration believes that \ntaxes should go up. They also believe these two types of taxes on \ninvestment should be treated differently, with dividends being taxed as \nhigh as nearly 40 percent.\n  Higher taxes on investment income will halt new investment and force \nthese investors with much needed capital on to the sidelines. If you \ntax something, you get less of it. If you reduce taxes, you get more of \nit.\n  But since Congress passed the 2,000-plus page regulatory overreach \nbill this year, we have seen a drop in capital formation, and tax \nincreases will only continue to discourage private productive capital \nformation in the nongovernmental private sector.\n  The looming tax increases will raise the price of capital and make \nlending much more expensive than it would be if we had properly reined \nin the bad actors and allowed the lending system to revert to practices \nbased on creditworthiness, which means it will be even harder for our \nsmall businesses to get the lending, borrow what they need to continue \nto meet their payrolls, continue to employ workers, and keep their \nlights on.\n  Dividends are payments made to shareholders by a profitable firm. \nThey are the owners of the firm. Many of the folks who receive dividend \nincome are not multimillion-dollar investors but, rather, many of them \nare seniors who rely on this as a supplement to their retirement \nincome. We should not raise taxes on seniors who rely on this income.\n  Recently, I heard from a utility in my State that came in and talked \nabout the increased dividend tax and the concern as to what it would do \nto their shareholders. Many of their investors are senior citizens who \nare by no means rich and who live off of this income every day. They do \nnot want to have, and they cannot afford to have, the government reach \ninto their pockets and take more money.\n  On the estate tax, death should not be a taxable event. There should \nnot be taxation without respiration.\n\n  The death tax hurts small, family-owned businesses, especially our \nfamily farmers. According to the Farm Bureau, individuals, family \npartnerships, or family corporations own 98 percent of our Nation's 2 \nmillion farms and ranches.\n  When faced with the death tax, farmers and ranchers are in an \nespecially tough spot with most of their assets tied up in land and \nbuildings, livestock and equipment. This gives them little flexibility \nwhen settling an estate. Unlike an investor with a stock portfolio, \nthey can't simply sell off the stock and move on.\n  The death tax punishes the American dream, making it virtually \nimpossible for the American family to build wealth across generations, \nand this is particularly true for family farms.\n  The death tax is antisavings, antifamily, and anti-investment. Quite \nsimply, it is un-American, and it should be eliminated, or at least it \nshould be reduced.\n  Sadly, because of the Senate's failure to repeal this tax, I have \nsigned on to the next best alternative--a bipartisan bill introduced by \nSenators Lincoln and Kyl which would increase the exemption for \nfamilies to $5 million from the $3.5 million under the previous law.\n  Under the President's plan, when you die, your estate will be taxed \nat a whopping 55 percent for assets above $1 million. The Kyl-Lincoln \nbill I am cosponsoring would reduce this rate to 35 percent for assets \nabove the $5 million exception.\n  Why is this important? Let me talk about farm country, where I live. \nEverybody knows that a successfully operated family-owned grain or corn \nor soybean farm is likely to have $1 million worth of land and likely \nmore than $1 million worth of farm equipment so they can be a \nproductive farmer in the world competitive economy. The President's \nplan would force these family farms to close rather than pass to the \nnext generation of family farmers.\n  I say to my colleagues, unless Congress acts now, in less than 100 \ndays Americans will be hit with the largest tax hike in our Nation's \nhistory. That is why I have joined with Senators McConnell, Grassley, \nand others to stop these tax hikes, cosponsoring the Tax Hike \nPrevention Act. This bill prevents the tax hikes scheduled for next \nyear, permanently passes the alternative minimum tax, and protects \nfamilies from increased death taxes.\n  For most Americans across the Nation, recovery is what we desperately \nneed. We need it in my State and we need it in every State. Small \nbusinesses are not hiring new workers or expanding. It is not just the \nuncertainty; it is the certainty of what the Federal Government is \ndoing to them. Also, unemployment has been hovering at almost 10 \npercent. More than 3 million Americans have lost their jobs since \nFebruary of 2009, and more have quit looking or are underemployed.\n  One of the best ways to help our economy and end the uncertainty that \nis crippling job creation is to stop the coming tax hikes. In addition \nto helping small businesses, stopping the coming tax hikes would let \nAmericans keep more of their paychecks that they can save and invest. \nOur citizens know how to spend their money better than any government \nbureaucrat.\n  We have tried it with the government money. We have tried it with the \ngovernment stimulus. The government stimulus stimulated the expansion \nof government. That is not productive. Let's try it the other way. \nLet's go back to what we used to do in this country and let the private \nsector work and develop useful products and services, sell those \nproducts, gain a profit, and hire more workers. It is time this \nCongress acts, and I hope they will act soon.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7310-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7310-S7311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX POLICY\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about something \nthat is enormously important, and that is tax policy and the economy.\n  Over the most recent break, I had the opportunity to go out across \nthe State of Nebraska. I traveled throughout the State and I conducted \n14 townhall meetings. I listened to a lot of concerns, but there was \none issue that dominated all of the discussion and that was the state \nof our Nation's economy. Nebraskans, like all Americans, are wondering \nwhen the economy will turn around. They are wondering when this \nadministration is going to actually take action to support job creators \ninstead of just talking about it.\n  A recent CNN poll shows that 57 percent of Americans disapprove of \nthe President's handling of the economy. The President's job agenda to \ndate has simply failed to produce the results that were promised.\n  Take a look at the economic stimulus that cost taxpayers $862 \nbillion--$1 trillion if you add interest--and it has come up short. \nInstead of more government spending that fails to create jobs, we need \nto create a progrowth environment that fosters job creation that is so \ndesperately needed in every part of this great Nation. In order to do \nso, we must first and foremost give individuals and businesses some \ndegree of certainty about the future. Unfortunately, the health care \nbill and the financial bill are doing exactly the opposite. Businesses \nare actually fearful of the regulatory environment and the list of \npending tax hikes, causing them to wait out the anxiety and stay on the \nsidelines.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business describes it this \nway:\n\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\n\n       Uncertainty about the economy and looming tax hikes have \n     kept this sector from hiring new workers, resulting in a weak \n     economic recovery and slow to nonexistent job growth.\n\n  But the NFIB doesn't stop there. They further describe this:\n\n       Congress can take an important step to address the \n     uncertainty by holding a vote and passing legislation \n     extending all of the expiring tax rates. No small business \n     owner should face higher taxes.\n\n  At a time when Americans are struggling in their businesses to meet \nnext month's payroll, they don't need more uncertainty from Washington. \nWhat they need are assurances from their government that there will be \nno more taxes or unnecessary regulatory burdens piled on top of them at \na time when their plates are already overflowing.\n  Even White House economic adviser Larry Summers recently acknowledged \nthe importance of providing businesses with certainty about the future. \nHe said something actually quite profound:\n\n       Confidence is the cheapest form of stimulus, and we've got \n     to be very attentive to creating an economic environment in \n     which there is confidence.\n\n  I agree with him.\n  One way to help eliminate this uncertainty and bring confidence back \nto the economy is to continue the current tax rates. Failing to do so \nwill only cause further uncertainty and inadequate growth. Most \nalarmingly, letting these tax rates increase will result in the largest \ntax hike in American history. Let me repeat that: One hundred days from \ntoday, the largest tax hike in history will take effect, unless \nCongress acts.\n  Considering the state of our economy, with a lackluster growth rate \nof 1.6 percent and unemployment at 9.6 percent, with real unemployment \nin the double digits, tax increases are the last thing Americans need. \nTax increases are the last thing our job creators need.\n  It is no surprise that businesses aren't willing to take the chance \nto expand and to hire. We keep hearing the President and his \nadministration tell businesses to create jobs, to get off the \nsidelines. We keep hearing the President say that. Meanwhile, the same \nadministration has increased taxes, imposed mandates, created \nuncertainty, and now is willing to allow this massive historic tax \nincrease to hammer our job creators. It simply makes no sense. Why \nwould an administration that is supposedly committed to small \nbusinesses try to take more of their money while at the same time \nurging them to spend more money on expanding and creating jobs? Maybe \nit is because they claim that only rich Americans--rich Americans--\nwould be impacted.\n  As small business owners across the country can tell us, this is \nsimply a false notion. Many small business owners file as individuals \nand, therefore, report income above $200,000. We rely heavily on these \nsmall businesses to use that capital to create jobs to boost our \neconomy.\n  Over the past 15 years, small businesses have been responsible for \ngenerating--get this--64 percent of all of our new jobs. Under the \nadministration's proposal, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates \nthat nearly 750,000 taxpayers with small business income will be hit \nwith a tax increase 100 days from today. I don't get it. I can't fathom \nwhy we would raise taxes on job creators when we are facing record \nunemployment and a sputtering economy.\n  It is not just small businesses. It is also family farms and ranches \nthat would be caught up in the net of this massive tax increase. \nSuddenly, they would all find themselves classified as the ``rich'' \npeople this administration claims are the only ones impacted by this \nfoolhardy policy.\n  It is unfair and unwise policy I am speaking about. What our small \nbusinesses, farms, and ranches need now is a stable economic \nenvironment, not tax increases from their government. It is time for \ngovernment to stop suppressing businesses and give them a chance to \ngrow in a certain environment--to expand, create jobs, to buy new \nequipment--because that is what will fuel job growth in this Nation. \nOur small businesses are the heart of our economy. We need to give them \nthe opportunity to move our economy forward, not be stifled by \ngovernment policies.\n  The original intent of the tax cuts when instituted nearly 10 years \nago was to free up capital for these entities to grow, to hire, and to \nproduce. In fact, in 2007, once these tax breaks had taken effect, our \ntax collections achieved an all-time high in this Nation. Let me repeat \nthat. In 2007, once these tax rates took effect--they were fully in \nplace--our tax collections achieved an all-time high. The reason is \nobvious. When you have people working, they pay taxes, they add to the \neconomy, they fuel economic growth.\n  The bottom line is that tax breaks help to get our economy moving \nwhich, in turn, generates revenues. We saw it in 2007. Even Christina \nRomer, the former chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers, recently published some research on tax policy. I am quoting:\n\n       Tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output \n     effects.\n\n  In contrast, she wrote:\n\n       Tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and \n     highly significant negative impact on output.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Standing idly by while taxes skyrocket at the end of this year, in \n100 days, will--and it is very predictable--have a chilling effect on \nAmerican businesses and, therefore, hard-working families. It is time \nthat the actions of this administration and this Congress match the \npromises being made about creating an environment that fosters growth \ninstead of hindering it.\n  The American people are no longer willing to accept empty words at \nface value. They want to see policies that match promises. Fortunately, \nit is not too late. This administration and this Congress still have an \nopportunity to make good on their promises to small businesses, to \nthose working families, but it will mean taking action to prevent a \nmassive tax hike on January 1, 2011.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to show they are willing to work together \nto fulfill their promises to small businesses. Let's deliver on those \npromises to provide stability instead of uncertainty. Let's work \ntogether to prevent a huge tax hike on our job creators in 100 days.\n  The American people--hard-working families--deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7311-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7311-S7313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, just yesterday, the Columbus \nDispatch, the second largest paper in my State, reported that one \nsingle Cincinnati-based corporation gave more than $450,000 to Karl \nRove's outfit. Lest we forget, Karl Rove was the very political person \nin the Bush administration who was sort of the mastermind of dirty \ntricks and of raising tons of special interest money and the mastermind \non a lot of the sort of, shall we say, disinformation coming out of the \nWhite House in the Bush years during the lead-up to the Iraq war--that \nKarl Rove. Again, the Columbus Dispatch reported that one single \nCincinnati-based corporation gave more than $450,000 to Karl Rove's \noutfit to support advertising for one single Ohio Senate candidate.\n  That was reported from a generally conservative newspaper. The \nColumbus Dispatch is no friend of Democrats. They are a pretty \nRepublican organization, although the reporters are fairminded. So one \ncorporation sent $450,000 to one single Senate candidate. That \ncorporation can do that because of the Roberts Court decision--the \nSupreme Court decision, with its new ultraconservative Court, which is \nperhaps more conservative than any Court in the 21st or 20th centuries, \nin a case called Citizens United. It is an outright corruption of our \ndemocratic process. But with the Citizens United case, it is a reality.\n  The Supreme Court opened the floodgates, allowing multinational, \nlarge corporations to bankroll their favorite political candidates and \nbuild a Congress in their image. They don't have\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\nto be American; they can be foreign corporations. It is not like the \ndrug companies, oil companies, and insurance companies don't have \nenough power in Washington, DC. When they sneeze, too many people \naround here get a cold. When the drug companies, insurance companies, \nand the oil industry--these large corporations--want something, far too \noften they are successful in the Halls of Congress. That is the reason \nwe have seen the obstruction in the last year and a half. That is why \nit is so easy for Leader McConnell to get 41 Republicans to oppose what \nwe are trying to do in this body--because of the influence of these \ndrug companies, insurance companies, the oil industry, and others--\nthese huge companies that outsource jobs.\n  The Supreme Court is made up of almost all conservative appointees--a \nmajority of them--backed by these major moneyed corporate interests, \nand this Court has given even more power to these corporations. In some \ncases, they said they can be foreign-based corporations.\n  In Citizens United, the Supreme Court swept aside decades' worth of \nestablished jurisprudence to abruptly--and radically--change the rules \nof the game to remake, if you will, our democratic system. The Roberts \nCourt couched their activism in arguments about the first amendment.\n  I am not a constitutional lawyer; in fact, I am not a lawyer at all. \nWhen I hear: Should General Motors or should Pfizer drug company or \nshould any large corporation have the same free speech rights as \nindividual Americans, I don't think so. The Founders never thought \nabout corporations having all the same first amendment free speech \nrights as individuals, as the pages sitting here do or as Americans in \nToledo, Akron, and everywhere do by nature of the fact they are \nAmerican citizens. They have free speech rights.\n  The Roberts Court decision said we are going to give free speech \nrights to corporations in every way, which means the free speech of an \nindividual American is washed away, in political terms, because of the \nhuge influence that a small number of corporations can have because \nthey have so much money to inject into the political system.\n  Citizens United, therefore, buries the voices of everyday Americans, \nas Fortune 500 companies straddle the globe and reap billions in \nprofits, and they can take just pennies on the dollar and lavish huge \ndollars on American campaigns. If a multibillion-dollar company drops \n$1 million to help a candidate--as we are seeing with Rove's sort of \nsordid political operation--that is not very much money to that \ncompany. But that $1 million certainly can wash away and so much \ncounteract a bunch of American citizens in Mansfield, Lima, \nSpringfield, and Zanesville, OH, who are giving $20 each.\n  Average households are struggling to break even. How can you compare \ntheir ability to influence--ability to exercise their free speech--to \nthat of a multimillion-dollar Fortune 500 company?\n  Look how that plays out. In 2009, corporations spent $3.3 billion \nlobbying Congress to influence legislation, exerting far more influence \non our political process than they should.\n  We saw how special interests spent more than $1 million a day in an \nattempt to shape health care reform and Wall Street reform, and because \nof Citizens United they will be able to spend unlimited amounts of \nmoney to intimidate, retaliate against, and replace their foes in \nCongress.\n  If you speak up, as I am doing now at some risk--I am on the ballot \nin 2012. I know what this crowd is going to do because I do not always \nagree with BP's agenda or the drug companies' agenda. In fact, I \nusually do not. I also know these companies already have so much \ninfluence lobbying the Congress day after day, and now they are going \nto have greater influence in electing their allies to the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. They have turned this advantage into a \ncorporate monopoly of political speech.\n  When campaigns overwhelmingly are run on television now, with \nmillions of dollars spent--at least $10 million will be spent in Ohio \nin the Senate race, probably more than that in the Governor's race--\nwhen there is that kind of money, it too often drowns out everyday \nAmericans' free speech.\n  Most Americans today do not advocate for, nor would the Framers have \nenvisioned a democratic system in which $10 million contributions from \ncorporations drown out $20 donations that represent real people's real \nconcerns. A lot of people give me $10, $20, or $50 for my campaign. \nThey are not trying to buy influence. They do not buy influence with \nthat. They contribute to me and the Senator from Illinois and others \nbecause they agree with what I do. They like the positions I take. They \nthink I represent them reasonably well. But they are not going to \ninfluence the system. Contrast that with this more than $400,000 \ndonation to one political candidate from one corporation. What does \nthat suggest might happen down the road?\n  Our democracy was once--I hope still is--on the power of a single \nperson walking into a voting booth and casting a vote. It is based on \nindividual rights, not corporate profits. But the Citizens United case \ngave corporations the power to put corporate profits squarely ahead of \npersonal rights. That is why the legislation we are working on, the \nDISCLOSE Act, is so important. I guess that is why Republicans en masse \nseem to be opposing the DISCLOSE Act.\n  The DISCLOSE Act fights back by giving individual Americans more \npower to understand, to cast sunlight into the shadows of corporate \npolitical spending. It grants citizens power of information--\ninformation that breeds accountability and transparency. If a company \nengages in political activity, that company should be willing to \nidentify itself--but not the way the Citizens United case is. That \nmeans the DISCLOSE Act would make CEOs do what political candidates do \nwhen they pay for political advertising.\n  When I ran for office, as I did in 2006 for the Senate, I looked into \nthe camera and said: This ad was paid for by friends of Sherrod Brown, \nso people would know I am responsible for this ad. Why shouldn't a \ncorporation that writes a check for $1 million to a political \norganization--why shouldn't that CEO be willing to and be told to and \nbe forced to and be compelled to under law stand in front of the camera \nand say: This ad was paid for by XYZ Corporation. I take \nresponsibility, and I am the CEO.\n  It helps the public follow the money behind the multimillion dollars \nthat buy ads from shadowy groups. If BP were to give $1 million to a \npolitical candidate in Ohio or Pennsylvania and nobody really knows it \nis a BP ad that has gone into this group, then the voters do not have \nany way of judging very much from that ad. But if the CEO of BP had to \nwalk out in front of that camera and say: I am the CEO of BP, and I \npaid for this ad, that is going to send a message to voters: Do I want \nto support this candidate BP is supporting? But, instead, BP can get \nbehind the desk and hide from disclosure.\n  I have heard people in this body--the Republican leader most \nprominently--argue ad nauseam on campaign finance laws that we need \nfull disclosure, we need the sunlight to shine. This is his opportunity \nto step up and argue for full disclosure and go down to that well and \ncast a vote: Yes, I agree with full disclosure.\n  They are not doing it now. Do you know why? So far, not one \nRepublican has been willing to walk out here and make a CEO say: I am \nresponsible for this ad. My corporation paid for this ad. They are not \nwilling to because Republicans really know that come election time, \nwhen multinational corporations are willing to write million-dollar \nchecks, they are going to be the beneficiary--not that my party by a \nlong shot is perfect, but we know that Republican candidates are almost \nalways supported by the biggest multinational, often foreign \ncorporations in this country--the big oil companies, the big insurance \ncompanies, the big drug companies--that already have too much power \nhere, but they are going to have more power here because they are \nspending all this money to elect conservative, Republican, pro-\ncorporate, at-any-cost candidates. What that means is higher taxes for \nindividuals as corporations pay less--less corporate responsibility for \nderegulation of Wall Street and the environment. Look at what happened \nto Wall Street in the last 3 years. Look at what happened to the \nenvironment with BP. The merry-go-round will continue.\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\n  The DISCLOSE Act also has a provision that says political decisions \ncannot be influenced by foreign-owned companies. We are putting a \nprohibition in this bill that a foreign-owned company cannot come to \nAmerica and buy elections. I am incredulous that my Republican \nopponents--who always talk about nationalism, always challenge \npatriotism of people with whom they do not agree, always are talking \nabout our national interests, always bashing immigrants--would not \nagree with us that foreign companies ought not be able to come in and \nbuy American elections. I guess that is OK to them too, because our \nbill says foreign-owned corporations may not participate in American \nelections in this way.\n  To me, it is bad enough that a company based in the United States--\nthis is the case where a company that is based in the United States but \nowned by a European interest can still contribute. That is what the \nCitizens United case said. We are saying no to that. Think of a U.S.-\nbased, Chinese-owned company spending millions to influence a trade or \nmanufacturing bill.\n  One of the things I fought for--and I know the Presiding Officer \nagrees with this, and it has been supported--is made-in-America \nprovisions. We have seen in downstate Illinois, in suburban Chicago, in \nDayton and Springfield, OH, Cleveland and Toledo, a significant erosion \nof our manufacturing base. One of the reasons for that is that \ncompanies have moved offshore because of bad trade agreements and bad \ntax law that we are trying to fix even though it has been blocked by \nthe other side. We also know most Americans would love to buy clothes \nmade in the United States, would like to buy products. They go to \nstores and cannot find products made in the USA. Tell me that a \nforeign-owned corporation that spends political money, comes in and \ngives hundreds of thousands of dollars to a conservative political \ncandidate, tell me that corporation is not going to lobby that Member \nof Congress against some of our made-in-America laws we have tried to \nenact. You can bet those conservative politicians who love to trumpet \ntheir patriotism and accuse others who disagree of not being so \npatriotic will find a way to oppose strengthening made-in-America \nrules.\n  If anything should bear the label ``Made in America,'' it should be \nour elections. I am amazed that Republicans in this body do not agree \nwith that.\n  It used to be that the disclosure of campaign expenditures was \nbipartisan, Republicans and Democrats. It is bipartisan in the public; \nit is just not bipartisan here. We should not want to see our \ndemocratic system become the puppet of corporate America or any special \ninterest. Transparency matters. People ought to know from where these \ndollars come. Disclosure matters. Companies should have to disclose and \ntake responsibility for those ads and those contributions. By enabling \nAmericans to see behind the curtain, the DISCLOSE Act ensures Americans \nwill not be left in the dark.\n  The bill restores some of the integrity and the transparency that the \nCitizens United decision stripped from our political process. Let's not \nforsake this opportunity. I know it will not affect the tens of \nmillions of dollars Karl Rove and his friends in the Bush \nadministration are spending in campaigns this year, but if we do this \nbill right, it can affect elections in the future in a positive way so \nthat elections, one, will be made in America; and second, for people \nwho give money, there will be transparency and disclosure so the public \nknows which corporations are putting how much money into whose \ncampaigns, and it will mean ultimately that corporations take \nresponsibility for the decisions they make and the money they spend in \nthe American political system. It is what the rest of us have to do. \nCEOs should have to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, I wish to mention something else \nafter talking about the, perhaps, Chinese influence on American \nelections and other countries' influence on American elections and how \nRepublicans do not seem to want to stand up for the American people's \nfirst amendment rights and national interests. I wish to talk about \nsomething that is more bipartisan, in a sense, and is every bit more \ndisturbing; that is, 10 years ago this month, the Senate sold out \nAmerican manufacturing. Ten years ago this month, by a vote of 83 to \n15, the Senate passed a bill establishing permanent normal trade \nrelations with the People's Republic of China. I remember. I was in the \nHouse of Representatives, and I opposed this measure. We were joined by \nmost of the Democrats and a number of Republicans, but we were unable \nto defeat it. It was a fairly close vote.\n  The proponents of China PNTR came to our office, the people who \nwanted to give these extra benefits to China. It was initially called \nmost-favored-nation status for China. The supporters thought that did \nnot sound very good, even though we had used that term for years, and \ncalled it permanent normal trade relations with China. They put another \nname on it; they put lipstick on that pig. What the supporters said to \nus--the CEOs who came to Congress and one at a time talked to us--was \nthat they could not wait to pass PNTR because they would then have \naccess to 1 billion Chinese consumers, so those consumers could \npurchase American-made products. They wanted access to 1 billion \nChinese consumers. It sounded pretty good. As you know, it was not \nquite the story because as soon as PNTR passed, as soon as they changed \nthe rule, the story became not 1 billion Chinese consumers about whom \nthey were excited, it was 1 billion Chinese workers about whom they \nwere excited. You could see American companies crossing the ocean--\nshutting down a plant in Dayton, OH, and moving to China; shutting down \na plant in Youngstown, OH, and moving to Shanghai; shutting down a \nplant in Toledo, OH, and moving to Wuhan; shutting down a plant in \nLima, OH, and moving to Beijing or Quang Chau.\n  I think it is the first time since colonial days--maybe ever--the \nfirst time when a business plan--get this--when a company's business \nplan is this: The first thing you do is lobby Congress to change the \nrules. The second thing you do is start to shut down plants in your \nhome country with your home country's workers, where your entire \ncompany was established and grew. You have shut down production in your \ncountry. You move several thousand miles away, set up production, \nunderstanding that the workers work more cheaply, the workers work for \nless pay, the country does not have strong environmental rules and has \nvery few protections for workers.\n  They make the product, and then they sell the product back to the \nhome country. This business model, after getting the law changed--\nPNTR--10 years ago this month, was to move overseas, make the products \nthere, then sell them back to the original home country. That is bad \nfor the environment, first of all. It is bad for our workers and bad \nfor our communities when a plant shuts down.\n\n  Look what has happened. We have seen since PNTR passed a 170-percent \ntrade deficit increase in the last 10 years. China continues to \nundermine free market competition, and it leaves American workers and \nmanufacturers in severe disadvantage. Instead of helping U.S. companies \nexport more products to China, our trade policies have permitted China \nto manipulate its currency, provide illegal subsidies to Chinese \nexporters, and artificially price Chinese goods, so U.S. manufacturers \nhave to compete against a flood of cheap imports.\n  Do you know what happens? When I see people supporting this--people \ntalking about small businesses--here is how wrong they are. When a \nlarge company leaves Akron or Canton, OH, and pulls up stakes and moves \nto Mexico or China--a large assembly company, an auto plant, for \nexample--you know what happens to all the small companies and small \nmanufacturers. They don't have the wherewithal or the sophistication to \nmove to China or Mexico so they lose 30 percent of their business--a \nlittle tool and die shop in\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nAkron, a little machine shop in Hamilton, OH, whatever--because they \nhave lost their major customer. Look what happens to them and to their \nworkers. So big companies move overseas and all the component \nmanufacturers are out of luck, all because of this trade policy and \nthis tax policy which makes it more attractive for a company and a \nCEO--well, the CEO doesn't move, he or she still lives here--to move \ntheir company to China and then sell back into the United States.\n  Second, our Nation's trade policy--this PNTR bill that passed 10 \nyears ago--sold out American manufacturers and undermined our Nation's \nability to lead the world in clean energy. China, which barely had a \nwind turbine or solar manufacturing presence at all a decade ago, by \nthe end of this year may be making, or close to making, half of all \nwind turbines and solar panels in the world--in 10 years. And they are \nnot making them--most of them--to sell in China but to export, much of \nwhich comes back to the United States. More than 70 percent of the \nworld's clean energy components are manufactured outside the United \nStates.\n  We know how to make things in my State. Ohio is the third biggest \nmanufacturing State. We know how to make things. We invented and \ndeveloped most of the wind and solar panel technology. In fact, 30 \nmiles from my house is a taxpayer-funded NASA facility that developed \nthe technology we use in wind turbines, most of which is built in China \nand Spain and other places around the world.\n  Supporters of this China trade policy will make the argument that \neverything is about exports. I agree, we have to boost our exports, but \nwe have a $226 billion trade deficit per year. That is about $600 \nmillion a day. That means $600 million every single day, 7 days a week. \nIt means we buy $600 million more from China than we sell to China. So \nhow do you argue this trade policy is working for us? It means, in \nessence, that $600 million disappears from our shores every day going \nto China, and that is not going to work long term for our country when \nyou build up those types of trade deficits.\n  We can do a couple of things about this. First of all, we have to do \nmuch better at enforcing trade laws and to revive the Super 301 \nmechanism that lapsed under the Bush administration that requires the \nadministration to establish enforcement priorities for the most \npressing trade barriers, including currency manipulation, restrictive \nprocurement policies, and intellectual property theft. It would ensure \nthat our government helps open foreign markets to U.S. exporters.\n  I am a member of the President's U.S. Export Council. There are about \n10 House and Senate Members on this council--both parties, both \nHouses--and a number of American CEOs are on the council as well. We \nall want to export more. But as we try to export more, sell more U.S. \nproducts abroad, we have to enforce U.S. trade laws so those companies \naren't selling things into our country illegally.\n  President Obama has done that, to some degree. He has done more on \nthat than any previous President. He has not done close to enough. He \nhas stepped forward on oil country tubular steel goods, which is the \nsteel pipes that are used for gas and oil drilling. The Chinese were \ncheating on that. The President made the right trade decision on that, \nthe right enforcement decision. We saw hundreds of new jobs in Mahoning \nValley, in northeast Ohio. The President made a similar decision on \nChinese tires that were sold in this country illegally. After the \nPresident made that decision, 100 people were hired at the Findlay \nCooper tire plant in Findlay, OH, in northwest Ohio, and in other \nplaces around the State.\n  I would close with this. We hear a lot of talk from both parties \nabout Made in America. What that means is standing up for American \nworkers and manufacturers who are too often undercut by imports made in \ncountries that violate the law. We are just asking to have the law \nenforced. So my challenge to my colleagues--and to the President--is to \nensure American manufacturing grows rather than contracts during the \nnext decade of the 21st century.\n  Thirty years ago, almost a third of our gross domestic product was \nmanufacturing. Today, it is only 11 percent. Thirty years ago, 11 \npercent of our GDP was financial services. Today, that is 25 percent. \nSo as not to overwhelm people with numbers, we have seen basically a \nflipping of our national priorities. Think back to 30 years ago: Almost \na third of our GDP was manufacturing and only 11 percent financial \nservices. That has flipped. Look where it has gotten us. It has gotten \nus the financial crisis that almost brought our economy down, if we \nhadn't stepped in on banking and autos to stabilize the economy. It has \nalso robbed many Americans of a chance to join the middle class, \nbecause manufacturing has always been the ticket in this country for \nworking-class men and women to get a chance to work in manufacturing, \nto buy a decent home in a decent neighborhood, to buy a car and send \ntheir kids to school so their kids would have a better life. That is \nthe goal of all of us.\n  I close by saying that I hope we remember the China PNTR. I would \nhope that maybe we would even invoke some buyer's remorse; that some of \nmy colleagues would come to the Senate floor and want to discuss this \nand maybe learn from the mistakes of the last 10 years. Maybe we could \nachieve a truly normal relationship with China. I want a good strong \ntrade relationship with China. I want us to sell products to China. I \nthink we should buy products from China. But I want to do it on a level \nplaying field, with rules that work for the workers in both countries, \nnot just the big corporations that move companies to China, and not \njust for the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese military, which \nhave benefitted greatly from our trade policy. It is time to learn from \nthe last 10 years and to move forward in a very different way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about the Senate's \nprocessing of judicial nominations, and I ask you to forgive me if I am \na bit irritable, but we have had a lot of complaints about how fast \nPresident Obama's nominations are going forward. I think they are \nmoving rather well. I think some people who are now complaining have \nforgotten how they handled President Bush's nominees--and in a much \nmore unacceptable fashion.\n  I wish to emphasize that all of this is not to lay the groundwork for \nsome sort of payback, because I think we all ought to rise to the \nchallenge of handling nominations properly, but to set the record \nstraight, because there has been a lot of misinformation and some of \nour newer Senators don't know how things have happened.\n  Allegations of unprecedented obstruction and delay have been bandied \nabout--some in the press also--but the reality is that the Democrats' \nsystematic obstruction of judicial nominees during the Bush \nadministration was unprecedented then and it is unmatched now. Soon \nafter President Bush was elected, a group of well-known liberal \nprofessors--Laurence Tribe, Marsha Greenberger, and Cass Sunstein--met \nwith the Democratic leadership in the Senate. The New York Times \nreported on that meeting. I believe it was in January, before the \nsession began, and the Times reported that they proposed ``changing the \nground rules'' of the confirmation process. They proposed that with a \nRepublican President and Democrats in the Senate, Senators consider a \nnominee's ideology--their personal political views, I suppose, they \nmeant. For the first time in the history of the country, they proposed \nthat the burden be shifted to the nominee to prove they are worthy of \nthe appointment instead of having the Senate respect the presumptive \npower of the President to make the nomination and then object if there \nwas a disagreement.\n  As time went on, it became clear that a majority of the Democratic \nMembers of the Senate began to execute their unprecedented obstruction\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\nplan, targeting President Bush's circuit court nominees while moving \ndistrict court nominees to mask the obstruction. After Democrats took \ncontrol of the Senate in 2001, the Senate confirmed only 6 of President \nBush's 25 circuit court nominations that year. Two of the six were \nprior Clinton nominees that President Bush had renominated as an act of \ngood faith. They weren't his nominations. He renominated them and they \npromptly confirmed them--two of the six.\n  The majority of President Bush's first nominees--nominated on May 9, \n2001--waited years for confirmation. Let me list some of the names: \nPriscilla Owen, who was then on the Supreme Court of Texas--a brilliant \njurist--was confirmed but only after 4 years, on May 25, 2005. These \nwere in that first group. Now Chief Justice John Roberts--a fabulous \nnominee; probably--not probably, he was the premier appellate lawyer in \nAmerica--was nominated to the DC Circuit. He was confirmed, but only \nafter 2 years and after undergoing two Judiciary Committee hearings. He \neventually was confirmed by a voice vote.\n  Jeffrey Sutton, another superb lawyer with great skill in the \nappellate courts, was confirmed but only 2 years later.\n  Deborah Cook, for the Sixth Circuit, was confirmed 2 years later on \nMay 5, 2003.\n  Dennis Shedd was confirmed more than a year and a half later.\n  Michael McConnell, for the 10th Circuit, was confirmed more than a \nyear and a half later but also by voice vote--he was delayed that long \nfor no reason.\n  Terrence Boyle waited almost 8 years until his nomination was allowed \nto lapse at the end of President Bush's Presidency. He was never \nconfirmed.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing story was that of Miguel Estrada, whose \nname was raised during the Supreme Court nomination of Justice Kagan. \nHe was an outstanding, highly qualified nominee who was nominated on \nMay 9, 2001, just like the others, right after President Bush took \noffice. He waited 16 months just for a hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee, only to be confronted with demands that the Department of \nJustice turn over internal legal memoranda that had never been turned \nover before. They used that for 2\\1/2\\ years, leaving him in limbo, and \nthen had a protracted 6-month filibuster. I think it was the first \novert, direct filibuster of a highly qualified nominee the Senate had \nseen. This was one of the ground rule changes that occurred. There were \nseven cloture votes on Miguel Estrada, seven attempts by the \nRepublicans to produce an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate on \nMiguel Estrada. It went on for weeks. I participated in that. I \nprobably spoke on his behalf more than any other Senator. Eventually, \nMr. Estrada withdrew his name from consideration. He had a private law \npractice to deal with. He could not continue this.\n  I remain baffled today as to why such a fine nominee was treated so \npoorly, his character assassinated, and his nomination was ultimately \nblocked for no reason. The record that they claim needed to be produced \nfrom the Department of Justice was, by every former living Solicitor \nGeneral--they said those are internal lawyer-client documents that \nshould not have been produced. It was a sad day. I hope the Senate has \nlearned from that unfortunate event.\n  One of the most blatant examples of obstruction of Bush nominees \noccurred in the Fourth Circuit. This court sat one-third vacant. One-\nthird of the judges had retired, and it was vacant. They needed judges. \nI did not hear any of my Democratic colleagues worrying then about \nvacancies and caseloads when they were deliberately delaying and \nblocking outstanding, well-qualified nominees to that court, including \nFederal District Court Chief Judge Robert Conrad, Judge Glen Conrad, \nMr. Steve Matthews, and Mr. Rod Rosenstein. They deliberately blocked \nthese nominees to keep those vacancies open so that a Democratic \nPresident would perhaps have the opportunity to fill them.\n  That actually turned out to be a success, from their perspective. A \n2007 Washington Post editorial at the time lamented the dire straits of \nthe Fourth Circuit at the time, writing:\n\n       [T]he Senate should act in good faith to fill vacancies--\n     not as a favor to the president but out of respect for the \n     residents, businesses, defendants and victims of crimes in \n     the region the Fourth Circuit covers. Two nominees--Mr. \n     Conrad and Mr. Steve A. Matthews--should receive confirmation \n     hearings as soon as possible.\n\n  But they did not.\n  He was the chief presiding trial judge in a district court, a Federal \ndistrict court. He was nominated to the seat for which President \nObama's nominee, Judge James Wynn, was confirmed on August 5 of this \nyear. They held that seat open for 8 years. Since the President has \nbeen in office, he nominated someone else, and he got his nominee \nconfirmed by this Senate.\n  Chief Judge Conrad had the support of his home State Senators and \nreceived an ABA rating of unanimously ``well qualified,'' the highest \nrating you can get. He met Chairman Leahy's standard for a \nnoncontroversial, consensus nominee. He previously received bipartisan \napproval by the Judiciary Committee and was unanimously approved by the \nSenate to be U.S. attorney and later to be district court judge for the \nWestern District of North Carolina. Of all the lawyers in the country, \nAttorney General Reno, when he was a Federal prosecutor, reached out to \nhim and picked him to preside over the investigation of one of the \ncampaign finance task force cases that implicated, perhaps, President \nClinton, the President of the United States. He did that investigation \nprofessionally. He returned no indictments against the President or his \ntop people. He was respected on both sides of the aisle. Yet he was \nflatly blocked, although representing the highest quality.\n  On October 2, 2007, home State Senators Burr and Dole sent a letter \nto Senator Leahy requesting a hearing--at least a hearing on Judge \nConrad. They also spoke on his behalf at a press conference on June 19 \nthat featured a number of Judge Conrad's friends and colleagues who \ntraveled all the way from North Carolina to show their support. The \nrequest for a hearing was denied.\n  On April 15, 2008, Senators Burr, Dole, Graham, and DeMint sent a \nletter to Senator Leahy asking for a hearing on Judge Conrad and Mr. \nMatthews. That request was denied.\n  Despite overwhelming support and exceptional qualifications, Judge \nConrad waited 585 days for a hearing that never came. His nomination \nwas returned to the President on January 2, 2009. That was a horrible \nevent, in my view. The Senate failed in its duty. Judge Conrad was a \npowerful, bipartisan nominee with great credentials and served Attorney \nGeneral Reno and the Democratic President and should have been \nconfirmed.\n  Another of President Bush's outstanding nominees was Judge Glen \nConrad. He also had the support of his home State Senators, including \nDemocratic Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, and received an ABA rating of \n``well qualified,'' the highest rating. He, too, met Chairman Leahy's \nstandard because he had already been confirmed to the District Court \nfor the Western District of Virginia by a unanimous vote--89 to \nnothing.\n  Despite his extensive qualifications, Judge Conrad, who was nominated \non May 8, 2008, waited 240 days for a hearing--just a hearing in the \ncommittee--that never came. His nomination was returned to the \nPresident in 2009, as President Bush left office. In stark contrast, \nPresident Obama's nominee to this seat, Judge Barbara Milano Keenan, \nreceived a hearing a mere 23 days after her nomination and a committee \nvote just 22 days later, and she was confirmed at the beginning of this \nyear--a slot that should have been filled by Mr. Conrad.\n  President Bush nominated Steve Matthews in 2007 to the same seat on \nthe Fourth Circuit to which Judge Diaz has now been nominated. Mr. \nMatthews had the support of his home State Senators and received an ABA \nrating of ``qualified.'' He was a graduate of Yale Law School and had a \ndistinguished career in private practice in South Carolina.\n  Despite these qualifications, he waited 485 days for a hearing that \nnever came. His nomination was returned to the President as he was \nleaving office.\n  That does not seem to slow down my Democratic colleagues who have \nforgotten all this, I guess, and their allies in the press from \nunabashedly complaining that Judge Diaz had been\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\nwaiting too long for this seat, for a confirmation vote, or decrying \nthe need to rush to fill the vacancy--a vacancy that just has to be \nfilled right now.\n  The truth is that the vacancy should never have existed if Mr. \nMatthews had been confirmed when he was supposed to have been \nconfirmed.\n  Earlier this year, we confirmed Judge Andre Davis to the ``Maryland'' \nseat on the Fourth Circuit. A brief history of that bears mention. \nPresident Bush nominated Rod Rosenstein to fill that vacancy in 2007. \nThe ABA rated him unanimously ``well qualified,'' the highest rating. \nPreviously, he had been confirmed unanimously as the U.S. attorney for \nMaryland. Prior to that, he held several positions in the Department of \nJustice under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n  Despite these stellar qualifications, Mr. Rosenstein waited 414 days \nfor a hearing--just a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, which the \nDemocrats never gave him. His nomination was returned to the President \non January 2, 2009.\n  The reason given by the home State Senators for why his nomination \nwas blocked was that he was ``doing [too] good [of a] job as U.S. \nAttorney in Maryland.'' I think the Washington Post editorial painted a \nmore accurate picture, saying:\n\n       Blocking Mr. Rosenstein's confirmation hearing . . . would \n     elevate ideology and ego above substance and merit, and it \n     would unfairly penalize a man who people on both sides of \n     this question agree is well qualified for a judgeship.\n\n  But it was only when President Obama nominated Judge Davis to this \nseat that we heard our Democratic colleagues express outrage over the \nfact that it had been vacant for 9 years. I said that was like the man \nwho complained about being an orphan after having murdered his parents. \nIronically, however, Judge Davis fared far better than President Bush's \nnominees to the Fourth Circuit. He received a hearing a mere 27 days \nafter being nominated. A committee vote occurred 36 days later, and he \nhas been confirmed.\n  Suffice it to say that the Democrats have capitalized on their 8 \nyears of obstruction of outstanding, well-qualified Bush nominees by \npacking the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals with Obama-picked nominees.\n  I want to say, parenthetically, President Bush did an excellent job \nof picking high-quality judicial nominees. Consistently, they sought \nout highly competent men and women of integrity and ability to appoint \nto the courts, people who had this fundamental belief--that some on the \nother side do not like--that a judge should follow the law, should be a \nneutral umpire, and should not take sides and ought not to be an \nactivist and ought not to promote their personal agenda when they get a \nchance to rule and define the words of statutes and the Constitution. \nThere is a fundamental difference. I will talk about that later. I may \nnot get to that today, but I am going to talk about it some more. It is \na big deal, what you think the role of a judge is. Should they be an \nactivist? Should they promote greater vision, as President Obama said, \nof what America should be? Is that what we want judges to do? \nClassically, in America, judges are empowered to do one thing: to \ndecide the discrete case before them objectively, impartially, under \nthe laws and Constitution of the United States.\n  The Democratic Senators perpetrated similar systematic obstruction in \nthe Sixth Circuit. I hate to say it. I hate to talk about it. I sound \nlike I am being a partisan person over here, complaining. I am just \nreading the record.\n  In November of 2001, President Bush nominated Judges David McKeague, \nSusan Neilson, and Henry Saad to fill vacancies on that court. In June \nof 2002, he nominated Richard Griffin to fill an additional Sixth \nCircuit vacancy.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is up. I don't see anyone on the floor. \nI ask unanimous consent that I be able to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will yield the floor if and when my \ncolleagues seek it.\n  But the Democratic home State Senators refused to return their blue \nslips for any of these nominees for the Sixth Circuit. President Bush \nrenominated all four on January 2003. This time the Democratic home \nState Senators returned their blue slips--negative blue slips, opposing \nall four nominees.\n  Despite this, on July 30, 2003, 629 days after the initial nomination \nand 204 days after his renomination, the Republican-controlled \nJudiciary Committee--Republicans had just taken control--held a hearing \non Judge Saad's nomination.\n  However, Democrats continued to delay the nomination for a year, \nuntil he was finally and favorably reported out of committee on a \nparty-line vote. But it did not matter. The Democrats filibustered his \nnomination on the floor, and he never received an up-or-down vote in \nthe Senate. He was filibustered, which was a changing of the ground \nrules. We had not filibustered judges before in the Senate. All this \noccurred after 2001.\n  President Bush renominated Judge Saad in February 2005, but the \nSenate failed to act on his nomination, and he was never confirmed. \nJudges Griffin and McKeague eventually received hearings on June 16, \n2004, 721 days after Judge Griffin had been nominated, and 951 days \nafter Judge McKeague's original nomination. They were both reported \nfavorably out of committee a month later, but the Democrats \nfilibustered them on the floor, and their nominations were returned to \nthe President.\n  Both were renominated in the 109th Congress and were finally and \noverwhelmingly confirmed, Judge Griffin by a vote of 95 to 0 and Judge \nMcKeague by a vote of 96 to 0.\n  As these votes show, the nominations were not controversial. They \nwere just being held up. Yet they still waited over 1,000 days for \ntheir confirmation. Judge Susan Nielson received a hearing on September \n8, 2004, over 1,000 days after her original nomination and over 600 \ndays after her renomination. Although her nomination was reported \nfavorably out of committee on October 4, 2004, Democrats refused to \ngive her an up-or-down vote in the full Senate, and her nomination was \nreturned to the President.\n  He renominated her in 2005, and 7 months later the Democratic home \nState Senators finally returned positive blue slips, after delaying the \nnomination for this long. She was easily confirmed 97 to zip, 1,449 \ndays after her original nomination. Unfortunately, Judge Nielson passed \naway shortly thereafter.\n  On June 28, 2006, President Bush nominated Stephen Murphy and Raymond \nKethledge to fill still more vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. However, \nthe Democratic home State Senators withheld their blue slips, and the \nnominations were returned to the President. The President renominated \nthem in March of 2007. After almost a year of delay, as part of a \ncompromise, President Bush agreed to withdraw Mr. Murphy's nomination \nand to nominate Judge Helene White in his place. In exchange, home \nState Senators finally returned positive blue slips for Mr. Kethledge.\n  There is a story behind this. Why was there so much needless \nobstruction in the Sixth Circuit? One reason, it appears, was that the \nNAACP National Defense League made a personal request to Democratic \nSenators on the Judiciary Committee that they stall the confirmation of \nnominees to the Sixth Circuit until cases regarding the \nconstitutionality of affirmative action in higher education were \ndecided. They believed, apparently, that if Bush appointees were \nconfirmed to that circuit, the outcome of the cases would not be to \ntheir liking. They were afraid President Bush's judges would be \ncommitted to color-blind policies.\n  So this is just one example of a larger agenda. Our Democratic \ncolleagues criticized, during the Kagan confirmation hearings, Chief \nJustice Roberts' metaphor that a judge should act like a neutral umpire \nin a ball game, calling balls and strikes and applying the law to the \nfacts.\n  No, they seem to want judges who will make policy and rule based on \ntheir personal policy preferences and political beliefs to advance \ndesired outcomes.\n  Well, what is activism? Is this an exaggeration? I think we need to \nbe frank that there are activist judges--and you can be a conservative \nactivist or a liberal activist, but there is a difference in the sense \nthat liberal judges and law\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\nprofessors and commentators advocate judges being activists.\n  Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito were articulate spokesmen for \nthe classical American view that a judge should be a neutral umpire and \nshould be impartial and should decide the cases and not try to make law \nor advance a vision for America.\n  Many judges, however, are overriding the will of the people this very \nday. It is becoming apparent that many on the left hold the Federal \njudiciary as an engine to advance the agenda of the left, picking and \nchoosing which constitutional rights they will protect and which ones \nthey will cast aside. The only consistent principle--of which sometimes \nI think, and I am exaggerating, but I sometimes think--is to advance \nthe agenda of the leftwing of the Democratic Party. That is about the \nonly consistent guiding principle you can find in some of these \nopinions.\n  Just a few months ago, the preservation of the explicit \nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms was upheld by a single vote \non the Supreme Court. Four Justices, including Justice Sotomayor, \ncontrary to, I think, what she said just 1 year earlier in her \nconfirmation hearing, would have held that the right to keep and bear \narms is different from other liberties protected by the Bill of Rights \nand should not apply to the States.\n  Hugely significant. If that were to be so, any State, any city or \ncounty, for that matter, could ban firearms altogether because the \nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms would not apply to them. \nFour Justices on the Supreme Court ruled that way.\n  During the last term, the free speech clause of the first amendment \nbarely escaped being rewritten by a single vote in Citizens United. In \nthat case, the Supreme Court invalidated a portion of the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance law, holding that political speech is not \nexempted from the first amendment guarantee of free speech merely \nbecause the speaker's expression is funded, in part, by money from a \ncorporation, a group of Americans.\n  Four Justices on the Supreme Court would have rewritten the free \nspeech clause to allow the government to ban statements made by such \ngroups in an election cycle. I mean, the last thing we need to be doing \nis whacking away at the great liberties in free speech clause of the \nfirst amendment.\n  Just a couple years ago, one vote on the Supreme Court decided that a \ncity could use its eminent domain power to take property, to take a \nwoman's house, in order to give it to a private company for a \nredevelopment project, not for public use. So much for the \nconstitutional guarantee of life, liberty and property and the \nconstitutional guarantee that your property can only be taken for \npublic use, not private use. You cannot take somebody's property \nbecause you would like to take it to give to somebody else who would \nuse it in a way that the city thinks is better, maybe spend more money \non it so they can get more tax revenue.\n  By one vote, the Supreme Court held it did not violate the first \namendment for a public university to require a religiously oriented \nstudent organization to accept officers and members who do not \nsubscribe to the organization's religious beliefs. How could they say \nthat?\n  Recently, a judge in the Western District of Wisconsin, the same \ndistrict to which Louis Butler has been nominated, held that the \nstatute establishing the National Day of Prayer was unconstitutional \nbecause its sole purpose ``is to encourage all citizens to engage in \nprayer.''\n  In so doing, the judge held that the government had ``taken sides on \na matter that must be left to individual conscience.'' Well, nobody is \nbeing made to pray. You do not have to bow your head if someone has a \nprayer, for heaven's sake.\n  One wonders, then, does this Senate violate the establishment clause \neach day when we open the session with a prayer, most often led by a \npaid Chaplain, former head of the entire Chaplain Corps of the United \nStates Military?\n  There is a constitutional guarantee to the right of free exercise of \none's religion, the free exercise clause, not found in the first \namendment of the judge's constitution.\n  I will repeat, if other Senators would desire to speak, I will yield \nthe floor.\n  The liberal Ninth Circuit, to which Professor Goodwin Liu has been \nnominated, held recently that the recitation of the Pledge of \nAllegiance in an elementary school was unconstitutional under the \nestablishment clause of the first amendment because the pledge includes \nthe words ``under God,'' and amounted to a government endorsement of a \nreligion.\n  One wonders what the Ninth Circuit would have to say about teaching \nchildren the Declaration of Independence. After all, it does say: ``We \nhold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, \nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nRights.'' Is that now unconstitutional, to read the Declaration of \nIndependence?\n  A single judge on the U.S. district court in Massachusetts recently \ninvalidated the congressionally passed Defense of Marriage Act that \npassed on this floor. I remember the debate about it. The judge found \nit unconstitutional. Basically, what he said is: No State would have to \ngive full faith and credit to a marriage in another State if it does \nnot meet their definition of marriage as between a man and a woman.\n  The judge, in great wisdom, not having had to run for office, with a \nlifetime appointment, unaccountable to the public in any way, objected, \nfound it to be unconstitutional because it did not have ``a legitimate \ngovernment interest'' and was outside the scope of ``legislative \nbounds.''\n  Well, I remember the debate on that. People quoted the Constitution, \nand we discussed it at great length. I cannot imagine how that can be \nheld to be unconstitutional.\n  A single judge in the Northern District of California, the same court \nto which Edward Chen has been nominated, held that a statewide ballot \ninitiative defining marriage--this was a California initiative, \nstatewide, that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, which \nwas passed by a majority of California voters--violated the due process \nand equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.\n  The judge decided, essentially by fiat, that the State, the people of \nCalifornia, had no legitimate interest in defining marriage.\n  Marriage has always been a matter of State law. A single judge in the \ncentral district of California recently held Congress's don't ask, \ndon't tell policy was unconstitutional. This is the policy on gays in \nthe military. The judge in the central district of California held that \nthis policy was unconstitutional because it did not ``significantly \nfurther the government's interest in military readiness or unit \ncohesion.'' It was an impermissible content-based restriction that \nviolated free speech, free association, and the petition clauses of the \nfirst amendment.\n  I don't think this judge has any responsibility for or knowledge \nabout readiness and unit cohesion in the military. It is a matter \nCongress appropriately has dealt with, will have the opportunity to \ndeal with again, and may well do so, although we did not move forward \nyesterday.\n  This is not a matter for the courts. The American people know this. \nThey sense activism in their courts, and they are concerned and unhappy \nbecause these judges, once they declare something to be constitutional, \nor find something in the Constitution, it is as if an entire amendment \nwas passed, and it becomes impossible for a city or county, a State or \ncongressional action to overturn it.\n  These are big issues we have been talking about for some time. I do \nhave my back up a little bit about being accused of obstructing, when \nnominees are moving along at a very good pace today, in my opinion. A \nfew are controversial, and I could talk about them, but I see Senator \nKerry in the Chamber now.\n  I believe when we get all the facts out, people will remember that \nmany of the changes in the process occurred as a deliberate plan by the \nDemocratic leadership in 2001.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7317-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7317-S7323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in the 25 years I have had the privilege of \nserving in the Senate, I have regrettably, in the course of almost \nevery election period, with one brief exception when we had the McCain-\nFeingold bill in\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\nplace, seen our system of funding campaigns become increasingly broken. \nThe truth is, a lot of the anger the American people feel today--\nrightfully--for the absence of this Congress--not just this particular \nsession but the Congress of the United States being able to directly \naddress the concerns of the American people--a lot of that anger really \nought to be directed at the system itself, at the fact that we have \nlocked in place funding of campaigns that robs the American people of \ntheir voice, that steals the legitimacy of our democracy, and \nconcentrates decisionmaking in the hands of the powerful, individuals \nwith a lot of money or powerful corporations with a lot of money.\n  Money is driving American politics. Money is driving the American \npolitical agenda. Money decides what gets heard and does not get heard \naround here, what gets acted on and does not, and how it gets acted on \nin many cases. Every so often we have bubbling up a legitimate kind of \ncitizen energy that motivates one particular reaction here or another, \nwhether it is a tax bill or a particular piece of legislation for \nwomen, pay, but it is rare now. It is actually rare that the kind of \ngrassroots effort that traditionally we think of when we think of \nlegitimate democracy, that it is felt in its appropriate ways.\n  The truth is, the increased influence of special interest money, big \nmoney in our politics, is robbing the average citizen of his or her \nvoice in setting America's agenda. There are far more poor people, \nthere are far more children, there are far more interests that don't \nget represented. We constantly see, like the debate we have had \nrecently over carried interest, for instance, or a number of other \ninterests here get as much time and as much debate over one or two of \nthose single issues as some of those that affect a far greater \nproportion of the population.\n  As a result of the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Citizens \nUnited, we have seen an incredible step backwards from accountability, \na step backwards from preserving our democracy, and an incredible gift \nto the power of money. In the last few years, under the McCain-Feingold \nbill and under our rules, at least if a company wanted to participate \nin the election, it had to go out and ask its executives to contribute. \nWe went through the sort of charade of having a fundraising event at \nwhich a whole bunch of executives would have to show up or people who \nworked for a company, and they wrote a check. The checks were bundled \ntogether, and there were your contributions. But at least there was \naccountability. At least people knew those people had contributed. At \nleast people saw where it was coming from and who it was coming from.\n  Under the Citizens United decision, all a CEO has to do is put it in \nthe budget of the corporation. The corporation can budget annually. We \nare going to put $2 million, and the CEO can turn that money over in \nits totality to some group that is formed to destroy somebody's \nreputation with a lot of lies, just pour the money over. That is it. \nTotal secrecy. We don't even get to know who gave the money. No \naccountability. They just turn the money over to lobbyists who run the \nmedia campaigns to help their friends and defeat their opponents in \nCongress. We can have the best Congress. People have always said that \nmoney buys people in public life. But this is a step toward the \ngreatest certification of that I have ever seen. It sends a chilling \nmessage to candidates without means, which is most candidates, that \nthey can't combat the bottomless pocket of a K Street lobbyist who has \nsome cabal of corporations that want to pour a bunch of money in to get \ntheir special interests protected.\n  So American workers in Ohio or Indiana or any other State who wonder \nwhy those jobs went overseas, there is a tax benefit that helps those \ncompanies actually take those jobs overseas. Why is that tax benefit \nthere? Why do we have thousands upon thousands of pages of special \ninterest tax provisions in our Tax Code? Because the lobbyists and the \npowerful people are able to be heard, and they are able to work their \nwill. They are able to make that happen.\n  Now we have a rule, because the Supreme Court ruled that corporations \nare like people and have the same rights. So we have a new assault on \nAmerica's democracy. I mean that. It is an assault on our democracy. We \nhave always had money in the marketplace of politics. We understand \nthat. For years people have tried to find one way or another of trying \nto address that concern. This is not a new concern of the American \npeople. It is hard to say where we are headed, all of us, in our \ncareers in public life. I am, obviously, on the back end of that \nrunway, but I am stunned by what the impact of this is going to mean to \nour country and to the ability of average voices to be heard.\n  The humorous Will Rogers once quipped that ``politics has gotten so \nexpensive, it takes a lot of money even to get beat.'' But Will Rogers \nwould be stunned by the amount of money in politics today.\n  In 2008, a record total of $5.2 billion was spent by all the \nPresidential, Senate, and House candidates. When I ran for President in \n2004 on a national basis, we spent $4.1 billion. That broke the 2000 \nrecord when Al Gore ran of $3.1 billion. So we go from $3.1 billion to \n$4.1 billion to $5.2 billion.\n  Now we have a new rule. All these secret funds can come into the \npolitical process. We have already broken the record in 2010 from the \n2006 race by a huge amount. I think the total amount of money spent in \n2006, which was an off Presidential year, was about somewhere around \n$700 something million, $800 million. We are well over $1.2, $1.3 \nbillion already in this cycle. That is just the campaign spending. That \nis the direct money that goes into the campaigns.\n  But last year, special interests spent a record of $3.47 billion \nhiring lobbyists. The rest of the country might have been suffering \nfrom a recession, but it was a great year for K Street in Washington, a \n5-percent increase in fees over the previous year.\n  President Obama's ``change'' agenda stirred up so many people who \nwere going to be opposed to it from the very beginning--health care, \nbanking regulation, all the things that have undermined Americans in \nthe last years--they wanted to preserve the status quo. They sat up, \nand they came up with about $1.3 million spent per minute in 2009. That \nis the amount the watchdog group, Center for Responsive Politics, \narrived at when they took the $3.47 billion that lobbyists collected \nand divided it by the number of hours Congress was in session in 2009. \nIt comes out to $1.3 million per minute spent to try to hold on to the \nstatus quo.\n\n  Now thanks to the Supreme Court, it is a lot easier for special \ninterests to finance and orchestrate contrived political movements. \nUnbelievably, the Court ruled in Citizens United that corporations have \nthe same right to speech as individuals. Therefore, they can spend \nunlimited amounts of money in elections.\n  I remember from my days in law school learning distinctly that a \ncorporation is a fictitious entity. It is a fictitious entity created \nas a matter of law to protect the corporation in the conduct of its \neconomic business, not to protect it in the context of giving it the \nsame rights as an individual with respect to speech. For a Supreme \nCourt of the United States to somehow put a corporation on the same \nplane as the individual citizen is absolutely extraordinary.\n  As a result, we are now seeing a whole bunch of spending by shadowy \ngroups run by long-time Republican Party officials and activists that \nis going to end up in the hundreds of millions of dollars, money that \ncannot be traced to its source. How do Members feel about that? How do \nAmericans feel about the millions of dollars being spent and they don't \nknow who is spending it? Unaccountable democracy.\n  What we are talking about, I suppose, means little to the \ncorporations compared to what they are going to get in terms of \nblocking a regulation. We have people here who want to delay the \nregulations for clean air. They are going to come in here and try to \nsay: We can't proceed now to have clean air. We have to delay it. So \nmore coal fumes will pollute the air and more people will get sick and \nso forth. But they will try to work their way, and they have a lot of \nmoney to try to do it with.\n  The Supreme Court's ruling also clears the way for the domestic \nsubsidiary of a foreign corporation to\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\nspend unlimited amounts to influence our elections.\n  I want people to think about that. A foreign corporation and a \nnational of a foreign country are barred under the law from \ncontributing to Federal or State elections. But nothing in the law bars \nthe foreign subsidiary incorporated in the United States from doing so. \nThose subsidiaries do not answer to the American people. They answer to \ntheir corporate parents way off in some other country. That means that \nin no uncertain way a foreign corporation can indeed play in an \nAmerican election, and clever people will not have a hard time in \ncovering that trail.\n  So today, on the floor of the Senate, in Washington, DC, in the year \nof the tea party--when the tea party is asking for accountability, and \nthe tea party is asking for sunshine, and they want reform--I would \nlike to hear the tea party stand up today and say: Republicans ought to \nvote overwhelmingly to have sunshine on the funding process of our \ncampaigns.\n  The DISCLOSE Act, on which we will vote today, does not amend the \nConstitution. It is not going to overturn the Supreme Court decision \nthat equated the rights of people--I would think the tea party ought to \nbe excoriated over the notion that a corporation has been given the \nsame rights as the Constitution gives to an individual. But it does not \neven overturn that. It does not even constitute campaign finance \nreform. All it does is shine the disinfectant of sunlight on \ncorporations and faceless organizations that are trying to buy and \nbully their way in Washington through campaigns run against Members who \ndisagree with them.\n  The DISCLOSE Act requires corporations, organizations, and special \ninterest groups to stand by their political advertising, just like any \ncandidate for office, and it requires the CEO of a company to identify \nthemselves in their advertisements. And corporations and organizations \nwould be required to disclose their political expenditures.\n  Is that asking too much, that the American people get to know who is \nspending the money to influence them so that maybe they will have the \nability to judge whether there might be a little bias in that ad or \nthere might be a little personal interest in that ad, there might be a \nreason they are getting the information they are getting, the way they \nare getting it?\n  That is all we are asking. It is not radical. It is not prohibitive. \nIt simply removes the false notion that Americans are somehow \nvoluntarily organizing all across this country in order to pursue a \npublic interest. The fact is, corporate special interest money is being \ncompiled and targeted to pursue a special interest and to send a loud \ntelevised message to those who disagree with them that they are going \nto be punished for disagreeing. If that practice is not disclosed and \ntempered, it is not only going to tip elections, it is going to \ncripple--cripple--the legislative process more than it has already been \ncrippled in these past few years.\n  Instead of negotiating with each other in the public interest in the \nCongress, Members of Congress find themselves asking corporations--\nsupposedly subject to the law and will of the American people--they ask \nthem whether it is OK with them whether we regulate or legislate and \nrelease their allies to vote in favor of one thing or another. And \nguess what. No surprise to the American people, those corporations \nalmost always refuse to do so.\n  So when the Citizens United decision was handed down, the voices \nseeking support from these corporations argued it would have no effect \non the American political process. They said: We don't need to worry \nabout new funneling of funds to candidates. But the record already says \notherwise. The truth is, Karl Rove admitted that based on the Citizens \nUnited decision, he has formed two new groups specifically, because \nthis decision empowered him to do it, to influence the 2010 elections \nwith $52 million of ads bankrolled anonymously by special interests.\n  Now that the Supreme Court has opened the door to these anonymous \nads, a lot of other groups are planning to spend approximately $300 \nmillion or more on the elections this fall. Already we have seen \nincredible disparity. I think the total spent by these anonymous groups \nattacking Democratic candidates around the country is over $30 million. \nThe total amount the Democrats have had available to them, because they \ndo not have as much money, and they do not represent those powerful \ngroups, is about $3 million. Seven to one is the ratio.\n  All you have to do is begin to analyze these ads, and you can see \nexactly what the message is and why it is coming.\n  So here is the deal: Whether you agree with the ads or not is not \nwhat is at issue on the floor of the Senate today. At a minimum, I \nwould hope our colleagues would support the idea that messages that are \nsent in American politics, advertisements that are made for or against \na candidate, advertisements that are made for or against a particular \nidea, that those ought to be sent openly; that they ought to be sent in \nan accountable way so the American people--which is what this is all \nabout, this institution, this house, the Senate, the House. All of this \ncomes from the words ``We the People,'' and we have been hearing those \nwords, ``We the People'' all over America from the tea party and from \nothers who are trying to remind people what that is all about. This \nvote is all about that today, and their outrage ought to be summoned \nall across the country to shed the sunlight on this political process \nand hold it accountable.\n  If our friends come to the floor this afternoon and vote en bloc \nagainst it, let me tell you, that is a declarative statement about \nwhose interests are being protected and what is at stake in this \nelection as we go into this November.\n  The stakes for the American people are simply too high to let special \ninterests hide behind faceless and unidentified campaigns. I cannot \nthink of anything that is less American than secret money going into \ncampaigns to try to affect the choices of the American people.\n  This is an opportunity for us to truly speak for the American people, \nand I hope my colleagues will join us in doing so today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise to voice my support for the \nDISCLOSE Act.\n  The DISCLOSE Act has to do with the Citizens United case, where the \nSupreme Court went out of its way to overturn nearly 100 years of \nstatutes and settled precedent that had established the authority of \nthe Congress to limit the corrupting influence of corporate money in \nFederal elections. It is a truly astounding decision, and it broke with \nall precedent for 100 years.\n  The Court ruled--and this takes a little bit, and you have to suspend \nyour mind to get this right--that corporations are absolutely free to \nspend shareholder money with the intent to promote the election or \ndefeat of a candidate for political office. The corporations have \nfreedom of speech. This is astounding.\n  Beyond ignoring precedent, the Court's reckless, immodest, and \nactivist opinion failed to distinguish between the rights of purpose-\nbuilt political advocacy corporations and profit-driven, large \ncorporations to direct resources to influence elections. They came in \nand ruled that any corporation can spend corporate money on whatever \nraces they want. By issuing the broadest possible opinion, the majority \nadmitted of no differences between Citizens United and any major \nmultinational corporation.\n  But this decision left important questions unresolved. Who determines \nwhat candidates the major multinational corporation supports or \nopposes? Think about it. Here are corporations run by managers. We all \nknow the problems with boards of directors, and we have seen what has \ngone on in the last years with decisions by corporations. But they \nnever said who in the corporation gets to make the decision. Can a \nmanager of the corporation or a CEO say I am going to throw $40 million \nor $50 million into the political pot or should he have to go to \nshareholders to get it?\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\nThat is a gigantic amount of money in politics, but it is a mere \npittance to a large corporation. Who determines what candidates the \nmajor multinational corporation supports or opposes? The boards of \ndirectors? The CEO? The employees? All these groups and individuals \nserve the corporation for the benefit of the shareholders.\n  How will the shareholders of these corporations learn who makes these \ndecisions within the corporation? Even so, how are we to determine what \nspeech the shareholders favor? How do you do that? You are running a \ncorporation and you get up one morning and decide you are going to go \nagainst candidate X or Y. Have you asked your shareholders what to do \nwith their money or whether they want to be against or for candidate X \nor Y? How is that decision made? Do we care if the shareholders are \nU.S. citizens or citizens of an economic, political, or military rival \nof the United States? The way this thing rules is that a corporation \nthat is under the control of an economic, political, and military rival \nof ours anywhere in the world can now be involved in our campaigns. \nThat is something we have never done before.\n  As it stands now, Citizens United allows corporate interests to \nprevail over the rights of American citizens--that is it, pure and \nsimple--because they have so much in assets. A speaker in California \nsaid that money is the mother's milk of politics. Most Americans know \nthat and they decry it. With this decision, it allows corporate \ninterests to prevail over American citizens and overwhelms the \ncontributions and the voices of shareholders and individuals, and it \nultimately makes elected officials even more beholden to corporations.\n  I tell you what, I don't have to do a survey to find out that most \nAmericans don't want elected officials more beholden to corporations, \nand I am a corporate guy. There is nothing wrong with corporations. But \nthe American people don't want corporations having more control over \nelected officials.\n  Boardroom executives must not be permitted to raid the corporate \ncoffers to promote personal political beliefs or to curry personal \nfavor with elected politicians. That result is bad for corporations, \nbad for shareholders, and bad for government. We must ensure that the \ncorporation speaks with the voice of its shareholders, and that those \nwho would utilize the corporate forum to magnify their political \ninfluence do not do so for improper personal gain or to impose the will \nof a foreign power on American citizens.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has left us without the tools to \ndirectly affect any of these compelling public interests. The DISCLOSE \nAct cannot entirely undo the activism of the Roberts Court and shut off \nthe spigot of corrupting corporate funds because they say it is \nunconstitutional. The Congress cannot overcome a constitutional \nviolation that was made by the Supreme Court. That is fundamental to \nour system. But it will serve as a bulwark against the flood of \ncorporate money and help resolve the open questions created by the \nCourt in Citizens United.\n  The act will shine a spotlight on corporate spending and prevent \ncorporations from speaking anonymously by increasing disclosure and \nstrengthening transparency in Federal campaigns.\n  Transparency--if you came to the floor since Buckley v. Valeo, in \n1974, the first campaign finance ruling, you would have found my \ncolleagues, led by their majority leader, speaking passionately about \ntransparency, transparency, transparency. Now we have a bill where no \none knows who is spending the money, and there is no movement on the \nother side. In fact, there is a filibuster against this bill, which \nwould allow transparency. That is the main thing to do. It can't change \nthe rules because the Supreme Court says it is then constitutional. We \nare trying to deal with transparency, something that has been a \nhallmark--if you take a debate over the last 30 years on financing of \nelections and put all of those papers up on a wall, and you throw a \ndart, the chance that you would hit a Member on the other side of the \naisle talking about transparency is pretty high.\n  So you have to ask: Why would they be opposed to shining a spotlight \non corporate spending and prevent corporations from anonymously \nincreasing disclosure and increasing transparency in Federal campaigns?\n  Not only does the act require the corporation, organization, and \nspecial interest groups to stand by their political advertising like a \ncandidate running for office--when we had McCain-Feingold, I think most \nAmericans liked this. If you were going to put up an ad, you would say: \nI am Ted Kaufman and I approve this ad. There were a lot of jokes about \nit, but you knew who paid for the ad. But they don't want to do this \nwith corporate money. I can go to a big corporation and start a \ncommittee to save the world, and I can pour $35 million into it and \nspend it around the country, and I never have to disclose that it is \nme.\n  Under this act, CEOs would be required to identify themselves in \ntheir advertisements just like political candidates, and corporations \nand organizations will be required to disclose their political \nexpenditures.\n  All we are asking is, if a corporation spends $35 million on a \npolitical race, they have to disclose that, like elected officials and \neverybody else has to do now. The other thing we say is, if a \ncorporation is going to spend money in a race, the person in charge--\nthe CEO--has to say what every elected official and Federal \nofficeholder has had to say in recent years, since McCain-Feingold--\nthat ``I am Joe Brown and I support this ad.'' Disclosure is exactly \nwhat our friends on the other side of the aisle were supporting.\n  Directors of public companies may still be able to hijack shareholder \nmoney to promote their own narrow interests. But thanks to the DISCLOSE \nAct, shareholders will be able to determine when they have done so.\n  The act will prevent foreign-controlled corporations from secretly \nmanipulating elections by funneling money to front groups to fund last-\nminute attack ads and other anonymous election advertisements. But they \ncan also be 6 months in advance. Last minute is because you don't want \nthem to know you did an ad. They can do it 6 months before the \nelection, and nobody knows who did the ad.\n  If we fail to respond to the threat that the Citizens United decision \nposes to our democracy, then I fear the public confidence in its \ngovernment will continue to erode, precisely when bold congressional \naction is needed. It is not bad enough that the Congress has an \nincredibly low approval rating. You vote for someone because you think \nthey are X, and all the time they are being supported by corporation Y. \nOur ability to meet the Nation's pressing needs depends on our ability \nto earn and maintain the public's trust. That is what we have all \nlearned and know.\n  How do you maintain public trust? To not get involved in this bait \nand switch, where there is an organization saying one thing and it is \ndoing something else. Earning that trust--the trust of the American \npeople--will be all the more difficult in a world in which corporate \nmoney is allowed to drown out the voice of individuals and corrupt the \npolitical process. This is basic to our society and what we believe in. \nThe American people deserve much better. I think it is important that \nwe pass the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I heard what the Senator from Delaware \nsaid. He has been a very valuable member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and of this body itself. We all listen to what he says. He is \nnot saying this out of any sense of what it might do in an election for \nhim, he is retiring this year. We ought to listen to somebody who has \nno stake in this, other than as a citizen who cares what happens to our \ndemocracy. I thank my friend from Delaware for speaking out, as he \nalways does so clearly.\n  We are going to try again this week to take action to help stem the \ntide of corporate influence that was unleashed when, earlier this year, \nfive unelected Supreme Court Justices overturned 100 years of precedent \nin the Citizens United decision. When we last tried to correct this \nprior to the August recess. We brought up the DISCLOSE Act. Republicans \nfilibustered the bill. It never allowed the Senate to even debate the \nlegislation. Many of us argued that without even going to the \nlegislation, we faced real problems, and those have been borne out. We \nhave seen massive\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\ncorporate spending, drowning out the voices of hard-working Americans.\n  I heard somebody say in Vermont: ``Do you mean if you have somebody \nwho is trying to stop counterfeit goods coming from China''--or to use \nanother example, ``trying to stop the flood of toys that have too much \nlead in them that will endanger our children--and you have a Member of \nCongress who goes out and works to tighten the law so they can't do it, \nare you telling me that Chinese company can set up a small corporation \nhere in the United States and spend a fortune to defeat the person who \nis trying to protect our children, to defeat the person who is trying \nto stop lead in toys? And do you mean in defeating the person who is \ntrying to protect our children they could do it without anybody ever \nknowing where the money was coming?'' I said: That is the result of the \nCitizens United decision.\n\n  They could not understand that. But I tell my fellow Vermonters, with \nelection day less than 2 months away, hundreds of millions of dollars \nof corporate interest group funds have been spent or pledged to be \nspent on political advertising and election activities. The American \npeople deserve better than that.\n  We have seen filibusters, once a rarely used part of Senate \nprocedure, become a regular tool for obstruction in the Senate on issue \nafter issue. No matter how much the American people want an issue voted \non, we end up having a filibuster blocking it. That obstruction has led \nto delays in considering legislation meant to protect the American \npeople, as well as an alarming and almost unprecedented rise in \njudicial vacancies because Republicans will not allow votes on judges. \nHere, in an area fundamental to our democracy, it is clear the American \npeople continue paying the price unless Congress takes action. \nAmericans should expect bipartisan support for any legislation designed \nto prevent corporations from taking over elections, corporations from \ndeciding elections, instead of the people who are affected by them.\n  This legislation does that, and I hope the Senators on the other side \nwill stop filibustering this legislation. I cannot help but think on \nthese filibusters--do you know what it is? It allows one to say: I am \ngoing to vote maybe. We were elected and paid to vote yes or no, not \nmaybe. Those who keep using the filibuster to prevent a vote on serious \nmatters can go home and say: That matter has not come up. I have not \nvoted on that. I am on your side, whichever side you are on, because I \nnever voted. I voted maybe. That is what these filibusters are. They \nare voting maybe because you do not have the courage to stand and vote \nyes or no.\n  In Citizens United, five Supreme Court Justices cast aside a century \nof law and opened the floodgates for corporations to drown out \nindividual voices in our elections. Five overruled every law passed by \nCongress or other courts over the years. That broad scope of the \ndecision was unnecessary, it was improper, and it was one of the \ngreatest grasps for power I have ever seen. At the expense of hard-\nworking men and women in this country, the Supreme Court ruled that \ncorporations could become the predominant influence in our elections \nfor years to come. These unelected members of the Supreme Court said: \nWe are going to let corporations decide your elections, not the hard-\nworking men and women who are affected by the elections. We have \nalready seen the consequences. Corporations have injected more money \nthan ever into primary races and now general elections across the \ncountry, and they can do it without ever even saying which corporation \nis emptying their treasuries to do this. We need to at least have some \ntransparency to this new-found access.\n  We have heard from Americans of all political persuasions who express \noverwhelming concern over the impact of the Citizens United decision, \nas the threat it poses to our electoral process is readily apparent. We \nhave a constitutional duty to work to restore a meaningful role for all \nAmericans in the political process. Vote yes or vote no. Be willing to \nstand on one side or the other of the issue, not a filibuster which \nallows you to duck facing responsibilities as a Senator, not a \nfilibuster to a motion to proceed because that is a vote to ignore the \nreal-world impact this decision is already having on our democratic \nprocess. I call on Senators: Have the courage to take a position. Do \nnot vote maybe so you can go back home and say: That issue has not come \nup. Have the courage, have the honesty. Vote yes or no.\n  The DISCLOSE Act is a measure I support to moderate the impact of the \nCitizens United decision. I will vote for it. The DISCLOSE Act will add \ntransparency to the campaign finance laws to help ensure corporations \ncannot abuse their new-found Supreme Court-made Constitutional rights.\n  This legislation will preserve the voices of hard-working Americans \nin the political process by limiting the ability of foreign \ncorporations to influence American elections. Can you imagine a proud \ncountry such as ours, we are willing, because of the decision of five \npeople, to allow foreign corporations to come in and meddle in our \npolitical process? We are going to prohibit corporations from receiving \ntaxpayer money when contributing to elections. Are you going to say to \nthe taxpayers: We are going to tax you, and then we are going to give \nthe money to determine who might give us more taxes? We are going to \nincrease disclosure requirements of corporate contributions, among \nother things.\n  It is hard to overstate the potential for harm in the aftermath of \nthe Citizens United decision. The DISCLOSE Act is necessary to prevent \ncorruption in our political system because the Citizens United decision \nbrings about corruption in our political system. The DISCLOSE Act will \nprotect the credibility of our elections because the Citizens United \ncase diminishes credibility for our elections. If we do not do that, we \nare not going to maintain the trust of the American people. While some \non the other side of the aisle praise the Citizens United decision as a \nvictory for the First Amendment, what they fail to recognize is that \nthese new rights for corporations come at the expense of the free \nspeech rights of all Americans. That much is already clear. There is no \nlonger any doubt that the ability of wealthy corporations to dominate \nall mediums of advertising is quieting the voices of individuals who do \nnot have the deep pockets and the unlimited resources of these \ncorporations.\n  Citizens United is only the latest example of which a thin majority \nof the Supreme Court places its own preferences over the will of hard-\nworking Americans. The campaign finance reforms of the landmark McCain-\nFeingold Act were the product of lengthy debate in Congress as to the \nproper role of corporate money in the electoral process and passed by \nbipartisan majorities.\n  Those laws strengthened the rights of individual voters while \ncarefully preserving the integrity of the political process. But with \nthe stroke of a pen, five Justices--unelected Justices--cast aside \nthose years of deliberation and substituted their own preferences over \nthe will of Congress and the American people.\n  Vermont is a state with a rich tradition of involvement in the \ndemocratic process. We see it in March at our Town Meeting Day. But it \nis also a small state, and it would take so little for a few \ncorporations to outspend all our local candidates--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. Come on. A megacorporation could, in effect, try to \ncontrol all the government of our small state. It is easy to imagine \ncorporate interests flooding the airwaves with election ads and \ntransforming the nature of Vermont campaigning. This is not what \nVermonters expect of their politics. The DISCLOSE Act is the first step \ntoward ensuring Vermonters and all Americans can remain confident that \ntheir voices are going to be heard in the political process, not an \nunseen, unknown corporation with a whole lot of money.\n  The Citizens United decision grants corporations the same \nconstitutional free speech rights as individual Americans. Who could \npossibly have imagined what the Framers of the Constitution would have \nthought of that? Remember the opening words of our Constitution: ``We \nthe People of the United States . . . '' It does not say we the people \nand a few megacorporations of the United States. In the Constitution, \nthe Founders spoke of guaranteeing fundamental rights for the American \npeople, not to corporations, which is\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\nmentioned nowhere in the Constitution. The time is now to ensure our \ncampaign finance laws reflect this important distinction.\n  The American people want their voices heard in the coming election. I \nlook forward to working with all Senators to pass this important \nlegislation to ensure the DISCLOSE Act is enacted into law. At the very \nleast, our constituents deserve a debate in the Senate on this \nlegislation. Have the courage and the honesty to vote yes or no, not to \nhide behind a filibuster and get away with voting maybe. What does that \ndo for their constituents?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak about the same topic \nabout which the senior Senator from Vermont just spoke. We are grateful \nfor his leadership on so many issues but especially those that involve \nthe Judiciary Committee, the committee of which he has been chairman. \nHe has been a great example. I will not try to repeat or replicate his \nmessage but to reinforce what Senator Leahy and others have said \nalready in this debate.\n  For people who do not follow campaigns day to day or even week to \nweek--a lot of people are making a living and struggling through a \ntough economy, so they are not always engaged in day-to-day politics. \nGenerally, the way it works in this country, whether it is a State such \nas Pennsylvania, New York or Vermont or any State in the Union, for the \nmost part, with some exceptions, we have candidates who declare their \ncandidacy for office. They have to file paperwork. They have to fill \nout ethics forms and provide other disclosures as a candidate.\n  Then candidates, as they are running and raising money, have to make \nreports about their donors. That happens all the time in State races \nand in Federal races where someone gives you a contribution of any \nsize, that has to be reported. Some States might have a cutoff below a \ncertain dollar amount.\n  If you are running in an election and someone gives you a \ncontribution of $25,000 or $100,000, people ought to know about that. \nThey ought to know who is funding your campaign.\n  Even in the Federal system, we have limits on contributions. But \nwhile a candidate is running, they file reports that tell the voters \nwho is supporting them. It is a basic foundational principle of the way \nwe run elections.\n  Now we are faced with a situation, because of the Citizens United \ncase, where those basic rules about how candidates are influenced or \nimpacted by contributions, what corporations and entities do in an \nelection--all that is turned on its head.\n  Basically, what this Supreme Court decision means is, you can have a \ncorporate entity--I am not sure there is anyone in America who does not \nthink corporations already have too much influence. Let's set that \naside. They have plenty of influence in elections. Right now any \ncorporation at any time can spend any amount of money they want.\n  We do not have any information, unless the law is changed, about \ntheir donors, who is paying for that influence, who is paying for those \nadvertisements. The corporate entity does not even have to identify \nitself. They can call themselves the XYZ company or XYZ campaign and \ncome in and run ads positively or negatively, for or against, \ncandidates in an unlimited way. It violates the basic rule we have all \noperated under, which is: Sunlight is the best disinfectant. If you \nwant to bring some light to the darkness, especially the darkness that \nwill envelop a lot of campaigns, then I guess you would be in favor of \nnot having a statute passed such as the DISCLOSE Act.\n  It is very simple. Others have gone through it, so I will not walk \nthrough every provision, but one of the first provisions is mandating \nexpanded disclosure and disclaimer requirements for certain \ncommunications by corporations, unions, and certain tax-exempt \norganizations.\n  What is wrong with that? Why shouldn't we have that? For the most \npart, we have had that for years. Now we don't have that due to the \nSupreme Court decision. So we should make sure that is the law again.\n  Second, the legislation would require covered organizations to report \ninformation about their donors and spending for certain independent \nexpenditures and electioneering communications.\n  Why shouldn't someone voting in 2010, or in any year, have \ninformation about the entity that is spending the money, and especially \nthe donors supporting that entity. It is a free country. They can \nexercise their right to free speech, but the idea that it has to be \nshrouded in darkness and secrecy----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Chair.\n  And, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a New York Times article of September 20, 2010, entitled ``Donor \nNames Remain Secret as Rules Shift.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 20, 2010]\n\n                Donor Names Remain Secret as Rules Shift\n\n                  (By Michael Luo and Stephanie Strom)\n\n       Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies would certainly \n     seem to the casual observer to be a political organization: \n     Karl Rove, a political adviser to President George W. Bush, \n     helped raise money for it; the group is run by a cadre of \n     experienced political hands; it has spent millions of dollars \n     on television commercials attacking Democrats in key Senate \n     races across the country.\n       Yet the Republican operatives who created the group earlier \n     this year set it up as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit corporation, so \n     its primary purpose, by law, is not supposed to be political.\n       The rule of thumb, in fact, is that more than 50 percent of \n     a 501(c)(4)'s activities cannot be political. But that has \n     not stopped Crossroads and a raft of other nonprofit advocacy \n     groups like it--mostly on the Republican side, so far--from \n     becoming some of the biggest players in this year's midterm \n     elections, in part because of the anonymity they afford \n     donors, prompting outcries from campaign finance watchdogs.\n       The chances, however, that the flotilla of groups will draw \n     much legal scrutiny for their campaign activities seem slim, \n     because the organizations, which have been growing in \n     popularity as conduits for large, unrestricted donations \n     among both Republicans and Democrats since the 2006 election, \n     fall into something of a regulatory netherworld.\n       Neither the Internal Revenue Service, which has \n     jurisdiction over nonprofits, nor the Federal Election \n     Commission, which regulates the financing of federal races, \n     appears likely to examine them closely, according to campaign \n     finance watchdogs, lawyers who specialize in the field and \n     current and former federal officials.\n       A revamped regulatory landscape this year has elevated the \n     attractiveness to political operatives of groups like \n     Crossroads and others, organized under the auspices of \n     Section 501(c) of the tax code. Unlike so-called 527 \n     political organizations, which can also accept donations of \n     unlimited size, 501(c) groups have the advantage of usually \n     not having to disclose their donors' identity.\n       This is arguably more important than ever after the Supreme \n     Court decision in the Citizens United case earlier this year \n     that eased restrictions on corporate spending on campaigns.\n       Interviews with a half-dozen campaign finance lawyers \n     yielded an anecdotal portrait of corporate political spending \n     since the Citizens United decision. They agreed that most \n     prominent, publicly traded companies are staying on the \n     sidelines.\n       But other companies, mostly privately held, and often small \n     to medium size, are jumping in, mainly on the Republican \n     side. Almost all of them are doing so through 501(c) \n     organizations, as opposed to directly sponsoring \n     advertisements themselves, the lawyers said.\n       ``I can tell you from personal experience, the money's \n     flowing,'' said Michael E. Toner, a former Republican F.E.C. \n     commissioner, now in private practice at the firm Bryan Cave.\n       The growing popularity of the groups is making the gaps in \n     oversight of them increasingly worrisome among those mindful \n     of the influence of money on politics.\n       ``The Supreme Court has completely lifted restrictions on \n     corporate spending on elections,'' said Taylor Lincoln, \n     research director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch, a \n     watchdog group. ``And 501(c) serves as a haven for these \n     front groups to run electioneering ads and keep their donors \n     completely secret.''\n       Almost all of the biggest players among third-party groups, \n     in terms of buying television time in House and Senate races \n     since August, have been 501(c) organizations, and their \n     purchases have heavily favored Republicans, according to data \n     from Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political \n     advertising.\n       They include 501(c)(4) ``social welfare'' organizations, \n     like Crossroads, which has been the top spender on Senate \n     races, and Americans for Prosperity, another pro-Republican \n     group that has been the leader on the House\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\n     side; 501(c)(5) labor unions, which have been supporting \n     Democrats; and 501(c)(6) trade associations, like the United \n     States Chamber of Commerce, which has been spending heavily \n     in support of Republicans.\n       Charities organized under Section 501(c)(3) are largely \n     prohibited from political activity because they offer their \n     donors tax deductibility.\n       Campaign finance watchdogs have raised the most questions \n     about the political activities of the ``social welfare'' \n     organizations. The burden of monitoring such groups falls in \n     large part on the I.R.S. But lawyers, campaign finance \n     watchdogs and former I.R.S. officials say the agency has had \n     little incentive to police the groups because the revenue-\n     collecting potential is small, and because its main function \n     is not to oversee the integrity of elections.\n       The I.R.S. division with oversight of tax-exempt \n     organizations ``is understaffed, underfunded and operating \n     under a tax system designed to collect taxes, not as a \n     regulatory mechanism,'' said Marcus S. Owens, a lawyer who \n     once led that unit and now works for Caplin & Drysdale, a law \n     firm popular with liberals seeking to set up nonprofit \n     groups.\n       In fact, the I.R.S. is unlikely to know that some of these \n     groups exist until well after the election because they are \n     not required to seek the agency's approval until they file \n     their first tax forms--more than a year after they begin \n     activity.\n       ``These groups are popping up like mushrooms after a rain \n     right now, and many of them will be out of business by late \n     November,'' Mr. Owens said. ``Technically, they would have \n     until January 2012 at the earliest to file anything with the \n     I.R.S. It's a farce.''\n       A report by the Treasury Department's inspector general for \n     tax administration this year revealed that the I.R.S. was not \n     even reviewing the required filings of 527 groups, which have \n     increasingly been supplanted by 501(c)(4) organizations.\n       Social welfare nonprofits are permitted to do an unlimited \n     amount of lobbying on issues related to their primary \n     purpose, but there are limits on campaigning for or against \n     specific candidates.\n       I.R.S. officials cautioned that what may seem like \n     political activity to the average lay person might not be \n     considered as such under the agency's legal criteria.\n       ``Federal tax law specifically distinguishes among \n     activities to influence legislation through lobbying, to \n     support or oppose a specific candidate for election and to do \n     general advocacy to influence public opinion on issues,'' \n     said Sarah Hall Ingram, commissioner of the I.R.S. division \n     that oversees nonprofits. As a result, rarely do \n     advertisements by 501(c)(4) groups explicitly call for the \n     election or defeat of candidates. Instead, they typically \n     attack their positions on issues.\n       Steven Law, president of Crossroads GPS, said what \n     distinguished the group from its sister organization, \n     American Crossroads, which is registered with the F.E.C. as a \n     political committee, was that Crossroads GPS was focused over \n     the longer term on advocating on ``a suite of issues that are \n     likely to see some sort of legislative response.'' American \n     Crossroads' efforts are geared toward results in this year's \n     elections, Mr. Law said.\n       Since August, however, Crossroads GPS has spent far more on \n     television advertising on Senate races than American \n     Crossroads, which must disclose its donors.\n       The elections commission could, theoretically, step in and \n     rule that groups like Crossroads GPS should register as \n     political committees, which would force them to disclose \n     their donors. But that is unlikely because of the current \n     make-up of the commission and the regulatory environment, \n     campaign finance lawyers and watchdog groups said. Four out \n     of six commissioners are needed to order an investigation of \n     a group. But the three Republican commissioners are inclined \n     to give these groups leeway.\n       Donald F. McGahn, a Republican commissioner, said the \n     current commission and the way the Republican members, in \n     particular, read the case law, gave such groups ``quite a bit \n     of latitude.''\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Basically, in this article we have a news organization--\namong many--that is saying donor names are being kept secret. The other \nproblem we have, of course, is foreign nationals are coming into the \nUnited States and spending money to influence elections. So this is not \ncomplicated. It is very simple. Either there is going to be sunlight \nand exposure about our elections and who is funding these various \nelections or we are just going to have darkness. I think that injures \nour ability to have free debate in a campaign, and it injures the \nvoter's ability to learn what they expect and should have a right to \nknow about candidates and about those who are influencing candidates.\n  Madam President, we should pass the DISCLOSE Act. At a minimum, we \nshould have a debate on the DISCLOSE Act.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Noziska\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to remember a fallen hero, \nU.S. Army 1LT Mark A. Noziska of Grand Island, NB.\n  Mark was a proud member of the 1st Battalion of the 4th Infantry \nDivision. He was active in and around Kandahar, one of the most \ndangerous areas of Afghanistan. Sadly, Mark was killed on August 30 by \nan improvised explosive device. He had dismounted from a convoy vehicle \nto investigate suspicious activity when he was attacked. But by taking \nthe lead, he likely prevented many more casualties within his platoon. \nHis death is a great loss to our Nation and to my home State of \nNebraska.\n  Mark loved life, he loved the Huskers, and he especially loved the \nArmy. His leadership qualities became apparent early on in his life. He \nwas recognized in Who's Who and selected to represent Nebraska in \nPeople to People while a student at Papillion High School. Before \ngraduating, he was voted Mr. Monarch, a very high honor.\n  Mark enlisted in the National Guard in 2004 and before long was \nselected as the Nebraska Army National Guard Soldier of the Year. He \nsubsequently finished as first runner-up in the Soldier of the Year \nnational competition. Yet Mark had even higher aspirations. He enrolled \nin college and ROTC to become an officer. The University of Nebraska-\nOmaha ROTC Program honored Mark with the Military Order of the Purple \nHeart Medal.\n  After graduating with his college degree, he proceeded to the \nInfantry Officer Basic Course. His family reports that being an officer \nin the U.S. Army was an obvious joy and privilege for him.\n  First Lieutenant Noziska will be remembered as an eager, playful, yet \nvery dedicated young man. His family recalls his lust for life, his \nlove of his favorite football team, the Huskers, and his commitment to \nserving his country. His young nephew longs for Mark's teasing.\n  To Army leadership he was an energetic lieutenant with unlimited \npotential. His decorations and badges earned during his short but \ndistinguished military career speak to his dedication and to his \nbravery: the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal, the NATO Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the \nArmy Service Ribbon, the Army Commendation Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the Army Reserves Component Service Medal, the National \nGuard Individual Achievement Medal, the Adjutant General Outstanding \nUnit Citation, and the Combat Infantry Badge.\n  Today, I join family and friends in mourning the death of their \nbeloved son, their brother, and their friend. May God be with the \nNoziska family and all those who mourn Mark's death and celebrate his \nlife.\n  Mark laid down his life in defense of our freedom and security, and \nour Nation must never forget his sacrifice, just as we remember all of \nthe Nation's fallen heroes. We have not been forced to relive the \nhorror of 9/11 because heroes such as Mark offered their lives to \nprotect us from it. America can never repay them. We are forever \ngrateful.\n  I ask that God be with all those serving in uniform, especially the \nbrave men and women on the front lines of battle. May God bless them \nand their families, and may God bring them home safely.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleagues today to \ndiscuss our elections process and the state of campaign finance. As \neveryone here knows, in January of this year the Supreme Court ruled in \na 5-to-4 decision in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission \nthat the first amendment cannot limit corporate funding of political \nadvertisements in candidates' elections. Effectively, this decision\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\noverturned decades of campaign finance law that limited special \ninterest influence on elections.\n  I am deeply concerned that this ruling is weakening the voice of the \nAmerican people in our elections. Monday the New York Times reported \nthat, since the ruling, many nonprofit advocacy groups have set up \nsister organizations and specially classified themselves under section \n501(c) of the Tax Code. Organizations are using the 501(c) status as a \nloophole to avoid having to disclose their donors' identity.\n  I want America's campaign finance process to be transparent. What do \nI mean by transparent? That the public knows who is paying for the \nmessage and how much. We have to be aware of the influence that money \nhas on politics.\n  In response to the Court's decision, the DISCLOSE Act was introduced \nto mitigate the harmful effects of the Supreme Court's decision in \nCitizens United. The DISCLOSE Act would implement comprehensive \ndisclosure requirements on corporations, unions, and other \norganizations that spend money on Federal election campaigns. This is \ncommon sense. When every one of us here in this Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats, runs for reelection, we have to state in our advertisements \nthat we approved the ad. There is no reason we should not hold \ncorporations and unions to the same standard. By increasing the \ntransparency of campaign spending by these groups, this legislation \nseeks to prevent unregulated corporate power over elections.\n  Under the legislation, the CEOs of corporations, the leaders of \nunions and other organizations would be required to appear on camera \nfor the election advertisements they have funded. The DISCLOSE Act \nwould also require that the top five donors from organizations that pay \nfor campaign advertisements be listed on the screen at the end of the \ntelevision ad.\n  Additionally, the legislation would take steps to eliminate the \ninfluence of foreign corporations on American elections. I believe the \nCourt's decision puts the voices of ordinary Americans at risk of being \ndrowned out by direct corporate spending on elections. America deserves \nopen and transparent elections and that is why I am a cosponsor of the \nDISCLOSE Act. I believe the DISCLOSE Act would ensure that average \nAmerican voters are the ones in charge during elections, not special \ninterest money and not foreign corporations.\n  I can assure you I will continue to do everything within my power and \nwork with my colleagues in the Senate to protect the integrity of the \nelection process. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill join us in this effort.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the many values that make America \nso great is that no matter where we start off from in life we believe \nthat we all deserve to have a shot at the American dream.\n  We all deserve an opportunity to work hard, support our families, and \ngive back to the Nation that has been there for us all of our lives.\n  This is an American value I cherish. It is one I feel very strongly \nwe ought to maintain and strengthen. And it is why I stand here today \nto talk about the DREAM Act, which would help us do exactly that.\n  The amendment we proposed was a narrowly tailored piece of \nlegislation that was developed with Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether.\n  And I was extremely disappointed that Senate Republicans refused to \neven allow us to begin debate on this critical issue.\n  The DREAM Act would give a select group of undocumented students the \nchance to become permanent residents if they came to this country as \nchildren, are long-term U.S. residents, have good moral character, and \nattend college for at least 2 years or enlist in the military.\n  Under this bill, tens of thousands of well-qualified potential \nrecruits would become eligible for military service for the first time.\n  These are young people who love our country and are eager to serve in \nthe Armed Forces during a time of war.\n  And the DREAM Act would add a very strong incentive for them to \nenlist by providing a path to permanent legal status.\n  It would also make qualified students eligible for temporary legal \nimmigration status upon high school graduation, which would lead to \npermanent residency if they attend college.\n  And most importantly, it would allow the young people who want to \ngive back to America an opportunity to do so.\n  This is about our values as a nation.\n  But it is also about real communities. And real people in my home \nState of Washington and across the country.\n  I want to share a few stories I have heard that demonstrate why the \nDREAM Act is so critical.\n  I got a letter from a young man named Carlos, who was brought to the \nUnited States when he was just 2 years old.\n  Carlos' mom went to work every day to provide for her son, but she \nnever told him that he was undocumented.\n  It was only when he wanted to go overseas on a school community \nservice trip that he found out.\n  Carlos excelled academically and helped his family out with money by \nselling hot dogs after school.\n  And by the end of high school, he was student body vice president and \nhad received a scholarship to attend the University of Washington, \nwhere he is scheduled to start this year.\n  Carlos is going to continue selling hot dogs to pay for textbooks, \nand his dream is to go to law school and become a civil rights lawyer \nwhen he graduates.\n  I also heard from Judith, from Tacoma, another undocumented \nimmigrant.\n  Judith recently graduated from high school and she told me that she \ndreams of joining the Navy and serving her country.\n  And I heard from Luis, a junior at Whitworth University in Washington \nState.\n  Luis is excelling at school, but because he is undocumented he has \nbeen unable to apply for work-study programs, internships, or federally \nfunded scholarships.\n  He told me he wants to graduate and give back to the community by \nworking with young people. That is his dream, but he is afraid that his \nstatus will prevent him from achieving that goal.\n  Luis told me he lives in fear of being deported, that the United \nStates is his home, and that he wants nothing more than to be given a \nshot at the American dream.\n  The only way that can happen, the only way any of these young people \ncan get that shot, is if we pass the DREAM Act.\n  The stories I told here today are of just three of the young people \nwhose lives this affects, but I have received hundreds of stories just \nlike theirs.\n  And this issue touches so many more across the country.\n  The amendment we proposed would have allowed us to take a first step \ntoward fixing an immigration system that is clearly broken with real \nsolutions that will help real people.\n  And for me, this is not just about immigration, it is about what type \nof country we want to be.\n  America has long been a beacon of hope for people across the world.\n  And I believe that to keep that beacon bright we need to make sure \nyoung people like Carlos, Judith, and Luis are given a shot at the \nAmerican dream.\n  The dream that was there for me, that is there for my children and \ngrandchild, and that is there for millions of others across this great \ncountry.\n  So once again, I am extremely disappointed that Senate Republicans \nblocked our attempt to begin debate on the legislation this amendment \nwas attached to.\n  I am going to keep fighting for the DREAM Act.\n  And I am going to keep working toward comprehensive immigration \nreform that helps our economy, affords\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nthe opportunities we have offered to generations of immigrants, \nmaintains those great American values that I hold so dear, and improves \nour security.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to floor today to tell a sad, \nsad story of hypocrisy. It is not the first time we have told stories \nof hypocrisy around this Capitol Building, but this one is a \nparticularly sad story of hypocrisy because right now, the ending is \nugly.\n  In America, we like nice endings. This story of hypocrisy has a very \nbad ending. The name of this story is, Who is trying to buy your \ngovernment? There are folks out there right now trying to buy your \ngovernment. The saddest part of this story is that we have no idea who \nthey are. So why is it a story of hypocrisy? Well, we can start with \nhow we got here.\n  I have heard so many times--I cannot count how many times I have \nheard my colleagues in the other party talk about the evils of an \nactivist court: Well, we have to make sure we do not have activist \njudges. Well, no, I am not opposed to this nominee because he is \nappointed by a Democratic President; I am opposed to this nominee \nbecause of activism, evil activism. We have to watch out for activism.\n  So along comes the Citizens United case. If you looked up ``judicial \nactivism'' in a reference book, you would find the title ``Citizens \nUnited.'' This Court went off the tracks. They created precedent out of \nwhole cloth in an effort to turn our democracy into a race for the \nhighest bidder.\n  I think it is hypocritical for people to come before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and be eloquent--because these are all smart \npeople--very eloquent about the evils of judicial activism and then \nproceed to dismantle a system that is all about the public's right to \nknow.\n  There is another part of this that is hypocritical, besides the \nnotion that somehow conservative people are not judicial activists. \nThey are not judicial activists when they are active for something you \nbelieve in. Then it is not activism. In other words, judicial activism \nis in the eye of the beholder. I can think of a lot of Supreme Court \ncases that could back up that assertion.\n  The other thing that is so hypocritical about this is the ridiculous \nnotion that so many people in this body have talked about transparency \nlike it is so near and dear to them. We must have transparency. We must \nhave an open door. We must have sunlight. Let me read a few quotes. \nThis is rich:\n\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expedited . . .\n\n  Think about that term, especially when we realize where it came from.\n\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what \n     is appropriate.\n\n  Good, old-fashioned common sense. That is from the leader of the \nRepublican Party.\n  How about this one:\n\n       I think what we ought to do is we ought to have full \n     disclosure, full disclosure of all the money we raise and how \n     it is spent. And I think that sunlight is the best \n     disinfectant.\n\n  That came from the leader of the Republican Party in the House.\n\n       I think the system needs more transparency so people can \n     more easily reach their own conclusions.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. That comes from the Senator heading up the \nRepublican effort to elect Republican Senators this year.\n  I could go on and on. We have a Supreme Court decision that turns the \nsection of the IRS Code, 501(c), into an open bazaar. What was supposed \nto be not political and not for profit is now a mushrooming industry of \nnonaccountable, unaccountable organizations that nobody has any idea \nwhere they are coming from, who is writing the checks, and what their \nmotivations are. These groups have fallen into a regulatory nirvana. \nThere is no regulation. There is nobody watching. There is nobody \nasking questions.\n  These are social welfare organizations, 501(c)(4)s, like Crossroads, \nwhich is one that sprung up. It has been the top spender. It hasn't \nbeen the Republican committees or the Democratic committees. The top \nspender in the Senate races is a group we have no idea what it is or \nwho is writing the checks.\n  We have to realize they don't even have to file anything with the \ngovernment, with the IRS, until February, March, April. How many people \nthink these organizations are going to be around after November? \nReally? How naive are you? They have to find some excuse, right, \nbecause this is embarrassing that they are blocking our efforts at \nmaking campaign finance contributions transparent?\n  One can't really say: Hey, we are going to change our mind about \ntransparency because we have an election to win and we have a bunch of \nrich people out here who want to write big checks or big corporations \nthat want to write big checks. So what do you do? You try to make it \nabout the big, bad unions. These rules need to apply to unions too.\n  Unions are doing ads right now. They should be saying what unions are \ndoing them. We should know where their money comes from. We do know \nwhere their money comes from. It comes from their members. But we ought \nto know who is doing it. This law requires the same thing of unions \nthat it requires of anyone else writing big checks.\n  Who is going to buy your government? It could be like a game show. We \ncould have a big wheel and spin the wheel and people could guess who is \nbuying the government. I am worried about government contractors. There \nhas been big money in government contracting. I have noticed from \nfirsthand experience that when we start shaking the trees of these \ngovernment contractors, they fight back. As I have tried to clean up \nsome of the contracting messes that have littered the financial \nlandscape of the Federal Government, I have run into an amazing amount \nof resistance from the underground power of these government \ncontractors.\n  Let's look at Blackwater. We know they have created dozens of fake \nnames to do business with the government. Many of them are \nnoncompetitive. Many of them are highly lucrative. They are hiding the \nidentity of their company for purposes of contracting.\n  Can colleagues imagine what they are capable of if they get to write \nchecks to influence elections with nobody knowing it? I am in big \ntrouble. I have gone after a lot of these big contractors. Now I think \nmy picture is probably on a lot of their dart boards. Now they don't \nhave to worry about throwing a dart. They don't have to worry about it. \nAll they have to do is anonymously write big checks. Millions of \ndollars. Write a check for $10 million. Blow out an election in a \nState. Nobody has to know who did it.\n  Foreign interests, yes; the Citizens United case created all kinds of \nloopholes that are actually delineated in the case. They explained the \nloopholes that are being created, if one reads the entire decision, for \nforeign corporations. It is like after that case we have fallen down a \nrabbit hole in terms of everything we should believe in in terms of our \nelection processes.\n  In the old days, they used to have the term, ``the bagman.'' The \nbagman was not exactly a positive term for people. The bagman was the \nguy who was in charge of carrying the money around in a bag. There was \na time in this democracy where they actually did that. Big bags of cash \nwere carried around and delivered to people's desks in every level of \ngovernment in the country. The people in this great democracy rose up \nand said: We want to clean up this mess. We want candidates to have to \nreport how much money they are getting.\n  Some States said: We want to limit how much they are getting. We \nlimit how much we get. I don't know why we are not honest about this. I \ndon't know why they don't just propose an alternative bill that we do \naway with any kind of limits. Frankly, it might be a better tradeoff.\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\n  If somebody put a gun to my head and said: You have to choose. Do you \nwant all the money being spent on campaigns disclosed where it is \ncoming from or do you want limits, I think I would take the disclosure \nbecause I trust the American people. If they know who is paying the \nbill, they can make a good judgment whether they trust what that \ncommercial says or what that mailer says or what that robo call says.\n  Trust is the great intangible around here. We can't do our jobs with \ndignity and with honor if we are hypocrites and if there is not trust. \nDoes anyone imagine that the American people are going to trust us more \nwhen we have open season on elections by the highest bidder?\n  I implore my colleagues, clean up this mess with us. Don't put the \nlast nail in the coffin of bipartisanship. This should be a bipartisan \neffort. One rich guy who has a grudge against you can make unfair \ncommercials and never be held accountable, regardless of whether you \nare a Democrat or a Republican.\n  I am not as offended by the notion that wealthy people can spend \ntheir money however they want as I am by the notion that they can buy \nelections with it and not be held accountable. We have a very wealthy \nguy in St. Louis, Rex Sinquefield, who is spending millions of dollars \ninfluencing elections and issues in Missouri. I kind of admire the guy. \nHe is up front about it. He is not handing checks off to Karl Rove \nsomewhere. He is very up front.\n  Trust is the great intangible. Everyone who blocks the effort to \nrequire full disclosure of money that is being spent on political \ncampaigns does great damage to the most precious commodity we have in \nthis country, and that is the strength of our democracy.\n  I hope the American people, who are pretty cranky right now--and I \nget it; they are upset; they ought to be really mad about this--hold \nevery one of us accountable. If you are not willing to support a bill \nthat will require full disclosure of people who are spending money on \npolitical advertising, then I don't know how seriously we can take \nanything you say you stand for.\n  Let's get the DISCLOSE Act up now. Let's clean up this mess. I \nguarantee my colleagues, it is going to have an ugly ending. This story \nwill not have a good ending unless we change the plot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, ``[c]learly the American public has a \nright to know who is paying for ads and who is attempting to influence \nelections. Sunshine is what the political system needs.''\n\n       We can try and regulate ethical behavior by politicians, \n     but the surest way to cleanse the system is to let the Sun \n     shine in.\n       I don't like it when a large source of money is out there \n     funding ads and is unaccountable.\n       I think the system needs more transparency so people can \n     more easily reach their own conclusions.\n       I support campaign finance reform, but to me that means \n     individual contributions, free speech and full disclosure.\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what \n     is appropriate.\n       The issue is expenditures, expenditures, expenditures; and \n     the real issue, if we really want to do something about \n     campaign finance reform, is disclosure, disclosure, \n     disclosure.\n       Disclosure helps everyone equally to know how their money \n     is spent. . . . Disclosure is what honesty and fairness in \n     politics is all about. Why would anyone fight against \n     disclosure?\n\n  Those are all excellent points. The fact is, they were made by seven \ndifferent Members of this body, all from my friends on the other side \nof the aisle. They were made either on the floor of this body or to the \npress.\n\n  So let there be no doubt, for a long time, disclosure of election \nspending has been a robustly bipartisan issue. But suddenly each of my \nfriends has changed his or her tune. They now oppose legislation called \nthe DISCLOSE Act--disclose, disclosure--the DISCLOSE Act that would \nforce companies, nonprofits, and unions to disclose the money they \nspend in our elections, both to the Federal Election Commission and to \nthe American people.\n  Here is one reason why they may have changed their tune. Thanks to \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, which Senator \nMcCaskill just spoke so eloquently about, corporations today have more \npower to spend in our elections than they have had in our lifetimes. In \nthat decision, the Roberts Court broke with a century of precedent, \noverturned two Federal laws, reversed two of its own decisions, and \nnullified 24 State laws, including a 20-year-old Minnesota law. The \nSupreme Court did all that to allow corporations to spend as much money \nas they want, whenever they want, in our elections and not just Federal \nelections--State elections, county elections, school board elections.\n  Here is another reason my friends have changed their tune: Those \ncorporations are using their newfound power to disproportionately \nbenefit my friends across the aisle. Since August 1, Republican \ninterest groups have outspent Democratic interest groups 5 to 1, and \nthese corporations are funneling millions upon millions of dollars into \nour elections without anyone knowing where that money came from.\n  It is no accident they are so eager to influence elections and to do \nso anonymously. You know why? Because Congress has finally stepped in \nto protect consumers from abuses by big businesses that have been \nallowed for far too long to write their own rules. So big businesses \nare giving money anonymously.\n  Corporations will not spend money on just any election. They are \ngoing to spend it when we, the Congress, try to pass laws that are \ntough on Wall Street or on health insurance companies. They are going \nto spend it when your city council debates whether to allow a new toxic \nwaste dump that wants to come to town. They are going to spend it when \nanyone tries to pass consumer and environmental laws that protect our \nfamilies and our homes. The best part of it is, they do not want anyone \nto know they are doing it.\n  That is why we need the DISCLOSE Act. The DISCLOSE Act will allow \nAmericans to know how and which corporations and unions are trying to \ninfluence elections. The DISCLOSE Act would make sure we do not need a \npermission slip from big business to run our communities.\n  Let me repeat what it will do. First and foremost, the DISCLOSE Act \nis about disclosure; hence, the DISCLOSE Act. That is why it is named \nthat. It will force CEOs, union heads, and leaders of advocacy groups, \nalong with their top contributors, to be identified in the ads they pay \nfor. These same groups, corporations, nonprofits, and unions would be \nrequired to disclose their top donors to the Federal Election \nCommission.\n  If a company has shareholders, they are going to have to disclose \ntheir expenditures to those shareholders in periodic reports and on \ntheir Web sites.\n  Some of my friends across the aisle are saying the DISCLOSE Act is \nnot just about disclosure, it has some other stuff in there. You know \nwhat? They are right. It has a few other things in there. What are \nthey? Well, a prohibition on spending by companies receiving taxpayer \nmoney in the form of major government contracts--the Senator from \nMissouri talked about that as well--or companies that have received \nTARP funds they have yet to pay back.\n  What else? A prohibition on expenditures by companies where a foreign \nindividual or company or nation has a controlling share, as it is \ndefined by Delaware and 30 other States--that is, at it is defined by \n31 of the 32 states that define a controlling share with a number. This \nis a provision I authored and that Senator Schumer included in this \npiece of legislation. This provision will prevent CITGO, owned by \nVenezuela, from using the Citizens United decision to pour money into \nour elections.\n  I welcome the opportunity to debate these provisions. I welcome it. \nSo far, some of my friends will not allow that debate to happen. No \ndebate, and the American people will continue to suffer for it.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to allow debate on this important bill. \nAllow debate on this bill. It is about the future of our democracy. \nAllow debate.\n  Before I conclude, let me quote again a prominent friend on the other \nside of the aisle:\n\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what \n     is appropriate.\n\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\n\n  Let me repeat that: ``Public disclosure of campaign contributions and \nspending should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what is \nappropriate.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we continue to have a discussion about \nwhether there should be a tax increase on Americans and, if so, which \nones. We are not sure whether the Senate is going to vote on one of \nthose propositions before the elections, but there appears still to be \na chance we would do that.\n  I found it of interest that a couple surveys--one of economists and \none of Americans generally--throw more cold water on the idea that we \nshould be raising taxes on any Americans.\n  I wish to report, first of all, a CNBC poll which just came out \ntoday. The headline is ``Most Americans Want All Bush Tax Cuts \nExtended.'' Well, that is another way of saying: We should not raise \ntaxes on any Americans. I will just quote from two lines:\n\n       In the new poll released this week, 55 percent said that \n     ``increasing taxes on any Americans will slow the economy and \n     kill jobs''. . . .Only 40 percent said the Bush-era tax cuts \n     should be canceled for higher earners. . . .\n\n  One other interesting statistic is that the poll showed that ``55 \npercent of Americans said [President] Obama's overall economic plans \nhave made things worse so far.''\n  This poll is consistent with every other we have seen. Most Americans \ndo not believe we should be raising taxes on anyone--on the wealthy, on \nbusinesses, on others, on anyone. I think most of them get the fact \nthat if you start raising taxes, particularly in the middle of a \nrecession, you are going to kill economic recovery and certainly slow \nthe creation of more jobs.\n  Well, that was also the opinion of a group of economists who were \nsurveyed by CNN. They surveyed 31 different economists and had a \nvariety of options. They asked: What should the Senate and the House \ndo? In this survey, 18 of the economists said we should not raise taxes \non anyone--in other words, extend the tax rates that have been in \neffect for the last 10 years for everyone, continue to extend them. \nThere were only three of the economists, incidentally, who said: No, we \nshould differentiate, extend for some but not extend for others. In \nother words, it is OK to go ahead and raise taxes on the so-called \nwealthy.\n  I noted also today that the National Taxpayers Union released a \nletter with 300 economists saying the same thing, that we should not \nraise taxes on anyone. Finally, I noted in comments I made Monday that \nSecretary Geithner had said what we should be doing to preserve jobs in \nAmerica is to promote savings and investment. That is, of course, \nprecisely what we should be doing. Unfortunately, that is exactly the \nopposite of what would happen if we raised the taxes on the so-called \nupper two brackets because that is how small businesses, by and large, \npay their taxes.\n  Fifty percent of the approximately $1 trillion of business income \nwill be reported on returns that have a marginal rate in the top two \nbrackets. That is another way of saying, if you increase the tax in \nthose top two brackets, you are going to dramatically impact small \nbusinesses that create about 25 percent of the total workforce here in \nthe United States.\n  In testimony before the Finance Committee, on which I sit, the former \nDirector of CBO, Doug Holtz-Eakin, testified that an increase in the \ntop effective marginal income tax rate would reduce the probability \nthat a small business entrepreneur would add to his or her payrolls by \nroughly 18 percent. I suggest it may even be more than that.\n\n  What I would like to do is quote from comments from a few small \nbusiness folks as to the effect of the tax increase on them. If the tax \nincrease were to be voted on by this body and the House of \nRepresentatives and adopted into law or if the current tax rate is not \nextended for everyone, here is what a few small business folks say \nwould happen to them. Some of these examples come from the Chamber of \nCommerce, some from the National Federation of Independent Business.\n  For example, Mark Clinton of Decisive Management in Little Rock, AR: \nLast year, he says, he paid about half his business's income back in \ntaxes. He has a small business that meets this threshold I mentioned \nbefore, and he said any tax increase would effectively kill his \nbusiness. I thought it was interesting. He gets frustrated, he said, \nwhen he hears the top-tier tax cuts referred to as tax cuts for ``the \nrich.'' He said:\n\n       These are employers who work hard to balance their budgets \n     and make ends meet. They need money to sustain their \n     businesses. Do you want someone who is broke as your \n     employer? No. You want someone who is able to pay their bills \n     and pay your salary.\n\n  Here is another example of someone who says he would be hurt if his \ntaxes are raised: Jim Murphy, from the firm EST Analytical, in \nCincinnati, OH. If taxes go up above the $250,000 threshold, the bottom \nline of his business will suffer and he will be forced to make serious \nbusiness decisions to make up for the lost income. He just recently \nlifted a pay freeze that has been in place for almost 18 months. His \ncompany suspended the 401(k) contributions at the same time, and that \nlikely will have to continue into the future. So instead of potentially \nhiring more people, he is definitely not going to make any new hires. \nHe said that the threat and uncertainty of health care costs going up \nnext year is also a great concern.\n\n       So instead of purchasing needed capital equipment and \n     generating economic activity for other businesses, I will \n     have to make do with what we have.\n\n  I will just mention a couple more.\n  Ron Hatch of Hatch Furniture in Yankton, SD, said his business, which \nis a furniture store, has struggled. He has seen his business fall by \n25 percent. He had to close one of his two stores. His business is \nheavily dependent on capital, and he says any tax increase would \ninhibit his ability to compete and force him to lay off more workers. \nIf the current tax rates are allowed to expire, he says he might well \nhave to go out of business.\n  Steve Ferree, who owns a Mr. Rooter Plumbing in Gladstone, OR, says \nhe has been lucky his business has been able to survive so far but that \nincreasing his tax rates, the rate at which he pays--just what we are \ntalking about here--would directly impact his business. He would not be \nable to consider hiring a new employee or buying new equipment should \nthe tax hike take effect.\n  There are several from the printing industry. I will just quote from \none.\n  Mike Nobis of JK Creative Printers in Quincy, IL, makes the point \nthat the tax increases hurt his clients which then, in turn, hits him. \nHe talks about the fact that his clients are having to cut back their \nbudgets and that this has had an impact on him. He said that increasing \ntaxes will be especially hard-hitting for his clients. As a result, he \nis going to continue to lose customers, and with that loss of customers \ncombined with the tax increase hitting his own budget, he will be hit \nfrom both sides. The looming tax increase and uncertainty with \nforthcoming health care mandates have left him in a position where he \nis hesitant to take on risks and grow his business.\n  Another example from the printing industry: Frank Goodnight of \nDiversified Graphics in Salisbury, NC. Another from the real estate \nindustry--a lot of examples there--Curt Green from Curt Green & Co. in \nTexarkana, AR.\n  Let me close with two examples that show other indirect effects.\n  Steve Walker from Walker Information in Indianapolis, IN, talks about \none of the indirect consequences of his firm having to pay more in \ntaxes, his small business. It is a family business. He said: We have \nalways taken care to give back to our community in Indianapolis and \ncentral Indiana. Here is a direct quote:\n\n       If Congress increases taxes, it will directly affect the \n     extent of our charitable work, in addition to impacting our \n     company's bottom line. I look at pretax dollars as a pie \n     chart. Right now, Uncle Sam gets 35 percent. If Uncle Sam \n     gets 39.6 percent, then 4.6 percent will come from other \n     uses. For us, those uses are as follows: Reinvest in the \n     business, give to charity, and meet capital obligations.\n       Meeting capital obligations are fixed, so the impact of a \n     tax increase will reduce the amount available for charity \n     first and investment capital second. I have already made \n     plans assuming that some sort of tax increase is coming.\n\n  And he talks about how that will drop his contributions to United \nWay, for example.\n\n[[Page S7328]]\n\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       I think Congress needs to have a much greater appreciation \n     for the direct and indirect consequences a massive tax \n     increase would have on businesses and the communities that we \n     and our employees live and work in.\n\n  Finally, noting a physician who has a business in Chicago, Dr. Herb \nSohn of Strauss Surgical Group makes another point not just about \nmarginal income tax rates but capital gains and dividends as well. \nRemember that these taxes would also be increased under the Democrats' \nproposal. He says that increases in dividends and capital gains taxes \nwill prevent his patient care business from expanding to provide \nquality care to more patients. He talks about having practiced medicine \nsince the early 1970s in the Chicago area. His focus is on his \npatients, but he says:\n\n       Unfortunately, the impending tax increases will impair our \n     ability to focus on patients and their care. The increases in \n     capital gains taxes and dividend tax rates will impact our \n     business, derailing our opportunities to expand our \n     operations.\n\n  Finally, he notes that he is structured as a passthrough entity. And \nthat is how a lot of these small businesses pay their taxes. That is \nwhy they are impacted by an increase in the top two marginal income tax \nrates. He says:\n\n       If Congress increases the marginal income tax rates, that \n     means we will have less money to expand and reinvest in our \n     business, which, again, is focused on patient care.\n\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       I'm not a tax expert, but I do have a straightforward \n     diagnosis on this issue--Congress needs to keep all the tax \n     rates at their current levels and not slap us with a bigger \n     tax bill.\n\n  My point is this: The American people, by a wide margin, believe we \nshould not increase taxes on anyone. Economists, by a wide margin, \nagree. We should not increase taxes on anyone. And the several examples \nof owners of small businesses who would be the first to be impacted by \nan increase in the upper two marginal income tax brackets have made it \nvery clear--every one of them--that it will have a direct impact on \ntheir ability to hire people, to expand their businesses, or to \ncontinue in business, and an indirect impact on the customers they \nserve, who then, in turn, would have less business for these small \nbusinesses.\n  All in all, it is a bad idea to even think about increasing taxes on \nany Americans, let alone small businesses. We should make it clear \nright now that these folks do not have anything to worry about; they \nare not going to be hit with a big tax hike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I had originally anticipated speaking for \n15 minutes. I understand that the speaker intruded into the \nRepublicans' time, for which I do not complain, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed 15 minutes even though the time would \nnormally expire at 3 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate that and the \ncourtesy of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7328-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7328-S7332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have two issues I wish to discuss \ntoday. The first one is one I have spoken about before, which is the \nDISCLOSE Act, which we are going to be voting on probably tomorrow. The \nlast time I talked about the DISCLOSE Act, I raised the issue of the \nfilm that was made in the 2004 campaign by Michael Moore. This was an \neffort, very clearly, on the part of Mr. Moore to influence the \nelection. No one could have seen that film without realizing it was a \nserious attempt to make sure Americans did not vote for President \nGeorge W. Bush.\n  Well, Citizens United, a group that has political views different \nfrom Mr. Moore's, believed that the film violated the law, and they \nfiled a complaint with the Federal Election Commission because they \nsaid it was clearly a political document, not just another movie, and \nit was filmed for the purpose of trying to affect the election.\n  At the time, Michael Moore had this to say about Citizens United and \ntheir complaint:\n\n       That's the difference between our side and their side. Even \n     when we disagree, we are respectful of freedom of speech, but \n     when they disagree, they try to shut you down. Well, it's \n     unAmerican and it's wrong and people are not going to stand \n     for it. People in this country don't like to be told they \n     can't watch something or see something.\n\n  I can argue with Mr. Moore about whether our side really does hate \nfreedom of speech, but the interesting point is that he insisted we \nhave more opportunities to watch rather than less opportunities to \nwatch and that any other position was, to use his term, un-American.\n\n  What did Citizens United do? They decided that rather than fight \nMichael Moore, they would join him, and they made a movie and they ran \nthe movie in the 2008 election. Immediately, they were attacked for \nmaking this movie because, unlike Michael Moore, Citizens United as a \ngroup happens to have a corporate charter. They are a corporation by \ndefinition, and the complaint was, you are entering the campaign and \nviolating the law which says corporations cannot contribute to \npolitical parties.\n  Citizens United took the case all the way to the Supreme Court and \nsaid: But we are not contributing to a political party; we are not \nviolating the law against corporate contributions. We are exercising \nour first amendment right to make a movie and tell people what we \nhappen to think about Hillary Clinton. Their views about Hillary \nClinton were no more generous than Mr. Moore's views about President \nBush.\n  I haven't seen either movie. I don't particularly care to at this \npoint. The issue is, does Citizens United have the same right to \nfreedom of speech that Michael Moore does or is the technicality of the \nfact that Citizens United happens to be a corporation and Michael Moore \nis rich enough to make his movie by himself, without a corporate form \nand without shareholders, mean that he can speak and they cannot? The \nSupreme Court said: No, we won't support that idea, that he can speak \nand they cannot; and as long as they are not making a direct \ncontribution to a party--that would be a violation of the law--they \nhave the right to make a movie and they have the right to distribute \nit.\n  Well, that is what the DISCLOSE Act attempts to do something about. \nWe have heard complaints on this floor: Oh, it is evil and improper for \ncorporations to speak, unless, of course, they happen to be the New \nYork Times corporation--they can speak all they want--or the Washington \nPost corporation. They can speak all they want. But if a group of \ncitizens get together, and they have some shareholders, and say, we \nwant to speak in the political arena, they are told, no, no, no, you \ncan't, except by the Supreme Court, which says, yes, yes, yes, you can. \nThat is why I support the Supreme Court decision.\n  All right. We get the DISCLOSE Act to say that the Supreme Court made \na terrible mistake but we will do everything we can to try to rectify \nthat mistake. We are told over and over again that we are not limiting \ntheir freedom of speech; we are just going for disclosure. Then there \nare all kinds of aspects of the bill that go beyond disclosure, and we \nare treating everybody alike, except for those groups we have carved \nout of the terms of the DISCLOSE Act, so they won't have to comply with \nthe DISCLOSE Act, and those happen to be the kinds of groups whose \nsupport is necessary for the people who voted for this bill in the \nHouse.\n  All right. Let's assume for the sake of argument that there are \nthings in the Supreme Court decision that do need some legislative \nattention. Why, then, don't we have some hearings? Why, then, don't we \nhave the bill open for amendment? I am the ranking member of the Senate \nRules Committee--the committee that would receive the jurisdiction on \nthis bill--and we have not seen it in the Rules Committee. It has not \nbeen referred to committee. There have been no hearings. There has been \nno opportunity for amendment. There has been no opportunity to \nsandpaper some of the rough places and make the bill more acceptable to \npeople who are currently opposed to it. It is simply: It passed the \nHouse in this fashion; let's bring it to the floor of the Senate the \nway it passed in the House and prevent the Senate from having any \nimpact on the way it is worded or structured.\n  So I am going to vote against the DISCLOSE Act for two reasons: No. \n1,\n\n[[Page S7329]]\n\nI happen to believe that the Supreme Court got it right and that \nCitizens United has every bit as much right to produce a movie that \nattacks a political character as Michael Moore does. The technical fact \nthat he does it as an individual should not change the importance of \nthe dialog that should take place in the public square. No. 2, even if \nthe Supreme Court decision does need some kind of legislative fix, it \nshould be handled in regular order. We should have seen it in the Rules \nCommittee. We should have had an opportunity to amend it, to debate it, \nto hear witnesses on it, to question those witnesses and have an \nunderstanding of it. For those two reasons, I intend to vote against \nit.\n\n\n                               Tax Policy\n\n  Turning my attention very quickly to the issue the Senator from \nArizona was discussing which has to do with tax policy, I wish to call \nto the attention of my colleagues an article that appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal on September 21 with respect to capital gains taxation \nand the impact of seeing the capital gains tax rate go up on the \neconomy. The headline of the article is ``Cap Gains Taxation: Less \nMeans More.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the entire article printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will highlight only one portion of this article in the \ninterest of time. It is the point that is made as the final point in \nthe article where it says:\n\n       Higher capital gains taxes will not substantially reduce \n     the deficit.\n\n  They point out--we have all seen it--that the higher the capital \ngains tax goes, many times the lower the capital gains tax revenues. \nWhy is that? Because if you have an investment in a business or a piece \nof real estate and the cost of getting out of that investment is \ninordinately high because of a capital gains tax rate, you won't be as \nmotivated to get your money out of that investment and put it into a \nmore productive one as you would be if the capital gains tax were low.\n  We have all known that. The economic information on that has been \naround for a long time.\n  But there is another aspect to this I want to highlight; that is, the \nimpact on jobs. The figure they use in this article is that if the \ncapital gains tax rate went to zero, the loss to the Treasury, in terms \nof income, would be $23 billion a year. Oh, you may say, that is a lot \nof money. We can't afford to lose $23 billion a year coming into the \nTreasury. What impact would that have on the deficit? We would lose $23 \nbillion a year that we need.\n  All right. Let's assume that the $23 billion comes in. What does this \nadministration propose to do with it? They want to put it in the \nstimulus package to create jobs. They would spend the entire $23 \nbillion as rapidly as it came in. It would go out in a stimulus effort \nto create jobs. The point made in the article is that by not taking in \nthat $23 billion and leaving it in the economy, we are giving the \neconomy itself and those people who are in the business of creating \njobs $23 billion in incentives to create jobs. If I can quote the last \nparagraph:\n\n       A capital gains tax reduction to zero produces new jobs at \n     the cost of $18,000 per worker--far less than might occur \n     from any other proposals.\n\n  In other words, if the government took in the $23 billion, and then \nspent it in incentives to create jobs, they would spend more than \n$18,000 per job than would happen if we simply left that money in the \nhands of the people who know how to create jobs. I am not suggesting a \ncapital gains tax rate of zero, but I am saying let's leave it where it \nis, because it is the most efficient way to create new jobs in this \neconomy, rather than have it come into the government and have the \ngovernment hand it out in ways that are proven to be less effective in \nthe creation of new jobs than the reality of the economy working on its \nown.\n  Those are my two messages, and I appreciate the opportunity of \nsharing them today. No. 1, let's defeat the DISCLOSE Act. No. 2, let's \nleave the tax program where it is, because that is the most efficient \nand effective way to create new jobs, and new jobs is what we want and \nneed in this economy more than anything else.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 21, 2010]\n\n                  Cap Gains Taxation: Less Means More\n\n                            (By Allen Sinai)\n\n       Congress is deliberating on what to do about the ``Bush tax \n     cuts''--the reductions in income, capital gains and dividend \n     taxes legislated in 2001 and 2003--currently set to expire at \n     the end of this year. The recession may officially be over, \n     but what Washington does on tax policy still matters for an \n     economy that's creating very few net new jobs and is stuck \n     with an unacceptably high unemployment rate and record-high \n     federal budget deficits of over 9% of GDP.\n       Capital gains taxation is one area in which lawmakers can \n     help jump-start the economy. Capital gains tax rates for \n     taxpayers in the top four income brackets are set to move \n     higher in a few months. My new study, ``Capital Gains Taxes \n     and the Economy,'' published this week by the American \n     Council for Capital Formation, shows that the net effect of \n     lower capital gains taxation is a significant plus for U.S. \n     macroeconomic performance.\n       The study simulated reductions and increases in capital \n     gains taxes starting in 2011 and extending to 2016 to \n     estimate the effects on economic growth, jobs and \n     unemployment, inflation, savings, the financial markets and \n     debt.\n       Here are a few of the relevant findings:\n       Hiking capital gains tax rates would cause significant \n     damage to the economy. Raising the capital gains tax rate to \n     20%, 28% or 50% from the current 15% would reduce growth in \n     real GDP, raise the unemployment rate and significantly \n     reduce productivity. These losses to the economy outweigh any \n     gains in tax receipts from the increase in the capital gains \n     tax rate.\n       For example, at a 28% capital gains tax rate, economic \n     growth declines 0.1 percentage points per annum and the \n     economy loses about 600,000 jobs yearly. If the capital gains \n     tax rate were increased to 50%, real GDP growth would decline \n     by 0.3 percentage points per year, and there would be 1.6 \n     million fewer jobs created per year. At a 20% capital gains \n     rate compared with the current 15%, real economic growth \n     falls by a little less than 0.1 percentage points per year \n     and jobs decline about 231,000 a year. Smaller increases in \n     the capital gains tax rate have smaller effects on the \n     economy, but the effects are still negative.\n       Lowering capital gains tax rates would help grow the \n     economy and jobs. My study found that when capital gains \n     taxes are reduced to below 15%, the after-tax return on \n     equity rises, stock prices increase, household wealth rises, \n     consumption moves higher, and capital gains can be realized. \n     Capital gains tax receipts to the government increase and \n     household financial conditions improve to provide a healthier \n     basis for future consumer spending.\n       My study also found that a reduction in the capital gains \n     tax rate to 5% from 15% raises real GDP growth by 0.2 \n     percentage points per year, lowers the unemployment rate by \n     0.2 percentage points per year, and increases nonfarm payroll \n     jobs by 711,000 a year. Productivity growth improves 0.3 \n     percentage points a year.\n       Taken to its logical conclusion, moving to a zero capital \n     gains tax rate would have an even bigger effect, increasing \n     growth in real GDP by over 0.2 percentage points per year and \n     approximately 1.3 million additional jobs per year.\n       Higher capital gains taxes will not substantially reduce \n     the deficit. The net impact on the federal budget deficit of \n     a reduction in the capital gains tax rate to 0% is a decline \n     in tax receipts of $23 billion per year after the positive \n     effects of stronger economic growth on payroll, personal and \n     corporate income taxes are taken into account. This is \n     significantly less than the $30 billion per year static \n     revenue loss estimate, which does not include feedback \n     effects. A capital gains tax reduction to 0% produces new \n     jobs at a cost of $18,000 per worker, far less than might \n     occur from many other proposals.\n       The bottom line is that any capital gains tax increase is \n     counterproductive to real economic growth. To the contrary, a \n     reduction in the capital gains tax rate would be a pro-growth \n     fiscal stimulus that creates new jobs and new businesses, \n     funds entrepreneurship, reduces the unemployment rate, \n     increases productivity, and in the long run brings in more \n     payroll taxes. In the case of capital gains taxation, less \n     means more.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about an issue \nthat came up frequently during my townhall meetings in Maryland in \nAugust, and that subject dealt with campaign finance reform and what we \nneed to do to restore public confidence in our election system.\n  I must tell you, there wasn't a single person in Maryland who told me \nthat we needed more special interest corporate spending in elections. \nThere wasn't a single person who told me there is too much disclosure \nof information as to where contributors come from. It was the reverse. \nPeople in\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\nMaryland believe there is too much special interest money in our \ncampaigns. They believe they have a right to know where all campaign \ncontributions and expenditures come from. They want true campaign \nfinance reform.\n  The interesting thing is that we know how difficult it is to pass \ncampaign finance reform legislation. I was part of the Congress that \npassed, in 2002, the bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. It wasn't easy to \nget it done, and it was a bipartisan bill. We made strong headway in \nthat legislation to restrict corporate money. I must tell you, I think \nthe public appreciated the efforts that were made, appreciated that it \nwas bipartisan, and knew we did make progress in limiting what \ncorporations can spend in Federal elections. Corporations can \nparticipate. They can have their employees work for political action \ncommittees. But it is very transparent, open, and it is limited, so \nthat we have some control of the amount of special interest money \ncoming into our Federal elections.\n  Then comes Citizens United, the Supreme Court case that reversed the \nactions of Congress, that reversed the 2002 bipartisan Campaign Reform \nAct. It was a decision--5-to-4--by the Supreme Court, where the so-\ncalled--and I use this term gently--conservative Justices, who, in my \nview are the most judicial activists, reversed precedent and \ncongressional action and expanded what corporations can do in Federal \nelections.\n  I was listening to Senator Bennett talk about how unfair it was that \na documentary was treated differently. Well, as Justice Stevens said in \nthat case:\n\n       Essentially, five justices were unhappy with the limited \n     nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to \n     give themselves an opportunity to change the law. There were \n     principled, narrow paths that a court that was serious about \n     judicial restraint could have taken.\n\n  They could have dealt with the issue Senator Bennett talked about. \nBut, no, instead they opened the door completely for corporations to \nspend money in Federal elections.\n  Let me quote from Public Citizen Congress Watch. Their research \ndirector Taylor Lincoln said:\n\n       The Supreme Court has completely lifted restrictions on \n     corporate spending on elections.\n\n  That is moving in the exact opposite direction the people of this \nNation want us to move in, dealing with campaign finance reform--\nreversing the actions of Congress and indeed their own decisions. This \nwasn't the first time. I can give you a lot of chapter and verse how \nthe so-called, again, judges who are supposed to be conservative have \nbeen judicial activists. They did that in the Lilly Ledbetter case. In \nthat case, they reversed previous precedent and made it virtually \nimpossible for a woman to be able to bring a case based on gender \ndiscrimination in the workforce. We took that Supreme Court decision \nand the Congress did the right thing. We made sure that the intent of \nCongress was carried out. We passed a bill to give gender equity and \nopportunity to bring an effective suit if one is discriminated against \nin the workforce.\n  We need to do the same thing on campaign finance reform. The Supreme \nCourt has acted. I disagree with their decision. Now Congress needs to \nact in order to restore some confidence with the American people. I \napplaud Senator Schumer in his efforts to bring forward legislation--\nthe DISCLOSE Act--and this bill is consistent with the Supreme Court \ndecision. I disagreed with the Supreme Court decision. I don't believe \ncorporations are equal to individuals, as far as spending money and \ncontributing in a campaign. But we will debate that issue on another \nday. That is not what this bill does. It does something I thought \nvirtually every Member in this Congress agreed on, which is that the \npublic has a right to know who is spending money in a campaign--to \ndisclose where you are spending money, where it is coming from.\n  If you, as a candidate for the Senate, put an ad on television, you \nhave to identify that it is your ad. The public has a right to know who \nis responsible for the money being spent on the ad being put on \ntelevision. That is not true under Citizens United. Corporations can \nnow spend money without accepting responsibility for the ad, and \nwithout the public knowing the source of the ad. That is plain wrong. \nWe have an opportunity to correct that, consistent with the Supreme \nCourt decision. This is not about trying to reverse the Supreme Court \ndecision. I would like to do that, but that is not what this is about. \nThis is about making sure the public knows who is spending money in a \ncampaign. I thought everybody agreed on this.\n  Let me quote from the leaders of the Republican Party in the House \nand Senate. Senator McConnell said:\n\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expected so voters can judge for themselves what is \n     appropriate.\n\n  Our Republican leader was right on that.\n  House Republican Leader Boehner said:\n\n       I think what we ought to do is we ought to have full \n     disclosure. I think sunlight is the best disinfectant.\n\n  I can quote lots of Democrats and lots of Republicans. Quite frankly, \nI don't know Members who are against disclosure. Yet some of my \ncolleagues will be voting against it. To me, it is hard to understand \nwhy, when this bill is narrowly focused and its principal objective is \nto make sure voters know who is spending money in an election. Does it \ndo other things? Yes. I didn't think there were objections to the other \nprovisions, such as making sure foreign corporations cannot contribute. \nWell, you know, I thought that is what we all agreed on. Government \ncontractors--restricting what they can do. It is consistent with the \nSupreme Court decision, where eight of the nine Justices acknowledged \nthat it would be OK for Congress to enact legislation concerning \ndisclosure.\n  So I come back to our responsibility. We are not on the Supreme Court \nof the United States. That is not our responsibility. Our \nresponsibility is to enact laws. Our responsibility is to respond to \nthe needs of this Nation, to respond to what our constituents want us \nto do. Quite frankly, our constituents want us to take up campaign \nfinance reform. They want us to do a lot more than just the DISCLOSE \nAct, when it comes to campaign finance reform. I am one of those who \nsupports public financing of campaigns.\n  I think it would be far better for the people of Maryland and this \nNation to have less special interest money financing campaigns. I think \nit would be better to have some public way in which they can know the \ncandidates running. I think we should require our networks to provide \nair time for debates. That is not today's debate, but it is whether we \ncan move the ball forward on campaign financing that makes sense. In \nother words, let's not move backward. Let us do what the Supreme Court \ntold us we can do in regard to corporate spending.\n  Let's do what Members of this body have said we should do, and that \nis require that we disclose the source not only of those who contribute \nto our campaigns but those who spend money on behalf of getting us \nelected or defeated. We have a right, the voter has a right to know \nthat. Those who are responsible for the act should have the courage to \ndisclose the moneys they are spending and take responsibility for the \nads they produce.\n  I could go on with additional information that we have--some of these \norganizations that are organized under the Internal Revenue Code. I can \nshow you that we are not going to be able to have adequate enforcement \nof that. One thing we can do, which I hope we can agree on, is to pass \nthe DISCLOSE Act so the public has the information to judge who is \ngetting involved in our campaigns, and then I hope that Democrats and \nRepublicans can join to make sure the integrity of our election system \nis strengthened.\n  Confidence in government depends upon the people of our Nation \nbelieving that our elections are open and fair. We spend a lot of time \nin other countries making sure their election process is right. We need \nto do a better job here in America. It can start this week by allowing \nus to debate the DISCLOSE Act. Let's not hide behind the filibuster. \nLet's bring it forward and have the debate on the floor, and let us \nrespond to our constituents. They have the right to know who is \nspending money in this election.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n[[Page S7331]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am honored to follow my \ndistinguished colleague from Maryland, who has such great legislative \nand elective experience and speaks with such passion and energy about \nthis issue. I share his concern, and I rise today to speak about a type \nof corruption in the political arena. What type of corruption in the \npolitical arena am I talking about?\n  I am talking about the corrosive and distorting effects of immense \naggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the \ncorporate forum and that have little or no correlation to the public \nsupport for the corporation's political ideas, wealth that can unfairly \ninfluence elections when it is deployed in the form of independent \nexpenditures.\n  Sounds like tough talk to call that a type of corruption in the \npolitical arena and describe it in those terms. But those are not my \nwords. Whose words are they? Those are the words of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. The U.S. Supreme Court said:\n\n       State law grants corporations special advantages--such as \n     limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of \n     the accumulation and distribution of assets--that enhance \n     their ability to attract capital and to deploy their \n     resources in ways that maximize the return on their \n     shareholders' investments.\n\n  That is what they are for, and that is what they should do. But the \nSupreme Court continued:\n\n       These state-created advantages not only allow corporations \n     to play a dominant role in the Nation's economy, but also \n     permit them to use ``resources amassed in the economic \n     marketplace'' to obtain ``an unfair advantage in the \n     political marketplace.''\n\n  That was the law of the United States of America. That law was \nprecedent when our Chief Justice stood before our Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and promised, under his oath before that committee, that he \nwould honor precedent. Not only that precedent, but it relied on \nearlier Supreme Court precedent.\n  This Court, Justice Marshall writing, quoted the Massachusetts \nCitizens for Life decision, a previous Court, and said, as the Court \nexplained in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the political advantage \nof corporations is unfair because ``[t]he resources in the treasury of \na business corporation . . . are not an indication of popular support \nfor the corporation's political ideas. They reflect instead the \neconomically motivated decisions of investors and customers. The \navailability of these resources may make a corporation a formidable \npolitical presence, even though the power of the corporation may be no \nreflection of the power of its ideas.''\n  When Chief Justice Roberts, under oath before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, promised that he would honor the precedent of the United \nStates of America, this was not only precedent, it was precedent within \nprecedent. It was the established law of the United States of America, \nthat corporate expenditure in elections was a type of corruption in the \npolitical arena.\n  But they could not resist. They could not resist, and by a 5-to-4 \ndecision--one of an array of 5-to-4 decisions by which a narrow \npartisan majority of our Supreme Court has taken the law and moved it \nas far as it could--they changed the law of the United States. They \nknocked down this standing precedent in order to open the floodgates of \nAmerican elections to corporate money.\n  Let me interrupt myself for 1 minute. When I say ``moved it as far as \nit could,'' I mean these decisions on these massive issues--issues of \ngreat importance to our country, issues of vast consequence in our \nelections--do not need to be decided 5 to 4. A Court that had a real \ninterest in modesty, in conservatism, could look for a broader majority \nto try to build consensus for the rule that it was announcing. Of \ncourse, if they tried to build that broader consensus, they would not \nbe able to take as big a political leap. This is a Court that over and \nover will take the big political leap at the cost of, I think in the \nlong run, the Court's credibility, but in the short run of building a \nprecedent that has lasting value because it has a significant majority \nbehind it.\n  Other big decisions of the Court--Brown v. Board of Education for \ninstance--were unanimous. Here, once they have their majority, that is \nall--that is enough. Then they are willing to move.\n  Who did they open the floodgates to when they did this? Let's see who \nhas been opposing our bill to try to at least make public what \ncorporations are taking advantage of. Roll Call reported back in July \nthat ``the bulk of corporate outreach on the campaign finance bill''--\nthat is the bill we are trying to get to, trying to correct this \nCitizens United decision, trying to protect our elections from being \nflooded with corporate money--``the bulk of corporate outreach on the \ncampaign finance bill was done primarily by companies based outside the \nUnited States but that have substantial operations here.''\n  That is great. The lobbying on whether corporations get to control \nour elections is being dominated by multinational corporations based \noutside of the United States. American citizens' voices are going to be \ndrowned out by corporate money based on lobbying from corporations that \nare not even American corporations.\n  Roll Call continues: ``According to Senate filings, large \ninternational firms reported lobbying Members--or hiring others to do \nso--on the DISCLOSE Act''--the bill we are on--``in recent months. . . \n.'' They include Sony and Honda. How fortunate for General Motors to \nhave the electoral process controlled by lobbyists for Honda. The \nfinancial firm, UBS, a Swiss bank--that is what we need. The views of a \nSwiss bank are clearly important to American elections and should \ncertainly drive them and, therefore, let the corporate money flow. That \nmakes great sense. A Swedish drugmaker, Novo Nordisk--that is where the \nmoney is behind this.\n  Where does it go? It goes to Karl Rove's group--like he has not \nalready done enough damage to this Republic--American Crossroads, which \nhopes to spend $50 million in this election, according to the New York \nTimes, supported by the American Action Network, which is planning to \nspend $25 million in concert with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which \nis spending $75 million, all reported by the New York Times, along with \nother groups: Americans for Job Security, the American Future Fund.\n  Let me ask, if you see an advertisement on television that slams a \npolitical candidate, that trashes him on some issue, and it is brought \nto you by Americans for Job Security or the American Future Fund, you, \nas a citizen trying to evaluate that advertisement, what information \ndoes that give you? I suggest it does not give you very much \ninformation at all.\n  ExxonMobil could buy American elections. The entire Presidential \nelection between President Obama and Senator McCain, adding up the \nspending on both sides, cost about $1 billion. ExxonMobil makes that \nevery week.\n  These big multinational corporations can drown out American citizens' \nvoices, and it barely makes a dent in their bottom line. They can buy \nAmerican elections through what the Supreme Court said, until this \nactive, radical group on the Supreme Court pushed this decision through \n5 to 4, with the precedent of the United States, was a type of \ncorruption in the political arena. That was the law of the land, not \njust in one decision but repeatedly. Now that can happen, thanks to \nthat decision. And American citizens will be swamped by these big \ncorporations.\n  Is it a coincidence that 85 percent of the spending so far in this \nelection has been on behalf of Republicans? There is a phrase in \npolitics: You are supposed to dance with the guy that brung ya. But I \ntell you what, when you take the oath as a judge, that principle should \nbe dispensed with and discarded. You should take on new duties that go \nbeyond loyalty to any political party.\n  Nevertheless, this Court has opened the corporate floodgates so that \ninternational corporations can come in, drown out American voters, buy \nup American elections, and what was law before, a type of corruption in \nthe political arena and 85 percent of the spending by the big \ncorporations is on behalf of Republicans--I am sure that is just a \ncoincidence.\n  To the contrary, we often hear my colleagues on the other side say: \nUnions do just the same thing. When you see that advertisement on \ntelevision attacking a political candidate, and it says at the bottom--\nlet's pick our most active union, the Service Employees International \nUnion--it says\n\n[[Page S7332]]\n\nService Employees International Union, you have a pretty good idea who \nthat is. You can find them in the phonebook. You probably know somebody \nwho is a member. They are active in the community. It is no mystery. \nBut how about American Future Fund? The way this is set up right now, \nExxonMobile could take its billions of dollars and start laundering \nthat money through shell organizations and shell corporations. By the \ntime the slammer ad gets put on television attacking a political \ncandidate--it could be Americans for Peace and Puppies, as far as we \nknew--and nobody would have the time in the hectic last days before an \nelection to figure out who it is who is really behind these attacks.\n\n  That is no way to run an election. That is no way to run a democracy. \nThat is not transparent. These corporations are not even humans. What \nthey are doing, involved in these elections on this scale, is \nunimaginable. What it does is it amplifies the political voice of CEOs \ndramatically.\n  The great thing about American democracy is that you and I and the \npages who are here, when they are old enough to vote, and the police \nofficers outside and the fellow driving by in the taxicab on \nConstitution Avenue, every American has a vote that counts the same. If \nyou are the CEO of a big corporation, not only can you do your own \npoliticking, but you can take that amassed treasury of wealth with what \nthe Supreme Court called ``the amassing of large treasuries warrants \nthe limit on independent expenditures,'' and you can spend it to push \nyour own views and to drown out your neighbors, your friends, people \nwho oppose you--anyone--with immense amounts of anonymous political \nspending.\n  I do not think that is right. I think that is a mistake. Justice \nStevens had it right in his dissent in the Citizens United case. He \nsaid this:\n\n       At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the \n     common sense of the American people, who have recognized a \n     need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government \n     since the founding, and who have fought against the \n     distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering \n     since the days of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n  Justice Stevens continued:\n\n       It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While \n     American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of \n     the court would have thought that its flaws included a dearth \n     of corporate money in politics.\n\n  So if you want the government of the United States of America--this \ngreat and sovereign Nation, this light of democracy in the darkness of \nthis world, this government of Washington, of Jefferson, of Madison, of \nRoosevelt, of Lincoln--controlled by the same people who brought you a \n30-percent interest rate on your credit card, well, the DISCLOSE Act is \nnot for you because they will not be able to do it anonymously if this \nbill passes.\n  If you want the government of our country controlled by the insurance \ncompanies that took your child off the insurance when he got sick, that \nwouldn't provide coverage because he had a preexisting condition--if \nthose are the people you want controlling the government--you don't \nwant this bill because you want them to be able to fund these anonymous \norganizations with no consequence, with no transparency.\n  If you want our government controlled by the people who brought you \nthe gulf oilspill and who are polluting our atmosphere with carbon day \nin and day out in ways that are changing our world as we watch it, this \nbill ``ain't'' for you because this bill wouldn't allow them to do it \nsneakily, anonymously, unlimitedly.\n  If you want this government controlled by the big corporations that \nare taking American jobs and making the American worker pack up the \nmachinery they have worked on into shipping crates to be shipped \noverseas, where a foreign worker will be hired to make that same \nproduct, which will then be brought back into America--if they are the \nfolks you want controlling our government, anonymously, through money \nand expenditure--the DISCLOSE Act is not for you.\n  But let me tell you, if you are a regular American, who thinks \neverybody should have a fair voice at election time, who doesn't want \nto see our American elections drowned out by lobbyists for \ninternational corporations, by huge corporate expenditures that aren't \neven traceable back to the corporation but that come through phony-\nbaloney organizations with names that sound like ``The Make America \nGreat Foundation''--if that is the kind of politics you want to put an \nend to--if you want to see real issues debated by real people, this \nDISCLOSE Act is important.\n  This isn't just about fairness in one election. This isn't just about \na Supreme Court that handed to one political party a gigantic corporate \ncheckbook that had previously been illegal and tells them: Get out \nthere and spend, it is fine. Get out there and spend anonymously, it is \nfine. If you are an international corporation--if you are not even an \nAmerican company--get out there and spend, we don't mind. Every day we \nmake choices about whether corporations or people are going to have the \nupper hand in this society. Our Supreme Court just gave corporations \nthe upper hand, and we have to fight back because it is not just about \nwho wins this election, this is about a democracy that has been through \nover 200 years of stress and strain. This is about an idea the Founders \nput together that was unheard of at the time. It was radical, it was \nexceptional, and it created a society that has shown a light in this \nworld that is brighter than any other government in the history of \nhumankind.\n  This government has lasted through Civil War and world war, through \ndepression. It has lasted through every kind of stress. Its value is, \nas probably our greatest President said, very simply, that it is a \n``government of the people, by the people, for the people.'' Our \npurpose is that it not perish from this Earth. This is not a government \nof the CEOs, by the big corporations, and for their shareholders. It is \nnot an anonymous government where you don't know who is on the air with \nmillions of dollars in advertisements slamming away. It is not a \ngovernment where a candidate would be embarrassed to have a big \ncorporation on their side that laundered their money through corporate \nscreens so when it finally appeared in the waning days of the race it \nwas all phonied up with a name such as ``Americans For Peace and Love'' \nor whatever the group is going to be called. That is not what America \nis all about.\n  So this may seem like a small issue about reporting of corporate \nexpenditures, but I would submit that when corporations make more in a \nweek than an entire U.S. Presidential election costs and they can throw \nthat kind of money around, there is a lot at stake in trying to make \nsure American elections are honest and honorable ones. To allow the big \ncorporations, even the international corporations, to continue to spend \nunlimited amounts of money in our elections, with no reporting \nrequirement, with the ability to launder through phony-baloney shell \norganizations before people see it, the risk of damage is very great.\n  So I know it is easy for me to say, because the money is coming in 85 \npercent against Democrats and for Republicans, and it looks like this \nis what that is about, but it is not. It is about making sure that a \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people does not \nperish from this Earth.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7332-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, we are having difficult times in this \ncountry, difficult times in my home State of Florida--the highest \nunemployment\n\n[[Page S7333]]\n\nanyone can remember, nearing 12 percent. Florida, unfortunately, is No. \n1 in mortgage foreclosures in the first half of the year; No. 1 in \nbeing behind in its mortgage payments. Our people are struggling. Our \nsmall businesses are struggling. People are struggling to make ends \nmeet. As we face this very difficult time it is natural that the people \nof my State and the people around this country would look to their \nleaders in Washington for help.\n  Certainly government cannot solve all problems. But we here in \ngovernment do not want to make the problems any worse. Right now we are \non the verge of raising taxes on the American people. Tax cuts that \nwere imposed in the last 10 years are set to expire if this Congress \nfails to act by the end of the year. What is this going to mean to the \naverage Floridian, to the average American, if their taxes go up? It \ndepends upon where you find yourself, in terms of how you pay your \ntaxes. We know the tax brackets are going to increase. For example, the \n10-percent tax bracket would disappear and those taxpayers would move \nup to the 15-percent bracket, capturing all those with incomes below \n$34,550. It is not just going to affect the people at the upper end of \nthe tax scheme but it is going to affect everyone. When people are \nhaving a difficult time making ends meet, to have to pay more in taxes \nis exactly the wrong thing to do.\n  Some have said let's extend the tax cuts for those who are in the \nlower brackets and let's increase those who are at the higher brackets. \nThe problem with that is you are again hurting this economy because we \nknow that people who pay in the higher brackets are job creators. In \nfact, many of them are small businesses. In our country, small \nbusinesses often file as if they were individuals. Subchapter S \ncorporations file as if they were individuals. By not continuing these \ntax cuts, by raising taxes in the middle of the recession, as many as \nthree-quarters of a million small businesses in this country would have \ntheir taxes increase.\n  I was talking to some folks in Pensacola last week. The gentleman I \nwas speaking to told me the story of a businessperson who related that \nhe is being laid off at his job. The reason he is being laid off is his \nemployer told him when his taxes go up he is not going to be able to \nafford to keep that employee on. When you raise taxes on small \nbusinesses you hurt job creators, exactly the wrong thing we should be \ndoing in this very difficult time.\n  Instead of tackling issues that could help people get back to work, \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle here are debating a campaign \nissue, a political issue about alleged campaign finance reform. Where \nis the initiative to try to put Americans back to work? Where are the \nofferings from my friends on the other side to get Americans back to \nwork so we can get out of this very difficult economy? We on our side \nhave proposed things such as cutting the payroll tax. If we cut the \npayroll tax 3 percent, every employee in America would get a 3-percent \npay increase. Every employer would have 3 percent more they could use \nto buy a new piece of equipment or hire a new employee. That is the \nkind of policy this government could do to get people back to work.\n  Instead, we passed a $1 trillion health care plan that we found out \ntoday is going to require 80 percent of small businesses to change \ntheir health care offerings--probably more expensive. So that promise, \n``If you liked your health care plan, you can keep it'' is going to \nring hollow. We passed the financial regulation reform bill that is \ncausing people in Florida to wonder whether they should move their \nbusinesses overseas. We passed huge forms of regulation--more \nbureaucracy, more spending. What is it doing to job creation? It is \nfreezing it. When I go home to Florida and talk to businesses, they \nsay: I don't know what government is going to hand me next. I don't \nknow if I hire that 25th or 50th employee if I am now going to be fined \nfor not having the right kind of health care. I don't know what is in \nthat 2,000-page financial regulation bill. I don't know what is in that \n2,000-page health care bill. What does it mean for my small business?\n  We have frozen American business, especially small business, which \ncreates two out of every three jobs in this country, with too much \nbureaucracy, too much spending, too much borrowing, and too much debt.\n  That goes to another important point about my friends on the other \nside of the aisle trying to raise taxes in the middle of a recession. \nThis government does not have a revenue problem. This government has a \nspending problem.\n  I came to the Senate a year ago, appointed to serve the people of \nFlorida, 18.5 million Floridians. When I came to the Senate on \nSeptember 10 of last year our national debt was just shy of $12 \ntrillion--$11.7 trillion. The national debt today is $13.5 trillion. We \nhave gone more than $1.5 trillion in additional debt in 1 year. It took \n200 years for this country to go $1 trillion in debt. Why on Earth \nshould the American people sacrifice more of their hard-earned money to \ngive this body more money it is going to waste?\n  The American people have no confidence that we have any ability in \nCongress to spend their money wisely. They are right about that. That \nis why they are so angry, and they have a right to be angry--another \n$1.5 trillion in debt. These numbers are so enormous it is hard to get \nyour brain around them. A trillion dollars is $1,000 billion. I tell \nfolks when I meet with them, if you took $1 bills and laid them out on \nthe ground, $1 million would cover two football fields; $1 billion \nwould cover Key West, FL--3.4 miles square of $1 bills blanketing the \nground. A trillion dollars would cover Rhode Island--twice. This is an \nenormous amount of money.\n  If you look at the 2009 budget, the 2010 budget, the 2011 budget--\neach one of them is about $1.3 to $1.5 billion in debt. That is more \nthan $4 trillion debt in 3 years.\n  We cannot afford the government we have, let alone the government \nthat some in this Chamber want. We need to do a much better job of \nspending the money we are spending now. But this body does not budget. \nWe go through some procedure that is called budget but what we do is \ntake last year's budget and add to it. No one goes into the agencies of \ngovernment and says, Are these agencies spending their money \nefficiently and effectively? No one checks to see if every dollar spent \nis spent wisely. We are not jealous with the American people's dollars, \nwe just spend them.\n  Most don't know what we spend them on. Most don't know what those \ndollars are for. That is because we do not balance our budget. We do \nnot do what American families do when they sit around the table in a \ndifficult economy and say: You know, we are not going to be able to \ntake that vacation this year; or, You know, maybe our daughter cannot \nhave those piano lesson; or, Maybe we have to put the braces off until \nnext year. The hard decisions Americans are making right now are not \nbeing made in this Chamber. We are spending more and more of your \nmoney, so why on Earth should we take more of your money and give it to \ngovernment when it is not being spent wisely?\n  The next generation's future is in jeopardy. If we continue to spend \nthe way we are spending, the debt and deficit will be out of control. \nRight now we spend $200 billion a year on interest alone--paying for \nthe obligations we should not have incurred in the past. That will turn \nto $900 billion by 2020 when the projected debt for this country will \nbe $25 trillion. My friends, if we are $25 trillion in debt and we are \nspending $900 billion a year in interest payments, this government will \nnot function.\n  This is not just a problem for our kids; this is a problem for us. \nThis problem is going to visit us in the next 2 to 5 years. Washington \ndoes not have a revenue problem. Washington has a spending problem. \nLet's get about the business of getting Americans back to work. If \nAmericans are back to work, there will be more people paying taxes, \nthere will be more revenues. Let's get about the business of balancing \nthe budget and spending money on things that are efficient and \neffective.\n  This body should not budget and spend money every year. We should do \nit every 2 years. My colleague Senator Thune has proposed that. Let's \nspend the other year on oversight making sure your money is spent \nwisely. If we are required to balance the budget, we will actually look \nin these agencies and see if they are spending your money wisely. If we \ndo those two things, we can save America. So let's get about that \nbusiness. Instead of\n\n[[Page S7334]]\n\ntalking about increasing taxes on small business and individuals, let's \ncut the payroll tax. Let's give employees a pay raise and employers a \nchance to hire new employees and buy equipment. Let's pass the free \ntrade agreements with Colombia, with Panama, and South Korea. We know \nthose agreements will create more jobs, especially in a State such as \nFlorida. Why have they not been sent to the Congress for approval? My \nfriends on the other side of the aisle like to talk about job creation, \nbut none of the measures that is coming to the floor of this body, or \nvery few, have anything to do with getting Americans back to work.\n  Today we are missing another opportunity as this body debates alleged \ncampaign finance reform instead of caring about what the American \npeople care about and that is creating jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one reason I am proud to be from the great \nState of Wyoming is that our State is the land of many firsts. We have \nthe first national park, which is Yellowstone National Park. We have \nthe first national monument, which is Devils Tower, and we have the \nfirst national forest, which is the Shoshone National Forest, just to \nname a very few.\n  But another huge milestone and important first for our State is that \nwe were the first State to give women the right to vote. We are \npioneers in more ways than one out West. That is how Wyoming got its \nnickname, the Equality State.\n  I rise to talk about an important anniversary that our country \nrecently celebrated. August 26 was Women's Equality Day, marking the \n90th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote. Of course, that is \n50 years after Wyoming's special vote. We just celebrated 140 years \nsince Louisa Swain became the first woman in the world to vote.\n  When the Wyoming territory was being considered to be a State, we \nwere told to repeal women's right to vote. Our legislators said: No \nthanks. It is not worth that to be a State. Wyoming stood first and, of \ncourse, the rest of the country followed suit five decades later.\n  The ratification of the 19th amendment to our Constitution was a \nlandmark in our need to recognize the voices of women and welcome their \ncontributions to our country. Women have always offered a wealth of \nknowledge and spirit, and the 19th amendment showed our commitment to \ncontinually fight for women's equality.\n  In Wyoming alone, we have been graced by women's accomplishments from \npast to present. Wyoming had the first female justice of the peace in \nthe United States, Esther Hobart Morris. We had the first woman to head \nup the mint. In fact, she is one of the few female statues displayed in \nthe U.S. Capitol today. Wyoming also welcomed the first woman to serve \nas Governor of a U.S. State, Nellie Tayloe Ross.\n  Today, we are continually impacted and influenced by strong women in \nour State. I am honored to serve in Wyoming's congressional delegation \nalongside U.S. Representative Cynthia Lummis, who took the reins from \nher predecessor, Barbara Cubin, and has been a remarkable leader for \nWyoming. She has served Wyoming in a variety of roles, as a lawyer, a \nrancher, a legislator, and State treasurer, now U.S. Representative. \nNow in her role in the House, she continues to do an outstanding job \nserving her constituents and fighting for their interests in Congress.\n  It is clear there is no shortage of women looking to stand and make a \ndifference in this country. I am optimistic that we are continuing down \na path that looks out for women's best interests and seeks to provide \nthem with more and more venues to have their voices heard and resources \nknown.\n  Women serve as a pillar of strength in our country. I am proud to \nrecognize the 140th year of Wyoming women voting, and this 90th \nanniversary of women in the rest of the United States gaining the right \nto vote and look forward to continually welcoming their contributions \nand achievements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.)

The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7334-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7334-S7336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak, as \nmany of my colleagues have today, on the DISCLOSE Act, which is being \nsponsored by Senator Schumer, primarily, and other Members of the \nSenate, to try to fix and make significant adjustments to an area of \nlaw that is very important to many Americans and actually is at the \nbasis of the operation of our democracy.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the floor to express their concern \nabout the importance of fixing this, and the DISCLOSE Act is how many \nof us intend to try to get something fixed that needs to be fixed. No \nmatter if you are a Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, or \nif you are a progressive or a centrist, I think you think it is right \nto be honest. I think that is a principle everybody can agree to, to be \nhonest and to be forthright and to be truthful and to have been \naboveboard.\n  The problem, as you know, with the outcome of the Court case has to \ndo with the way we run our elections. If we do not fix this, we are \ngoing to be in a situation in this democracy where people can spend \nunlimited amounts of money in a secret way. That is the problem. It is \nnot that corporations can do it or labor unions can do it or \nconservatives or liberals, it is that it can be done at all in secret.\n  I do not think Americans want this. I know the people I represent do \nnot want this. They want to have an honest debate. They want to have an \nopen debate. They want people to stand and say: Hi. My name is Joe. My \nname is Jane. This is my position. This is my position. Debate it. Then \npeople can vote. The problem, if we do not fix this Court case, is that \nyou will never know who is saying what, and that is not right.\n  That is akin to walking out into the school yard and getting hit from \nbehind and you do not even know who hit you and no one will tell you. \nHow can you fight someone you do not know? How can you participate in \nsomething like that? So this loophole has to be closed. I think, and \nmost people in my State believe, that elections should be open, should \nbe honest, should be transparent. Corporations can participate, labor \nunions can participate, big companies, small businesses. But you do \nneed to disclose who you are in a report.\n  I have an article from the Washington Post. I wanted to have it blown \nup, but we had difficulty. I will try to explain it, and I will hold it \nup so maybe the cameras can see it. This says in the last cycle in \n2008, 117 entities reported donations, and there were 372 that didn't. \nThat ratio is about one-third reported, and the other two-thirds did \nnot. The trend is going in the wrong direction. More people are \nparticipating but not saying who they are so nobody knows. The report \nfor this year, 2010, is already a ratio of 1 to 6. So we are not even \ninto the end of this election cycle. We are getting close to it. The \nratio is 15 have been reporting, 85 haven't, which means about only 1 \nin 6. It is all becoming secret.\n  I don't think that is right for our people. I think our people should \nknow who is saying what, what money is behind what ad so it helps them \nunderstand better the arguments and why they might be seeing such ads.\n  I have a real problem, and I will give an example. The Presiding \nOfficer may have this problem in Minnesota. We have a big problem in \nLouisiana and Florida with Chinese drywall. This product came in from \nChina, and it is rotten. When people put it in their house, they get \nsick. Their kids get sick. Their copper piping starts rotting. It is \nhorrible. Our people had\n\n[[Page S7335]]\n\ntheir homes flooded, and we had to gut their homes. We didn't have \nenough drywall in the United States so we started needing it so much, \nit came from lots of other places. Some of it is really bad.\n  So a couple of us have a bill that says: Don't send us any more \nrotten Chinese drywall. We are going to try to pass that bill.\n  I think my constituents would like to know, if they see an ad on \ntelevision saying how great drywall is, these ads that say this is a \nfabulous product, tell Senator Landrieu to support this product, I \nthink my constituents would like to know if that is actually the \nChinese drywall company that is behind that product telling them not to \nvote for me because I am trying to protect them from this company. That \nis one example, but I could give 100 examples. I am not saying the \nChinese drywall company that sent us rotten drywall should not \nadvertise, although I don't think foreign companies should be \nadvertising in elections in America. But let's say it was an American \ncompany that sent us this bad drywall. If they want to argue against a \nbill, fine. But at least let people know that is what they are doing. \nIf it is a labor union advocating for something, let people know.\n  That is why I support the Schumer bill. That is why I support the \nDISCLOSE Act. That is why I think most people in Louisiana support it. \nThey might make up their minds, but they would like to know who is \npaying for the ad. That is all this bill does.\n  I know there have been some friends from the other side who have come \ndown and tried to convince the Senate that we don't have to tell \npeople, that we should have all of our elections in secret. I think \ndemocracy is best served when people are educated, intelligent, and \ninformed about all aspects. Let them make their own judgments. We live \nor die by that; we are either in office or we are not.\n  I wished to express my support. I hope we vote on it tomorrow. I wish \nwe could get 60 votes in the Senate. It is mind numbing to me and mind \nboggling that we couldn't have a handful of Republicans stand and say \nthey too believe we should have honest and open elections. It is not \nabout corporate money or union money. It is not about trying to block \ncorporate money or increase union money or block union money and \nincrease corporate money. It is just about disclosing the money from \nwherever it comes and having reasonable limits that are fair to \neveryone. I don't think that is too much to ask. That is basically all \nthis bill does.\n  I support cloture and ending the debate on something we don't have to \ntake that long to understand. It is pretty clear. One is either for \ntransparency or not, for disclosure or not, and we fought fairly for \neveryone.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, when I was home in New Hampshire over \nthe recess, I had the opportunity, as I am sure the Presiding Officer \ndid, to see all of the television ads that are being run by various \ncandidates and special interest groups. Already--again, I am sure this \nis true in Minnesota and it is true across the country--because of the \nCitizens United decision by the Supreme Court, a decision many of my \ncolleagues talked about earlier today, the airwaves in New Hampshire \nwere flooded with ads from essentially anonymous, unaccountable special \ninterests. I think the question we all should ask and certainly voters \nacross this country should ask is, Who is really paying for these ads? \nVoters don't know. Sure, the ads give the special interest groups great \nmom-and-pop, apple pie-sounding names, but voters today have no way of \nknowing who is funding these groups and who is really putting up the \nmoney for these ads.\n  Personally, I think there is too much money being spent on elections \nthese days. During the 1990s when I first ran for election in New \nHampshire for the State senate and then for Governor, in New Hampshire \nwe had a voluntary spending cap law. I think the law worked extremely \nwell in limiting the amount of money candidates could raise and spend. \nUnder our State law, a candidate who didn't want to voluntarily limit \ncampaign spending had to obtain a certain number of signatures from \nvoters or pay a higher fee to get on the ballot. And when that law was \nin effect, almost every candidate chose to abide by the voluntary \nspending limit. That had two very positive effects. First, candidates \ncould spend less time raising money and more time talking to voters \nabout the issues they faced. Second, a candidate needed to rely more on \nvolunteers to help get their message out because they didn't have as \nmuch money to spend on ads and staff. You also became very efficient at \nhow you spent your money--something that I think is helpful when you \nget into elective office. Now, unfortunately, New Hampshire's voluntary \nspending cap law was struck down in a decision very similar to the \nCitizens United Supreme Court decision.\n  When I look back at my three campaigns for the State senate in New \nHampshire, I spent about $20,000 each time. Fast forward to today and \nthe impacts of repealing that law by the Supreme Court in New \nHampshire, and today candidates routinely raise and spend about five \ntimes that much. In my campaigns for Governor, I raised and spent about \n$1.25 million to $1.5 million based on what the campaign spending law \nwas that year. Today, in New Hampshire, serious candidates for Governor \nraise and spend several times that amount.\n  Now, because of the Citizens United decision, we can no longer limit \nthe amount of spending by special interests on Federal elections. But \nwhat we can still do and what we should do is require these anonymous \ngroups to disclose who is funding their ads. That is exactly what the \nDISCLOSE Act does. It also prohibits foreign corporations from spending \nmoney to influence American elections.\n  I think unlimited election spending by anonymous groups and \npotentially foreign corporations poses a real threat to our democracy. \nThis should be a bipartisan issue. For years, it was.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, because I have heard him talk about \nthis, back in 1997 the minority leader said--this is back in 1997, so \nover 10 years ago--that ``public disclosure of campaign contributions \nand spending should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves \nwhat is appropriate.''\n  Then just this spring, even after the Citizens United decision, \nSenator Cornyn, the Senator who is leading the Republicans' election \nefforts, told the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       I think the system needs more transparency so people can \n     more easily reach their own conclusions.\n\n  I agree completely. If all the Senators who are on public record \nsupporting disclosure of campaign contributions voted in support of the \nDISCLOSE Act, we would pass the DISCLOSE Act today by a wide bipartisan \nmargin.\n  I hope, as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle think about \nthe DISCLOSE Act and about what is happening to manipulate our \nelections in this country, that they will join me--and all of us who \nbelieve that the best way to make sure that our democracy remains \nstrong and that we address how money is being spent in elections--in \nsupporting the transparency and the accountability that is available to \nvoters in the DISCLOSE Act.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. President, America has one of the safest and most \nabundant food supplies in the world, but it is not perfect. Foodborne \nillnesses sicken one in every four people every year. Twenty-five \npercent of people get sick from foodborne illnesses every year. As many \nas 5,000 Americans die from food poisoning every year.\n  The bill we are attempting to bring to the floor today is a very \nsimple bill. It will make our food safer. It is a bipartisan bill that \nwas reported out unanimously from the HELP Committee, and there have \nbeen negotiations going on for a long time--months and months.\n  People often think of food poisoning as an upset stomach that goes \naway in a few hours or maybe a day or two. Sometimes that is all it is, \nbut sometimes it is much worse. I have met with families from Nevada \nwho have been seriously sickened by food they have eaten, people who \nhave been hospitalized for weeks and months and a number of whom came \nvery close to dying. In some of these cases, they will deal with the \nresults of their food poisoning for the rest of their lives.\n  One of the little girls I met with is named Rylee Gustafson. She is \nfrom Henderson, NV. This little girl, when she was 9 years old, was \ndoing what her mom asked her to do: eat her salad. The salad had \nspinach in it. E. coli was in there with the spinach. She got so very \nsick. I have seen her on a number of occasions. She is a beautiful \nchild, but she is going to be small all of her life because of that \nillness. She was hospitalized for a long, long time and survived. Three \nothers got E. coli from fresh spinach, and they died. She didn't.\n  I also had the opportunity to meet with the Rivera family in Las \nVegas. Linda Rivera also became sick from E. coli from cookie dough. \nLast October, she was in a coma and on life support, and doctors didn't \nknow if she would survive, but she did. She is still recovering. The \neffects will be with her for the rest of her life. It is food \npoisoning. It will be a long road back to full health for Linda. We \nhope she arrives to that.\n  Last month, there was another big recall. This time, it was eggs \ncontaminated with salmonella. More than 2,000 people have been sickened \nduring this outbreak.\n  The egg recall and stories such as Rylee's and Linda's and their \nfamilies and what they went through illustrate the need for food safety \nlegislation. People in Nevada and across the country are asking for \nthis legislation. They want to know what food they can put on the \nfamily's dinner table, what they can pack in their children's lunches, \nand is it safe.\n  There is no excuse to wait any longer. Our current food safety system \nhasn't been updated in almost a century. It is not keeping up with \ncontaminants that cause these problems, and new ones come along all the \ntime. The FDA doesn't have the authority or resources it needs to keep \nup with the modern advances and expansion in food processing, \nproduction, and marketing.\n  This bill will fix that. The bipartisan bill called the FDA Food \nSafety Modernization Act would improve the system while minimizing the \nregulatory burden.\n  It gives the FDA mandatory recall authority of contaminated foods, \nsets up a system to allow the FDA to keep track of foods so we can find \nout where the contaminated food came from and stop it quickly from \ngetting to grocery stores. It strikes the right balance between \nassuring consumers that food is safe, without overburdening farmers \nwith new regulations. It makes no changes to the current organic \nprogram run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Nothing could be more important than using our time here in these \nwaning days before the election to help our constituents. Nothing \nshould be less controversial than keeping them out of harm's way. So \nlet's move to this commonsense bill and pass it. That is why we are \nhere--to do things to help the American people. This would do that.\n  I also add that the committee has worked very hard. They have \nnegotiated and negotiated and negotiated. They had different versions. \nThey kept moving forward, and finally it was all done. We thought we \nwere going to be able to get this done. But it appears we have one \nperson who doesn't want this bill to pass, and that is unfortunate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by me, following consultation with Senator McConnell, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 247, the FDA Food \nSafety Modernization Act, S. 510, and that when the bill is considered, \nit be under the following limitations: that general debate on the bill \nbe limited to 2 hours, equally divided and controlled between Senators \nHarkin and Enzi or their designees; that the only amendments in order, \nother than the committee-reported substitute, be those listed in this \nagreement, with debate on each of the listed amendments limited to 30 \nminutes, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; further, that when any of the listed amendments are offered for \nconsideration, the reading of the amendments be considered waived, and \nthe amendments not be subject to division: Harkin-Enzi substitute \namendment; Tester amendment regarding small farms and facilities; \nHarkin-Enzi amendment--I add editorially that these are the chairman \nand ranking member of the committee, who are both extremely easy to \nwork with and good legislators--\n  Harkin-Enzi amendment regarding technical and conforming, and that \nonce offered, the technical amendment be considered and agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; Coburn amendment \nregarding offset for cost of bill; Feinstein amendment regarding BPA; \nLeahy amendment regarding criminal penalties; that upon disposition of \nthe listed amendments, the use or yielding back of all time, the \nHarkin-Enzi substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; that the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; and \nthat the bill, as amended, be read the third time and the Senate then \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n  Before the Chair rules, I should have mentioned earlier in my remarks \nthat the person who has been heard on this for months has been Senator \nDurbin. This is something he believes in, as he can come to believe in \nthings so intently. I respect the work he has done on this bill, \nkeeping it always at the front of my attention list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object if the Senator changes the proposed agreement to say that \nthe only amendments in order, other than the committee-reported \nsubstitute, will be these three: Harkin-Enzi substitute amendment, \nwhich is fully offset and has been agreed to by both managers, which \nwill be agreed to as original text for the purpose of further \namendment; the Harkin-Enzi technical amendment; and the Tester \namendment in regard to small farms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the leader so modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that my good friend from Oklahoma \nwould have no amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would not need one because the bill would already be \noffset.\n  Mr. REID. What I say to my friend, I think this is something I would \nlike to take a little time--not a lot of time--to talk to my friends, \nSenators Durbin, Harkin, and Enzi, and see if there is something we can \ndo to move this down the ballfield; if not, we can come back again and \ntalk about this.\n  In light of my friend's request to modify my unanimous consent \nrequest and my inability to intelligently respond to it because it is \nsomething I had not anticipated, I will be happy to withdraw my \nrequest, and I will renew it at a later time if I can come up with \nsomething that is more appropriate.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will modify his \nrequest so I might be recognized following his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have no problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there is nobody in this country who \ndoesn't want our food to be safe. There is no question, we all rely on \nthe intent that the vast majority of food is safe in this country. \nThere is no question that we have some problems with food safety. But \nthe biggest problem we have is in fixing the symptoms of the problem \nrather than the problem itself.\n  I hope America will pay attention to this. Ask yourself why it took \nthe Food and Drug Administration 10 years to give us an egg safety \nstandard and that no oversight committee of either the House or the \nSenate, through the previous 10 years, held an oversight hearing to ask \nwhy it has taken 10 years to get that egg safety standard. It came out \n10 days afterwards, coincidentally, to the salmonella infection we have \nrecently seen.\n  As a practicing physician who has treated Shigella, Salmonella, \nYersinia pestis, Campylobacter, and Listeria monocytogenes, which are \ninfectious gastrointestinal bacterial diseases that can come from food, \nI want it to be safe. What I want more than that is for the \norganization that is supposed to keep it safe to do its job. The \nproblem with this bill, besides it not being paid for, is it doesn't \nfix the real problem.\n  The American public should know, if you go to the grocery store \nanywhere in this country and buy a pepperoni pizza, the FDA is \nresponsible for food safety. But if you buy a cheese pizza, it is the \nUSDA. How does that make any sense to anybody in America?\n  What happened on the farms in Iowa, as far as eggs, is the USDA knew \nthere was a problem, but they didn't tell the FDA because the FDA is \nonly responsible for the egg once it gets out of the chicken. Which \ncame first, the chicken or the egg? It was then shipped and was the \nresponsibility of the FDA.\n  This bill doesn't address any of those problems. As we look to solve \na very critical and real problem--and I acknowledge Senator Durbin's \nwork on this and that of our chairman and ranking member. I had a staff \nmember at every meeting they had raising these same objections. We now \nhave a bill that will cost the American public $1.5 billion over the \nnext 5 years that doesn't fix the real problem.\n  The real problem is the lack of focus of the agencies to do their \njob. It does not eliminate the crossover and lack of consistency. If \nyou buy red meat in the store, you only have to trust one agency. But \nif you buy an egg, you have to trust two. If you buy a salad or \nlettuce, you have to trust two. They are not talking to one another. \nThere is nothing in this bill that makes them do that.\n  What we have done is we have created a lot of new regulations, with a \nlot of money, without solving the real problem. The only way we get to \nthe real problem is to have the FDA up here once a week for the next 4 \nweeks and have the USDA up here once a week for the next 4 weeks, \ntalking about these critical crossover issues.\n\n  In the bill, it actually states that nothing in this act or an \namendment made by this act shall be construed to alter the jurisdiction \nbetween the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. In other words, there is a prohibition to alter the \nresponsibility so we might have safe food--in other words, to hold one \nagency accountable, rather than two so one can point the finger at the \nother. We had a House hearing today on the egg recall, and the fact is \nthat is what happened. USDA knew there were problems. But the FDA \ndidn't know there were problems until after somebody got sick.\n  So we create a high level of additional regulation, a high level of \nvarious inspections--and I am not against inspections. I eat salad like \nthe rest of us. Sometimes I am not accused of being human, but, in \nfact, I consume the same food everybody else does. I don't want to get \nsick from it. But we can't continue to pass bills that pile on \nregulations that cost the American people $1.5 billion and don't fix \nthe real problem. That is the problem. My objection is it is not paid \nfor.\n  I will hear the objection that it is an authorizing bill. Oh, really. \nIt is just an authorizing bill. So that means there is not any money \ngoing to be spent? Then we aren't passing the bill to do what we want \nit to do. Because if we say we are not responsible for spending another \n$1.5 billion, then there is no problem. It is not spending money. If it \nis not spending money, it is not going to do anything. But if it is \nspending money, we ought to decrease the priority somewhere else within \nthe waste of the USDA--which there are billions--and within the FDA, \nwhich has tons of properties they are not using that could pay for this \nbill easily. We ought to eliminate the things that are not working.\n  So I want our food to be safe. As a practicing physician, I know the \npublic health aspects of this bill. But I refuse to go forward when we \ncontinue to make the same mistakes that have given us a $1.4 trillion \ndeficit and have given us lack of control and oversight of the \nbureaucracies. The biggest thing is, we are not holding anybody \naccountable for this because we will pass this. Then, the next time \nthere is a food problem, in terms of contaminated food, we will pass \nsomething else. In between times, there will not be the first oversight \nhearing to say: What did we do that didn't work and show us a result \nthat works. Is it efficient, effective, and did it improve the safety \nof the food? We will not do that. We will just react and pass another \nbill.\n  I am through passing bills that don't solve the real problems. I am \nthrough spending the next two generations' money, when we can't make \nthe priority choices. The fact that we have refused to say we are going \nto eliminate something that is very low priority to be able to have a \nfood safety bill, then that tells the American people we are not up to \nthe task of getting us out of our problems.\n  I know everybody in this body wants safe food--even me. I am not \ntired of taking the hits for holding up this bill. We can't be perfect \non food, but we can be a whole lot better. This bill can solve some of \nthe problems, but it is not complete. It hasn't looked at the levels it \nneeds to straighten out the bureaucracy on food safety. It hasn't \neliminated the overlap. Nobody with any common sense says you will have \npizzas in the grocery store, one controlled by the USDA and one by the \nFDA.\n  It is clueless. It does not fit. The reason the one that does not \nhave any meat on it is controlled by the FDA is because it has a milk \nproduct. It has cheese. But the one that has pepperoni on it has cheese \ntoo. How did we get there? Where are we going to establish \nresponsibility and accountability with the agencies that are \nresponsible for food safety?\n  I look forward to working with the majority leader. I will take a \nless than perfect bill anytime. But I will not take a bill that is not \npaid for and does not come out of the hides of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suppose we reflect on that and \nthink the American dream is about a time the American people have a job \nthat pays well, a job with security, a career with a growth ladder to \nit, a family, a home, living in a nice community, living on a safe \nstreet--the American dream.\n  We look at the history of this country and discover that beginning \nearly in the last century, we started changing things in America--\nlifting up people, doing a whole series of things to develop a group of \nmiddle-income Americans. We have been enormously successful, perhaps \nmore than any other country in the world. We expanded a middle class.\n  Now things are changing, and we see that people are upset, nervous, \nand in some cases angry. We see reports that they worry their children \nwill not have it as good as they have it. They worry about the future.\n  What is at the root of all of that, and what can we do about all of \nthat? Everyone wants to do well. All of us have hopes and aspirations \nfor ourselves, our children, our families--the American\n\n[[Page S7338]]\n\ndream. Someone once asked J. Paul Getty: How is it that you can be \nsuccessful? Give me the elements of success.\n  He said: It is very simple. No. 1, go to school and get the best \neducation you can get. No. 2, get a good job and work really hard. And, \nNo. 3, strike oil. That is the advice of J. Paul Getty.\n  I suppose that works if you are J. Paul Getty. But his advice, of \ncourse, makes a lot of sense on the first two points: get the best \neducation you can and get a job and do well, work hard.\n  The problem is today, in late September of 2010, a lot of people woke \nup this morning without a job and cannot find one. It is estimated \nthere are about 20 million Americans this morning who woke up \nunemployed. Most of them put on their clothes and went out looking for \nwork, a triumph perhaps of hope over experience because many of them \nhave tried for a long while and have not been able to find a job. And \nthey are very worried there may not be a job for them in the future.\n  We had 2.1 million workers in the past two years having to leave \nmanufacturing plants, losing their jobs as manufacturing workers. Those \nare often the very good jobs. They pay well with good benefits, in most \ncases. Mr. President, 2.1 million of them have lost their manufacturing \njobs in the last 2 years; more than 5 million have lost their jobs \nsince 2000.\n  What do we do about that? What can we tell the American people when \nthey see their neighbors, their friends, and their relatives searching \nfor a job, having been laid off from somewhere they worked for 15, 20, \n25 years? Then they read in the paper that in Stanleytown, VA, a \ncompany was started by a man named Thomas Stanley, a young dairy farmer \nin southern Virginia, who decided he wanted to create furniture that \nwas of superior craftsmanship and affordable still, so he started \nmaking furniture. It became Stanleytown, and he employed highly skilled \ncraftsmen, 1,300 people who carried on his vision at a manufacturing \nplant of 1.7 million square feet.\n  Then those who make Stanley furniture woke up a couple months ago and \nread this in the paper:\n\n       Stanley Furniture's decision to close its plant in the \n     small town that bears its name fell like a hammer blow on \n     southern Virginia and resounded across an industry \n     increasingly moving overseas. More than 500 employees will \n     lose their jobs this year as the manufacturer shuts down its \n     Stanleytown, VA, plant, where the company has made furniture \n     since 1944.\n\n  Where is it going? It is going to Asia. Those 500 people--I do not \nknow their names. I cannot tell you who they are. I would not recognize \ntheir faces because I do not know any of them. But I am sure those 500 \npeople are paying an enormous price in their lives for having lost jobs \nat a plant in a company that produced a product about which they cared \nvery deeply. Gone to Asia. Why? Were these bad workers? Did they decide \nit was a job, but just a job, so they were going to loaf all day and \nnot do their work? No, it was not that at all. In search of low wages, \nthis company decided: We are going to Asia to produce this furniture.\n  I mention Stanley Furniture. The other day I mentioned a furniture \ncompany from Pennsylvania because I had just been to Philadelphia--\nPennsylvania House Furniture. It has a very similar story in many ways. \nPennsylvania House Furniture, made for a century in Pennsylvania, upper \nlevel furniture, fine furniture made by craftsmen, one day it was \npurchased by La-Z-Boy, and La-Z-Boy decided: We do not want to make \nPennsylvania House Furniture in Pennsylvania. We want to take the \nPennsylvania wood and ship it to China, have them put it together, and \nship it back to America to be sold. They told all the workers: You are \ndone. It is over. The plant is closed.\n  On the last product of the day, on the last day at work, these \ncraftsmen who made this fine furniture for Pennsylvania House Furniture \nturned over the last cabinet that came down the line, the last one they \nhad made, and they all signed their names--proud craftsmen working for \na company that existed over 100 years, the last piece of furniture ever \nto be made with American hands. Jobs gone.\n  The list is endless. This is not a short list. Hershey chocolates, \nYork peppermint patties: ``The cool refreshing taste of mint dipped in \ndark chocolate will take you miles away.'' In fact, it will take you so \nfar away it will take you to Mexico because that is where they moved \nthose jobs when they shut down the mint Hershey's plant in the United \nStates of America. It will take you miles away. It certainly took away \nthe jobs of those who were working there.\n  I am not going to go through all these charts because I have done it \nbefore. I know what repetition means around this place. But I want to \ntalk just for a moment about the consequences of this to a lot of \npeople whose names we do not know and faces we would not recognize but \nwho are living as victims of something they cannot control. That is the \nerosion of America's manufacturing base with jobs shipped overseas \nwholesale and the hollowing out of America's manufacturing capability.\n  Why does that matter? No. 1, because a lot of people are losing jobs \nwho need jobs in this country. And, No. 2, this country will not remain \na world economic power unless we have a world-class manufacturing \ncapability. That is just a fact.\n  The question is, When will we stand up for this issue and decide we \nhave to do something about the export of American jobs?\n  Paul Craig Roberts--I have met him--former Assistant Treasury \nSecretary under President Reagan said:\n\n       Outsourcing--\n\n  He means outsourcing of jobs--\n\n     is rapidly eroding America's superpower status. Only fools \n     will continue clinging to the premise that outsourcing is \n     good for America.\n\n  Another quote, if I may, from Dr. Paul Craig Roberts:\n\n       In order to penetrate and serve foreign markets, U.S. \n     corporations need overseas operations . . . However, many \n     U.S. companies use foreign labor to manufacture abroad the \n     products they sell in American markets. If Henry Ford had \n     used Indian, Chinese and Mexican workers to manufacture his \n     cars, Indians, Chinese and Mexicans could possibly have \n     purchased the Fords but not Americans.\n\n  Because they would not have had the jobs. Pretty prescient. Pretty \ninteresting.\n  This is a chart that shows Stanley Furniture's workers in the \nmanufacturing plant. But, of course, that was then, and now it has gone \nto Asia.\n  I want to show this picture only because the Los Angeles Times needs \nto know this. I spoke of this subject some while ago and showed a \npicture of the dancing grapes that represented the advertising campaign \nfor Fruit of the Loom underwear. They left America and are produced \nelsewhere. The Los Angeles Times wrote a piece saying I was on the \nfloor of the Senate talking about underwear, not describing that I was \ntalking about trade and the movement of jobs overseas. If they write \nabout it again, they might mention I was talking about jobs moved \noverseas that were performed by American workers to produce Fruit of \nthe Loom.\n\n  I have described often Radio Flyer--a little red wagon made in \nIllinois for over 100 years by an immigrant who put together a \ncompany--that almost every child has experienced. Almost every American \nchild has ridden in a Radio Flyer little red wagon. But they are not \nmade in America anymore. They have gone to China.\n  Huffy bicycles, gone to China; left Ohio, gone to China. Not made for \n$11 an hour by an Ohio worker, as was the case, but made now by Chinese \nworkers who make 50 cents an hour, working 7 days a week, 12 to 14 \nhours a day.\n  I have often mentioned, and will mention again, that all of these \nfolks, on the last day of work, when they walked out to the parking \nlots after having been fired so their jobs could be moved to China, \nleft pairs of empty shoes in the parking lots saying: Yes, you can move \nour jobs, but you will never replace us. They are never going to \nreplace these workers.\n  This represents a photograph of a company called HMC. Not everybody \nis moving overseas. There are some manufacturers--and I want to pay \nattention to what the owner of HMC said recently. They make high-tech \ngearboxes, high-tech machinery. HMC--made in America and enormously \nproud of it.\n  Let me mention what the president and CEO of HMC said:\n\n       Offshoring in search of higher profits is a mistake . . . \n     because it ignores manufacturing's larger purpose in U.S. \n     society.\n\n  This is from the CEO of an American manufacturer. Further he says:\n\n\n[[Page S7339]]\n\n\n       It's my belief that every American citizen, not only me, \n     should feel strongly about maintaining one of the most \n     important cultures we have, and that is manufacturing.\n\n  Good for Mr. Robert Smith, wherever he is. Good for Mr. Smith, \npresident and CEO of HMC, believing that manufacturing is important in \nthis country.\n  What does all this mean? Our economy is in some significant trouble \nfor a couple of reasons. No. 1, for about a decade and a half or two \ndecades, we have pursued a different trade strategy--a trade strategy \nin which we have refused to stand up for our economic interests.\n  For the first 25 or 30 years after the Second World War, it was just \nunderstood that we were the biggest, the best, the strongest--we were \nAmerican. Whether it was trade competition or any other competition, we \ncould beat anybody in this world with one hand tied behind our back. \nMuch of what was imported were trinkets that were inexpensive trinkets \nthat were pretty worthless. We made products that were made in America, \nproducts that lasted, products that worked, products on which you could \ncount.\n  But in the second period following that first quarter century after \nthe Second World War, things have changed. We have largely had \nconcessional trade practices. It used to be we just did outright \nforeign aid to help other countries. Not anymore. We have for the last \n20 years or so done concessional trade practices to help other \ncountries. We have said: We will do a trade agreement with you that is \nunfair to us because we are bigger and stronger and better than you \nare. So here is a trade agreement. We have done that time after time. \nTherefore, we now have very large trade deficits.\n  Let me show the consequences of a trade agreement.\n  We have trade agreements with Korea. Here is the issue of automobiles \nwith Korea. Last year, because we had a deep recession, we were not \nbuying as many cars. Last year the Koreans put on boats and sent to \nthis country 467,000 cars made in Korea--467,000 Korean cars. Those are \nKoreans who go to work in the morning to a job. They are making cars. \nThey are pleased as punch they make cars because they sell them in \nDetroit, Bismarck, and Denver.\n  Here is what we were able to sell in Korea: not 467,000 cars, Korea \nallowed us to send 6,000 cars to Korea.\n  One might say: Is that an accident? Of course, it is not. It is \nexactly what the Korean Government wanted. They want the jobs in their \ncountry. They want to make the cars in their country and send them \nhere, and they do not want our workers making cars we send to Korea.\n  If you wonder about that, I have another chart that shows what you \nwill confront on the roads in South Korea. If you drive down the road \nin South Korea, what you will see are a lot of vehicles, and you will \nsee almost no foreign vehicles. Ninety-eight percent of the cars on the \nroad in Korea are made there. They are made and manufactured in that \ncountry. Now, is that an accident? That is exactly what the Korean \nGovernment wants. They do not want foreign cars, and they do all kinds \nof things to keep them out. They want jobs for their people.\n\n  So we now have a trade agreement with Korea that we have not yet \nratified or voted on in the Senate, and they didn't address the \nautomobile issue. It is unbelievable to me. Why would they do that? How \nabout standing up for our interests, for our workers?\n  So, Mr. President, the reason I came to the floor of the Senate is \nthat there is now on the calendar a piece of legislation that would at \nleast begin the process of trying to even up some of the trade issues. \nWe actually, strangely enough, give a tax benefit for U.S. companies \nwho decide they are tired of manufacturing in America. If a company \nsays: Let's get rid of those workers. Let's lock up that manufacturing \nplant. Let's send the jobs to Senshen, China, and manufacture there. \nThen we will ship those bicycles and wagons and trailers and trucks and \ngarage door openers back, and we will sell them to Americans. That is \nwhat we will do. And our country says: You know what. That would be \ngood. Why don't you do that--fire your workers, get rid of your \nmanufacturing plant, go to China, and I tell you what we will do. We \nwill give you a tax break for doing it.\n  We have voted four times in the Senate to eliminate that tax break. I \nhave offered that piece of legislation four times. On all four \noccasions I have lost the vote. We are now about to vote again in the \ncoming days. Maybe at last--at long last--when 20 million Americans \ncan't find work, maybe we will see if we plug the drain just a bit on \nthese jobs that are moving out of this country at a rapid pace to be \nlocated in low-wage countries around the rest of the world. Maybe now \nis the time. Maybe people here will say: You know whose interests I \nstand up for? The workers in my State, American workers, people who are \nproducing good products that say made in America.\n  When I speak this way, there are some who will say: Well, you are \nbeing a protectionist. You want to change things. You are being a \nprotectionist. You are a xenophobic isolationist stooge. You don't get \nit at all. It is a new world order. We have all these countries who can \ndo things cheaper than we can do them, and you don't seem to understand \nthat. So you are just a protectionist.\n  Well, let me plead guilty to wanting to protect our country's \neconomic interest. I would hope every desk in this Chamber would be \noccupied by someone with similar instincts and wanting to stand up and \nprotect the economic interests in this country.\n  I am not interested in withdrawing from the world. I am saying, \nhowever, that after a long struggle and doing the things that are \nnecessary to improve things, as we have done in the struggle for \nworkers' rights, the struggle for safe workplaces--and people were \nkilled over those struggles. I described in the first book I wrote \nabout James Fyler who was shot 54 times. You know why he was shot 54 \ntimes in Ludlow, CO? Because he believed people who went underground \nand dug for coal ought to be able to work in a safe workplace and be \npaid a decent wage, and for that he was killed.\n  We have struggled for a century to raise standards, to get safe \nworkplaces and decent wages. Now, all of a sudden we are told it is a \nnew world order. We should compete with workers who are going to work 7 \ndays a week, 12 to 14 hours a day, for 50 cents an hour. If we can't \ncompete with that, tough luck.\n  That is what they told all the folks at Huffy bicycles. They said: If \nyou can't compete with the Chinese prices, you are out of luck because \nthat is our standard. The list is endless. Just about every kid has \nplayed with Etch A Sketch. Everybody knows what Etch A Sketch is, a toy \nmade in America. It was the principal employer of a town in this \ncountry. But no more. Walmart told Etch A Sketch: You won't be \nmarketing at Walmart unless you meet this price, and Etch A Sketch has \ngone to China. All those people who were proud of making a children's \ntoy are now not working.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I have been listening with fascination to the \nSenator's speech because there is nobody who comes to the floor and \nbetter explains jobs, trade, trade policy, and tax policy and what it \ndoes to our communities and our workers.\n  The Senator mentioned two very well known American companies, and \nboth happen to be from my State--Huffy bicycles and Etch A Sketch, \nwhich is a company called Ohio Art in Bryan, OH. That is exactly what \nhappened. Walmart came to Ohio Art and said: We want to sell Etch A \nSketch for less money than we are selling it for now. So they had no \nchoice.\n  But let me ask the Senator, it seems to me that there has not been \nanytime in recent history where U.S. companies have put their business \nplans together in this way: Instead of manufacturing something, cutting \ncosts, and treating their workers decently and contributing to the \ncommunity--which American companies have done for generations and is \nwhy we have such a strong middle class--it seems that the business plan \nfor so many large American companies is to move their production \noffshore, obviously getting less expensive labor, avoiding \nenvironmental and worker safety rules, and then selling the product--\nwell, first lobbying Congress to change the rules, as they did with \nPNTR for China, but moving their\n\n[[Page S7340]]\n\nproduction out of the country, offshore, producing it, and then selling \nit back into the home country.\n  That is a curious business plan that many American companies follow. \nI hear those companies say to me: Well, we have no choice but to go \noffshore for the cheapest production because our competitors are doing \nthat, even though they lobbied Congress to help change the rules. I \nmean, it is a bit cynical but a curious business plan that you leave \nbehind the community that built you up and you move somewhere else and \nthen you sell the products back to the country in which you were \nfounded.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say to the Senator from Ohio that it is a \nbusiness plan these days for too many companies. Not all, but too many. \nThere are some companies--and I just described a company, a CEO, and I \nwas giving him credit because what he said is important--a company \ncalled HMC. It is a company that manufactures very high-tech products \nin this country. He says:\n\n       It's my belief that every American citizen, not only me, \n     should feel strongly about maintaining one of the most \n     important cultures we have, and that is manufacturing.\n\n  The fact is, we are in a situation where a lot of companies have \ndecided they would like to produce elsewhere, hire other workers, but \nthey would like American consumers to buy their products. The question \nin the longer term is, Who is going to buy those products if American \nconsumers don't have jobs? I mean, that is the question.\n  I have talked a little about China. I am chairman of the \nCongressional Executive Commission on China, and I just chaired a \nhearing for 2 hours about the issue of piracy and counterfeiting and so \non in China. One of our witnesses described something I had written \nabout in my book as well; that is, American businesses should know \ntheir intellectual property is not secure in China. It will be stolen.\n  I am not a big fan of them--in fact, I have fought the pharmaceutical \ncompany pretty tough on the floor of the Senate--but Viagra, made by \nPfizer, was quickly reengineered in China and just sold without any \nrespect for property rights or intellectual property rights. In fact, \nthe witness over at the hearing this afternoon said the Chinese, once \nthey reengineered Viagra and sold it on their own basis, had a new \ntwist on it. They were putting it in soft drinks and hot dogs. So it \nwas kind of interesting to hear this guy, who is an expert in \nintellectual property rights, describe his view.\n  He finally said, by the way, Pfizer has won a case against the \nChinese for reverse engineering of Viagra. But this discussion is not \nabout that, it is about jobs in virtually every industry in this \ncountry. There are service industries that can never leave, of course. \nYou can't take a taxicab driver's job and move it to China or India \nbecause they have to drive a cab up and down an American street. But \nAlan Blinder and others have said we are talking about the potential of \ntens of millions of additional American jobs leaving unless there is a \nstrategy to understand that our participation in the global economy is \ndesigned to raise up others, not push down our standards. It is \ndesigned to be in our economic self-interest to try to keep Americans \nemployed in good jobs that pay well.\n\n  So we have a lot to do. I mentioned, Senator Brown, that we are \nlikely to have another vote in the Senate in the coming days on the \nquestion of shutting down this unbelievably ignorant provision in tax \nlaw that says if you leave America and get rid of your workers and \npadlock your plant and then go produce the jobs in China or India and \nthen sell back here, we will give you a tax break for doing that. We \nwould like to reward you for doing that. The other side of that is that \na lot of American business men and women who started their companies \nhere don't intend to go anywhere. They are here and they are proud of \nit and they are not leaving. They are going to hire their friends and \nneighbors in their communities, and they are going to make the best \nproducts possible. They are going to stick a made-in-America label on \nit. But they are disadvantaged. It is not just the workers but those \nAmerican business owners who are now having to compete against the one \nthat was across the street and then went to China and now has a lower \ntax rate because our Tax Code says that is fine.\n  I hope at long last that maybe we will have enough people here with \nthe courage to say: It is not fine with us. It is not fine with people \nwho are unemployed in this country. It is not fine with business men \nand women who are disadvantaged because of it.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Will the Senator yield once again?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the Senator.\n  I would add that a major manufacturer that leaves from Minneapolis or \nleaves from Cleveland or from North Dakota is a company that has the \nresources to do that, and that company has a multitude of component \nmanufacturers in its supply chain and that large company that leaves \nmay be its biggest customer. Perhaps it is a big assembly plant that \nleaves to go to China. The component manufacturer that sells to that \nauto assembly plant has all of a sudden lost its biggest customer. It \nis not big enough to move to China, so it loses 30 percent of its \ncustomer base.\n  So it is not just the company that moves and what that does to \nAmerican workers and companies and communities, it is also those \nmultitude of component manufacturers. In the auto industry, for \ninstance, there are way more people working in the supply chain than \nthere are in the actual assembly plant. So in the wake of a major \ncompany moving overseas, we see devastation in the entire supply chain \nof component manufacturing. I am sure you saw that with Huffy bicycle. \nThere is the manufacturer that made the steel, that stamped the \nfenders, that made the tires and the spokes that were taken to Huffy--I \nthink to Celina, OH, in those days--to assemble. So all of them lose.\n  In smaller communities, as the Senator knows, a manufacturing plant \noftentimes has a husband and wife both working at the same plant, \nmaking $12 to $15 an hour. Their whole lives are upended because all of \na sudden they have lost both jobs in their family.\n  Thirty years ago, 30 percent of our GDP was in manufacturing and only \n11 percent was in financial services. That number has flipped now, and \nlook where it got us. Only 11 percent of our country's GDP is now as a \nresult of making things. We know how to make things in this country, \nand we are losing that ability. Without a real manufacturing policy--\nmore than a strategy but a policy--like every other country has, we are \ngoing to see a decline in the middle-class long term.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I thought it was interesting that when the Senator \nfrom Ohio and I worked hard on putting together the Economic Recovery \nAct to try to put a net under this economy and stop it from \ncollapsing--and we were probably close to having a complete collapse. \nDespite the folks who come to the Senate floor who say no jobs were \ncreated, the CBO says 3 million jobs were created or saved. But when we \nput that together, Senator Brown from Ohio and I and others wrote \nsomething called a ``Buy American'' provision, and people nearly had \napoplectic seizures here. They were doing cartwheels in the Chamber, so \nupset and concerned and nervous about what this would do, if with our \nmoney, in order to employ our people, we decided to buy our products. \nHow selfish is that, they would say.\n  It was exactly the right thing to do. Why would we try to stimulate \neconomic recovery in America by buying goods from China or Japan? So \nwhat we tried to do is to say that there should be a preference with \nthese funds to buy American. But even that was unbelievably \ncontroversial. We got it done, and I am pleased we did.\n  While the Senator is here, I wanted to make the point that the Huffy \nbicycle story is almost the perfect storm of everything that is wrong. \nThese are workers in Ohio who made $11 an hour plus benefits and then \nthey all got fired. I have described about their leaving their empty \nshoes in the parking lot on the last day of work and so on. But the \nHuffy bicycle was sent to China. I described the conditions under which \nthey are now made. This brand still exists. It is still sold in major \nAmerican stores, Wal-Mart and Kmart and so on. But once it was sent to \nChina, it declared bankruptcy and then\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\nthe Chinese bought the brand. The bankruptcy meant that not only did \nthe workers in Ohio lose their jobs, the Federal Government here, under \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, assumes the pension of the \nfired workers, and China ends up with the brand. We still buy the \nbicycles but the people are out of work and we are stuck with the \npensions.\n\n  It is almost a perfect storm of what is wrong with what we are doing \nin this country. The question is, when will it ever change? The minute \nwe talk about it the Senator from Ohio will be called--well, he's one \nof those protectionists. He has a narrow head; doesn't understand the \nbreadth and depth of this new global economy. They say that about me \nand all of us who say this doesn't add up.\n  We have to stand up for this country's economic interests. We don't \nneed to put a fence around America. We don't need to decide there is \nnot a world economy--there is a global economy. We need fair rules and \nto stand up for our economic interests, and that has not been the case; \nit has not.\n  The question is what do we do about that. At least you can take a \nbaby step in the right direction. One of my regrets, serving in this \ninstitution, is that I may well leave this institution without having \nsucceeded, at least on this issue. I have been proud to participate in \na lot of things that have been successful in advancing public policy \nbut this has meant a lot to me. I think America is losing its \ncapability, its energy, it manufacturing base. People are losing hope, \nwith nearly 20 million of them out of work. I think it is very \nimportant for us to understand we have to address this issue.\n  There is no social program in this country as important as a good job \nthat pays well. That is a fact. We have to find ways to put people back \nto work in this country. People say innovation--I am all for \ninnovation. But we innovate, we create the product, but they \nmanufacture it somewhere else and the jobs are gone. It is very \nimportant for us to rebuild our manufacturing capability in this \ncountry.\n  I said at the start we will not long remain a world economic power \nunless we have world class manufacturing capability. The American \npeople need to see some hope from this Chamber. At least one step, one \nray of hope would be if we decide in the coming several days to enact \nlegislation that is now, I believe, rule XIV'ed at the desk, that we \nlikely will have debate on--and I will be here during that debate--that \nwill say finally, at long last, we will stop, put an end to this \ninsidious provision in the IRS code that says if you move your American \njobs to China we want to reward you with a tax break. That has to end. \nIt has to end, the sooner the better.\n  Let me end by saying there is plenty in this country that needs \nfixing but there is a lot to work with because there is plenty right in \nthis country as well. I have spoken previously about the New York Times \n1-inch story about a man named Stanley Newberg.

Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to speak \nin strong support of the DISCLOSE Act, which would close the glaring \ncampaign finance loopholes that have been opened by the Citizens United \nruling. This Supreme Court ruling was a true step backward for our \ndemocracy. It overturned decades of campaign finance law and policy. It \nallowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited \namounts of their money influencing our democracy and opened the door \nwide for foreign corporations to spend their money on elections right \nhere in the United States.\n  The Citizens United ruling has given special interest groups a \nmegaphone they can use to now drown out the voices of average citizens \nin my home State of Washington and across the country. The DISCLOSE Act \nwould tear that megaphone away and place it back in the hands of \nAmerican people, where it belongs.\n  I am extremely disappointed that Senate Republicans continue to block \nthis critical legislation. This is a very personal issue for me. When I \nfirst ran for the Senate back in 1992, I was a long-shot candidate with \nsome ideas and a group of amazing and passionate volunteers by my side. \nThose volunteers cared deeply about making sure the voices of \nWashington State families were represented. They made phone calls, they \nwent door to door, they volunteered hours of time, they talked to \nfamilies all across my State who wanted more from their government.\n  We ended up winning that grassroots campaign because the people's \nvoices were heard loudly and clearly. But, to be honest, I don't think \nit would have been possible if corporations and special interests had \nbeen able to drown out their voices with an unlimited barrage of \nnegative ads against candidates who did not support their interests. \nThat is exactly why I support this DISCLOSE Act. I want to make sure \nthat no force is greater in our elections than the power of voters \nacross our cities and towns, and no voice is louder than citizens who \ncare about making their State and country a better place to live.\n  The DISCLOSE Act helps preserve those American values in a lot of \nways. First of all, it shines a very bright spotlight on the entire \nprocess. The DISCLOSE Act will make corporate CEOs and special interest \nleaders take responsibility for their acts. When candidates put up \ncampaign commercials on television, we put our faces on our ad and tell \nevery voter we have approved the message. We don't try to hide what we \nare doing. But right now corporations and special interest groups don't \nhave to do that. They can put up deceptive or untruthful ads with no \naccountability and no ability for the public to know who is trying to \ninfluence them.\n  The DISCLOSE Act also strengthens overall disclosure requirements for \ngroups who are attempting to sway our elections. Too often, \ncorporations and special interest groups are able to hide their \nspending behind a mask of front organizations because they know the \nvoters will be less likely to believe their ads if they knew the \nmotives behind the sponsors. The DISCLOSE Act ends that. It shines a \nlight on this spending and makes sure voters have the information they \nneed so they know what they can trust.\n  This bill also closes a number of other loopholes that have been \nopened by the Citizens United decision. It bans foreign corporations \nand special interest groups from spending in our U.S. elections. It \nmakes sure that corporations are not hiding their election spending \nfrom their shareholders. It limits election spending by government \ncontractors, to make sure taxpayer funding is never used to influence \nan election. It bans coordination between candidates and outside groups \non advertising so that corporations and special interest groups can \nnever sponsor a candidate.\n  This DISCLOSE Act is a commonsense bill. It should not be \ncontroversial. Anyone who thinks voters should have a louder voice than \nspecial interest groups ought to support this bill. Anyone who thinks \nthat foreign entities should have no right to influence U.S. elections \nought to support this bill. Anyone who agrees with Justice Brandeis \nthat sunlight is the best disinfectant should support this bill. And \nanyone who thinks we should not allow corporations such as BP or \nGoldman Sachs to spend unlimited money influencing our elections ought \nto support this bill.\n  Every 2 years we have elections across this country to fill our \nfederally elected offices. Every 2 years voters have the opportunity to \ntalk to each other about who they think will best represent their \ncommunities and their families. Every 2 years it is these voices of \nAmerica's citizens who decide\n\n[[Page S7342]]\n\nwho gets to stand right here representing them in the Congress. That is \nthe basis of our democracy and it is exactly what the DISCLOSE Act aims \nto protect. I am very proud to support this bill and I urge all our \ncolleagues to stand up against special interests and for voters in \ntheir States and allow this bill to finally pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think most people understand that the \nUnited States today is in the midst of the worst economic crisis since \nthe Great Depression of the 1930s. What I want to do is take a very few \nminutes to talk about how we got to where we are today and what \npolicies we need, in my view, to move this country forward in a very \nbold way so that we begin to create the millions of jobs the middle \nclass of this country desperately needs.\n  Let me begin by taking a quick look back to where we were in January \nof 2009. It is important that we take that look back because if we \ndon't know how we got to where we are today, it is going to be very \nhard to move us in a different direction.\n  January 2009 was, as we all recall, the very last month of the \nPresidency of George W. Bush. In that month we lost over 700,000 jobs. \nThat is an extraordinary number, almost unprecedented. In fact, for the \nlast months of the Bush administration, this country was hemorrhaging \njobs as a result of the financial collapse brought about by the greed, \nthe recklessness, and the illegal behavior on Wall Street.\n  During that period, our gross domestic product, the total sum of all \nthat our economy produces, had gone down by nearly 7 percent during the \nfourth quarter of 2008--a 7-percent reduction. That was the biggest \ndecline in more than a quarter century. Some $5 trillion of Americans' \nhousehold wealth evaporated in a 12-week period as people in Vermont \nand all over this country saw the value of their homes, their \nretirement savings, and their stocks plummet.\n  We were at a moment where some economists thought we might enter the \nworst depression in history, that the entire world's financial system \nwould collapse. In January of 2009 we were hemorrhaging 700,000 jobs. \nThat is where we were.\n  Of course, as a result of the collapse on Wall Street, the last \nmonths of the Bush administration were a total economic disaster, but \nlet us be clear about the cumulative 8 years of the Bush \nadministration. What happened over that 8-year period? From 2001 when \nPresident Bush came into office, until January 2009 when he left, this \ncountry lost over 600,000 private sector jobs. Let me repeat that. \nDuring the Bush 8-year period, this country lost over 600,000 jobs. The \nreason it is important to understand that is there are folks in this \nChamber, throughout this country, who want to go back to those \npolicies. I am not quite sure why anyone would want to go back to a set \nof economic policies which resulted, in an 8-year period, in a loss of \n600,000 jobs. Net, there was a gain during the Bush administration of 1 \nmillion jobs--a very poor record--all of them government jobs, many of \nthem in the military, in Homeland Security. That is, under anybody's \ndefinition, a horrendous record of job creation. In fact, it is a \nrecord of job loss.\n  During the Bush years, not only did we lose 600,000 private sector \njobs, median income--median family income dropped by $2,200. In other \nwords, middle-class Americans earned significantly less income at the \nend of the Bush era than they did when he first came into office. \nDuring those 8 years, over 8 million Americans slipped out of the \nmiddle class into poverty; over 3 million lost their pensions; and \nnearly 8 million lost their health insurance.\n  During that period, 4.5 million manufacturing jobs disappeared as \ncompanies shut down in the United States and moved to China, Mexico, \nVietnam, and other low-wage countries. In the year 2000 we had over 17 \nmillion manufacturing jobs in this country. At the end of the Bush era, \nin 2008, we had less than 12 million. That is a huge reduction in good-\npaying manufacturing jobs--in fact, the fewest number of manufacturing \njobs since the beginning of World War II.\n  Under President Bush our trade deficit with China more than tripled \nand our overall trade deficit nearly doubled.\n  I raise those issues once again because it is very important to \nunderstand that there are a number of people in this Chamber who want \nto go back to those policies--policies which were a demonstrative \nfailure.\n  But here is another important point, and we should understand this \nvery clearly. While the middle class was battered during the Bush years \nand median family income went down, while poverty increased, not \neveryone did badly. In fact, during the Bush administration, the \nwealthiest 400 Americans saw their incomes more than double. The middle \nclass was battered, median family income was down, poverty increased, \npeople lost their health insurance, people lost their pensions, but the \nwealthiest 400 Americans saw their income more than double. In 2007, \nthese wealthiest 400 Americans earned an average of $345 million in 1 \nyear--on average, $345 million. In terms of wealth, as opposed to \nincome, the wealthiest 400 Americans saw an increase in their wealth of \nsome $400 billion during the Bush years--400 people, an increase of \n$400 billion during the Bush years.\n  Let me talk for a moment about something I consider to be very \nimportant, but we do not talk about it very much in the Senate. We do \nnot talk about it very much in the media. It is not something we engage \nin polite conversation, but it happens to be one of the important \neconomic issues facing our country; that is, the issue of distribution \nof income and distribution of wealth.\n  All over America, whether it is in Minnesota or Vermont, everyone \nwants to know--in New England, everyone loves the New England Patriots \nor the Boston Celtics, and what people want to know is, at the end of \nthe day, who won and who lost and what was going on in the game. Well, \nin terms of income distribution, that is the result of income as \neconomic activity. Who won? Who lost? And let's be very clear that when \nwe talk about winners and losers, the United States today has the most \nunequal distribution of income and wealth of any major country on \nEarth, and that inequality is getting worse. I know many people choose \nnot to talk about it, but I think it is imperative that we do talk \nabout it.\n  Today, the top 1 percent earns more income than the bottom 50 \npercent. Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent earns more income than \nthe bottom 50 percent. In 2007, which is the last year for which we had \ngood statistics, the wealthiest 1 percent, the top 1 percent of income \nearners, took in 23\\1/2\\ percent of all of the income earned in the \nUnited States. Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent earned over 23 \npercent of all income earned in the United States. Here is an even more \namazing statistic. The top one-tenth of 1 percent--top one-tenth of 1 \npercent--took in 11 percent of total income, according to the latest \ndata available.\n  The problem we are having in terms of income is that the situation is \nbecoming more and more unequal. We see that in the statistics, which \nare very clear. In the 1970s, the top 1 percent only made 8 percent of \ntotal income earned in this country, and now that number is 23\\1/2\\ \npercent--almost four times as much.\n  I would point out that the last time income was this concentrated was \nin the year 1928, and I think we all know what happened in 1929. When \nyou have such an unequal distribution of income and wealth, it is not \nonly, to my mind, immoral and wrong that so few have so much and so \nmany have so little, it is bad economics because the economy grows when \nall people have money to spend, when consumers can spend money. When so \nmuch of our income and wealth is concentrated on the top, we run the \nsignificant likelihood of major economic recessions, and that is what \nis happening right now.\n  Also, incredibly, in the midst of this growing inequality and while \nthe very wealthiest people in this country became much richer and at \nthe same time as our deficit soared, the tax rates for the people on \ntop went down. Middle class declines, poverty increases, the rich get \nricher, and the tax rate for the very wealthy goes down. This was a \nresult of not only tax breaks for the wealthy initiated during the Bush \nadministration but also, quite frankly,\n\n[[Page S7343]]\n\ntax policy that took place before Bush. The result is that from 1992 to \n2007, the latest statistics that we have, the effective Federal tax \nrate--effective Federal tax rate, and that is what people really pay--\nfor the top 400 income earners in our country was cut almost in half. \nThe rich get richer, their effective tax rates are cut almost in half.\n  Today, we have a Federal Tax Code that is so unfair, that it is so \nabsurd that Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, \noften points out that he pays a lower effective tax rate than does his \nsecretary. Hedge fund managers who make $1 billion a year now pay a \nlower effective tax rate than many teachers, nurses, firefighters, and \npolice officers.\n  I should also add that in terms of wealth, as opposed to just income, \ninequality, of course, is also growing. Today, the top 1 percent owns \nmore wealth than the bottom 90 percent, and during the Bush years, the \nwealthiest 400 Americans saw their wealth increase by some $400 \nbillion. When a few people have incredible wealth and incredible \nincome, they do not tuck that money under the mattress; they use that \nmoney.\n  The point Senator Murray of Washington was making a few moments ago \non the DISCLOSE Act is a very good example of how some of those folks \nare making money. Not content to have the top 1 percent earning more \nthan 23 percent of all income in America, these folks want more. Their \ngreed has no end. And what they are now doing as a result of the \nDISCLOSE Act, a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision, they and their corporate \nfriends are now free to put as much money as they want into the \npolitical process, into television ads, into radio ads, and they do not \nhave to disclose who they are. So you are going to have corporations \nwith foreign interests getting involved with the American political \nprocess. You are going to have corporations putting all kinds of money \ninto the political process, setting up phony institutions and front \ngroups, and they do not have to tell the American people who they are.\n  In addition to the DISCLOSE Act and the huge amount of money now \nflooding into the political process, we have an enormous amount of \nlobbying and campaign contributions that are going right into the whole \ntax issue, that which we are debating now.\n  As you know, some of our Republican friends think, apparently, that \nthe top 1 percent earning more income than the bottom 50 percent is not \nquite enough, that the fact that we have given huge tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires for the last 15 years is not enough; they \nneed more. So what some of our Republican friends are doing and what \ntheir friends on Wall Street and big money interests are doing is \npouring huge amounts of money into the political process which says \nthat we should provide, over a 10-year period, $700 billion in tax \nbreaks to the top 2 percent; that millionaires, those people making $1 \nmillion or more, should receive on average a $100,000 tax break. And \nthey are fighting for tax breaks for the rich at the same time as they \nare saying: Oh, isn't it terrible that we have a $13 trillion national \ndebt. So they wanted to give $700 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 \npercent, and then they say: Oh my goodness, isn't it awful that we have \na recordbreaking deficit and a large national debt, and they want to \npass on those tax breaks to our kids and grandchildren--increase the \nnational debt so that we can give tax breaks to millionaires and \nbillionaires. That makes zero sense to me. I think that is an \nincredibly dumb and irresponsible idea.\n  What I think we should do, what I believe we should do is that half \nof that $700 billion, instead of being given in tax breaks to the top 2 \npercent, should be used for deficit reduction. Let's do it now. And the \nother $350 billion should be invested in our infrastructure--rebuilding \nour roads, our bridges, our water systems, our schools, our \ntransportation systems--and putting people back to work. Our \ninfrastructure is crumbling. Everybody knows that. We are going to have \nto address it now or later. Let's address it now. In the middle of a \nrecession, let's put millions of people back to work rebuilding America \nto make us more competitive in the global economy and make our economic \nsystem more efficient. I think, frankly, it makes a heck of a lot more \nsense to put millions of people to work rebuilding America's \ninfrastructure and using $350 billion to lower the deficit than it does \nto give $700 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent. I hope that a \nmajority of my colleagues or, in fact, 60 of my colleagues agree with \nthat because, to me, that is the policy this country desperately needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.)

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to take a few minutes \nto talk about this issue of campaign ads being run all across the land \nand millions of dollars being spent by groups with misleading names, \nleaving our voters without any knowledge of who is behind the ads they \nare hearing.\n  To me, the lack of accountability and civility and literal accuracy \nin political campaigns is absolutely unacceptable, and I am of the view \nthat we ought to be asking here in the Senate whether this is really \nthe best we can do to ensure accountability and openness in American \npolitics. I think the answer to that is, it is a no-brainer. There \nought to be basic disclosure of who is behind all of those ads that are \nflooding the airwaves. That is what is behind the DISCLOSE legislation, \nthe bill that has been brought before the Senate to ensure that it is \npossible for Americans, at a time when there is intense interest in \nAmerican politics, to know who is sponsoring all of these commercials \nthat are rushing at the American people pell-mell over the airwaves.\n  What is striking is how stark the inequities in all of this are. What \nI am particularly troubled about is that as a result of the Supreme \nCourt decision, it is possible today for a foreign interest with no \nvote here in the United States to have a more substantial voice in our \nelections this fall than any hard-working American taxpayer. When you \nbreak that down, you really get a sense of just how outlandish this \nSupreme Court decision is. Let me repeat that. Foreign interests, \nthrough a subsidiary, with no vote here in the United States, will have \na louder voice in the State of Alaska, in the State of Oregon, than any \nof the hard-working taxpayers whom we are honored to represent here in \nthe Senate. I think that indicates that the campaign finance system is \nway out of whack.\n  This Supreme Court decision, in my view, has literally blown the \nhinges off the doors of our democracy. What is needed is legislation \nsuch as the DISCLOSE Act to ensure accountability, civility, and \naccuracy in political campaigns.\n  My view is that the lack of that kind of accountability creates not \nonly confusion but even resentment among voters. The reason I know that \nis that the situation the country finds itself in now is very similar \nto what I saw when I first ran for the Senate in 1996 against the man \nwho eventually became my colleague and good friend in the Senate, \nGordon Smith. That was the only race in the United States at that time, \nthe winter of 1996. Attack ads were being run by all sides, left and \nright. Senator Smith and I literally had no idea who was behind a lot \nof the attack ads. We made the judgment that while policy differences \nand personal criticisms are certainly a fair and legitimate part of a \npolitical campaign, what is not acceptable is the situation our country \nfinds itself in, once again; that is, the huge numbers of ads being run \nwhere nobody could figure out who was behind some of the attacks, \nattacks that were pretty vicious and certainly high decibel.\n  So I came to the Senate in the winter of 1996, and I vowed to try to \nmake some changes. I vowed to work with colleagues of both parties to \nbring transparency and accountability to campaign advertising. I had \nthe good fortune to find a terrific partner in this effort with our \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins. As part of the McCain-\nFeingold bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, Senator Collins and I \nwere able to win passage of an amendment which has come to be known as \nthe stand by your ad disclosure requirement. Not only have we all seen \nthese ads, everyone who has run to serve in this distinguished Chamber \nhas recorded them. It is real simple. I am Mark Begich. I approved this \nmessage. I am Ron Wyden, and I approved\n\n[[Page S7344]]\n\nthis message. It is not a hard thing to do. It comes about as a result \nof the fact that a colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator \nCollins, joined me in this effort that I believed passionately in after \nthat Senate special election in the winter of 1996.\n  That simple disclosure requirement gives voters very important \ninformation about who is behind a political ad. I am of the view that \ndisclosure should not be required just for candidates but for anyone--\ninterest groups, corporations--who seeks to communicate a political \nmessage. Unfortunately, after the Citizens United ruling, there are a \nvariety of these interests that are now free to spend unlimited amounts \nof money on political ads without voters knowing who is paying for the \nads. That is dangerous for democracy. It is wrong, and it needs to be \nstopped.\n  The stand by your ad provision of the DISCLOSE Act would require the \ntop official, the CEO or a top official from a company, a union or any \norganization paying for a political advertisement to take \nresponsibility for the ad. The DISCLOSE Act can't prevent the formation \nof misleading front organizations, but another provision would require \ndisclosure of the top five funders to allow voters to know who is \nbehind the ad.\n  I am of the view that companies, unions, other organizations ought to \nbe held to the same standards of transparency and accountability in \ntheir political advertising as political candidates and political \naction committees. It is, in a one-sentence description, all about \nsunshine. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. The disclosure \nrequirements in this legislation are going to give voters more \ninformation and help them understand who is paying for these political \nads.\n  I continue, as the Presiding Officer knows, to do everything I can to \nwork in the Senate in a bipartisan fashion. I am pleased to see my \ndistinguished colleague in the chair. He has joined me with Senator \nGregg and a number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle in what is \nthe first bipartisan tax reform legislation in a quarter century. It \npicks up on another bipartisan model--legislation advanced by former \nPresident Reagan, Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski, and others. A big day \nis coming up in tax reform. That is tomorrow. Chairman Baucus is going \nto lead us into the first debate in a long time about tax reform. I \nvery much look forward to working with Chairman Baucus and his \nleadership on this issue.\n  I see my colleague from the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley. If \nwe are going to duplicate that important tax reform work of 1986, it is \ngoing to be Chairman Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, the \nleaders of our committee taking us forward in a bipartisan way so the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska and I and other more junior members \ncan work with our colleagues and make some history and fix the American \ntax system, radically simplify it. But to do that we will have to work \nin a bipartisan way.\n  I come to the floor to say, once again, I am hopeful that the \nDISCLOSE legislation, which provides an opportunity for transparency \nand accountability in campaign finance, can also become a bipartisan \ncause. There is absolutely nothing partisan about the question of \nmaking sure a political advertisement that is offered is one where the \nAmerican people know who is behind it. That is not a partisan issue. As \nmy friend from Alaska knows, it certainly isn't a partisan issue to \ntake this unbelievable mess of a Tax Code that runs page after page \nafter page, thousands of words, and simplify it to a one-page form, a \none-page 1040 form. That is not partisan work, nor should disclosing \ncampaign finance advertisements be partisan either.\n  I ask on this question of election reform, look at the present \nsystem, where there is no accountability, where people don't know who \nis behind these advertisements, and ask: Is this the best we can do? I \nthink the answer is obviously no. I think the answer is, instead, to \nsay that companies and unions and other organizations ought to be held \nto the same standard of honesty and integrity as political candidates \nare required to do under the legislation Senator Collins and I authored \nas part of McCain-Feingold.\n  The fact is, this Senate can do better in election reform. I urge \ncolleagues to work together to bring transparency and accountability to \nAmerican elections and pass the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as a parent and grandparent, I have long \nbeen concerned about the dangers that face our kids. I have been \nespecially concerned about the large amount of dangerous drugs in this \ncountry and their use by anybody but particularly young people. It is \nclear drug dealers will stop at nothing to get our kids hooked on \ndrugs. All too often, we learn of new and emerging threats to \ncommunities that often have negative impacts on our youth. But when \nthese drug threats emerge, it is crucial that we unite to halt the \nspread of the problem before it consumes families and communities.\n  Today we are confronted with new and very dangerous substances \npackaged as somewhat innocent products. Specifically, young people are \nable to go online and/or to the nearest shopping mall and purchase \nincense laced with chemicals that alter mind and body. These products \nare commonly referred to as ``K2'' or ``Spice,'' among other names. I \nhave a chart Members can see behind me. They can see the package \nvarieties of K2 products. I will not go into detail, but look at them.\n  Specifically, kids are able to actually purchase these products with \na great amount of ease. Kids and drug users are smoking this product in \norder to obtain what they think is a legal high, and the word ``legal'' \ntends to imply harmless. It is believed K2 products emerged on the \nscene beginning 4 or 5 years ago. Their use spread quickly through \nEurope and the United States. According to a study conducted by the \nEuropean Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, most of the chemicals \nfound in K2 products are not even reported on the label. This study by \nthe European Centre concluded that these chemicals are not listed \nbecause there is a deliberate marketing strategy to represent this \nproduct as somewhat a natural substance. However, K2 is anything but \nnatural. Most of the chemicals the Drug Enforcement Administration has \nidentified within K2 products were invented by Dr. John W. Huffman of \nClemson University and for a very worthwhile purpose--research \npurposes.\n  These synthetic chemicals were never intended to be used for any \nother purpose other than research. They were never tested on humans, \nand no long-term effects of their use are currently known. As more and \nmore people are experimenting with K2, it is becoming increasingly \nevident that K2 use is anything but safe.\n  The American Association of Poison Control Centers reports \nsignificant increases in the amount of calls concerning these products. \nThere were only 13 calls related to K2 use reported in 2009. Look at \nthe figure for 2010. There have been over 1,000 calls concerning K2 \nuse. So it is very evident: A dramatic increase in a short amount of \ntime of the public concerned about K2 use, probably reflecting \nincreased use of K2.\n  Common effects reported by emergency room doctors include increased \nagitation, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, hallucinations, and \nseizures. The effects from the highs from K2 use are reported to last \nseveral hours, and in some cases up to one week.\n  Dr. Huffman has stated that since so little research has been \nconducted on K2 chemicals, using any one of them would be like \n``playing Russian roulette.''\n  In fact, Dr. Anthony Scalzo, a professor of emergency medicine at St. \nLouis University, reports that these chemicals are significantly more \npotent than even marijuana. Dr. Scalzo states that the amount of \nchemicals in K2 varies from product to product, so naturally no one can \nbe sure exactly the amount of drugs you are putting into your body when \nyou use these K2 products. Dr. Scalzo reports that this can lead to \nsignificant problems such as altering the state of mind, addiction, \ninjury, and even death. I will refer to the death issue in a moment.\n  According to various news articles across the Nation, K2 can cause \nserious erratic and criminal behavior. In Mooresville, IN, the police \narrested a\n\n[[Page S7345]]\n\ngroup of teens after they were connected to a string of burglaries \nwhile high on K2. The local county attorney prosecuting the case stated \nthis was an unusual crime spree. These kids were not the type who are \nnormally seen in the criminal justice system. The county attorney \nstated these kids had ``no prior record, good grades, athletes, so that \ngot me wondering: is there a correlation between K2 and the crime?''\n  Another case in Honolulu, HI, shows police arrested a 23-year-old man \nafter he tried to throw his girlfriend off an 11th floor balcony after \nhe was smoking K2.\n  A 14-year-old boy in Missouri nearly threw himself out of a fifth \nstory window after smoking K2. Once the teen got over his high, he \ndenied having any suicidal tendencies. Doctors believe he was \nhallucinating at the time of the incident.\n  K2 use is also causing serious health problems and increased visits \nto emergency rooms.\n  A Louisiana teen said he became very ill after trying K2. The teen \nsaid he experienced numbness, starting at his feet and traveling all \nthe way to his head. He was nauseous, light-headed, and was having \nhallucinations. The teen stated that K2 is being passed around at the \nschool. The teen also stated that many people were trying it without \nfear, assuming it was safe because it was legal. I said that previously \nin my remarks: a legal drug, it has to be safe is kind of the attitude.\n  Another case has a teenager in Indiana being admitted to an emergency \nroom with a blood pressure of 248 over 134 after testing positive for \nK2.\n  A teen in Texas became temporarily paralyzed from the waist down \nafter smoking K2.\n  Another teen in Texas had a heart attack after smoking K2 but, \nfortunately, survived the event.\n  Regrettably, K2 use also has deadly consequences. I want to speak \nabout an individual and family who suffered from a tremendously bad \nconsequence of K2.\n  The picture behind me is of David Rozga. David was a recent 18-year-\nold Indianola, IA, high school graduate. According to his parents and \nfriends, David was a bright, energetic, talented student who loved \nmusic, was popular, and active in his church.\n  David was looking forward to attending the University of Northern \nIowa this fall, my alma mater. On June 6, 2010, David, along with some \nof his friends, smoked a package of K2 thinking it was nothing more \nthan just having a little fun.\n  David and his friends purchased this product at a mall in Des Moines, \nafter hearing about it from some college students who were home for the \nsummer.\n  After smoking this product, David's friends reported that David \nbecame highly agitated and terrified. When he got home, he found a \nfamily shotgun and committed suicide 90 minutes after smoking K2.\n  The Indianola police believe David was under the influence of K2 at \nthe time of his death. David's parents and many in the community who \nknew David were completely shocked and, obviously, saddened by this \nevent.\n  As a result, the Iowa Pharmacy Board placed an emergency ban on K2 \nproducts in Iowa, which began on July 21, 2010. David's tragic death \nmay be the first case in the United States of K2 use leading to \nsomeone's death, but, sadly, it was only the beginning.\n  A month after David's tragic death, police reported that a 28-year-\nold Middletown, IN, mother of two passed away after smoking a lethal \ndose of K2. This woman's godson reported that anyone could get K2 \neasily because it can be sold to anyone at any price and at any time.\n  This last August, a recent 19-year-old Lake Highlands High School \ngraduate in Dallas, TX, passed away after smoking K2. The medical \nexaminer confirmed that this boy had K2 in his system at the time of \nhis death.\n  These incidents throughout the country give me great concern that K2 \nuse is a dangerous and growing problem. Twelve States, including Iowa, \nhave acted to ban the sale and possession of the chemicals found in K2 \nproducts. Many more States, counties, and communities throughout the \ncountry have proposed bans or are in the process of banning these \nproducts.\n  However, a recent article in the Des Moines Register highlights the \nfact that some stores are working around these bans by the simple \nprocess of changing some of the chemicals and by simply relabeling the \nproduct.\n  So I believe it is time we have a national discussion about these \ndangerous substances. I hope in the coming weeks and months my \ncolleagues will begin to take notice of this issue.\n  As cochairman of the Senate Drug Caucus--I cochair that with Senator \nFeinstein from California--it is my hope we will have a hearing on this \nissue in the not too distant future.\n  It is important to fully understand the magnitude and implications of \nallowing these products to remain legal in the United States. It is \nclear the sale and use of K2 products is obviously a growing problem. \nPeople believe these products are safe because they can buy them online \nor at the nearest shopping mall.\n  We need to do a better job at educating the public and our \ncommunities about the dangers these products present. We, in fact, need \nto nip this problem in the bud before it grows and leads to the tragedy \nof more death or the tragedy of other health consequences.\n  I ask each of my colleagues in the Senate to join me as we explore \npositive actions to stem the use of K2.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7345-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

GREENBERG\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \nwork of Peggy L. Greenberg, director of the Office of Education and \nTraining, who is retiring at the end of this month after 11 years. \nPeggy has been responsible for the training and development of all \nSenate staff in both the Washington, DC, office and all the Senate \nState offices. Her department offers programs in a wide variety of \nareas including general professional development, management and \nleadership development, legislative information and technical computer \nskills training.\n  After earning her undergraduate degree in nursing from Southwestern \nLouisiana, Ms. Greenberg moved from nursing in Louisiana to \nMassachusetts, where she was a pediatric nurse. She eventually became \nthe director of nursing inservice education and later the director of \neducation for all of Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Boston. During that \ntime, she earned a master's degree in adult and continuing education \nfrom Boston University.\n  Peggy was the director of Organization Effectiveness and Performance \nConsulting for Med Star Physician Partners and then a director of \nlearning and organization development for Kaiser Permanente of the Mid-\nAtlantic States. She was recognized in the Kaiser Permanente \norganization nationwide as a leader in the training and organization \ndevelopment area.\n  Peggy Greenberg has been a key contributor to improving the \neffectiveness and efficiency of Senate staff. We have all benefited \nfrom her professional and personal commitment to improving every aspect \nof or our individual and organizational development. The Senate has \nbeen fortunate to have someone with her knowledge and experience.\n  The Senate community will miss Peggy, and wishes her well as she \nenjoys long and adventurous bike rides with her husband, Brian and \ncontinues indulging her love of tap dancing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7345-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7345-S7346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TREE FRESNO'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 25th anniversary of Tree Fresno.\n\n[[Page S7346]]\n\n  The genesis of Tree Fresno can be traced to a group of residents who \nhad gathered during Fresno's Centennial in 1985 to explore ways to \nimprove the city. This group of civic-minded residents determined that \nthe planting of trees would beautify the city and create more livable \nand walkable neighborhoods.\n  The idea to beautify Fresno through the planting of trees was met \nwith great support and enthusiasm from the community as evidenced by a \ntelethon that netted $27,000--funds that provided seed money for Tree \nFresno's maiden project that resulted in the planting of trees in \ndowntown and the city's vibrant Tower District.\n  Over the past 25 years, Tree Fresno has spearheaded and successfully \ncompleted a number of community-wide efforts that have led to the \ngreening of the greater Fresno area. Throughout the years, Tree Fresno \nhas grown the tree canopy on local school campuses and along some of \nthe major thoroughfares in Fresno such as Blackstone and McKinley \nAvenues. On one remarkable day in 2000, thousands of Tree Fresno \nvolunteers planted 4,400 trees in and along an abandoned rail corridor \nbetween Fresno and Clovis.\n  In addition to the planting of trees, Tree Fresno has also been \ninstrumental in educating the public about the importance of \nresponsible environmental stewardship. Through programs such as Tribute \nTrees, Trees for Campuses and Kids and the Junior Board of Tree Fresno, \nthe organization has made an indelible impact on raising the overall \nenvironmental awareness and efficacy of the residents, especially the \nyoung people, of Fresno and surrounding communities.\n  The many accomplishments of Tree Fresno over the past 25 years are a \ntestament to the vision of its founding members, the dedication of its \nstaff and the support and commitment of thousands of volunteers and \nsupporters who have given so generously to help make Fresno a better \nplace to live.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate the board, staff and many friends \nof Tree Fresno for 25 years of environmental leadership in the greater \nFresno area. I send my best wishes for many more years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7346-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7346-S7347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 2009 ALFRED P. SLOAN AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I congratulate the 2009 \nwinners of the Alfred P. Sloan Award for Business Excellence in \nWorkplace Flexibility, which recognizes companies that have \nsuccessfully used flexibility to meet both business and employee goals. \nThe Sloan Awards are presented by the When Work Works initiative, which \nis a project of the Families and Work Institute in partnership with the \nInstitute for a Competitive Workforce, an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, and the Twiga Foundation Inc. The When Work Works \ninitiative is sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\n  I want to draw your attention to the Sloan Awards because I think \nthese companies are to be commended for their excellence in providing \nworkplace flexibility practices which benefit both employers and \nemployees. Achieving greater flexibility in the workplace--to maximize \nproductivity while attracting the highest quality employees--is one of \nthe key challenges facing American companies in the 21st century.\n  Businesses in 30 communities were eligible for recognition in the \n2009 Sloan Awards. In addition, this year an at-large category was \nadded. The Chamber of Commerce in many cities hosted an interactive \nbusiness forum to share research on workplace flexibility as an \nimportant component of workplace effectiveness. In these same \ncommunities, businesses applied for and recipients were selected for \nthe Sloan Awards through a process that included employee responses as \nwell as employer practices.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 2009 \nwinners of the Alfred P.

This group of talented vocalists from the Little Rock area \nrepresent the best of Arkansas, and I am proud of their efforts to \nspread music and ministry to others.\n  I celebrate St. Mark Sanctuary Choir and all performers of gospel \nmusic for their dedication to an art form that brings a message of hope \nand inspiration to all people. That is why earlier this year, I \nsubmitted a bipartisan resolution in the U.S. Senate designating \nSeptember as ``Gospel Music Heritage Month,'' to honor the lasting \nlegacy of gospel music in the U.S. and around the world.\n  In closing, I commend these talented individuals at St. Mark Church \nfor their dedication to serving others through music and worship. I \ncongratulate Bishop Steven M. Arnold and the entire congregation for \nthis tremendous achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7348-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 4:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3562.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue \npermits for a microhydro project in nonwilderness areas within the \nboundaries of Denali National Park and Preserve, to acquire land for \nDenali National Park and Preserve from Doyon Tourism, Inc., and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about legislation I am \nintroducing today with support from my fellow senator from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski.\n  It is all too rare that we get to talk about successful partnerships \nbetween private industry and the Federal Government. This legislation \nwould cement just such a successful partnership between a subsidiary of \nan Alaska Native Corporation, Doyon Limited and the National Park \nService.\n  Briefly this measure would authorize a special use permit and over \nthe longer term an equal value land trade to facilitate a micro-hydro \nproject within the non-wilderness portion of the Denali National Park. \nThe micro-hydro project would allow Kantishna Roadhouse, a backcountry \nlodge that accommodates thousands of visitors a year, to substantially \nreduce their diesel use.\n  Because the lodge is not connected to any utility grid, it must \ngenerate its own power. By converting much of the load to a renewable \nresource, the lodge would improve local air quality and reduce truck \ntraffic on the single park access road, thus improving the experience \nfor visitors to the lodge and park as a whole. It additionally would \nhelp the lodge's bottom line.\n  The legislation has been developed with the assistance of Alaska \nRegion of the National Park Service, and they are supportive of the \nproject. Eureka Creek, the source of the hydro power, is not a fish-\nbearing stream, and the Park Service is interested in acquiring the \nlands to be traded from Doyon ownership.\n  After a good deal of outreach this summer by Doyon and others, we are \naware of no opposition to this permit, land trade and the legislation \nitself. I want to thank the National Park Service for their willingness \nto come to the table and work constructively to solve problems. \nAdditionally, I particularly want to thank the senior senator from \nAlaska and her staff for their work on this legislation. It's been a \ngood partnership and I appreciate her help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 3821. A bill to amend title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \nprohibit discrimination on the ground of religion in educational \nprogram or activities; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to urge support \nfor legislation I am introducing today to amend Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964.\n  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on \nthe basis of race, color, and national origin by any organization, \nprogram or activity that receives federal financial assistance, \nincluding colleges and universities. If recipients fail to comply, the \nfederal agency providing the assistance may terminate funding, and \norganizations risk losing their eligibility for future funding.\n  The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, OCR, is tasked \nwith enforcing Title VI as it applies to colleges and universities. \nOCR, however, believes that it does not have jurisdiction over \ncomplaints based solely on religion as opposed to race, color, or \nnational origin. This means that when a Jew, or a Muslim, or a Sikh is \nharassed or discriminated against for being a Jew, a Muslim, or a Sikh, \nOCR must first determine whether the harassment or discrimination is a \nresult of the student's religion or a result of her race, color, or \nnational origin.\n  In most cases involving such discrimination, the perpetrator himself \nprobably wouldn't even know if his hatred stems from prejudice based on \nreligion or prejudice based on race, color, or national origin. Yet, \nbefore acting to protect these students, OCR has to determine the \nmotive behind the perpetrator's actions. This wastes valuable time and \nallows the discrimination to continue pending the determination. \nFurthermore, it sets a dangerous example to require OCR to make such a \ndetermination and then in essence say the harassment and discrimination \nis okay provided it was based on religion and not on race, color, or \nnational origin.\n  Many people are not aware that Title VI does not explicitly prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of religion. This is because discrimination \non the basis of religion is prohibited in virtually every other civil \nrights law and has become such a fundamental principle of our country \nthat we just assume the protection exists. For example, titles other \nthan Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibit religious discrimination \nin other contexts.\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\n  In 1941, President Roosevelt issued an executive order prohibiting \ndiscrimination in the Federal Government and in the defense industry on \ngrounds of ``race, creed, color, or national origin.'' The Civil Rights \nAct of 1957 established the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to \ninvestigate discrimination on the basis of ``color, race, religion, or \nnational origin.'' The Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself included \nnumerous prohibitions on religious discrimination, just not in Title \nVI. For example, Title VII of the 1964 Act prohibits discrimination in \nemployment. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 governing housing, continued \nto prohibit discrimination on the basis of ``race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin.''\n  When it comes to education, the 1964 Act provides two mechanisms that \naddress religious discrimination. First, the Attorney General is given \nlimited authorization to sue public colleges that deny admission on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in a way that \nlimits educational desegregation. Second, the Attorney General is \nauthorized to intervene in certain pending equal protection cases \nclaiming discrimination ``on account of race, color, religion, sex or \nnational origin'' if the case is of sufficient public importance. \nHowever, the Justice Department may not institute such actions on its \nown, and no federal agency is authorized to investigate run-of-the-mill \nreligious discrimination cases at educational institutions or cases in \nwhich the victim has been unable to initiate litigation.\n\n  Why was religious discrimination left out of Title VI? Key members of \nCongress wanted to make sure that religiously affiliated colleges \nmaintained their ability to discriminate in favor of co-religionists in \nadmissions and extra-curricular activities. The original version of the \nbill that would become Title VI, drafted by the Department of Justice, \ndid ban religious discrimination in federally assisted programs or \nactivities. However, Emanuel Celler, the House Judiciary Committee \nChairman and sponsor of the bill, explained during floor debate that he \nwanted to permit denominational colleges to engage in certain forms of \ndiscrimination in favor of co-religionists. Celler stated that he \nwanted to ``avoid a good many problems'' relating to funding that \n``goes to sectarian schools and universities.'' He explained that ``for \nthese reasons, the subcommittee and, I am sure, the full committee or \nthe majority thereof deemed it wise and proper and expedient--and I \nemphasize the word `expedient'--to omit the word `religion.' ''\n  Congressman Celler may have been right that eliminating religion made \nit expedient, but it did not make it correct. Congressman Celler's \nconcerns could have been addressed with some clarifying language that \nsuch institutions would still be allowed to favor co-religionists.\n  The bill that I am introducing contains such language. It states that \nthe amendment is not to limit an educational entity with a religious \naffiliation, mission, or purpose from applying admissions policies, \ndegree criteria, student conduct regulations, student organization \nregulations, or policies for faculty and staff employment, when these \npolicies relate to the religious affiliation, mission, or purpose of \nthe institution. Furthermore, it does not require educational entities \nto provide accommodation to any student's religion obligations such as \ndietary restrictions and school absences. Finally, if the educational \nentity permits expressive organizations to exist by funding or \notherwise recognizing them, the amendment does not require the entity \nto limit such organizations from exercising their freedom of expressive \nassociation by establishing membership or leadership criteria.\n  Therefore, I am proposing an amendment to Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. The amendment simply provides the same protection \nagainst discrimination based on religion that this title already \nprovides for discrimination based on race, color, and national origin.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 3824. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide for \nenhanced safety and environmental protection in pipeline transportation \nand to provide for enhanced reliability in the transportation of United \nStates energy products by pipeline, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on September 9, a gas pipeline \nunderneath a neighborhood in San Bruno, California, just south of San \nFrancisco, exploded, turning a quiet residential area into something \nresembling a war zone.\n  The resulting inferno damaged or destroyed 55 homes, injured 66, and \nkilled an estimated 7 people. Three likely victims have yet to be \nidentified.\n  This tragedy shows the heavy toll, in death and destruction, when \nhigh pressure natural gas pipelines fail. The risk is unacceptably \nhigh.\n  So today I join with my colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, to \nintroduce the Strengthening Pipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of \n2010.\n  This legislation is drafted to repair clear shortcomings in pipeline \noversight that have, unfortunately, come to our attention as the result \nof a devastating tragedy in San Bruno, CA.\n  Specifically, this legislation would improve pipeline safety and \noversight by expanding Federal inspection capacity; increasing fines \nfor safety violations; adding information to the national pipeline \nmapping system, to assure greater transparency for the public and the \nregulator; closing jurisdictional loopholes that allow gathering lines, \ncarbon dioxide pipelines, and biofuel pipelines to operate without \noversight; requiring widespread adoption of automatic shut-off valves \nthat could shut off a pipeline immediately in emergency situations; \nrequiring that high-pressure pipelines be inspected on a regular basis \nwith either internal instrumented internal inspection devices, known as \nsmart pigs, or other inspection methods that are certified to be just \nas effective; prohibiting pipelines that cannot be inspected with the \nbest, most-modern techniques from operating at high pressure; requiring \nregulators to consider seismicity and the age of pipes when identifying \npipelines that deserve the highest level of oversight; and establishing \nthe first standards for effective leak detection systems in natural gas \npipelines.\n  Together, Senator Boxer and I believe these improvements to pipeline \nsafety will bring about a safer national pipeline system in which \ndisasters, such as the tragedy in San Bruno, can be prevented.\n  At 6:11 p.m. on September 9, 2010, a 30-inch steel natural gas \npipeline exploded in San Bruno, California.\n  The blast in the Crestmoor neighborhood two miles west of San \nFrancisco International Airport shook the ground like an earthquake. \nThe fire raged for more than two hours and burned 15 acres.\n  The resulting loss of life, serious injuries and property damage are \nheartbreaking.\n  Two days after the fire, I visited San Bruno. I walked through the \ndevastation with Christopher Hart, vice chairman of the National \nTransportation Safety Board.\n  I was struck by what I saw: Homes leveled or charred; cars burned \nout; the burned and bent pipeline--now a key part of the \ninvestigation--which revealed the intensity of the heat; and a gaping \ncrater that demonstrated the size of the initial blast.\n  I was saddened by the disaster and I am determined to act to prevent \nthis type of catastrophe from recurring.\n  I left San Bruno once again impressed by the professionalism of the \nNTSB.\n  Their team was on site and in charge, and I am confident they will \nwork meticulously to find out what caused this deadly disaster.\n  I am confident that their feedback will make pipelines safer in the \nfuture.\n  But I also left San Bruno determined to introduce legislation to \naddress the known weaknesses in our pipeline oversight system.\n  Let me explain the key provisions in the Bill. First, we propose to \ndouble the number of Federal pipeline safety inspectors.\n  The Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials \nSafety Administration currently has 100 pipeline inspectors, \nresponsible for 217,306 miles of interstate pipeline. Each inspector is \nresponsible for 2,173 miles of pipeline--the distance from San \nFrancisco to Chicago.\n  The vast amount of pipeline per inspector has led to lax oversight of \npipeline operators, according to NTSB investigations.\n\n[[Page S7355]]\n\n  NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman testified in June that:\n\n       NTSB is concerned that the level of . . . oversight \n     currently being exercised is not uniformly applied by . . . \n     PHMSA to ensure that the risk-based safety programs are \n     effective. The NTSB believes that . . . PHMSA must establish \n     an aggressive oversight program that thoroughly examines each \n     operator's decision-making process for each element of its \n     integrity management program.\n\n  Doubling the number of inspectors will still require each inspector \nto oversee more than 1,000 miles of pipeline, but the thoroughness of \ninspection and oversight will be far greater.\n  Second, this legislation will require deployment of electronic valves \ncapable of automatically shutting off the gas in a fire or other \nemergency.\n  I was shocked to learn that it took hours to turn off the gas in San \nBruno.\n  Manually operated valves had to be located, buildings had to be \nopened, and workers had to physically turn off the valves. Every minute \nthat passed, a flaming inferno burned on.\n  In today's era we have electronic water faucets, and furnaces all \ndeploy electronic valves to shut off the supply of natural gas in an \nemergency.\n  If electronic valves can be deployed in our homes and offices, I \nbelieve they should be deployed on gas pipelines pumping millions of \ncubic feet of fuel through urban areas. Gas pipeline safety technology \nshould be brought into the modern era.\n  Third, this legislation will require inspections by ``smart pigs'' in \nall pipes, or the use of an inspection method certified to be equally \neffective at finding corrosion.\n  Department of Transportation accident statistics over the past \ndecade, 2000-2009, identify corrosion as the leading cause of all \nreported pipeline accidents.\n  We need to inspect our pipes to find problems before they cause \ndeadly explosions. Every pipe needs effective inspection, regardless of \nage or design.\n  Fourth, if natural gas pipelines cannot be inspected using the most \neffective inspection technology, this bill would require operation at \nlower pressure.\n  This precautionary approach to pipeline operations assures that \npipelines more likely to have undetected problems are operated at lower \nrisk.\n  Department of Transportation experts believe that a breach or other \nmajor problem with a pipeline operating at lower pressure is more \nlikely to produce a leak instead of a catastrophic or deadly explosion.\n  The cause of the San Bruno pipeline fire remains under investigation, \nbut we know that this pipe could not be inspected using the most modern \nsmart pigs, and we know it was operating at high pressure.\n  Had this law been in place, either this pipe would have been \ninspected by other means certified to be just as effective as a smart \npig, or it would have been operating at a pressure far less likely to \ncause the kind of catastrophe we saw.\n  Fifth, this legislation will require the Secretary of Transportation \nto consider pipe age and the seismicity of an area when identifying \npipelines deserving the highest level of safety oversight.\n  Today, regulators consider a pipeline's proximity to homes and \nbuildings. Other risk factors, such as age of pipe, are not a defining \nconsideration.\n  We know in San Bruno that this pipe was very old.\n  This old pipe had unique twists and turns, and numerous welds that I \nwas told would not be allowed on a pipe installed today. NTSB \nidentified failed welds as the cause of another major pipeline disaster \nin 2009, so these deserve special attention.\n  Sixth, this legislation would require standards for natural gas leak \ndetection equipment and methods to identify pipeline leaks as \nexpeditiously as technologically possible.\n  In San Bruno, some have asserted that they smelled gas for weeks. \nRecords are still being checked to determine whether consumers reported \nthese leaks, but no equipment on the pipeline clearly demonstrates that \nno leak existed.\n  Finally, this legislation adopts a number of commonsense provisions \nproposed last week by Secretary of Transportation LaHood to improve \npipeline safety, including increasing civil penalties for safety \nviolations; expending data collection to be included in the national \npipeline mapping system; closing jurisdictional loopholes to assure \ngreater oversight of unregulated pipelines; and requiring consideration \nof a firm's safety record when considering its request for regulatory \nwaivers.\n  Senator Boxer and I introduce this legislation today in order to \ninitiate quick action to make our pipeline system safer.\n  We have put forward our best ideas to improve inspection, address old \npipes, and advance modern safety technology. We hope to improve these \nideas as new information comes forward about the San Bruno accident.\n  We look forward to working with the Department of Transportation and \nthe Senate Commerce Committee to move and improve this legislation \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3824\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Strengthening \nPipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of 2010 today along with my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein.\n  On September 9, 2010, San Bruno, California suffered a terrible \ntragedy when a natural gas transmission pipeline unexpectedly exploded \nbeneath a busy residential neighborhood.\n  The catastrophic explosion and the resulting fire was a horrific \nevent, creating a massive fireball that many described as the largest \nearthquake they had ever felt.\n  The tragedy killed four people, injured 66, and destroyed nearly \nthree\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\ndozen homes. Preliminary estimates put the cost of the damage and \nrecovery at $65 million.\n  This tragic incident should not have happened.\n  Californians and all Americans must feel confident that their \ncommunities are safe and that the regulatory agencies responsible for \nensuring the safety of natural gas pipelines are doing everything \npossible to guarantee their safety.\n  That is why we are introducing this legislation today. Our bill is \nbased on the Department of Transportation's, DOT, proposal for \nimproving pipeline safety and includes additional provisions to address \nconcerns raised by the San Bruno blast.\n  The Strengthening Pipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of 2010 will \nincrease the number of Federal inspectors and require the Department of \nTransportation to certify an inspection method for gas lines that \ncannot use ``smart pig'' technology. ``Smart pig'' technology is used \nto test the structural integrity of a pipe and identify any defects.\n  The bill would also require DOT to promulgate regulations for the \ninstallation of automatic and remote shutoff valves, update the \ndefinition of ``high consequence areas'' to include seismicity of the \narea, age of the pipe and whether a pipe is able to use the ``smart \npig'' technology, and require DOT to set standards for detecting leaks \non natural gas lines.\n  This legislation strengthens pipeline safety standards to ensure that \na tragedy like this never happens again. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation and work for final passage as quickly as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. RISCH (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 3825. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to remove \ncertain portions of the distinct population segment of the Rocky \nMountain gray wolf from the list of threatened species or the list of \nendangered species published under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I come here today on behalf of myself and \nmy colleague, Senator Crapo, from Idaho to introduce the State Wolf \nManagement Act. This act as drawn is aimed at some particular issues we \nhave in Idaho with the management of wolves, and that other adjoining \nStates that share Idaho's boundaries have with the Federal Government.\n  First of all, I want to thank the Governor of the great State of \nIdaho, the Honorable Butch Otter, for his assistance in crafting this \nbill. I can tell you, Governor Otter, as the chief executive of Idaho, \nhis predecessor, who happens to be yours truly, and my predecessor, as \nGovernors of the great State of Idaho have all joined in the effort to \nobtain delisting of the wolf in Idaho. That is particularly true as we \nattempt to wrest management of this particular species away from the \nFederal Government.\n  What the act does is it identifies as a distinct population a segment \nof the gray wolf population. Specifically, it identifies this specific \npopulation in eastern Washington and eastern Oregon, in which there are \nfew if any wolves, and the State of Montana and the State of Idaho, all \nof those States in which there are a lot of wolves and indeed are too \nmany wolves.\n  First of all, let me say, the official estimates, in 2008, for Idaho \nare that there were 846 wolves in Idaho, with 39 breeding pairs. \nVirtually everyone in the State agrees that estimate is very low. In \nthe year 2010, again virtually everyone agrees there are well over \n1,000 gray wolves in Idaho and well over 39 breeding pairs.\n  How did we get to where we are?\n  Wolves have been gone from the State of Idaho and adjoining areas for \nmany years. In 1995, someone--I cannot identify who--in their infinite \nwisdom, who lived back here on the banks of the Potomac River, decided \nwe in Idaho needed wolves again.\n  The State of Idaho was indeed not very happy about the decision. The \nchief executive of the State, the executive branch of the State, the \nlegislative branch of the State, and the vast majority of Idahoans were \nabsolutely opposed to reintroducing wolves back into the State of \nIdaho.\n  After litigation, and after the usual things you go through, \nnonetheless, 34 wolves were captured in Canada and brought to the State \nof Idaho and introduced into the State of Idaho against the objections \nof almost everyone. Indeed, there was a group of people who did want to \nsee wolves brought to Idaho, and they got their way.\n  To give you a little bit of background as to what happened, we in the \nState of Idaho are very proud of our big game management. Under common \nlaw in this country, and indeed in England before this country, all \nwild game belonged to the sovereign. The United States of America is \nprobably surprised to hear they are not the sovereign, that indeed the \nStates are the sovereign. As a result of that, over the centuries--the \ncouple of centuries we have been in existence as the United States of \nAmerica--litigation after litigation has determined that indeed all \nwildlife in the State belongs to the sovereign; that is, the State in \nwhich they are located.\n  Idaho has a long and proud history and culture of hunting and outdoor \nlife. We have managed our wildlife to the point that we are getting--or \nhad been getting--the maximum out of our wildlife for big game harvest \nevery year. Before Europeans inhabited Idaho, there were very few deer \nand even less elk. Elk were a plains species. They were not a mountain \nspecies. After settlement of the State, the elk were pretty much \nremoved from the plains and took up residence in the mountains, where \nthey have done very well and adapted very well.\n  Again, over the years, the premier species in Idaho, as determined by \nthe people of the State of Idaho, has been elk. Elk are difficult to \nmanage; that is, they are not as easy to manage as deer. They are not \nas prolific as deer. As a result, they require relatively intensive \nmanagement.\n  As a result, the State has broken into many different game units for \nelk, and each of these units is carefully managed by the fish and game \ndepartment to determine the birthrate of the elk each year and the \nsurvival rate over the winter and a determination of how many elk can \nbe harvested. As a result, we have had a robust and relatively stable \npopulation of elk in the State of Idaho.\n  Fast forward to 1995. The Federal Government released its 34 wolves \ninto the State of Idaho, and contrary to what some people believe, they \nare not vegetarians. Also contrary to what some people believe, they \nneed to eat every day. And when they eat, they eat our elk.\n  As a result, there has been considerable depredation on our elk herds \nand for that matter on domestic livestock. The domestic livestock \nlosses are not large in number, unless, of course, it is your livestock \nthey are preying on, of which a number of us in the livestock business \nhave experienced losses in that regard.\n  Back to the elk. We want to continue to manage our elk. We want to \ncontinue to manage our deer. Indeed, we manage a lot of big game \nspecies. We manage moose, we manage bears, we manage cats, we manage \nall big game in the State of Idaho and do a pretty decent job of that.\n\n  On top of the Federal Government's introduction of these 34 wolves \ninto Idaho, which have now exploded into 1,000 wolves, with regulations \nthat at the outset were very, very intrusive, to the point where you \ncouldn't shoot wolves--even if you found them attacking your livestock, \nit was unlawful to take a wolf. Of course, the regulations that were \nimposed on us by the Federal Government have created a considerable \namount of animosity and bad blood.\n  What we want at this point is the ability to manage the wolves just \nas we manage every other population of big game and animal species in \nIdaho. The fact is that the wolves are there. They are going to be \nthere. We obviously made the effort at the outset to not have them. We \ndid our best to keep them out. We lost that fight, so now we have to \naccept the fact that they are there. But the fact that they are there \ndoes not mean that we, in the sovereign State of Idaho, should not have \nthe ability to manage our own game species.\n  Recently, because the numbers have exploded in the amount that they \nhave--when I was Governor, I pressed\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to start the delisting process, \nwhich happened on my watch. The start of the delisting happened on my \nwatch as Governor. As time went on, my successor, Governor Otter, did \nan excellent job of continuing to press the case for delisting. After \nall, the Federal Government has absolutely no business in the State of \nIdaho dealing with wolves other than the hook it has of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. To argue that a species that has been introduced--34 of \nthem--and then explodes to well over 1,000 is endangered simply flies \nin the face of not only science, but it also flies in the face of \nlogic.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what we were told and what we were promised \nby the Federal Government at the time they brought in the wolves. They \ntold us that once we got to the point of 300 wolves and got to the \npoint of 30 breeding pairs, the party was over and they would delist. \nWell, we reached that point in 3 years, and we have been trying to \ndelist ever since. We got them delisted. The matter went to court. We \nactually had a hunting season last year. But now it has gone back to \ncourt, and, again, those who are trying to protect the number of \nwolves, to the great disadvantage of elk, won again, and they got the \njudge to order that the wolves be listed again in Idaho and Montana.\n  That is as a result of a dispute the State of Wyoming also has with \nthe Federal Government, and they have been unable to reach an agreement \nas to how wolves should be managed. The Federal Government, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, and the Department of the Interior were perfectly \nhappy with the plans from Idaho and Montana, but because they have been \nunable to settle with Wyoming, we now find ourselves at a tremendous \ndisadvantage. This simply isn't fair.\n  This bill will very simply turn management of the wolves back over to \nthe State of Idaho unless and until the time that the Federal \nGovernment can again or can ever claim that they are an endangered \nspecies. When that happens, the State again will be subject to the \nlawsuits that will inevitably come if, indeed, they are endangered. But \nin the meantime, I will urge every Senator to vote for this bill. This \nis a States rights issue. We are a sovereign State. We are entitled to \ntake over management of these wolves. I can promise everyone that the \nState of Idaho will do a substantially better job, a cheaper job, and a \nmuch more efficient job of managing the wolves in the State of Idaho \nthan the Federal Government could ever do or will ever do, and we will \nbe able to do it with due deference to all the other species in the \nState of Idaho.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3827.

Johnson established the \n     President's Commission on White House Fellowships, through \n     Executive Order 11183 (as amended), to create a program that \n     would select between 11 and 19 outstanding young citizens of \n     the United States every year and bring them to Washington, \n     D.C. for ``first hand, high-level experience in the workings \n     of the Federal Government, to establish an era when the young \n     men and women of America and their government belonged to \n     each other--belonged to each other in fact and in spirit'';\n       Whereas the White House Fellows Program has steadfastly \n     remained a nonpartisan program that has served 9 Presidents \n     exceptionally well;\n       Whereas the 672 White House Fellows who have served have \n     established a legacy of leadership in every aspect of our \n     society, including appointments as cabinet officers, \n     ambassadors, special envoys, deputy and assistant secretaries \n     of departments and senior White House staff, election to the \n     House of Representatives, Senate, and State and local \n     governments, appointments to the Federal, State, and local \n     judiciary, appointments as United States Attorneys, \n     leadership in many of the largest corporations and law firms \n     in the United States, service as presidents of colleges and \n     universities, deans of our most distinguished graduate \n     schools, officials in nonprofit organizations, distinguished \n     scholars and historians, and service as senior leaders in \n     every branch of the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas this legacy of leadership is a resource that has \n     been relied upon by the Nation during major challenges, \n     including organizing resettlement operations following the \n     Vietnam War, assisting with the national response to \n     terrorist attacks, managing the aftermath of natural \n     disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, providing \n     support to earthquake victims in Haiti, performing military \n     service in Iraq and Afghanistan, and reforming and innovating \n     the national and international securities and capital \n     markets;\n       Whereas the 672 White House Fellows have characterized \n     their post-Fellowship years with a lifetime commitment to \n     public service, including creating a White House Fellows \n     Community of Mutual Support for leadership at every level of \n     government and in every element of our national life; and\n       Whereas September 1, 2010, marked the 45th anniversary of \n     the first class of White House Fellows to serve this Nation: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 45th anniversary of the White House \n     Fellows program and commends the White House Fellows for \n     their continuing lifetime commitment to public service;\n       (2) acknowledges the legacy of leadership provided by White \n     House Fellows over the years in their local communities, the \n     Nation, and the world; and\n       (3) expresses appreciation and support for the continuing \n     leadership of White House Fellows in all aspects of our \n     national life in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7361-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7361-S7362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4654.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 550, S. 3107.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3107) to amend title 28, United States Code, to \n     provide for an increase, effective December 1, 2010, in the \n     rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected \n     disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity \n     compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, as chairman of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 3107/\nH.R. 4667, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of \n2010. This measure would direct the Secretary of Veterans\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\nAffairs to increase, effective December 1, 2010, the rates of veterans' \ncompensation to keep pace with the rising cost of living in this \ncountry. The rate adjustment is equal to that provided on an annual \nbasis to Social Security recipients and is based on the Consumer Price \nIndex.\n  Congress regularly enacts legislation that would provide for a cost-\nof-living adjustment for veterans' compensation in order to ensure that \ninflation does not erode the purchasing power of the veterans and their \nfamilies who depend upon this income to meet their daily needs. The \n2011 COLA has not yet been determined.\n  The COLA affects, among other benefits, veterans' disability \ncompensation and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving \nspouses and children. Many of the recipients of those benefits depend \nupon these tax-free payments not only to provide for their own basic \nneeds, but those of their spouses and children as well. Without a COLA \nincrease, these veterans and their families would see the value of \ntheir hard-earned benefits slowly diminish if there was an increase in \ninflation. If there is an increase in inflation, we in Congress would \nbe neglecting our duty to ensure that those who sacrificed so much for \nthis country receive the benefits and services to which they are \nentitled.\n  It is important that we view veterans' compensation, including the \nCOLA, and indeed all benefits earned by veterans, as a continuing cost \nof war. It is clear that the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwill continue to result in injuries and disabilities that will yield an \nincrease in claims for compensation. Currently, there are more than 3.1 \nmillion veterans in receipt of VA disability compensation.\n  Disbursement of disability compensation to our Nation's veterans \nconstitutes one of the central missions of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. It is a necessary measure of appreciation afforded to those \nveterans whose lives were forever altered by their service to this \ncountry.\n  I urge our colleagues to support passage of this COLA bill. I also \nask our colleagues for their continued support for our Nation's \nveterans.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time; that the Veterans Affairs Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of H.R. 4667, which is the companion measure \nfrom the House, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; \nthat the bill, H.R. 4667, be read the third time and passed; further, \nthat S. 3107 be returned to the calendar; that the motions to \nreconsider be laid on the table, with no intervening action or debate, \nand that any statements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The bill (H.R. 4667) was ordered to be read a third time, was read \nthe third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "22", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/22/senate-section/article/S7364-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   99-YEAR TRIBAL LEASE AUTHORITY ACT\n\n  Mr. REID.
