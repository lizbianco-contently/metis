Madam President, the American people are making their \nvoices heard in the debate over health care. One of the things they are \ndemanding is that we do something to lower costs. This is why the \nproponents of a government takeover never fail to mention lowering \ncosts as one of their primary goals. Yet, more and more, Americans are \nbeginning to ask themselves a very simple question: How can more \ngovernment lead to lower costs?\n  They look at Medicare, a government-run health care program that's \nnearly bankrupt, and they don't understand how an even bigger, more \ncomplicated government-run health plan won't end up in the same \ncondition--and they certainly don't understand why the administration \nwould propose cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to \nhelp pay for this massive new government-run plan.\n  Yet, this is precisely what some are proposing: that we use Medicare \nas a\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\npiggy bank to pay a significant portion of the administration's plan \nfor health care reform. Well, in my view, it's a terrible idea, and on \nthe 44th anniversary of this vital program that roughly 40 million \nAmericans rely on each day, I think it is important to explain why.\n  Here is how one of the proposed cuts would work. Right now, if a \nsenior citizen on Medicare needs surgery, his or her hospital stay will \nlikely be covered by Medicare. And because health care costs go up each \nyear, Medicare provides for annual increases that ensure that hospitals \nand other providers are able to keep pace with inflation.\n  What the administration and some Democrats in Congress are now \nproposing is that we reduce or even eliminate this annual increase--\nthus, cutting the amount of money we spend on Medicare, a drastic \nmeasure that could have a serious impact on our hospitals and the \ncommunities and patients they serve.\n  It would be one thing if these cuts were being proposed as a way of \nstrengthening Medicare. The simple fact is that Medicare faces \nsignificant challenges that must be addressed. When Medicare Part A--\nthe program that pays for hospital stays--was enacted, 44 years ago \ntoday, it was projected that in 1990 this program would spend $9.1 \nbillion on hospital services and related administration. As it turned \nout, spending in 1990 totaled almost $67 billion--or more than seven \ntimes the original prediction. These exploding costs have taken a toll \non the program's bottom line. Today, Medicare is already spending more \nthan it is taking in, and it is expected to be insolvent in just 8 \nyears. Unfortunately, the administration plans to use Medicare cuts in \norder to fund yet another new government program.\n  America's seniors don't want politicians in Washington tampering with \nMedicare to pay for health care reform. They want us to fix it. I get \nletters almost every day from some of the nearly 700,000 Kentuckians \nwho have Medicare. They are counting on it in the years ahead, and they \nare worried about its future. In my view, we have a serious obligation \nto make sure it's there for them. Unfortunately, the administration's \nproposal takes the wrong approach.\n  Just yesterday, the Joint Economic Committee completed a study on the \nadministration's proposed cuts to Medicare. It found that if these cuts \nwere used to restore Medicare rather than to fund a government takeover \nof health care, the Medicare trust fund's 75-year unfunded liability \nwould be reduced by 15 percent, or more than $2 trillion, and that it \nwould delay the trust fund's bankruptcy by 2 years. In short, while any \nsavings from a reformed Medicare would strengthen it for a longer \nperiod of time were they put back into the current program, this just \nhighlights how important overall reform is to ensuring that Medicare \ncontinues to serve our seniors.\n  This is why I have argued for weeks that any savings from Medicare \nshould be put back into the program. And this is why I have also \nrepeatedly urged the administration and my colleagues in the Senate to \nmove forward on the bipartisan Conrad-Gregg proposal, which would \nprovide a clear pathway for fixing the problems in Medicare and other \nimportant entitlement programs. Conrad-Gregg would force us to get debt \nand spending under control. It is the best way to reform Medicare. It \ndeserves the support of every Member of Congress.\n  Doctors and hospitals across the country are worried about what these \nproposed cuts in Medicare would mean for them and their patients. \nEarlier this year, the Kentucky Hospital Association warned that the \nkinds of cuts being considered in Washington would seriously impact the \nservices hospitals currently provide to seniors in my State. I would \nencourage my colleagues to talk to seniors, doctors, and medical \nprofessionals in their own States and see what they're saying. My guess \nis that it's a lot different than what some of the lobbyists and \ninterest groups here in Washington are saying.\n  Some in Congress seem to be in such a rush to pass just any reform, \nrather than the right reform, that they are looking everywhere for the \nmoney to pay for it--even if it means sticking it to seniors with cuts \nto Medicare. If there was ever a program that needed to be put on a \nsounder financial footing it is medicare. And yet throughout the debate \nover health care, we don't seem to be focusing our attention on this \nvital issue. Instead, the same people who are unwilling to make the \nhard choices that are needed to fix Medicare now want us to trust them \nto create a new government program that will inevitably suffer from \nthese same problems. It just doesn't add up, and Americans are \nbeginning to realize it.\n  So on this anniversary, here is my message: Using massive cuts to \nMedicare as a way to pay for more government-run health care isn't the \nkind of change Americans are looking for. Americans want savings from \nMedicare to be used to strengthen Medicare, not to create a system that \nwould increase long-term health care costs, force Americans off the \ninsurance they have and like, and lead to a government takeover of \nhealth care that has the same fiscal problems that Medicare has.\n  Forty-four years ago today, President Johnson signed Medicare into \nlaw, saying that our Nation would never ``refuse the hand of justice to \nthose who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and labor'' to \ntheir Nation. Those of us in Congress have a responsibility to fulfill \nthat vow. And the best way to do so is to work together on reforms that \naddress the real problems in our health care system, problems like the \nones we see with Medicare.\n  I have been encouraged, as lawmakers on both sides, and even the \nPresident, have acknowledged that the reform proposals we have seen so \nfar are not where they need to be. Strengthening Medicare to make sure \nit meets the needs of seniors today and in the years to come would be a \nvery good place to start.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8502-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8502-S8504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have a statement to make about the \nPresident's nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be Associate Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Even though Judge Sotomayor's political and judicial philosophy may \nbe different from mine, especially regarding second amendment rights, I \nwill vote to confirm her because she is well qualified by experience, \ntemperament, character, and intellect to serve as an Associate Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In 2005, I said on this floor that it was wrong for then-Senator \nObama and half the Democratic Senators to vote against John Roberts--a \nsuperbly qualified nominee--solely because they disagreed with what \nSenator Obama described as Roberts' ``overarching political \nphilosophy'' and ``his work in the White House and the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office'' that ``consistently sided'' with ``the strong in \nopposition to the weak.'' Today, it would be equally wrong for me to \nvote against Judge Sotomayor solely because she is not ``on my side'' \non some issues.\n  Courts were never intended to be political bodies composed of judges \n``on your side'' who would reliably tilt your way in controversial \ncases. Courts are supposed to do just the opposite: decide difficult \ncases with impartiality.\n  The oath Judge Sotomayor has taken twice and will take again when she \nis sworn in as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court says it best:\n\n       . . . I will administer justice without respect to persons, \n     and do equal right to the poor and to the rich and . . . I \n     will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the \n     duties incumbent upon me . . . under the Constitution and \n     laws of the United States.\n\n  During her confirmation hearings, Judge Sotomayor expressly rejected \nthen-Senator Obama's view that in a certain percentage of judicial \ndecisions, ``the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in a \njudge's heart . . . and [in] the depth and breadth of one's empathy.'' \nIn answer to a question from Senator Kyl, she said in her confirmation \nhearing:\n\n       I can only explain what I think judges should do, which is \n     judges can't rely on what's in their heart. They don't \n     determine the law. Congress makes the laws. The job of a \n     judge is to apply the law. And so it's not the heart that \n     compels conclusions in cases. It's the law. The judge applies \n     the law to the facts before that judge.\n\n  Giving broad Senate approval to obviously well-qualified nominees \nhelps\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\nto increase the prestige of the Supreme Court and to confirm its \nimpartiality. For that reason, until the last few years, Republican and \nDemocratic Senators, after rigorous inquiries into the fitness of \nnominees, usually have given those well-qualified nominees an \noverwhelming vote of approval. For example, no Justice on the Supreme \nCourt that John Roberts joined in 2005 had received more than nine \nnegative votes. Four were confirmed unanimously. All but three \nRepublican Senators voted for Justice Ginsburg, a former general \ncounsel of the American Civil Liberties Union. Every single Democratic \nSenator voted to confirm Justice Scalia.\n  In truly extraordinary cases, Senators, of course, reserve the \nprerogative, as I do, to vote no or even to vote to deny an up-or-down \nvote.\n  During the 8 years I was Governor of Tennessee, I appointed about 50 \njudges. In doing so, I looked for the same qualities Justice Roberts \nand Judge Sotomayor have demonstrated: intelligence, good character, \nrestraint, respect for law, and respect for those who came before the \ncourt. I did not ask one applicant how he or she would rule on abortion \nor immigration or taxation. I appointed the first female circuit judge \nin our State and the first African-American court chancellor and the \nfirst African-American State supreme court justice. I appointed both \nDemocrats and Republicans. That process served our State well and \nhelped to build respect for the independence and fairness of our \njudiciary.\n  In the same way, it is my hope that my vote now will not only help to \nconfirm a well-qualified nominee but will help to return the Senate to \nthe practice only recently lost of inquiring diligently into \nqualifications of a nominee and then accepting that elections have \nconsequences, one of which is to confer upon the President of the \nUnited States the constitutional right to nominate Justices of the \nSupreme Court.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord my floor remarks in support of Judge John Roberts on September \n27, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\nFloor Remarks of U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander in Support of Judge John \n                      Roberts, September 27, 2005\n\n        My constituents have been asking me: who will President \n     Bush nominate for the second Supreme Court vacancy? And the \n     question reminds me of the kicker from California who went to \n     Alabama to play for Coach Bear Bryant. Day after day in \n     practice, the kicker kept punting it more than 70 yards. Day \n     after day, Bryant never said a word. Finally, the young man \n     went to Bryant. Coach, I came all the way here from \n     California to be coached by you and you never say a word to \n     me. ``Son,'' Bryant said, ``When you start kicking it less \n     than 70 yards, I will remind you of what you were doing when \n     you kicked it 70 yards.''\n       My only respectful suggestion to President Bush is that he \n     try to remember what he was thinking when he appointed John \n     Roberts, and to do it again. For anyone who has been trained \n     in the law, as I have, and who knows something about the \n     profession, it has been a pleasure to watch Judge Roberts' \n     nomination and his confirmation process. It is difficult to \n     overstate how good Judge Roberts seems to be. He has the \n     resume of most talented law students' dreams: editor of the \n     Harvard Law Review and clerk to Judge Henry Friendly. I was a \n     law clerk to Judge John Minor Wisdom in New Orleans who \n     regarded Henry Friendly as one of the two or three best \n     appellate judges of the last century. Judge Roberts learned \n     from Judge Friendly. Then he was law clerk to the last Chief \n     Justice. Add to that his work in the Solicitor General's \n     office where only the best of the best are invited to work. \n     Then add his success as an advocate before the Supreme Court \n     both in private and in public practice. Then still further \n     add his demeanor, his modesty both in philosophy and in \n     person--something that is not always so evident in a person \n     of superior intelligence and great accomplishment. And his \n     kindnesses to individuals with whom he has worked. His \n     performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     demonstrated all of those qualities: restraint, good humor, \n     intelligence, and a command of the body of law that a Supreme \n     Court justice must consider. The televised episodes could be \n     the basis for a law school course or any civics class.\n       Judge Roberts brings, as he repeatedly said, no agenda to \n     the Supreme Court. He understands that he did not write the \n     Constitution, and it's not his job to rewrite it but to \n     interpret it. That he does not make laws, but is obligated to \n     apply them. He understands the federal system.\n       For a devotee of the law, watching the John Roberts \n     hearings was like watching Michael Jordan play basketball at \n     the University of North Carolina in the early 1980s or Chet \n     Atkins as a session guitarist in the 1950s in Nashville. One \n     doesn't have to be a great student of the law to recognize \n     there is unusual talent here.\n       So then if Judge Roberts' professional qualifications and \n     temperament are so universally acclaimed why do we now hear \n     so much talk of changing the rules and voting only for those \n     justices who we can be assured are ``on our side.'' That \n     would be the wrong direction for our country. In the first \n     place, history teaches us that those who try to predict how \n     Supreme Court nominees will decide cases are almost always \n     wrong. Felix Frankfurter surprised Franklin Roosevelt. Hugo \n     Black surprised the South. David Souter surprised almost \n     everybody.\n       In the second place, courts were never intended to be set \n     up as political bodies that could be relied upon to always \n     tilt one way or another in controversial matters. Courts are \n     supposed to do just the opposite: to hear the facts and \n     impartially apply the law and the Constitution in \n     controversial matters. Who will have confidence in a system \n     of justice that is deliberately rigged to be on one side or \n     the other despite what the facts and the law are?\n       Finally, failing to give overwhelming approval to an \n     obviously well-qualified nominee like Judge Roberts just \n     because he is ``not on your side'' reduces the prestige of \n     the Court. It jeopardizes its independence. It makes it less \n     effective as it seeks to perform its indispensable role in \n     our constitutional republic.\n       For these three reasons Republican and Democratic senators, \n     after rigorous hearings and discussions, have traditionally \n     given well-qualified nominees for Supreme Court justice an \n     overwhelming vote of approval. I'm not talking about the \n     ancient past, I'm speaking of justices who are on the Court \n     today, none of whom are better qualified than Judge Roberts.\n       Justice Breyer--Confirmed by a vote of 87-9 in a Congress \n     composed of 57 Democrats and 43 Republicans.\n       Justice Ginsburg--Confirmed by a vote of 96-3 in that same \n     Congress.\n       Justice Souter--Confirmed by a vote of 90-9 in a Congress \n     composed of 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans.\n       Justice Kennedy--Confirmed by a vote of 97-0 in a Congress \n     composed of 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans.\n       Justice Scalia--Confirmed by a vote of 98-0 in a Congress \n     composed of 47 Democrats and 53 Republicans.\n       Justice O'Connor--Confirmed by a vote of 99-0 in a Congress \n     composed of 46 Democrats and 53 Republicans.\n       Justice Stevens--Confirmed by a vote of 98-0 in a Congress \n     composed of 61 Democrats and 37 Republicans.\n       The only close vote on this Court was for the nomination of \n     Justice Thomas following questions of alleged misconduct by \n     the nominee. Thomas was confirmed by a vote of 52-48. \n     However, even in that vote, 11 Democrats crossed the aisle to \n     support the nominee.\n       If almost all Republican senators can vote for Justice \n     Ginsburg, a former General Counsel for the American Civil \n     Liberties Union, and a nominee who declined to answer \n     numerous questions so as not to jeopardize the independence \n     of the court on cases that might come before her, and if \n     every single Democratic U.S. senator could vote for Justice \n     Scalia--then why can't virtually every senator in this \n     chamber vote to confirm Judge Roberts?\n       I was governor for eight years in Tennessee. I appointed \n     about fifty judges. I looked for the same qualities Judge \n     Roberts has demonstrated: intelligence, good character, \n     restraint, respect for the law, and respect for those who \n     came before the court. I did not ask one applicant how he or \n     she would rule on abortion or immigration or taxation. I \n     appointed the first woman circuit judge, as well as men.

Madam President, health care reform is a very personal \nmatter for me and a personal matter for so many people in my State. I \nfirst got interested in this issue, as I think many of us did, after \nsomething happened to me when my daughter was born. When she was born, \nshe was very sick. She could not swallow. Back then, insurance \ncompanies had a rule that new moms and their babies were kicked out \nafter 24 hours. After she had been in intensive care, I was kicked out \nof the hospital after 24 hours. As my husband wheeled me out in a \nwheelchair, I remember thinking: This wouldn't have happened to the \nwife of the head of the insurance company, but it happened to me.\n  I went to the legislature, along with a lot of other mothers, and \nsaid we have to change this to at least guarantee new moms and their \nbabies a 48-hour hospital stay. Minnesota was one of the first States \nin the country to adopt that rule, which later, under President Bill \nClinton, became national policy.\n  I remember going to the legislature and standing there at the \nconference committee, and some of the insurance companies were there \ntrying to make sure the implementation of this 48-hour rule was \ndelayed. I decided to take all the pregnant women I knew to the \nconference committee. We outnumbered the lobbyists two to one. So when \nthe legislators said, When should this new bill take effect which \nguarantees new moms and babies 48 hours, all the pregnant moms said, \n``Now.'' And that is what happened. That is my experience, and that is \nhow I got involved in this issue.\n  As I have traveled our State, I have heard from Minnesotans about the \nimportance of doing something about health care. They want cost-\neffective health care. We have one of the best health care systems in \nthe country. The President has lauded Minnesota. We know it is good. We \nhave something like 93 percent coverage, and it tends to be run a lot \nmore efficiently.\n  But still there are people in my State, as there are all over the \ncountry, who are saying: We can't have the status quo because we know \nour premiums are going up and up. Maybe we can afford it this year, but \nwe are not going to be able to afford it next year; or, if I lose my \njob, I am not going to have health care tomorrow.\n  That is what the people in my State are saying. I heard from Dawn in \nStaples, MN, who is struggling to afford the prescription drugs \nnecessary to treat her multiple sclerosis, and John in Oakdale, MN, who \nhas insurance for his wife and three sons but ends up paying thousands \nof dollars in deductibles and coinsurance if one of his boys gets sick.\n  Meanwhile, a new study by the White House Council of Economic \nAdvisers found that small businesses pay up to more than 18 percent--18 \npercent more--to provide health insurance for their employees, often \nforcing these businesses to lay off employees or cut back on their \ncoverage.\n  I was up in Two Harbors, MN, about a month ago visiting a little \nbackpack company that has done amazing things. They are actually making \nsome of the backpacks now for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. They \nsaid that their health care premiums now are something like $20,000 for \na family of four--small businesses paying that much, for one family, \nfor health care insurance. It cannot go on.\n  I was down in southern Minnesota in the southeastern corner of our \nState and met with one of the clinic heads there, someone who heads up \none of the hospitals in Wisconsin and Minnesota. He said they had three \nemergency appendectomies in just a 2-week time period and they should \nnot have happened at that point, they should have been caught earlier. \nWhen they talked with the three people who showed up for the emergency \nappendectomies, they said: Why are you here? Two said: We are in small \nbusinesses, and we thought if we came in too early--we thought we could \njust get over this because we were afraid what it would do to the \npremiums. The third person who had the emergency appendectomy said: I \njust don't have the money to pay for this.\n  That is what we are hearing all over our State, in a State that tends \nto have one of the best health care systems in the country.\n  The American people know inaction is not an option. If we do not act, \ncosts will continue to skyrocket and 14,000 Americans will continue to \nlose health insurance every single day. That is the status quo. We must \nnot waiver in our efforts to enact a uniquely American solution to our \nNation's health care problems. We must keep what works and fix what is \nbroken. We must also level the playing field between consumers and \ninsurance companies, preserve choice, expand access, and provide \nsafeguards so that people do not lose their coverage if they lose or \nchange their jobs, have preexisting medical conditions, or simply grow \nolder.\n  As we prepare to take up landmark health reform legislation, many in \nWashington are looking to Minnesota as a national leader. In Minnesota, \nwe have developed a health care system that rewards quality, not \nquantity. It promotes coordinated, integrated care, and it focuses on \nprevention and disease management and controls costs. That is why we \ntend to have healthier people in our State. That is why we tend to have \nmore people covered. That is why we tend to have more quality health \ncare, because we focus on the system as a whole.\n  Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf recently \ntestified before the Senate Budget Committee that to truly contain \nhealth care spending, Congress must change the way Medicare pays \nproviders in an effort to encourage cost-effectiveness in health care.\n  I couldn't agree more. Shifting to a value-based system is critical \nto controlling health care costs. Because you know what--and people \nwould be shocked by this--when you look at States that have some of the \nhighest quality, they tend to have some of the lowest costs, and States \nthat have the highest costs tend to have the lowest quality care. That \nis messed up.\n  Most health care is purchased on a fee-for-service basis, so more \ntests and more surgeries--if not done appropriately, with the patient \nin mind--can mean more money; quantity, not quality, pays. According to \nresearchers at Dartmouth Medical School, nearly $700 billion per year \nis spent on unnecessary or ineffective health care. That is 30 percent \nof total health care spending.\n  To rein in costs we need to have all health care providers aiming for \nhigh-quality, cost-effective results, as they do in Minnesota. That is \nwhy I have introduced legislation, along with Senator Martinez, that \nwould create a value index as part of a formula used to determine \nMedicare's fee schedule. This indexing will help reduce unnecessary \nprocedures because those who produce more volume will need to also \nimprove care or the increased volume will negatively impact fees.\n  To correct myself, that legislation was actually introduced with \nSenator Gregg, and Senator Martinez and I have introduced a bill to \nfocus on Medicare fraud.\n  Linking rewards to the outcomes for the entire payment area creates \nthe incentive for physicians and hospitals to work together to improve \nquality and efficiency. In too many places patients must struggle \nagainst a fragmented delivery system where providers duplicate services \nand sometimes work at cross-purposes.\n  We must also look at other areas where we can help reduce inefficient \nhealth care spending because, in the end, this is about focusing on \nquality care and getting that care to the patients who need it. It is \nfocusing on the patients instead of all the insurance providers and all \nthe other people who feed off the system. It is focusing on what works \nbest for the patients. Recent studies show if all the hospitals in the \ncountry followed the protocol the Mayo Clinic uses in the last 4 years \nof a chronically ill patient's life--lives where the quality index is \nincredibly high--I think most people in this country and their families \nwould love to have that kind of health care. If we used the model the \nMayo Clinic uses, we would save $50 billion every 5 years in Medicare \nspending. That money can be used to bring more people into the system. \nThat money can be used to make health care more affordable for the \npeople of this country.\n  That is what we are talking about when we talk about health care \nreform. The bill we have on Medicare costs and\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\nMedicare fraud--the bill I have with Senator Martinez--would require \ndirect depositing of all payments to providers under Medicare and \nMedicaid so they are not ripping off the system or scamming the system; \nthat it is going to the people who need it. The bill has been endorsed \nby the AARP, the National Association of District Attorneys, and the \nCredit Union National Association. Representative Patrick Murphy is \ncarrying the legislation in the House.\n  It is no small task, but we must reform America's health system. I \nstrongly believe in reaching this goal to reform, making sure we don't \nhave the status quo, where it is becoming harder and harder and harder \nfor people in this country to afford health care. We need a system that \ndepends on rewarding and controlling costs, that rewards quality and \nstopping fraud and making the system work for the people of this \ncountry.\n  For the sake of our fiscal health and for the sake of the millions of \nAmericans struggling to afford the care they need, enacting effective \nhealth care reform in this country is essential. We know it is not easy \nand it will not happen overnight. It is 17 percent of this economy. But \nwe also know that doing nothing and saying no to everything and calling \nthings names, when we are effectively trying to find a solution, is the \nwrong way to go.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will start working on this bill \nconstructively so we can get something done for the people of this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I see the Senator from Nevada is on the \nfloor, and I would like to ask, before I seek recognition here--I would \nbe happy to yield the floor to the Senator, with the understanding that \nI would follow him, if the Senator from Nevada would give me an \nindication of how long he might be speaking.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. At the most, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I thank the assistant leader from the \nDemocratic side, the Senator from Illinois, for that courtesy.\n  I rise today to talk about health care reform. It is critical in our \nsystem that we address the issue of cost. We have the finest quality \nhealth care system in the world, but it is too expensive for too many \nAmericans, and because of that, many Americans are uninsured. Not only \nare too many Americans uninsured, for a lot of folks who have \ninsurance, especially those who receive insurance through their \nemployer, they probably haven't received the kind of raises they would \nhave otherwise received simply because employers are paying more and \nmore for their employees' health insurance and there isn't money left \nover to provide higher wages.\n  It is critical for many reasons that we address the cost issue. We \nspend about $2 trillion a year in the United States on health care. \nSome people say we need to spend more, but I disagree with that. I \nactually think we spend plenty of money in the United States on health \ncare, we just don't spend it in the right ways. We need to eliminate \nwaste and the bureaucratic spending of our health care dollars and get \nthat money to the patients.\n  There are five different committees between the House and the Senate \nthat are working on health care reform proposals--three in the House, \ntwo in the Senate. Let me quickly address the HELP Committee bill, \nwhich is one of the committees in the Senate that has passed a bill. \nThe HELP bill was passed on a straight party line vote. I think the \nreasons for that, which I will point out, are the flaws that are in \nthat bill.\n  First of all, the bill is not paid for. Second of all, it is too \nexpensive and it doesn't cover enough people, especially for the money \nit spends. Two hundred times in the bill the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services is given new powers to establish programs, parameters, \nappropriate moneys, and otherwise dictates the course of one-sixth of \nour economy--200 different times. The HELP bill is around 600 pages. If \neach one of those times where it detailed or gave powers to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services--if that was actually written in \nbill form at that point, the bill would probably have been about 5,000 \npages. That is how incredibly complex our health care system is and how \neven more complex some people are trying to make it.\n\n  This bill creates 50 new offices, bureaus, commissions, programs, and \nbureaucracies, with 87 new government programs created in the Community \nTransformation Grants Program alone. The Democrats rejected by party-\nline vote, an amendment that would have prevented the bill from \nspending funds on sidewalks, parks, bike paths, and street lights. We \nall like those kinds of things. I actually ride bikes. I like to see \nbike paths and things such as that. But certainly there is not a place \nfor that in the health care reform bill that we are trying to work out \nbefore the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  Furthermore, the final cost of the bill has not been released. I \nserve on the Finance Committee, and there is a group of bipartisan \nSenators trying to work together to come up with an agreement. They \nhave not been able to do that, and the big reason for that is they are \ntrying to finalize the details. The details are extraordinarily \nchallenging because of how complex our health care system is today.\n  That is why we need to take our time and get it right. You don't mess \nwith one-sixth of the economy of the United States and get it wrong. \nThere are no do-overs when it comes to health care reform. If we mess \nit up, we literally can mess up our country. We can mess up the economy \nof our country and potentially threaten the very existence of our \nsystem of government because we can bankrupt our country.\n  We all know Medicare and Medicaid are threatening to bankrupt our \nsystem of government as it stands today. All that the HELP Committee \nbill and the other that have been introduced bills do so far, is \naccelerate how fast Medicare and Medicaid can bring economic collapse \nto the United States.\n  I am working on other proposals. There are examples out there where \nthings are being done right in the health care system. I have told this \nstory to my colleagues many times. Safeway is a company that saw their \nhealth care costs skyrocketing year after year. With 200,000 employees, \nthey were spending about $1 billion a year on health care expenses, \nwith costs increasing every year. When a company is only making $200 \nmillion to $300 million a year, and their costs are going up 20 percent \na year, you can see the writing on the wall. They were going to \nbankrupt their company with health care costs alone.\n  Safeway set out on a new course and focused on four areas. They \nincentivized their employees through lower premiums, if they didn't \nsmoke or they would quit smoking, they provided smoke cessation \nproducts. They focused on the area of obesity with weight management. \nIf employees were in the proper body mass index or if they lost weight, \nthey would give them a lower health care premium. They also focused on \ncholesterol and hypertension. They didn't penalize employees for having \nhigh cholesterol, but they rewarded them for keeping their cholesterol \nunder control and they rewarded them for keeping their blood pressure \nunder control.\n  Rewarding healthy choices actually works. Safeway is a very good \nexample. What happened to Safeway in the last 4 years, compared to the \nrest of the United States, is that Safeway has been able to lower their \nhealth care costs by 40 percent.\n  Unfortunately, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the official \nscorekeeper around here and determines how much money is going to be \nsaved, does not have a model that works with something like the Safeway \nprogram. CBO's economic models don't work that way. The bean counters \naround here, unfortunately, don't know how to put that in application \nfor the rest of the country. That is unfortunate because I believe, if \nwe used some of the same modeling Safeway did for the rest of the \ncountry, we could save\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\nhuge amounts of money in our health care system.\n  We don't have to save 40 percent, such as Safeway did. Maybe we could \nsave 10 percent. Actually, if we don't save anything, and just freeze \nthe rate of growth, we would be so far ahead in money that we would \nhave plenty left over to cover the uninsured. As I said, unfortunately, \nthe Congressional Budget Office doesn't say a model like Safeway's will \nsave money. It is ludicrous, though, to believe that having people quit \nsmoking and rewarding them for proper weight management wouldn't save \nmoney. I think we need to change the economic models we have around \nhere.\n  Not only would that save money, but it would also lead to higher \nquality lives. Obesity is an epidemic in the United States. Type II \ndiabetes is rampant. Most Type II diabetics can actually reverse, or at \nleast control their diabetes through diet and exercise. We need to \nencourage healthier behaviors in the United States. Instead of just \nhaving a sick care system, let's actually create a true health care \nsystem in the United States.\n  Another thing we need to do, I believe very strongly--and this is a \nrole for the government--we need to provide transparency on cost and \nquality so individuals can shop. In the bay area, a colonoscopy can \ncost anywhere from $800 to $8,000. Well, if the government were to \nprovide cost and quality measurement information across the United \nStates, people could set up plans and they could see what the various \ncosts are. Let's say that between the $800 and the $8,0000, they might \ndecide to pay $1,200. And then if they want the more expensive one, \nthey have to pay the difference. If they want the less expensive one, \nthey can get the difference. That will cause people to comparison shop \nand they will have the information based on cost and quality of \noutcomes to be able to make smart medical decisions.\n  The one thing we don't want to do is put a bureaucrat between the \ndoctor and the patient making those sorts of decisions. There is a \nprecious relationship between a doctor and a patient, and we don't want \nthe government making those kinds of decisions. I don't want to see a \ngovernment-run plan that says, you know what, we are going to have \nrationing. That is how so many other countries around the world control \ntheir costs. They actually ration care, or there is delayed care. We \nhave better outcomes in the United States on cancer, on cardiovascular \ndisease, and in so many other areas than Canada, Great Britain, and \nother places that have government-run health care plans.\n  I think it is critical we get together as Republicans and Democrats--\nas Americans--and come up with a health care system that is lower in \ncost and even better in quality than we have today. The bills before \nsome of the committees out there are not going to achieve that.\n\n  I have done several telephone townhall meetings in the last couple of \nweeks. We have called almost 200 thousand Nevadans now and talked to \nmany of them. They answered questions. We have gotten their feedback. \nThe one thing that seems not quite unanimous, but from the calls we are \nreceiving it is overwhelming, is that is people do not want a \ngovernment plan. They do not want a government bureaucrat rationing \ntheir health care.\n  Whatever plan we come up with should not include a government-run \nhealth care plan. I feel strongly about that. I think as more and more \nof the American people find out what the effects of a government-run \nplan will be, we will see a lot more opposition coming from them.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Illinois allowing me to go first. Let's \nget together as Americans and do the right thing on health care. Let's \njoin as Republicans, Democrats, and Independents across this country \nand have a health care system that has lower costs and better quality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the Senator from Nevada has just \nexpressed his views on health care, and I would perhaps like to give a \nlittle different view on where we are and where we should go. We are \nwrapping up this end-of-July session. We will be taking a recess for a \nfew weeks. It is one of the few chances during the year for us to be \nback home, get a little time with our families before school starts. We \nare all looking forward to it, as everyone does each year. But we have \nhad important work we have done this year, and more important work is \nto follow.\n  This year we hope to take up before the end of the year, and pass, \nhealth care reform for America. The House of Representatives is moving \na bill, a matter that will be considered in September by the House. We \nare counting on the Finance Committee to work with us to develop a bill \nfor consideration on the floor of the Senate about the same period of \ntime.\n  These bills and the concepts they contain are going to be there \nthroughout the month of August for everyone to take a close look at and \nreview. This is not going to be done in haste because it is too \nimportant. It is going to be there, and the critics will have a chance \nto look at it, people will be able to come up with suggestions--\nconstructive suggestions, I hope--that will lead us to the passage of \nhealth care reform in this country.\n  I listened earlier to my colleague and friend from Nevada, Senator \nEnsign, talk about government-run health care. In my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL, a doctor wrote a letter to the editor warning us about \ngovernment-run health care. I would like to put it in perspective.\n  There are about 300 million people living in our great Nation. Of \nthose 300 million people, 45 million of them are currently covered by \nMedicare. Medicare, for seniors and disabled people in America, is a \ngovernment-run health care plan. For many of these people it is the \nfirst health insurance plan they have ever been covered by.\n  A realtor in southern Illinois came up to me, a woman 63 years old. \nShe said: Senator I want you to meet somebody who has never had health \ninsurance protection one day of her life. I never could afford it. I \nwas a realtor. I didn't have enough money. Knock on wood, lucky for me, \nI have been pretty healthy. I didn't need it. I was able to pay my \nmedical bills. But, she said, thank God in 2 years I will be under \nMedicare so the savings I put aside for my retirement are not going to \nbe wiped out by one illness or one surgery. I will have Medicare.\n  She will join the ranks of 45 million people on a government health \ninsurance plan called Medicare that we have had for 45 years in America \nand is wildly popular. Not one single critic on the other side of the \naisle who stands up and shakes their fist and rails against government \nhealth care has said eliminate Medicare. Of course they would not. That \nis not a position the American people are going to support.\n  Some people are a little confused though. One of my colleagues went \nback home over the weekend and somebody said: Senator, listen; whatever \nyou do, don't let the government start meddling in my Medicare plan.\n  He said: Pardon me, ma'am, but the government runs your Medicare \nplan.\n  She didn't understand that. Some people don't, but that is a fact.\n  So there are 45 million people under Medicare. There are another 65 \nmillion Americans, maybe as high as 70 million, who are covered by \nMedicaid. Medicaid is the health insurance plan for the poorest people \nin America. We said: If you are poor in America, you are still going to \nget health care, and we are going to provide it, working with the \nStates. So more than one-\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\nthird of the people who live in America today are covered by government \nhealth insurance.\n  I have never heard a person on the other side of the aisle say \neliminate Medicaid. They don't. They understand we are a caring, \ncompassionate country, and we are going to provide this health \ninsurance coverage, as we have for decades, as we should.\n  Here we have one-third of America currently under a government health \nplan, and on the other side of the aisle people are waving their fists \nsaying: Whatever you do, don't have a government health plan.\n  It does not work. It is inconsistent. Many people say: I like my \nhealth insurance right now. I don't want to change. I don't want to go \ninto Medicare or Medicaid. I like what I have. Would you please leave \npeople alone.\n  The answer is yes. In fact, we guarantee it. We are going to put in \nany legislation considered by the House and Senate the protection of \nyou, as an individual, to keep the health insurance you have, if that \nis what you want. What we are trying to create are voluntary choices \nand opportunities. These are critically important because, let's face \nit, the cost of health care is going out of sight. We know it. We sense \nit.\n  Some people say: Senator, easy for you to say, you have that famous \nSenator health care plan.\n  We have heard all about that one. Let me set the record straight. \nMembers of Congress, if they choose--and I have chosen on behalf of my \nfamily--can sign up for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It \nis not a special program for Senators or Congressmen. We sign up for \nthe same program that covers Federal employees across the United \nStates, 8 million Federal employees and their families. It is a great \nprogram. That is why I signed up for it for my wife and myself.\n  Open enrollment is once every year. How about that. We get to go \nshopping once every year for the best health insurance for our \nfamilies.\n  What do we choose from? In my case, in Illinois, nine different \nprivate health insurance plans. We pick the one best for our families. \nIf we want a lot of coverage, they take more out of our paychecks; less \ncoverage, less out of our paychecks. But it is a voluntary choice, and \nI think that is what the bottom line should be for Americans.\n  We are trying to move toward that model, create pools of people \nsimilar to Federal employees so they can bargain with the private \ninsurance companies, have good coverage at a reasonable cost. We want \nto build into this as well health insurance reform. What good is it to \nhave a health insurance plan that says they offer coverage for \neverything except our sickness? That happens. People who may have \nturned in a claim last year for an aching back can find this year it is \na preexisting condition; it is not covered.\n  People who, 2 or 3 years ago, may have survived prostate cancer or \nbreast cancer may find no coverage for cancer illness in the future. \nThat is unacceptable. That is not really health insurance. Health \ninsurance isn't worth much if it is not going to cover your illness.\n\n  So we say as part of health care reform they can no longer exclude \npeople for preexisting conditions. They can no longer exclude people \nwho live in certain parts of the country over those who live in other \nparts of the country. They cannot discriminate based on age or \ngeography except within certain limitations. This gets health insurance \nto where it ought to be, not a game where the health insurance \ncompanies try to pick and choose the healthiest people in America and \npush everybody else over the cliff.\n  We want everybody under the tent. We want folks to understand if they \nbuy health insurance in America, it really will protect them.\n  I was interviewed this morning on WMAY, a station in my hometown. Jim \nLeach asked me a question: Senator, if you don't allow insurance \ncompanies to discriminate against people with previous conditions, \nwon't all our premiums go up?\n  The honest answer is, if everybody has health insurance in America, \npremiums can go down. We are not just paying for our care, we are \npaying for the care of the uninsured. Uninsured people in America are \nnot going to die on the street, thank God. They are going to show up in \nan emergency room and they are going to be cared for. When they can't \npay their bills, that hospital, that doctor, will pass their medical \ncharges through the system on to those of us who are paying for health \ninsurance.\n  So if we bring everybody in with health insurance protection, this \ncost transfer is not going to happen. It is going to reduce the upward \npush for health insurance premiums in our country.\n  Second, if we don't have basic rules about health insurance as to \nwhat they will cover, hold on tight. We found out in Illinois not too \nlong ago there were actually health insurance companies--I remember \nthis, as a person working in the Illinois General Assembly--there were \nactually health insurance companies that were selling maternity \ncoverage to new mothers and their children but excluding the newborn \nbaby for the first 30 days of life. Do you know why? Because if you \nhave a premature infant or an infant with a real problem, those first \n30 days of medical care can be very expensive. So they just wrote it \nout of the policy.\n  We said no way. As a matter of policy in Illinois, if they want to \nsell health insurance to cover a family or maternity benefits or cover \nchildren, they do it from the moment that child is born. We put it in \nthe law.\n  We can argue that is going to raise the cost of insurance. Maybe it \ndid. But if health insurance is not there when we need it, frankly, it \nis not worth the cost. That is why we are doing this health care \nreform.\n  There is one other aspect I want to mention, and that is small \nbusiness. I guess small businesspeople know better than any other group \nwhat is happening because these businesses are struggling to survive in \na recession. The men and women who own these businesses in good \nconscience are trying to provide for their employees. Yesterday we had \na gentleman from Aberdeen, MD, who came to speak at a press conference. \nHe owns a moving and storage company. His last name is Derbyshire. Mr. \nDerbyshire inherited this business from his father. He brought his son \nGarrett with him in the hopes his son would carry it on, I am sure. He \nalways felt a special kinship and connection with his employees. He \nwants them to do good work and he wants them to be loyal and he wants \nthem to know they are appreciated. So Mr. Derbyshire pays, as an \nemployer, 85 percent of each individual employee's health care \npremiums--85 percent, and 75 percent of the family's. That is pretty \ngood. I give him an A+ for caring and trying. But he told us he can't \nkeep up with it. Health insurance premiums are going up so fast he \ndoesn't know how long he can do it.\n  I heard the same thing again. I heard it from the man who owns \nStarbucks--which, incidentally, offers health insurance to its \nemployees--who told us not that long ago: We want Congress to do this. \nWe think it is the right thing to do, even for part-time employees. But \nif the costs keep going up we will not be able to continue.\n  That is the reality small businesses face. When we take a look at \nwhat they are facing, last year, only 49 percent of small businesses, \nthree to nine workers, offered health insurance; 78 percent of \nbusinesses with 10 to 24 workers offered some type of health insurance. \nIn contrast, 99 percent of businesses with more than 200 employees \noffer health insurance. It shows if you are operating close to the \nmargin in a small business, and a little added expense pushes you over \nthe edge, one of the first casualties is health insurance protection. \nIt means, incidentally, the employees have no protection. It also means \nthe openers of the business have to go out on the private market.\n  What happens when they go out on the private market? For small \nbusinesses, their choices are limited. The overhead costs, \nadministrative costs are dramatically higher than they are for the \nlarger companies, and many of them cannot afford to do it.\n  What we are trying to do is offer, through health care reform, a way \nfor every person working, for a business, large and small, to have \nhealth insurance. Look at the uninsured people in America and we are \ngoing to find that most of them are not the poorest people in our \ncountry. They have Medicaid. Of course, they are not the luckiest \npeople in the world like myself and other families who already\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\nhave health insurance. They are smack dab in the middle. They are the \npeople working for small businesses, and their children and they are \nthe ones who are uninsured.\n  If we are going to fill the gaps in America and provide for coverage, \nthat is the way we have to go. What are our goals? Our goals are simply \nstated. We want to have health care reform which helps the middle class \nin America. We want to make sure at the end of the day we have stable \ncosts so people know what they can anticipate, so the costs will not \nrun them out of health insurance coverage even if they lose a job. We \nwant to provide a helping hand, for example, to lower income people so \nthey can buy health insurance, giving them a tax break and giving them \nan incentive. We want to provide incentives and opportunities for \nbusinesses so they have the right to shop for the right health \ninsurance coverage. We want to make sure they have stable coverage so \nthese health insurance companies cannot waive the magic wand and all of \na sudden they are not covered by health insurance anymore.\n  Stable costs, stable coverage, and make sure at the end of the day we \nhave quality care available for all Americans.\n  One element we should be rewarding that the current system does not \nreward is preventive care.\n  There are a lot of things we can do to reduce the cost of health care \nin America and improve the health of individuals and families. We need \nto create incentives for that to happen. There are ways to do that.\n  Steve Burd is the CEO of Safeway and of Dominick's. He has a plan for \nhis management employees where they can voluntarily sign up. They go \nthrough a health screening, they identify any risk that person might \nhave: being overweight or diabetic or high blood pressure, high \ncholesterol, things of that nature, smoking. Then they create a little \nprofile and say: What we would like you to do is move toward more \nfitness, better diet, monitoring your diabetes, monitoring your \ncholesterol and your blood pressure.\n  As they show improvement, they earn cash incentives. In other words, \nthey pay them extra money if they get healthier. What has happened to \nthe health insurance costs at Safeway in the last 3 years? It has been \nflat. It has not increased. Across the board in other companies across \nAmerica on average it is has gone up 38 percent. So they are on to \nsomething.\n  By incentivizing employees to get healthier, they not only have \nbetter lives but better health outcomes and lower costs for their \ncompany. Why is that not a national model? Why are we not doing that \nacross the board saying we are going to move toward a healthier country \nso we have fewer health care costs?\n  Second, we have to eliminate the incentives for piling on medical \nbills. Ever had a member of your family go to the hospital for a day or \ntwo or a week, then a month later they send you the bill? Were you \namazed at how thick it was? You turn it page after page and say: My \ngoodness, thank goodness I have health insurance--if you do.\n  But if you do not, you look at the bottom line and say: I do not know \nhow I am going to pay for these things. We reward doctors and hospitals \nfor piling on every single line on the page. Every single line is a \nprofitmaker, instead of saying the real goal is wellness and making \ncertain people get well from diseases and illnesses. So we need to \ncreate a new incentive in the way we have health care in America, to \ntake the best and brightest women and men who serve as our medical \nprofessionals working at these hospitals and give them the incentive \nfor the best outcome.\n  Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota was here a few moments ago, and she \ntalked about the Mayo Clinic for which I have the highest regard and \nhighest respect. This is a clinic which gets some of the best results \nin medicine in America at the lowest cost. How do they do it? What is \nso miraculous or magic up there in Rochester, MN?\n  Well, they pay their physicians a salary. The physician does not make \nan extra buck if he orders an extra test. The physician, instead, looks \nat that patient and says: I think we need three specialists in this \nroom right now, and let's see if we can work out a plan for wellness. \nThey come together and they work it out. It is not a matter of how many \nlines there are on a page and final billing. It is a matter of that \nperson going home well, and it works. They have reduced cost, and it \nhappens across America. We have seen it many places such as the \nCleveland Clinic, and so many other places have been noted as examples \nof centers of excellence. That is what I want to see in my State of \nIllinois. That is what every State and every Senator should be working \nfor.\n  I will close by saying, let's not fall into the trap of this health \ncare reform debate and let the buzzwords and the words that infuriate \npeople stop us from a meaningful, honest debate. This has to be \npatient-centered health care not government-centered health care.\n  We are not talking about rationing. We are talking about a rational \nhealth care system that is geared toward wellness and disease \nprevention. We have to make certain that at the end of the day we allow \npeople to choose their own doctors and their own hospitals and their \nown health insurance plans and to keep the health insurance plan they \nhave if they want to.\n  We have to help small business provide the kind of health insurance \ncoverage they want to have for themselves as owners and for their \nemployees as well. At the end of the day, we can improve this system. \nIt is the biggest single issue challenge Congress has faced in at least \n40 years, maybe in a much longer period of time, because it affects \nevery single person in this country.\n  We can do it. With the President's leadership and his commitment, we \ncan get this right.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment and ask that it be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1907, as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To temporarily protect the solvency of the Highway Trust \n                                 Fund)\n\n       Strike section 1 and insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. TEMPORARY PROTECTION OF HIGHWAY TRUST FUND \n                   SOLVENCY.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 5 of the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. Law 111-5), from the amounts \n     appropriated or made available and remaining unobligated \n     under such Act, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget shall transfer $7,000,000,000 to the Highway Trust \n     Fund. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     shall report to each congressional committee the amounts so \n     transferred within the jurisdiction of such committee. The \n     amounts so transferred shall remain available without fiscal \n     year limitation.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I urge all colleagues to come together, as \nthe American people surely want us to do, and adopt this amendment. I \ntruly believe this amendment is the responsible way to address the \nshortfall in the highway trust fund.\n  This amendment funds the highway trust fund shortfall by using money \nfrom the already-passed stimulus bill. That is important because \notherwise we are racking up yet more deficit and more debt on top of \nthe mountains of\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\ndebt we have already accumulated to pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren. This is important so that, yes, needed highway work can \nbe done, particularly needed work in the midst of a recession, but it \ncan be done without racking up yet more debt to weigh down the economy \nand burden our children and grandchildren.\n  I wish to make two central points about this idea and why this \namendment is necessary. First, the level of debt we are accumulating is \ntruly staggering. It is beyond our ability to get our hands around. \nThis year alone, the deficit has surpassed $1 trillion. This year's \ndeficit spending has gone beyond $1 trillion. By the way, we are not \nfinished this year. It continues to grow. This year, we have racked up \nover $1.8 trillion of new debt because there is the $1 trillion in the \nnormal year's spending plus the huge stimulus bill of $800 billion. In \nterms of racking up new debt to put on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren, there is $1.8 trillion of new debt this year. That is \nway beyond anything we have experienced in our lifetime. Just the \ntrillion dollars of deficit spending rivals the sort of numbers we used \nto talk about not so long ago for the entire Federal budget.\n  But, unfortunately, it gets worse. It gets significantly worse \nbecause this Congress, over my objection, passed President Obama's \nbudget, and that budget takes those mountains of debt I just \ndescribed--at already sky-high historic levels--and what does it do? \nDoes it work it down? No. It doubles that level of debt in 5 years. It \nmore than triples that level of debt in 10 years. That is the path we \nare on, and that is the legacy we are handing to our children and \ngrandchildren. That is simply completely irresponsible. To have this \nmountain of debt already accumulated this year, at historically high \nlevels--$1.8 trillion accumulated this year alone, and it is growing--\nand then to have a budget plan that doubles that in 5 years and triples \nit in 10 years is inexcusable. In that 5-year period, this President \nwill have racked up more debt than every predecessor President before \nhim combined. We need to get off that path, and the American people \nknow it.\n  The American people understand, through their common sense, that this \nis a recipe for disaster. All of us as parents want to hand our kids a \nbetter world, a world of more opportunity, a better future than even we \nhad handed to us from our parents. Yet we are on a path to do exactly \nthe opposite and hand our kids an enormous burden, hand them a tomorrow \nfull of clouds and uncertainty, particularly dominated by this threat--\ncentral fundamental economic threat--of deficit and debt. We cannot \naccept that. Yet here we are on the floor with the other side proposing \nto fund the highway trust fund with--guess what--more debt, more \nborrowing, more borrowing by the government from whoever buys our debt, \nincluding wonderful allies around the world like the Communist Chinese \nGovernment.\n  We need to get off this path, and this is one important step in doing \nthat, saying: Yes, we will continue vital highway programs, but we will \ndo it by taking from the already-appropriated stimulus funds. That is \nappropriate money that is already appropriated through the process. We \nwill not do it by borrowing yet more money.\n  The other side has fancy arguments about: Well, this is really taking \nback a loan we sent the general fund 8 years ago. Let's make no mistake \nabout it, that money is long gone. This is racking up more debt, purely \nand simply. For that very reason--because it is racking up more debt, \nbecause it increases outlays in this fiscal year--it has a budget point \nof order against it, which I will raise before our final vote. So if \nyou need any further proof that the underlying bill requires borrowing \nyet more money, racking up yet more debt, it is nailed down by the fact \nthat there is a budget point of order against the underlying bill, \nwhich I will raise.\n  The second critical reason we should adopt the Vitter amendment and \nfund highway projects from stimulus money and not rack up yet more debt \ngoes to the nature of the stimulus and the attempt which has been very \nslow and very faltering of using those stimulus dollars to help revive \nthe economy. Of course, that was the whole argument behind the \nstimulus: We are in a severe recession. We need to do something. We \nneed to get spending and economic activity out the door. We need to \nhold down unemployment. That was the whole argument. From the very \nbeginning, I did not think that would be the result. That is why I \nvoted against the stimulus, both because of the nature of the \nspending--it is a lot of big government programs, not a lot of true \nshovel-ready infrastructure spending--and because of the timing of the \nspending. I thought from the very beginning that relatively few dollars \nwould go out the door immediately and a lot of the stimulus money would \nnot be spent for years. Well, unfortunately, all of that is coming \ntrue. Again, if you look at the nature of the spending in the stimulus \nand the timing of it, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n  I think all of us in this body, and Americans across the country, \nfavored infrastructure spending as the centerpiece of the stimulus. \nYes, let's do real, concrete, shovel-ready projects. Let's build roads \nand highways and bridges as the best example of a true, concrete, \nshovel-ready infrastructure project. I certainly strongly supported \nthat element of spending as a way--not the only way but as a way--to \nhelp revive our economy.\n  Unfortunately, that type of project was never a major part of the \nstimulus bill as passed. In fact, if you take all of the roads and \nhighways and bridges, all of that construction in the entire stimulus, \nhow much of the bill do you think it is? Fifty percent? Certainly not. \nThirty percent? Keep going down. Twenty percent? No. Ten percent? Try \n3.5 percent. Mr. President, 3.5 percent of the entire stimulus focused \non what the American people thought really could be spent to help \nstimulate the economy: shovel-ready infrastructure projects on roads \nand highways and bridges.\n  My amendment is a way to increase that part of the stimulus that goes \nto that project to increase highway funding through the stimulus, which \nI think there was a very broad consensus to do from the beginning, but \nit never got done in the stimulus.\n  The second big problem with the stimulus is the timing of that money. \nIt has gone out the door very slowly. Of the entire $800 billion \nstimulus bill, which was supposed to be immediate relief for the \neconomy--let's start turning the corner on this recession immediately \npassing that bill--today, months later, a half a year later, 10 percent \nhas gone out the door. Only 10 percent has been spent. That is \nludicrous.\n  Of that tiny slice that was roads and highways and bridges--the 3.5 \npercent--guess how much of that money has gotten spent. Mr. President, \n1 percent of that. Not 1 percent of the whole bill, not almost a third \nof the 3.5 percent. I mean 1 percent of the 3.5 percent; in other words \n.035 percent of the entire bill--a meaningless amount. So let's \nincrease the amount of money we take from the stimulus pot and \nimmediately get it out the door for vital highway projects.\n  Because of those factors in the stimulus--the nature of the spending, \nwhich was never focused on real, shovel-ready infrastructure; only 3.5 \npercent going to roads and highways and bridges; and the timing of the \nmoney, which has been amazingly slow; only 10 percent of the stimulus \nspent right now and only 1 percent on roads and highways and bridges--\nwhat has been the effect on the economy? Well, of course, the effect \nhas been slim to none.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber says it all. This graph is what the \nproponents of the stimulus bill say would happen to unemployment over \ntime: We pass the stimulus, and it is going to help revive the economy. \nIt is going to make sure unemployment peaks at less than 8 percent and \nthen comes down. Well, unfortunately, the reality has been very \ndifferent, because compared to this prediction by the proponents of the \nstimulus, this is the reality, as I show you on this chart. This is \nwhat unemployment has been doing in the last several months--going up \nand up and up, well beyond the peak that was predicted, reaching almost \n10 percent today.\n  Again, this is the second fundamental reason we need to adopt the \nVitter amendment, because the stimulus, as it was put together, is not\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\nweighted nearly enough toward real infrastructure such as roads and \nhighways and bridges, and it is not weighted nearly enough on spending \nnow versus years from now. This Vitter amendment will help change that \nfor the better. It will reweight the stimulus, at least at the margin, \nto more roads and highways and bridges and more spending now because we \nneed it now in the midst of this recession now.\n  So again I urge all of my colleagues to come around and embrace and \nsupport this Vitter amendment. Doesn't it make sense to say we need to \nstart now in terms of rejecting this path of more and more and more \ndebt? Because the underlying bill, make no mistake about it, is funded \nby more borrowing, more debt. That is why a budget point of order lies \nagainst the underlying bill. I will raise that budget point of order \nbefore the end of our debate.\n  Secondly, doesn't it make sense to say: Look, the stimulus idea was \nabout exactly this sort of spending? Americans across the country favor \nstimulus spending that is really focused on roads and highways and \nbridges and real infrastructure, things that are truly shovel ready. \nThey do not favor big government waste programs and they do not favor \nspending 3 years from now because that is going to have no impact to \nget us out of this recession right now.\n\n  This amendment, again, will fine-tune the stimulus in the positive \ndirection, toward spending on roads and highways and bridges, and \nvirtually all of us support more of that spending, including the \ndistinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nShe had an amendment on the stimulus to do just that, which was opposed \nand defeated by the other side.\n  This amendment will also fine-tune the stimulus to get more money out \nthe door now. Don't we need that? Only 10 percent of the $800 billion \nhas been spent. Don't we need to front-load it a lot more than that to \nhave any sort of significant positive impact on this recession?\n  Again, tragically, the unemployment figures say it all. The \nprediction: Peak at 8 percent, come down from there. The reality: We \ncontinue to go up and up and up--perilously close right now--toward 10 \npercent.\n  Again, I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to \njoin together, to work together, as the American people want us to do, \naround a basic commonsense idea. Let's stop the debt. Let's stop \nracking up yet more debt, putting it on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren. Let's front-load the stimulus and do shovel-ready \ninfrastructure now rather than big government projects 3 years from \nnow.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, could the Presiding Officer let us know \nhow much time remains on the Vitter amendment and general debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 30 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Louisiana has yielded back his time. There \nis 20 minutes of debate on the bill itself.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, of all the times to stop job creation in its tracks, I \nwill tell you, this is not the time to do it. The Republican response \nto the bill that has come over from the House--the bill that would \nrestore the funding, make sure there is funding in the highway trust \nfund to get us through September 30, and also make sure we can handle \nunemployment insurance and also ensure that our families can get \nmortgages, those who qualify--the answer from our Republican friends, \nand they have a right to do it, is to take that funding from the \nunobligated stimulus package.\n  Now, here is the thing. We know we are starting to finally get those \ndollars for our economic recovery out the door. We know that. Yes, they \nare not flying out the door because the administration wants to make \nsure these are worthy projects. But I will tell you right now, the \nRepublicans are putting at risk the very program they say they embrace: \nthe highway program. The fact is, we still have $10 billion for \nhighway-related jobs that would be subjected to the Vitter amendment. \nSo, irony of ironies, they say they are extending the highway trust \nfund, but that amendment puts these funds at risk, puts these jobs at \nrisk.\n  The stimulus is designed to create those jobs. The funding is getting \nout the door. I have gone to my State and seen it at work. Yes, we know \nemployment is lagging. So what do you do when employment is lagging? \nYou do not go to a program that is designed to put people to work.\n  I think it is important to note that the House bill is not only \ndeficit neutral, it actually reduces the deficit. According to CBO, not \nonly does it do it in 2010 but over the next 5- to 10-year period. That \nis because of the way they are funding the trust fund and the way they \nare funding the housing priority.\n  What the Republicans are doing is they are taking a deficit reduction \nmeasure that keeps the highway trust fund solvent through the end of \nSeptember, that makes sure people can continue to get unemployment \ninsurance, that makes sure people can get mortgages--those who \nqualify--and they are saying that, instead of reducing the deficit, \nlet's slash the stimulus program, take funding away from our States, \naway from our counties, our cities, and our businesses back home when \nit is not necessary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield further, I am trying to see \nwhether there is net job creation from the Senator's amendment or if we \nwould lose ground with it. If our goal is to create more jobs in \nAmerica--I listened to the Senator's explanation, and I would like to \nask the Senator from California this: Even if we just take the money \nout of one pocket and move it to another pocket, how does that create \nnew jobs in America?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Clearly, it is not even moving funds, it is slashing \nfunds from the stimulus program, which has one purpose, and that \npurpose is to create jobs.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have heard from our Republicans friends over and over \nagain, who voted against the stimulus--although I have to say some of \nthem are standing in front of projects built with stimulus dollars, but \nwe will forget that for now--we are hearing from them that the stimulus \nisn't working fast enough. What do they want to do today but cut the \nfunding?\n  What I have suggested--and I want to get my friend's reaction to \nthis--to my friends on the other side--because I agree we ought to \nextend the highway trust fund for 18 months; I don't like the way they \nare paying for it--is to wait until the end of the stimulus program, \nand if there is funding at that time that hasn't been obligated, that \nhas been left on the table, take those funds and add them to the \nhighway trust fund.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield, I ask the Senator from \nCalifornia this: Since the Senator from Louisiana didn't support the \nPresident's recovery and reinvestment program, and most of those on his \nside of the aisle did not, those of us who voted for it did it with the \nunderstanding it would do a number of things. It provides tax relief \nfor families, and it provides a helping hand to those who are \nunemployed, so they can afford health care insurance if they have lost \ntheir job, for example. It does provide infrastructure programs and \nprojects. It is my understanding we are a little over 4 months into \nthis 2-year stimulus program--not quite 5 months into it--and the \nSenator from Louisiana wants to basically declare it a failure, never \nhaving voted for it. I ask the Senator from California, when the \nSenator from Louisiana talks about the number of dollars committed, the \nnumber of projects we have agreed to, it was my understanding that, as \nof a couple weeks ago, we had obligated over $200 billion out of the \n$787 billion, meaning we promised we will pay, once the projects are \nunderway and the jobs are actually created, and that number is going to \ncontinue to grow as we obligate it. Is it not also true that we want to \nmake certain, whether we are spending money for projects under the \nhighway trust fund or the stimulus bill, that we don't waste taxpayer \ndollars; we want to look carefully at each project to make sure it \nserves a public purpose and make certain Americans are going to work at \na decent wage, and when it is over, we not only get through the \nrecession, but we have a legacy of projects that will serve our economy \nand our Nation.\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\n  If the Senator from Louisiana has his way, he is going to take the \nmoney out that we are currently investing into creating jobs in America \nand move it into the highway trust fund. I am wondering if the Senator \ncould respond. Does it make any sense for us to take a different \napproach on the stimulus and not be careful that the money we spend is \nactually spent well?\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield to the Senator from Louisiana on his time, \nbut I will keep my time right now. It is very important we thread this \nneedle in the right way. We want those jobs out there, and we want them \nout there as fast as they can get there.\n  Out of the $27 billion for highway projects, there is $10 billion \nremaining. I can assure both my friends that it is very important to be \ncareful in the way you do it. If you do it too quickly, you know what \nwill happen on the floor of the Senate. We will have our friends on the \nother side saying: `` they rushed.'' We want to be careful, but we \ndon't want to, at this point, as we see this recovery starting to take \nhold--we all believe and hope it is true--we know employment is the \nlagging indicator. This is not the time to throw a dagger into the \nheart of job creation. That is what the Senator's amendment will do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from California, if I have the \nappropriate amendment before us, does the Senator from Louisiana go \nbeyond the highway trust fund in the money that is transferred? Does he \napply some of the money from the stimulus to unemployment and to \nmortgage insurance or is that a separate amendment? I know his \namendments were filed late last night, and I am not sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe the Senator's amendment--and he can explain \nit--deals with the trust fund, and others will have similar amendments \nfor UI and mortgage insurance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator--and this is a legitimate inquiry, as I \ndon't know the answer--on the stimulus projects we are funding, what is \nthe requirement for a local match for those projects, as opposed to \nrequirements for projects under the highway trust fund?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My understanding is it is 100 percent because it is the \nstimulus. We are trying to do that because our States are suffering--\nyours is and mine. We saw our Republican Governor talk about how heavy \nour hearts are back there, and we decided to help our State. This is \nvery different. It is 100 percent offset.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The stimulus is 100 percent Federal, which means projects \ngo forward even if States are struggling with the budget. If the money \ngoes into the highway trust fund for projects, most of that required a \nState or local match, right?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct; 20, 30 percent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Most States, including Illinois, California, and others, \nwould have a more difficult time moving projects forward through the \nhighway trust fund rather than the stimulus, which is 100 percent \nFederal dollars.\n  Actually, the Senator from Louisiana is cutting down the opportunity, \nreducing the opportunity for infrastructure projects by requiring this \nmatch through the highway trust fund; isn't that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the assistant majority leader, he is absolutely \ncorrect. I understand the need to extend the trust funds to 18 months. \nOn that part, Senator Vitter and I are in agreement. But the way he \nfunds it is hurtful to the American people, to the American workers, to \nour businesses, and to our contractors. Even though we know a lot of us \nwant to see these funds get out there quicker, they are on the verge--\nVice President Biden has said we have committed more than a fourth of \nthe Recovery Act total funds. We are on track to meet the deadline set \nwhen the act was passed in February, spending 70 percent by the end of \nSeptember of 2010. He points out that the purpose of the stimulus was \nthe jolt for immediate help but then a long-term economic recovery.\n  This kind of amendment--and the others we will see--which says to the \nAmerican people: Gee, it is 4 months and we want to forget about this \nwhole notion--doesn't make sense. The timing of this is way off. If at \nthe end of the 2-year period, within which the stimulus is supposed to \nact, there is money left over, I will be the first one saying: Let's \neither reduce the deficit with it or let's put it into the highway \ntrust fund. I do believe infrastructure should have gotten more funds \nfrom the stimulus, but that is another point.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My last question to the Senator from California--and I \njoin her in opposition to this amendment--is this: If the net result of \nthe Vitter amendment is not to increase jobs in America but actually \nwill reduce jobs in America, it seems like it is the opposite of what \nwe ought to be doing in the middle of a recession, with so many \nAmericans losing work. We want to create good-paying jobs here at home, \nand the Vitter amendment, by increasing the need for a State and local \nmatch, for example, is going to decrease the likelihood of creating \njobs. The stimulus money--100 percent Federal money that is for shovel-\nready projects--will move more quickly into the economy and into \npaychecks and will help us rebound from this recession we are in.\n  I say to the Senator from California, I thank her for her opposition \nto this amendment. I hope our colleagues on both sides will realize \nthat even if you didn't vote for the stimulus, voting for the Vitter \namendment is going to take money away from projects in your States that \nwill create good-paying jobs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before my friend leaves, I think I can put some specifics \nout to him. We already know there are $10 billion worth of highway \nprojects that have not been obligated. That is at risk right away. We \nknow there are Superfund cleanups that are long overdue. We have funds \nfor that. We have $5.5 billion in construction-related activity that \ndeals with cleaning up underground leaking storage tanks and the \nspecialized, good-paying jobs that those activities create. We have \n$300 million to restore our Nation's wildlife refuges. We have $100 \nmillion in a great program Republicans and Democrats have been lauding \nin my committee--the Economic Development Administration--where you \nleverage those funds from business. That would be at risk. We have $5 \nbillion available for flood control. It is ironic that my friend from \nLouisiana--I have been working with him and Senator Landrieu to do \neverything in our power to stop flooding. We have problems in our \nState, and Lord knows and the world knows about the problem in Senator \nVitter's State; $5 billion was available for flood control, for water \nsupply and harbor maintenance, all of which are focused on job \ncreation, and the irony of ironies is that those funds could well be \ncut under the Vitter amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the Senator's amendment would effectively cut funds \nused in the stimulus for flood control?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Any funds not obligated out of the $5 billion available. \nAs we know, Vice President Biden says, on average, 25 percent of the \nfunds have been obligated. That means a good portion of the $5 billion \nfor flood control would, in fact, be at risk.\n  I thank my friend for coming over and helping me explain to our \ncolleagues and the American people why we oppose this amendment, even \nthough it may be well intentioned. At the end of the day, it hurts our \npeople and their chance to get good jobs.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, let me briefly address some of the \nissues and misconceptions that have come up by focusing on four key \npoints.\n  First, I believe the Senator from Illinois said: Why would we want to \ntake anything out of the stimulus and stop job creation? I have a news \nflash: There is no job creation. Unemployment is going up. Again, \nunfortunately and tragically, the unemployment numbers say it all. This \nwas the projection from the proponents of the stimulus about \nunemployment peaking at 8 percent and then coming down. Tragically, \nthis is the reality. Joblessness goes up and up, toward 8 percent. So \nthere is no job creation right now.\n  No. 2, the Senator from Illinois said: Why would we want to move \nmoney from one pocket into another pocket? That doesn't do anything. \nWell, it does a lot if the pocket we are removing money from is stuff \nthat would not be spent until after 2011, and we move it\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\nto a pocket focused on real, concrete roads, highways, and bridges--\nspending that can be done now. That is a big change in terms of the \ntype of spending we are talking about. It is a big change in terms of \nthe timing of the spending.\n  The biggest reason for the stimulus having no significant impact on \nunemployment is the type and the timing of the spending. On the timing \nside, only 10 percent of the entire $800 billion stimulus has been \nspent to date. On the type of spending, only 3.5 percent of the whole \nbill was ever for roads, highways, and bridges. Only 1 percent of \nthat--1 percent of the 3.5 percent--has been spent yet. So, yes, we are \nmoving money from one pocket to another so as not to run up more debt. \nIn the process, we are having a lot more immediate, positive impact on \nemployment. That is very important.\n  Point No. 3: In direct response to the Senator from California, if \nshe would like to wall off any stimulus money--the money for roads, \nhighways and bridges and the money for flood control--and say the \nPresident cannot use that money in this transfer, I would be very open \nand supportive of such a second-degree amendment.\n  I did not do that simply to give the administration maximum \nflexibility in terms of working out those details. However, again, if \nthe Senator from California would like to propose a second-degree \namendment to wall off true highway funding or flood control funding, or \nwhatever, I would be happy to support that.\n  Fourth and finally, I couldn't believe my ears, but I think the \nSenator from California said the underlying bill involves deficit \nreduction. Let's get real. I know Washington is a fairy tale world. I \nknow things are turned upside down so often, like Alice in Wonderland, \nbut the underlying bill involves racking up more debt, more deficit. \nThat is the whole motivating factor of my amendment. The underlying \nbill does nothing but borrow more. Don't take my word for it; look at \nthe fact that there is a budget point of order against the underlying \nbill which I will point out and raise for consideration by the Senate.\n  So the underlying bill clearly involves more debt. How could it not? \nWe are taking money from the general fund to fill in the highway trust \nfund. Guess what. We are deficit spending in the general fund. We are \nalready, through the general fund, racking up a deficit. So if we take \nmoney from there, we have to backfill that if we spend the same amount \nwith more borrowing, more deficit, more debt.\n  Again, if we care about turning the corner on deficit and debt, this \nis the responsible amendment to support and the responsible approach to \ntake. The underlying bill racks up more debt; the Vitter amendment \navoids that.\n  Again, there is a budget point of order against this underlying bill \nabout which, with the cooperation of the Senator from California, I \nbelieve she needs to make some introductory comments, but I will make \nthat budget point of order now.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time remains on the Vitter \namendment on either side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican side has 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes for Senator Vitter; 15 minutes for Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And on the general debate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty minutes on the general \ndebate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am going to put a couple of items in \nthe Record and make sure Senator Vitter can offer his budget point of \norder. I asked if Senator Durbin would be willing to take 10 minutes on \nour side on the general debate. I don't think I have to ask unanimous \nconsent, but why don't I do that. I ask unanimous consent that after I \nconclude and after Senator Vitter makes his point of order, then we get \nto Senator Durbin for his 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, on the issue of the Congressional Budget \nOffice score that scores the House bill as deficit reduction, I find it \nintriguing that my friend who supports the CBO when they say we are \nspending money--for example, on the health bill, they say: Oh, look. \nCBO says it costs money, but he derides it when CBO says this \nparticular bill is a deficit reducer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the CBO score \nthat shows, in fact, the bill sent over from the House reduces the \ndeficit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   H.R. 3357: TO RESTORE SUMS TO THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Changes in direct spending (in millions of dollars)\n                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       2009            2010          2009-2014       2009-2019\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSection 1--Appropriate $7 billion to the Highway\n Trust Fund:\n    Budget Authority............................               0               0               0               0\n    Estimated Outlays...........................           1,000          -1,000               0               0\nSection 4--Increase Loan Limit to $400 Billion\n for the GNMA Mortgage-backed Securities Loan\n Guarantee Program Account:\n    Estimated Budget Authority..................             -40               0             -40             -40\n    Estimated Outlays...........................             -40               0             -40             -40\n    Total, H.R. 3357:\n        Estimated Budget Authority..............             -40               0             -40             -40\n        Estimated Outlays.......................             960          -1,000             -40            -40\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTES:\nSection 2 would have no estimated budgetary impact relative to CBO's baseline.

Allowing FHA to guarantee additional loans has no cost or savings\n  because under the Federal Credit Reform, CBO's estimate of the subsidy cost of new FHA guarantees is zero.\nSource: Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, notwithstanding the order of July 29, I \nask that it be in order for Senator Vitter to make a budget point of \norder against H.R. 3357 at this time, and that a motion to waive the \napplicable point of order be considered made, with the vote on waiving \nthe point of order occurring at a time to be determined.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will make that point of order. The \nunderlying bill is such a great deficit reduction that it would involve \nmore borrowing and more debt and more mandatory spending. It would \nspecifically increase mandatory spending and exceed the committee's \nsection 302(a) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against \nthe bill pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nwaiver is considered made.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I seek recognition pursuant to the \nunanimous consent agreement of the Senator from California, 10 minutes \nremaining on our side on the general debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Senator from Louisiana suggests the \nstimulus bill the President enacted is not creating jobs because we \nstill have unemployment. The fact is, it is creating jobs and we are \nstill in a recession. Were we not working with the stimulus bill to put \nmoney back in the economy to create American jobs, it would be worse. \nWe all know that.\n  When the President came to office, he encountered an economy that was \nlosing on average 700,000 jobs a month. Our growth rate had hit a \nnegative 6.3 percent. Foreclosures were at record levels, and \nresidential investment had\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\nfallen. Banks were in crisis and freezing lending. Madam President, $10 \ntrillion in wealth had been lost. Virtually every American with a \nsavings or retirement account had taken a hit. That is when the \nPresident took his hand off the Bible and accepted the responsibility \nof office, and that is what he inherited.\n  He came to Congress and said: Let's put money in the economy and get \nAmericans back to work. Let's invest in things that will pay off in the \nlong run. Let's build the bridges, the highways, the airports. Let's \nmake sure we make investments that not only create jobs today, but we \ncan rely on in the future to build our economy. And we did it, with \nlimited help from the other side of the aisle.\n  The Senator who is offering this amendment voted against it. The \nposition for most Senators on the other side of the aisle was, let's do \nnothing; let's let the market work this out.\n  Do you have any idea where we would be today if the market was still \nworking this out? I am afraid we would be in sorry shape. We would \ncontinue to see job loss and continue to see more and more unemployed \nAmericans, which is exactly the opposite of what we want.\n  Now comes the Senator from Louisiana who opposed the stimulus package \nin the midst of this economic crisis and now says: Let's take money out \nof the stimulus package that is creating good-paying jobs in America. \nLet's take it away from the States where they get 100 percent Federal \nfunding for their projects. Let's put it in a different fund. It isn't \ncreating any new investment, but let's put it in a different fund that \nnow requires a State match.\n  What that means is, if your State budget is struggling--we know a lot \nof States are--the Senator from Louisiana does you no favor. He is \ntaking a project in your State that is important for your economic \nfuture, closes it down and says: We will be glad to give you some of \nthat money back as long as you can come up with matching funds.\n  I am afraid that is not helpful. It is hurtful at a time when this \neconomy needs all the help it can get. When it comes to the stimulus \npackage, understand, we are a little over 4 months into this stimulus, \nthis 2-year stimulus package.\n  The Senator from Louisiana says: I am prepared to declare it a \nfailure; let's stop right now.\n  I am not prepared to declare it a failure. In fact, I think there is \nan indication that it is starting to put America back to work.\n  Because of the Recovery Act, on which the Senator from Louisiana \nwants to reduce spending--listen to this--95 percent of working \nfamilies are already getting tax credits in their paychecks. Those \ndealing with job loss are collecting an extra $25 a week if they are \nout of work. That does not sound like much if you have a job, but if \nyou are out of work, it means something.\n  There also is help for unemployed people to pay health insurance. I \ndon't know if the Senator from Louisiana didn't vote for that. I don't \nknow if he thinks that is a good idea. If I were unemployed, I would \nwant my family to have health insurance. That is pretty basic.\n  There is money to help seniors and college students, many of whom \nhave faced the idea of suspending their college education because mom \nand dad are struggling at home. The Senator from Louisiana may be \nopposed to that; I am not. I want them to stay in school. I want them \nto get their degrees because they will lead America.\n  We provided $34 billion in funds for States for Medicaid because our \nStates are struggling to provide health care for the poor. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana may oppose that. That is his right to do. I happen to \nthink that providing basic health care to the poor in America is \nevidence we are a caring and compassionate nation and will continue to \nbe.\n  The money that has gone to States and local governments has avoided \nthe layoffs of teachers and police officers and other law enforcement \nin Louisiana, Illinois, California, and around the Nation. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana may think that is a waste of money, we never should have \ndone that. But for a safer America and for an America where kids can go \nto school and have the teachers they need, I think the money was well \nspent.\n  Beyond that, this Recovery Act in which we are involved is one that \nis starting to make some results. Just starting. I am not being \nPollyanna-ish about this. We are still in a recession. I think we are \ncoming out--I hope we are coming out.\n  In January, the month before this Recovery Act went into law, we lost \n741,000 jobs. Terrible. By June, the economy was losing one-third fewer \njobs. I wish we were not losing any jobs, but the fact is the stimulus \nis starting to work.\n  The Senator from Louisiana, who did not support it, who had no plan \nfor this economy, now wants to take the money out just at the moment it \nis starting to work. Boy, the perfect Washington answer. Let's move in \nright now, 4 months into a 2-year program, and declare it a failure. \nThat may be his approach, but I don't think it works for America.\n  In less than 160 days, more than 30,000 projects have been started \nunder this bill--30,000 across the country. I went to Peoria, IL. There \nis a project at the airport which is critical to its economic future \nfunded by the stimulus bill, creating good-paying local jobs right in \nthe heartland of Illinois. More than $23 billion will be made available \nto fund over 6,600 shovel-ready construction projects; 3,200 are \nunderway. If the Senator from Louisiana has his way, we will stop right \nthere. We will start cutting back on these projects right now. That is \nhis idea of economic recovery.\n  Over $369 million has been put into rural water systems. I can tell \nyou, representing a State with a lot of small towns, such as Louisiana, \nthey need this money to make sure their drinking water is safe for the \npeople who live there. The Senator from Louisiana says: Enough said; \nlet's start cutting back on that.\n\n  Madam President, $2 billion has been moved out to State governments \nand community organizations for weatherization and energy efficiency on \nlow-income homes, and half a billion in overdue cleanup of Superfund \nsites. The Senator from Louisiana says: Let's cut that money; let's \nreduce that money. I don't think that makes sense.\n  We know if we did not have this Recovery Act, there would be more \nunemployment, more people out of work, fewer dollars being paid in \ntaxes to the Federal Government and State governments. Our situation \nwould be worse when it comes to the deficit. The more people who are \nunemployed, the fewer who are paying taxes, the more people need \nservices. It is a recipe for a deficit that grows.\n  The Vitter amendment, by reducing the spending power of the stimulus \nfunds, will make our deficit worse. That is a fact. He must acknowledge \nthat. I hope he does.\n  In terms of obligating these funds, I want to make sure at the end of \nthe day, having voted for this and supported it, that the money is well \nspent. I don't want a single dollar wasted. We are going to take care \nto make sure these projects make sense, that we have a justification \nfor them, and they will serve America and our economy's future. That is \nresponsible and accountable transparency.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana says we are 4 months in, we have \nnot gotten it spent, it is time to bail out. That kind of \nshortsightedness will not work. The idea that we would cut back on \nfunds for flood control in the States of Louisiana and Illinois makes \nno sense whatsoever. The Senator from Louisiana is wanting to cut back \nthose funds so he can transfer money into the highway trust fund.\n  I think we are on the path to recovery. I hope that path is a short \none and we reach it soon. In the meantime, the Vitter amendment will \nnot help. The Vitter amendment makes it worse. The situation is that \nthe projects we are counting on to get America back to work, good-\npaying jobs right here at home, are in danger because of this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, even if they didn't \nvote for the stimulus package, do the math--100 percent Federal money \nfor the project in that State, as opposed to the Vitter approach which \nwould require 20 percent or more from the State before they could go \nforward with any projects at a time when most States\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\nare struggling. This is not the answer. This will not be the only part \nof the problem; it will be a big part of the problem.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1905, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I call up my amendment at the desk and \nask that it be modified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The instruction line of the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1905, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To offset the appropriation of funds to replenish the \n  Unemployment Trust Fund with unobligated nonveterans funds from the \n            American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009)\n\n       On page 3, after line 12, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. USE OF STIMULUS FUNDS TO OFFSET APPROPRIATION OF \n                   FUNDS TO REPLENISH UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND.\n\n       The unobligated balance of each amount appropriated or made \n     available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n     2009 (Public Law 111-5) (other than under title X of division \n     A of such Act) is rescinded pro rata such that the aggregate \n     amount of such rescissions equals $7,500,000,000 in order to \n     offset the amount appropriated to the Unemployment Trust Fund \n     under the amendment made by section 2 of this Act. The \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall report \n     to each congressional committee the amounts so rescinded \n     within the jurisdiction of such committee.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, in my home State of Nevada, the \nunemployment rate has reached 12 percent, and we are seeing \nunemployment continue to rise across the country. The President said \nthe stimulus bill that was passed this year was going to keep \nunemployment no higher than 8.3 percent across the country. We know it \nis a lot higher than that everywhere now. This is not just a Nevada \nproblem, it is a problem in every State.\n  American families across the country are hurting, and they are \nhurting badly. I am offering an amendment that will help families \nduring these tough times. 18 States have depleted their State \nunemployment fund and are now borrowing from the Federal unemployment \nfund to cover benefits. The Federal Fund is now running dangerously \nlow. I am offering an amendment to shore up the Federal fund and help \nthe States that have depleted their own funds. My amendment will help \nin a way that is fiscally responsible. My amendment is very simple. It \nwould say we are going to use money out of the stimulus bill to \nreplenish the Federal unemployment funds that the States are borrowing \nfrom, and we are going to do that in a way where we don't increase the \ndeficit. My amendment does not play any phony numbers games, unlike the \nbill that was sent over here from the House of Representatives. The \nHouse bill says, technically, it is not increasing the deficit. The \nFederal Government, however, is borrowing from future generations, and \nwill very likely forgive the States that have borrowed money, which \nwill therefore increase the deficit.\n\n  The U.S. Department of Labor estimates it will take about $7.5 \nbillion to replenish the Federal fund for the rest of the Fiscal Year. \nNext year, it is projected to be at $30 billion. And we have already \nseen in the stimulus bill that this Congress is giving money away to \nthe States. We will continue to borrow from future generations so we \ncan forgive that debt the States have run up. States are not going to \nbe able to pay back all they have borrowed, right? That is what we all \nassume. So let's show some fiscal responsibility and take the money \nneeded to replenish the Federal unemployment fund, out of the stimulus.\n  The Senator from Illinois was just on the floor talking, and I \nlistened carefully to some of the things he was saying. He was saying \nthat if we actually borrow less--as does the Vitter amendment, for \ninstance--it means our deficit is going to be more. Well, that just \ndoesn't pass the commonsense test. I know what he is saying. He is \nsaying, basically, if we take the money away from the stimulus--in \nother words, we borrow less now--it is not going to help the economy as \nmuch. That was the philosophy behind the stimulus package, that by \nborrowing money and putting that government money into the economy, we \nwould help the economy recover. I think it is not arguable that there \nare a certain amount of jobs that can be created by government \nspending.\n  The reason I voted against the stimulus bill is because I thought a \nlot of the money was irresponsibly spent and it was going to run up the \ndeficit. So I was looking more long term, not just short-term. The \nproblem with continuing to borrow more and more is we have the threat \nof long-term economic harm. We have the threat of long-term inflation \nin this country, which will be devastating to this economy.\n  Under the President's budget that was passed here in the Congress, it \nis projected that our national debt will double in 5 years and triple \nin 10 years. Think about that. Take all of the debt that was borrowed \nin the history of this country, from George Washington to George W. \nBush, and that debt is going to be doubled in 5 years and tripled in 10 \nyears. That is unsustainable. We have to think about future \ngenerations.\n  States do need help to replenish their Federal unemployment insurance \nfund. They do need that help. We recognize that. But let's do this in a \nway where we are not borrowing more money from our children's future. \nThat is really what this is about.\n  We had the former Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan, talking to our \nconference at lunch a couple of weeks ago. One of the things he talked \nabout and one of his big fears is that the United States is borrowing \ntoo much money and that can be a future threat to our economy in the \nform of inflation. If we get to the point where other countries decide \nnot to loan us this money anymore--if they quit buying our Treasury \nbills, in other words--our economy falls off a cliff. We don't want to \nget to that point.\n  That is why we need to start taking small steps, which can lead to \nlarger steps on being fiscally responsible in this country. We hear \nSenators from both sides of the aisle get up and talk all the time \nabout being fiscally responsible. Yet every time we have a small \nproposal that shows fiscal responsibility around here, it is rejected: \nWe can't do that now. We can't do that with this program. The stimulus \nprogram is off limits.\n  Even though a large amount of the stimulus isn't going to be spent \nfor a long time, it was originally supposed to help our economy this \nyear. And the Senator from Illinois just said the economy is \nrecovering. There are signs the recession is slowing down; however, \nthis looks as if this is going to be a completely jobless recovery. \nThat is not what the stimulus bill was supposed to be about. It was \nsupposed to be about creating jobs.\n  We had alternatives, actually, that would have created jobs, that \nwould have helped the housing industry. The housing industry was the \npart of our economy that drug the rest of the economy down. So we \nthought we should have fixed housing before we started putting money \ninto all these other projects and all these other government programs. \nThat was rejected by the Democratic majority, unfortunately. I still \nbelieve we need to help the housing industry.\n  Senator Johnny Isakson from Georgia has a good proposal--to give a \n$15,000 tax credit to anyone who would buy a home. In my State of \nNevada, the housing market is still devastated. We have huge \nforeclosure rates. We have a large amount of inventory to sell out \nthere. The housing market is starting to turn around in some of the \nother States, but it still has a long way to go, and we could really \nhelp the housing market.\n  The bottom line is that we need to be more fiscally responsible to \nfuture generations. My amendment today is just taking a small step \ntoward that.\n  My dad used to tell me all the time when I was growing up: You have \nto watch the small amounts of money. He used to say: If you watch the \n$20 bills, the large amounts of money will take care of themselves. \nWell, let's start watching the small amounts. I know\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\n$7.3 billion is not a small amount of money, but around here, it is. \nLet's start watching at least these amounts of money so that when we \nare talking about the $1.8 trillion deficits, we can start taking care \nof that and we can start being fiscally responsible to future \ngenerations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I think \nthe Vitter amendment is the right direction to go as well. This is \nsomething we need to do for future generations.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to speak against the Ensign \namendment, and I want to explain why, so I will take my time off that \ndiscussion and retain the remainder of my time on the other amendments.\n  Let me say that Senator Ensign has come to the floor and he wants to \ntalk about fiscal responsibility. I welcome that debate. He blames the \nDemocrats for not doing anything to help us get a handle on deficits \nand debt. But let's go back to recent history--not ancient history, \nrecent history.\n  Bill Clinton left the White House in the year 2000, and we had a \nbudget surplus. That was very hard to get to, but we Democrats did it \nwith him and with the help of some of our Republicans. We had a debt \npractically eliminated. It was on the way down. And I remember \ndiscussions about what do we do when we have no more Treasuries to buy.\n  Then we had George Bush elected, and we had the Republicans \nsupporting him. In a nanosecond, the whole table turned. We went from \nbudget surpluses as far as the eye could see to deficits as far as the \neye could see. We went from a debt that was going to be extinguished to \na debt that began climbing.\n  As a result of these policies, there was a call for change in this \ncountry. We had more Democrats elected. We have a Democratic President, \nand he inherited one giant mess. The chickens came home to roost.\n  So our President said to the Nation: I am going to do everything I \ncan to get out of this economic mess. Help me. Help me pass a bill that \nwill put people to work. He said: I know it is going to be hard. I know \nit is going to take time, but we need to do this because of the \nrecession. And if we don't get out of this recession, we are not going \nto be able to attack the problem of deficit and debt.\n\n  Anyone who knows President Obama knows that when he was a Senator, he \nwas always conscious of our fiscal issues and distressed about the \ncourse we had been on for the last 8 years.\n  So here is what happens. We are 4 months into the economic recovery \npackage. I have been to places in California, I have seen people \ngetting those jobs--highway jobs, water infrastructure jobs, cleaning \nup Superfund sites, restoring our wildlife refuges. Those are just some \nexamples of the jobs. And we know, according to Vice President Biden, \nthat about 25 percent of those funds have been obligated.\n  Senator Vitter came down here and said nothing is working; we are not \ngetting those jobs out there. Let's go in and cut that stimulus \nprogram--put a dagger in its heart is what they want to do, when it \nisn't necessary to do so.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, as I have said--and I have put into \nthe Record--tells us the bill the House sent us does nothing to \nincrease the deficit. As a matter of fact, it is a small benefit to the \ndeficit over 10 years. They figure it is about $40 million--not much, \nbut it doesn't produce more deficits.\n  So they come to the floor and they are arguing the House bill at the \ndesk causes deficits when the Congressional Budget Office says, after \nthey had done a study, absolutely not. They still insist it does. Fine. \nThey do not agree with the CBO.\n  By the way, they do agree with the CBO when the CBO says there are \ncosts to health care reform. Then they embrace the CBO. But now they \ncan't because it doesn't fit their political rhetoric.\n  So all I can say is, if you take all these amendments--and, look, I \ndon't think they are meant to be mean-spirited. I think they are honest \nin their approach. They do not like the fact that we passed the \nstimulus bill. They do not believe in it, even though a few of them on \nthe other side--a few of them--have gone to see some of the projects \nthat are putting their own people to work. A few have done that. I find \nthat a little disingenuous, but that is their choice.\n  Their argument just doesn't hold up. Look, if we take the funding out \nof the stimulus, we put at risk $10 billion of highway-related jobs. We \nput at risk millions of dollars that would otherwise be paid to our \nconstruction industry. We put at risk very important construction \nprojects at military bases, long overdue Superfund cleanups, the \ncreation of clean energy jobs in the future, improvements to outdated \nrural water systems. Why would we want to do this--Why, in the middle \nof a recession, when we have come up with a way to handle this that \ndoes not add to our deficit?\n  On the highway trust fund, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate \nagree we ought to do an 18-month extension. On that part of the Vitter \namendment, you will find me on his side, but not to take the funds out \nof the unspent stimulus money that is on the ground and putting people \nto work and will continue to do so. It has only been 4 months since the \nfunding has started to get out the door. Have a little patience. You \nknow, for 8 years we saw the economy turn into a bad way. For 8 years, \nwe saw this economy turning bad. For 8 years, we saw the recession \nbuilding. For 8 years, we saw the deficit building. For 8 years, we saw \nthe debt building. It is not going to take 4 or 5 months to turn this \naround. And why would we put a dagger in the heart of job creation at \nthis point, no matter how noble the effort?\n  I believe it is very important that we don't play games with this \nbill that is at the desk. For example, Senator Bond is going to offer a \nvery good amendment. It has nothing to do with cutting the stimulus; it \njust corrects a real problem, and it restores funding to the trust \nfund. He is absolutely right on that, and I absolutely will support his \namendment. But here is the thing. We have until September 30 to make \nthat fix, when we have to reauthorize the program. This is just a \nfinancial transfer into the fund. September 30, we need to actually \nreauthorize the highway bill. We take care of Senator Bond. But the \nreason I cannot support it is, as he well knows, the House has stated--\nand I do not agree with their attitude, I don't agree with it but they \nhave stated--this is it. We are giving you this quick influx of funds, \nand we do not want to have it come back with amendments.\n\n  We can put off the Bond amendment. We have time to deal with it. I \npraise Senator Bond for continuing to raise this matter before us \nbecause we do have to take care of it. Let's just get it straight. When \npeople come down to this floor and rail against deficits and rail \nagainst the debt, just remember that little simple piece of history \nthat is documented, that President Clinton left President George W. \nBush a surplus as far as the eye could see and a debt going down. Now \nthe other side of the aisle claims our President is not moving fast \nenough on all these fronts. Let me assure my colleagues our President \ncares a lot about the financial future of this country. He has two \nlittle kids. He knows exactly what their burden is. I do not believe \nthat fiscal responsibility belongs to the other party because it was \nour party, under Bill Clinton, that got this country in the best \nfinancial shape it was in for decades. It only took a few short years \nto see all that go out the window.\n  Let's not lecture each other. If they continue to do it, I will just \ncontinue to bring up the facts. But, again, I see Senator Bond is here. \nI am going to repeat what I said before he got here. I complimented the \ngood Senator because I think he is totally right on his amendment. \nHowever, I do know if it is attached to this bill what will happen \nbecause the House has told us. They will not take up the replenishment. \nWe risk the highway trust fund running out of funds. I personally will \nwork with the Senator from Missouri and my colleague, Senator Inhofe, \nto make sure the Bond amendment is part of the reauthorization which we \nwill have to do in September. But I thank him because he perseveres. He \nbrings it up all the time, and it is good that he does so. I support \nexactly what he is trying to do, but the timing, unfortunately, would \nundermine the replenishment of the trust fund.\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, as the ranking member of the committee, \nfirst of all, while I love the chairman dearly, she is dead wrong on \nall the information she just gave you. Let me go over that briefly.\n  First of all, on the Clinton administration. Let's keep in mind that \neven then-Vice President Al Gore admitted they had a recession coming \nat that time and that reduced the amount of money that was coming in to \nrun the government. We all know that is basic economics. We also know \nduring the 8 Clinton years he downgraded the military by 40 percent--\nnot 10 percent or 15 percent. I will never forget the euphoric \nattitude: The Cold War is over now; we don't need a defense any longer. \nWe cut down our end strength and our modernization program and all of a \nsudden 9/11 came and we were in the middle of fighting a war with a \nmilitary that was downgraded by the President. Obviously, it took a lot \nof money to bring us out.\n  I would say on behalf of President Bush that was a tough situation, \nbut he grabbed hold of it. Yes, we had to spend more money at the time, \nbut he had to rebuild what was torn down during the Clinton years.\n  One word about the Vitter and Ensign amendments. They are both good \namendments, and all they are doing is what I thought the chairman of \nour committee joined me in wanting to do back when we were considering \nthe stimulus bill, the $789 billion bill. Only 3.5 percent of that went \nto roads and highways and bridges. That would really have stimulated \nthe economy. I had an amendment cosponsored by the chairman, Chairman \nBoxer. We were unable to get it passed. That would have turned this \ninto a real stimulus bill. Frankly, we would not be here today if we \nhad been successful doing that.\n  Look, 67 percent of that $789 billion is unobligated today. What \nbetter use could there be than using that for construction, for getting \ninto something where we can actually stimulate the economy? This has to \nbe done. Our roads, our highways, our bridges are in deplorable \ncondition. Our chairman and I agree on that. We want a robust \nreauthorization bill. But in the meantime, to be able to take some of \nthe money that is in the stimulus bill that doesn't stimulate \nanything--we are not talking about taking away from military \nconstruction. I am the second ranking member on the Armed Services \nCommittee. I wouldn't tolerate that. That is already in there. But the \nunobligated funds amount to about 67 percent or about over $400 billion \nof the stimulus bill.\n  I am going to strongly support--in fact, I recommended to both \nSenators Vitter and Ensign--that this is a good place to find the money \nwe have to find in order to rebuild our system.\n  I have to say something about the Bond amendment because I will have \nto leave the floor in just a minute. I am fully supportive of the \namendment. The rescission is bad for every State and bad for the \nhighway program. This amendment corrects an accounting provision in \nSAFETEA that removes $8.7 billion of what was supposed to be unneeded \ncontract authority.\n  I think the rescission was not intended to have the real funding \nimpacts on the States, but the provision in the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007 changed how the rescission was to be implemented. \nNow States stand to lose about $400 million of real money.\n  Madam President, $40 million of that $400 million comes from \nOklahoma. Right now the Oklahoma secretary of transportation, Gary \nRidley--and I believe he is the best secretary of transportation \nanywhere in the Nation--recently told me my State will be forced to \ncancel $40 million in projects that were supposed to begin this year. \nFor this reason, this amendment cannot be put off. We have to pass it \nnow; otherwise, States will have to cut planned projects in \nanticipation of this rescission.\n  Some are arguing this amendment would somehow endanger the passage of \nthe trust fund rescue. I flatly reject this argument. The other body is \nstill in session. Right now they are over there, and we should not bow \nto its whims. This is not just a Senate problem to fix. The House has a \nresponsibility to address it too.\n  As I stated earlier, the House is still in session and they can take \na few extra hours before their adjourning to pass a highway fix bill \nwith the Bond rescission language in it. It is ludicrous to talk about \ninfrastructure spending being an ingredient in creating jobs on one \nhand and on the other hand allowing $8.7 billion in contract authority \nto disappear.\n  I urge my colleagues to support all three of these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1904\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the ranking member, Senator \nInhofe, for his support of the amendment. I thank the Chair for her \nkind words, even though we disagree. We, all three of us, strongly \nsupport the need to get highway funds moving to build the \ninfrastructure we need in our transportation. This is a critical time.\n  Right now our economy is struggling to recover from the worst \nrecession in generations; hard-working Americans in my home State of \nMissouri and across the nation are losing their jobs; and our states \nare straining to fund projects that are critical to our constituents. \nUnfortunately, unless we act now, our economy, workers, and our States \nwill be dealt another heavy blow.\n  At the end of September, millions will be cut in on-going, shovel \nready highway projects. That does not have to happen. This drastic cut \nwill halt critical transportation projects--like the repair of highways \nand bridges--across the Nation. In addition to halting critical \ninfrastructure projects, this cut will cost jobs in all 50 States.\n  My amendment is the action we must take now to protect our struggling \neconomy and protect jobs from this dangerous rescission. This amendment \nwill protect our economy and workers by eliminating the $8.7 billion \nrescission of contract authority mandated in the last highway bill--\nSAFETEA LU--for September 30, 2009.\n  The reason for repealing this dangerous cut now is simple. We should \nnot be giving money to States for infrastructure, jobs and economic \ngrowth with one hand and on September 30 taking money away with the \nother. This contradictory action just doesn't make any sense and runs \ncounter to our own efforts to improve our Nation's infrastructure.\n  According to our State departments of transportation, rescinding \ncontract authority can limit our state's ability to fund their \npriorities and operate their programs as efficiently as possible. There \nare real world consequences for our States if we continue with these \nrescissions. The most obvious consequence will be a halt to much needed \nimprovements to our Nation's infrastructure.\n  I don't think I need to remind people of the state of our \ninfrastructure around this country. If I do, then you simply aren't \npaying attention.\n  We are beginning to burst at the seams, our vehicle miles traveled \nremain at historic highs, congestion rates are up with more and more \npeople sitting in traffic next to trucks carrying products to and from \nbusinesses across the Nation. Our deteriorating infrastructure is a \nreal problem and it is taking an economic toll at a time when we simply \ncannot afford more burdens on our system. Unfortunately, the real world \nconsequences of this dangerous cut will be hardest on workers and \nfamilies. The Missouri Department of Transportation estimates that this \nrescission would mean about $201 million in lost projects and countless \npink slips in Missouri. Missouri is not alone. The numbers for other \nStates are startling: California, $793 million; Pennsylvania, $404 \nmillion; New York, $406 million; Maryland, $140 million. But most \nimportantly, behind these numbers there are jobs. The American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimates \nthat for every billion dollars rescinded, our States will miss out on \nnearly 33,000 jobs.\n\n  If Senators were to contact their State's department of \ntransportation they would quickly understand the full impact this \nrescission would have back at home. I urge my colleagues to do that \nbefore voting.\n  In fact, let's hear from some State DOT directors on the real effect \nthis recession will have back at home.\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\n  Colorado Director of Transportation Russell George stated that the \nupcoming $8.7 billion rescission will cost the State $98.7 billion:\n\n     that could have otherwise been obligated and out the door \n     helping to employ hard working Coloradoans and providing \n     important infrastructure projects to the State. This real \n     dollar cut is about 20 percent of the total federal funds \n     Colorado receives each year.\n\n  The Department of Transportation director in Nevada, Susan \nMartinovich, said that the upcoming rescission of $61 million \nrepresents 25 percent of the State's annual $236 million Federal aid \nallocation and that she would be forced to cancel $48 million of \nprojects that are already under construction, having a ``devastating \neffect'' on workers.\n  We have kicked the can down the road on this rescission for far too \nlong.\n  Right now, with this amendment, is our last opportunity to do what is \nbest for our economy, American workers, and our States by repealing \nthis rescission. I know that I don't want to go back to my State having \nvoted against so many jobs for Missouri.\n  Repealing this rescission will allow States to continue to move \nforward to meet our infrastructure needs and to create the jobs that \nstruggling families and this economy so desperately needs.\n  I also have a letter of support from Americans for Transportation \nMobility. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      FasterBetterSafer, Americans\n\n\n                                  for Transportation Mobility,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2009.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The Americans \n     for Transportation Mobility (ATM) coalition strongly urges \n     you to pass H.R. 3357, which would address the looming \n     shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund, and make highway and \n     public transportation reauthorization a top Congressional \n     priority during the remainder of the year. The coalition also \n     supports the Bond amendment, which would repeal the \n     rescission of $8.708 billion in highway contract \n     apportionment to states scheduled to take effect on September \n     30, 2009.\n       The 2005 highway and transit reauthorization legislation, \n     the ``Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation \n     Equity Act: a Legacy for Users'' (SAFETEA-LU), which expires \n     at the end of September, guaranteed at least $223 billion for \n     federal highway program investments through fiscal year 2009. \n     This investment level was predicated on a forecast of \n     anticipated revenues collected for the Highway Trust Fund's \n     Highway Account over the life of SAFETEA-LU. Unfortunately, \n     the Highway Account is expected to run short of cash to \n     liquidate obligations sometime in the next few weeks.\n       To avert the imminent crisis, Congress should provide \n     revenue to support the Highway account expeditiously. H.R. \n     3357 would achieve this by transferring $7 billion from the \n     general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund's \n     Highway Account. This measure would provide states and \n     localities with needed continuity in federal reimbursements \n     to ensure infrastructure efforts around the country do not \n     come to a screeching halt.\n       While H.R. 3357 is critical to supporting ongoing \n     infrastructure efforts, it is only a short-term solution to \n     an imminent crisis. Continued bailouts for the Highway Trust \n     Fund are hardly a sustainable approach to the nation's \n     infrastructure investment needs. Congress must develop a \n     comprehensive, long-term solution to ensure the platform of \n     our economy is sound.\n       The ``user fee'' system has been in place since 1956 when \n     Congress dedicated the gas tax to pay for construction of the \n     Interstate Highway System. This system and the Highway Trust \n     Fund have been a stable source of funding for decades and \n     have offered states and localities the predictability and \n     consistency necessary for capital investment. Additional \n     revenue will be needed to sustain this system and fuel taxes \n     are currently the simplest, fairest, and most effective way \n     to fund surface transportation infrastructure investment. \n     Capital investment requires capital, and there is no \n     alternative for the systemic funding needed at the federal \n     level.\n       The Coalition strongly urges you to pass H.R. 3357 to \n     address the imminent shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund and \n     support the Bond amendment to repeal the looming rescission. \n     Congress must make highway and public transportation \n     reauthorization the national priority it should be to ensure \n     long-term stability in national infrastructure planning and \n     investment.\n           Sincerely,\n                            Americans for Transportation Mobility.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

But as the ranking member pointed out, \nthey are still in session. If we believe this is right, accept the Bond \namendment, pass this bill as amended, send it to the House, give them \nthe chance to do what is right. Our job is to make sure we get this \nbusiness right before we go home on August recess.\n  If the House refuses to take it, they will have to go home and spend \nall next week explaining why they are at home instead of having passed \na bill that could have had workers on highway and bridge projects \nworking at home. They should be asked, if they go home, if they refuse \nto pass it: Why did you leave early? The Senate is still in session. \nYou could have stayed there and gotten rid of the rescission that will \ncut jobs.\n  There is, I guess, going to be a Budget Act point of order raised \nagainst this bill. I will, of course, ask to waive the Budget Act point \nof order. I would note that if you are going to take budget points of \norder seriously, this whole bill could be challenged on a Budget Act \npoint of order. I will not do that because I want to see this done.\n  But let's be clear: This so-called money for this bill comes in from \ngoing back and assuming interest was paid on the intergovernmental \ntransfers. We do not do that. That is totally bogus. That is a pencil-\nwhipping trick that I do not believe anybody would honestly score.\n  That is the problem with the whole bill itself, not just with my \namendment. If you want to be serious about paying for this bill, and my \namendment, the Vitter amendment, it is very simple: We can rescind a \nsmall amount of money, a small portion of the stimulus bill that was \npassed, and less than only 10 percent has been used. That money we can \nuse to put people to work on shovel-ready projects, make sure the work \ngoes on that otherwise would be cut off by an artificial September 30 \ndate.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the waiver of the point of order on \nthe budget amendment. Because if you do not, quite simply, to put it in \nterms we are using every day, if we fail to repeal the rescission, we \nwill be taking the shovels out of hands of workers ready to go to work \non shovel-ready projects. That is not something I wish to go home and \nexplain to the people of my State. I do not think Senators and Members \nof the House would want to go home and explain to the people or the \nconstituents in their areas that they represent.\n  I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1904.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To repeal a certain provision of the SAFETEA-LU)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESCISSION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES.\n\n       Section 10212 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient \n     Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (119 Stat. \n     1937) is repealed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I support repealing the rescission \ncontained in the SAFETEA-LU bill that requires that on September 30, \n2009, $8.7 billion of apportioned contract authority provided to States \nfor investment in infrastructure be rescinded. This is important to \nMichigan and all the other States across the Nation that cannot afford \nto have Federal infrastructure funding cut at a time of severe funding \nconstraints. I will work to repeal this rescission so Michigan and \nother States do not lose these needed Federal transportation funds.\n  Based on the assurances of the chairman of the Senate Environment and\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\nPublic Works Committee that this will be corrected before September 30 \nand the extremely time sensitive nature of the underlying bill, I will \noppose the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Bond \namendment to this bill. H.R. 3357 restores funding to the highway trust \nfund to keep it solvent through September. With the House of \nRepresentatives scheduled to adjourn tomorrow any Senate amendment to \nH.R. 3357 would require that it be sent back to the House, likely \nkilling this important bill. We cannot risk letting the highway trust \nfund run out of funds.\n  I will work with the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to repeal the SAFETEA-LU rescission as part of the bill \nto extend SAFETEA-LU programs for 18 months.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I support rescinding section 10212 of \nthe Safe Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act: A \nLegacy for Users. Section 10212 will rescind apportioned contract \nauthority for States for infrastructure investment on September 30, \n2009. If section 10212 goes into effect, my State could lose up to $100 \nmillion in transportation funds this year alone. While I support the \nintent of amendment No. 1904, offered by my colleague, Senator Bond, to \nrescind section 10212 and maintain apportioned contract authority for \nStates, I believe it is more important to follow the direction of \nChairman Boxer and pass H.R. 3357 as a clean bill with no amendments. \nProviding funding for transportation, unemployment insurance, and \nhousing programs included in H.R. 3357 are vital for the State of \nMichigan, and we must pass this bill quickly rather than delay it in a \nlong conference process. I look forward to working with both Chairman \nBoxer, who is committed to resolving the problems surrounding section \n10212, and with Senator Bond to address this problem in a timely \nmanner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before Senator Bond leaves the floor, I wanted to thank \nhim for his leadership on this issue. I wanted to assure him and all \nthe people who support this amendment that this amendment will pass. It \nwill not pass today, I do not think, for one main reason. We are \nfearful of playing these parliamentary games with the House on the \nhighway trust fund.\n  We have until September 30 to address this issue. My friend is \nentirely correct, we must deal with this rescission. We have to repeal \nit and we are going to repeal it. I will work with him to do that.\n  I simply wished to say that on September 30, when we are faced with \nour next deadline, the entire bill has to be reauthorized. So it is not \nonly this problem but many other issues have to be addressed. Again, I \nwish to state this: I am not happy the House sent us this very short \nextension.\n  I and I know my colleague wanted to see the highway trust fund \nextended for 18 months. I think the places we differ have to do with \nhow we pay for the extension. Senator Vitter and all my colleagues who \nare dealing with unemployment insurance and the rest want to cut funds \nout of the job-producing stimulus program. I think it is unnecessary.\n  I also would say to my colleagues who say we are borrowing and we are \nborrowing to do all this: Simply look at the CBO score which scores \nthis as a positive. The House bill is scored as a positive because of \nsome of the legislative changes in it. Again, I wish to be clear, I \nwill work side by side with Senator Bond. We are going to reauthorize \nthe highway bill. It might be for 18 months. Maybe we can get together \nand we can come up with a bill for 5 or 6 years. We have to find a \nfunding source to do that. I hope we can. But we will deal with the \nBond amendment. We have to deal with it. The Senator is exactly right--\nexactly right.\n  He talks about taking shovels away from workers. The only place I \ndisagree with him is that I think you are taking shovels away from \nworkers by cutting the stimulus. I visited my State. I see people being \nput to work.\n  As Vice President Biden said: We have only seen 25 percent of the \nstimulus money go out the door.\n  So I also wanted to ask unanimous consent when Senator McCain comes \nto the floor he wanted some time to speak on the Bond amendment. So I \nask Senator McCain be given up to 15 minutes to speak on the Bond \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Bond \namendment No. 1904, which if enacted would add another $8.5 billion to \nthe $1.8 trillion deficit we are accumulating this year.\n  As many of my colleagues will recall, when Congress considered the \nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act in \n2005, the so-called SAFETEA Act, we included a section that required \nthat $8.543 billion of unobligated contract authority be rescinded on \nSeptember 30, 2009.\n  The question, obviously, would arise: Why would we do such a thing, \nauthorize money but then say it will be rescinded or cancelled? It was \ndone for one simple reason; that is, because of the size of the bill it \nwould have been subject to a point of order because it exceeded the \nbudget.\n  By the way, I would remind my colleagues this was a $223 billion \nbloated and earmarked highway bill. So apparently it is not sufficient, \nin the minds of some, that we at least honor a commitment we made, \nwhich would have canceled about $8.5 billion.\n  Please keep in mind it was a $223 billion piece of legislation. \nPlease keep in mind that earlier this year we passed a $787 billion \nstimulus bill, that only 10 percent of the money has been spent, and \nonly 1 percent of the $787 billion stimulus has been spent on highway \nand infrastructure projects.\n  So we know there are many billions of dollars more that will be spent \non highway and infrastructure projects out of the stimulus bill that \nhas not been spent. Yet that does not seem to be enough, we need to add \nanother $8.5 billion.\n  I would point out that this amendment, the same amendment, was \nconsidered in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on July \n15 and was defeated by a vote of 14 to 5.\n  Well, sometime we have to stop. You keep coming to the floor time \nafter time and saying: At some point we have to consider our children \nand our grandchildren and the kind of debt they are inheriting. This is \nanother $8.5 billion which was not budgeted, which will add to the \nburgeoning debt America is staggering under and at a time when we know \nthat tens of billions of dollars additional will be spent on highway \nand infrastructure.\n  It is almost sad to see this because it began with gimmickry in order \nthat the bill on the floor at that time would not be subjected to a \nbudget point of order, knowing there would be an attempt at some point \nto restore it, which is now being made.\n  In 2005, we were accumulating deficits but unlike anything we have \nexperienced in the last several months and since the economy cratered \nback in September of last year.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment. It is unnecessary, \nunneeded, and unwanted. Frankly, it is another sign that we don't \nunderstand how serious the deficit problem is, that we are accumulating \nthe biggest deficit since World War II as a percentage of our gross \nnational product.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1905\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Ensign \namendment. This amendment would fund the unemployment compensation \ntrust fund by taking unobligated money from the recovery package. It is \nironic that one of the major tools we are using to maintain employment \nand grow it is the recovery package. In\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\nRhode Island, our State used about $200 million, which is a significant \nsum in their budget, to ensure they didn't have to lay off workers, \nwhich would have increased the demand on unemployment, and that they \ncould maintain services. All of this is a result of the recovery \npackage.\n  We are beginning to see the momentum pick up. For example, with \nrespect to weatherization, Rhode Island initially received some funds, \nbut then the bulk of the funds would be received based upon submission \nof their plan. The plan is underway. The State will see roughly $20 \nmillion over the next several months to get people to work doing \nweatherization. Not only does this help the environment, it also \nprovides employment, particularly for those most hard hit, the \nconstruction industry.\n  To take this money now and put it in the trust fund is \ncounterintuitive and counterproductive. On those grounds alone, we have \nto seriously look at this amendment.\n  The other issue that should be mentioned, among several, is that CBO \nhas indicated that this approach of moving funds in the underlying bill \nhas no effect on their baseline. It is an intergovernmental transfer \nthat the underlying legislation is proposing.\n  So this issue, again, is more of a comment, perhaps, on the recovery \npackage than trying to effectively stem unemployment and to provide \nfunds for those who are unemployed.\n  The issue of unemployment is probably the most significant one we \nface in the country, particularly in my home State. We know joblessness \nis rising. It is 12.4 percent in Rhode Island. Rhode Island and 18 \nother States have had to borrow $12 billion to keep their State \nunemployment trust funds solvent. Rhode Island has borrowed more than \n$80 million itself to cover unemployment costs, and over the next few \nmonths, they will draw on a line of credit of about $40 million to keep \npaying these benefits, which are absolutely critical to families who \nhave lost their jobs. If we don't, today, transfer these funds, as \nsuggested in the underlying legislation, Rhode Island and many other \nStates would be looking at a real crisis in which they would fail to be \nable to respond to this need for unemployment compensation.\n  On the merits of where the money comes from--i.e., the Recovery Act, \nwhich is the biggest tool we have that is trying to keep people working \nand employ more people--it doesn't make sense. And not making this \ntransfer, as suggested by the underlying legislation, would imperil the \nState's ability to provide unemployment compensation in a labor market \nthat is still very weak. We have to do more, and we also have to be \nmore innovative in our approach to unemployment.\n  One of the things my State has done with its own resources is a work-\nshare program. Rhode Island and 17 other States are using their \nresources to provide WorkShare, an effective program. Essentially, it \nallows an employer to cut back on the number of hours a worker is \nengaged, and that worker would qualify for what is basically a partial \nunemployment check,--not the full check, so it doesn't put that much of \na drain on the trust fund. Part of the conditions in Rhode Island is \nthat the employer must maintain the benefits the workers enjoy. So it \nis really a win-win-win. First, people do not lose their health care \nbecause they must maintain the benefits. Second, they are still \nemployed, so there is continuity of workers on the factory floor or in \nthe office. Third, the pressure on the State trust fund is lessened.\n  One of the things that is particularly appropriate to mention when it \ncomes to this program is that it provides a big bang for the buck. Mark \nZandi, an economist who is well renowned, has indicated that for every \ndollar of funds we put in through the unemployment system, we get $1.69 \nback. That makes sense. People who are getting these funds are using \nthem right away. They are going into the economy with their other funds \nto buy food, to buy the necessities of life they need. This has a \nstimulus effect on the economy. That is another reason we have to move \nvery aggressively.\n  But I would like to broaden this concept of WorkShare, which has been \nso effective in Rhode Island, to ensure we have a system that would \nprovide some Federal support to those States that are engaged in work \nshare programs. Again, it is not only a very efficient program, it is \nvery popular with industry and business in Rhode Island.\n  I had the occasion to visit a Hope Global plant, and they have \nengaged in WorkShare. In fact, the number of companies in the State \nengaged in WorkShare has gone up dramatically, given the economic \nrecession.\n  At this company, I listened to a woman who worked there with her \nhusband, and they benefitted from this program. She said, point blank: \nWithout it, we would have lost our health care and we would have lost \nour home.\n  So we can do more when it comes to flexibility and innovation with \nrespect to unemployment. This also includes passing legislation \nimmediately to extend unemployment insurance. Over half a million \nworkers will exhaust their benefits by the end of September, and 1.5 \nmillion will run out of coverage by the end of the year. This is an \nextraordinary number of Americans, and we need to provide them the \nsupport of the unemployment system, particularly high unemployment \nStates like Rhode Island.\n  Also, as I indicated before, this is a way in which we cannot only \nmoderate the crisis of unemployment for families but also to stimulate \nour economy. In fact, in that sense, it complements the Recovery Act. \nTo take away funds from the Recovery Act to place into the unemployment \ntrust fund would blunt the overall macroeconomic stimulus that we need \nto get this economy moving again.\n  The unemployment levels today are unacceptable, particularly in my \nState of Rhode Island. It is the No. 1 concern. Related to \nunemployment, for many people in my State, is the concomitant loss of \ntheir health care. So we have to move aggressively on health care \nreform also. But we have to act, and we can act, and we should act. I \nurge my colleagues to reject the Ensign amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am expecting Senator McCain on the \nSenate floor anytime, but I think I will begin.\n  The Government Accountability Office released a report yesterday that \ntalked about the highway trust fund. What they noted is that over the \nlast 4 years $78 billion of that trust fund has been spent on things \nother than highways, bridges, and roads.\n  Some of the things it has been spent on nobody would have any \nquestion. But here we find ourselves--the second time in a year--trying \nto bail out the trust fund, and we are going to get to decide whether \nwe are going to steal it from our kids or steal it from the stimulus \nbill, which will actually make it much more stimulative than the money \nthat is there.\n  But we find ourselves in trouble. When this trust fund was first set \nup, it was set up during the Eisenhower administration. It was designed \nto build the Interstate Highway System and help us with roads and \nbridges and secondary roads and bridges throughout the country. What it \nhas morphed into is that a large percentage of it now does not go for \nany of that.\n  So we find ourselves in the midst of a recession--with last year \nhaving high gas prices which depressed the money going into the fund, \nand with a recession now, with decreasing revenues going into the \nfund--and we have all these projects that we know are priorities for us \nthat need to be fixed.\n  The other thing we learned from this report is that 13,000 people in \nthis country a year die because of bad roads, bad bridges, and bad \nhighways.\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\nSo it would seem to me the highway trust fund moneys ought to be spent \nto eliminate those 13,000 deaths, and the priority ought to be about \nroads, bridges, and highways.\n  I will put into the Record many other items where the money is spent. \nTen percent is mandated for highway beautification. Well, I think that \nis great--if we do not have a trust fund that is broken, and we do not \nhave 200,000 bridges in the country that structurally have some defect, \n93,000 of which are seriously structurally defective. I think it is \nimportant that we turn our attention to priorities that will support \nthat.\n  We are going to have a lot of votes on this today.\n  I am supportive of us doing what we need to do for the trust fund. I \nam also supportive of making sure the priorities of the trust funds are \nabout bridges, roads, and highways. Because of what happened in Tulsa, \nOK, yesterday, we have a man in ICU. Somebody hit a bridge with a car, \nand he was driving under the bridge in another lane, and chunks of \nconcrete fell through his windshield and seriously injured him. Our \nhighway department knew we had a problem with that bridge--not going \nunder it or over it, but the foundation was suspect in terms of the \nconcrete underlying it, and the uprights. So the dollars that went to \nbuild a bicycle path and to plant flowers along the highways and the \ndollars that went to put in walking paths means that guy is in the \nhospital today because the dollars didn't go for what they were \nintended.\n  So when we have had $78 billion over the last 4 years that didn't go \nfor roads, highways, and bridges, and instead went for things that \naren't going to enhance safety or help save 13,000 lives a year, \nAmerica has to ask: What are your priorities?\n  I commend to my colleagues the GAO report: ``Highway Trust Fund \nExpenditures on Purposes Other Than Construction and Maintenance of \nHighways and Bridges During Fiscal Years 2004-2008'' on the GAO Web \nsite at www.GAO.gov.\n  Mr. President, I make the point that as they look at this, there are \nimportant things for us to consider. We know that had we passed a \nbetter stimulus bill, we would be doing twice as much now in terms of \nfixing the real problems in this country in terms of transportation \ninfrastructure. But we didn't. We passed a stimulus bill that created \ntransfer payments on 70 percent of it, and 20 percent of it may be \nconsidered to be stimulative. So the hope is that, as we go forward--\nand we are going to bail this out--what we really need to do is, let's \nhave our own money. In Oklahoma, we have never gotten 100 percent back. \nThe highest was last year. When I came to Congress, we were getting \nback 74 cents out of every dollar. If we can keep that money, we can \nget more done with it than what we get done through the trust fund now. \nThat may be one solution to ultimately getting us out of this \nsituation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, it is a real problem we have \nhere. I remember, up until about 5 years ago, our trust fund took care \nof our needs. The problem we had was not just the fact that as it goes \nup, the proceeds go down, but that we got involved in things that had \nnothing to do with transportation. It used to be bridges, \ntransportation, and highways. It was adequate at that time, but the \nhitchhikers would say there is a big surplus, so let's tap into that, \nand now we have all these things having nothing to do with \ntransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, but first I have one other point.\n  In the last 20 years, we have built 25 transportation museums rather \nthan the money going to highways. Remember the Minneapolis bridge that \ncollapsed? We are putting money into museums, and I wonder if we are \ngoing to build a museum about the collapse of the bridge in \nMinneapolis. We are putting money into museums instead of making sure \nthe roads and bridges--especially the bridges--are safe in this \ncountry. Our priorities are messed up, and the American people know \nthat. Hopefully, we can redirect transportation dollars to true \ntransportation projects, not to the aesthetics that we cannot afford \nnow, even though they may be nice, and, No. 2, are causing additional \ndeaths on our highways.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Couldn't it also be traced to earmarks and porkbarrel and \n``demonstration projects''? Couldn't it be traced to the fundamental \nfact that the 1982 highway bill included 10 demonstration projects \ntotalling $386 million? The 1987 bill had 152 porkbarrel projects, \ntotaling $1.4 billion. The 1991 bill had 538 locations with specific \nporkbarrel projects, totaling $6.1 billion. The 1998 highway bill had \n1,850 earmark projects, totaling $9.3 billion, and then in 2005 had \n5,634 earmark projects, totaling $21.6 billion. How can anybody who \ncalls himself or herself a fiscal conservative stand by and allow this \nkind of thing to happen?\n  And what happens? There was $2.3 billion for landscaping enhancements \nalong, of all places, the Ronald Reagan Freeway; $480,000 to \nrehabilitate a historic warehouse along the Erie Canal; $600,000 for \nthe construction of horse-riding trails in Virginia; $2.5 million for \nthe Daniel Boone Wilderness Trail Corridor; $400,000 to rehabilitate \nand redesign the Erie Canal Museum; $400,000 for a jogging, bicycle, \nand trolley trail in Columbus, GA. How in the world can those things be \njustified and then expect our constituents not to rise up?\n  Mr. COBURN. The answer to the Senator's question is, they can't. \nThere is no question that there are certain priorities. What has \nhappened is, as we try to address priorities for individual States, \nbecause the States don't get their money back--and there may be a great \nproject in there, and along comes a lousy one.\n  I just make the point that we have our eye off the ball. The eye \nneeds to go back. All you have to do is go read the story that happened \nin Tulsa, OK, yesterday. Had we been applying money to transportation \ninstead of nontransportation through this trust fund, that gentleman \nprobably would not be in the hospital today. A 700-pound piece of \nconcrete fell through his windshield, trapping him in the car. We don't \njust have a problem of not enough money in the trust fund, our problem \nis that the money that goes out doesn't go for the real things the \ntrust fund was designed to do in the first place.\n  I will restate, and then I will yield back. We have to do one of two \nthings. Until this country gets out of the financial damage it is in, \nfirst, we have to make sure the money is spent on transportation \nprojects, real transportation projects, to save some of those 13,000 \nwho are being lost because we are not fixing roads, bridges, and \nhighways. Second, let's eliminate the thing and let the States keep \ntheir money, and we will figure out how to spend it at home. In \nOklahoma, we have never gotten a square deal yet.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator know how much we are spending on highway \nand transportation projects in the stimulus, the $787 billion stimulus \nbill?\n  Mr. COBURN. It could be around 4 or 5 percent. Senator Inhofe will \nknow the answer to that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The answer is 3.5 percent, and an additional 3.5 percent \nin military construction, totaling about 7 percent.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the ranking member know how much of that has been \nspent in dollars?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Sixty-seven percent has not been obligated, so 33 percent \nis obligated.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me add, also, that if you go to USAspending.gov and \nto recovery.gov, you will find that as of last week--I don't know what \nit is this week--only $78 billion of the whole stimulus package has \nactually been spent. More of it has been obligated but not actually \nspent. I think there is another $150 billion obligated out of that. \nThat is one of the reasons we are not seeing the effect of the \nstimulus. One, it is not going to stimulate things, and it is not \ngetting to where we need it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, that is another reason the \nVitter amendment and Ensign amendment are good. You are talking about \nmoney that is out there, not recoverable. Let's try to direct it where \nwe can get something from it. I had an amendment during the stimulus \nbill to try to triple\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\nthe amount of money that would go into actual construction, and they \nwould not take it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as Senator Coburn has just mentioned, we \nreleased a report today examining how the highway trust fund receipts \nhave been used for projects other than road and bridge construction and \nmaintenance over the past 5 years. It relies heavily on the new GAO \nanalysis that was performed at our request on how we prioritize, or \nfail to prioritize, our Nation's transportation spending.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that the GAO concluded that, over the \nlast 5 years alone, we spent $78 billion on projects other than road \nand bridge construction and maintenance. I will repeat that--$78 \nbillion on projects other than the construction and maintenance of \nroads and bridges.\n  Where did it go? According to GAO, over $2 billion was spent on 5,547 \nprojects for bike paths and pedestrian walkways. As one example, it \nidentified a $878,000 project for a pedestrian and bicycle bridge for a \nMinnesota town of 847 people. I don't know what that works out to be, \nbut it works out to roughly $1,000 per person. I would be interested to \nknow how many inhabitants actually use that bridge. We all know about \nthe ``bridge to nowhere''; perhaps this is a ``bridge for no one.'' \nAnother $850 million went for 2,272 ``scenic beautification'' and \nlandscaping projects around the country, and $84 million was spent on \nroadkill prevention, wildlife habitat connectivity, and highway runoff \npollution mitigation projects. Yet another $84 million went to 398 \npedestrian and bicyclist safety projects. I don't mean to diminish \nsafety, but do we really need to spend Federal dollars for brochures \nlike the one we cited in our report that encouraged bicyclists to \n``make eye contact, smile, or wave to communicate with motorists. \nCourtesy and predictability are a key to safe cycling.'' Still another \n$28 million went to the transportation museums, and $215 million went \nto scenic or historic highway programs. The list goes on. I know \nAmericans find these numbers as disturbing as I do. They should because \nthey demonstrate that Congress is not focused on our Nation's \ntransportation priorities.\n\n  We should not forget that 2 years ago, the I-35 West Bridge over the \nMississippi River collapsed during rush hour, killing 13 and injuring \n123 more of our fellow citizens. That tragedy exposed a nationwide \nproblem of deficient bridges. According to the Department of \nTransportation, in 2008, of the Nation's 601,396 bridges, 151,394, or \n25 percent, of our bridges were deficient. Over 71,000 of them had \nsignificant deterioration and reduced load-carrying capability, and \nalmost 80,000 didn't meet current design standards. Yet we have been \nspending billions of dollars on bike paths, museums, landscaping, and \nroadkill-reduction programs.\n  Part and parcel of the problem, obviously, is the addiction to \nearmarks. As I mentioned before, the way the earmarks have grown, one \nof the standard arguments made by the earmarkers and porkbarrelers in \nCongress is that it has always been like this; we have always had \ncongressional discretion because we know better than the bureaucrats \nwhere the taxpayers' money should go. Frankly, I agree that sometimes \nthat is the case, if it competes with other programs, if it is \nscrutinized and authorized by the appropriate committees. But what we \ndo is we earmark these porkbarrel projects, and many times--let's have \na little straight talk, Mr. President--they are in return for campaign \ncontributions, and we see corruption.\n  People are under investigation. Lobbyists' offices are being raided \nby the FBI. Again, I am not going to repeat what I said to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, but the 1982 highway bill had 10--count them--10 \ndemonstration projects, and it was $386 million; in 1987, $1.4 billion; \n1991, $6.1 billion; 1998, we get up to 1,850, totaling $9.3 billion; \nand 2005, 5,634 earmarked projects totaling $21.6 billion of American \ntaxpayers' dollars. That is where we find the bypasses and the \nbeautification projects and the trails. And all those are earmarked by \nspecific Members of Congress. Meanwhile, we have 25 percent of our \nbridges that are deficient and 71,000 of them have significant \ndeterioration and reduced load-carrying capability and 80,000 that do \nnot meet current design standards.\n  What are we going to say to the taxpayers of America if, God forbid--\nand I pray not--there is another bridge collapse? What do we say to \nthem? That we took their tax dollars and built a museum instead of \nfixing their bridges and highways to ensure their safety?\n  Maybe--just maybe--if we had not spent $21.6 billion on earmarked \nprojects, maybe some of that money, just maybe some of that money might \nhave gone to fix the design problems on the bridge over the \nMississippi. Maybe not. Maybe we didn't know. I am not making a \njudgment here. But it seems to me that sooner or later, if you earmark \nas much as $21.6 billion of the taxpayers' money for museums and \nbypasses and brochures, sooner or later the priority projects suffer.\n  Again, projects originally authorized under SAFETEA-LU, the 2005 \nhighway bill, included $3.2 billion for landscaping enhancements along \nthe Ronald Reagan Freeway. I have often wondered how often Ronald \nReagan turns over in his grave. I bet he was spinning on that one. Mr. \nPresident, $480,000 to rehabilitate a historic warehouse along the Erie \nCanal; $600,000 for the construction of horse riding trails in \nVirginia. You will notice all these projects are earmarked to a \nspecific locality. That is what, among other things, they have in \ncommon. There is $2.5 million for the Daniel Boone Wilderness Trail \nCorridor; $400,000 to rehabilitate and redesign the Erie Canal Museum; \n$400,000 for jogging, bicycle, and trolley trails in Columbus, GA. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  No one thinks our Nation should be without flowers, ferries, bike \npaths, and boat museums. But today we have to make some choices about \npriorities and how we spend limited resources.\n  This has to be considered in the backdrop of this year a $1.8 \ntrillion deficit, the largest in the history of this country since \nWorld War II. There is no end in sight. It is almost overwhelming, a \n$1.8 trillion deficit this year. But what is worse, there is no way \nout. No one knows of a plan to bring us to a balanced budget without \nfundamental reform of Medicare and Social Security. Here before us on \nhealth care reform, we see another trillion dollars piled on that.\n  When are we going to decide we cannot afford taxpayers' dollars to \nrehabilitate and redesign museums, for trails, for beautification and \nlandscaping enhancements when we have other priorities on \ntransportation that have to do with the safety of our citizens?\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his continued advocacy for the \ntaxpayers of America. I thank him for all the efforts he makes. I \nregret that neither he nor I will be elected Miss Congeniality in the \nSenate again this year. But I also believe the American people are \nbeginning to wake up, and they are beginning to get angry. We saw this \nin the tea parties that took place all over this country. I hear it and \nsee it in response to my Twitters. Over 1 million people now follow my \nTwitters and my tweets. They are very interested in this. We are going \nto post all these. We are going to let the American people know where \ntheir dollars have gone.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's, for once, catch up with the American \npeople and start becoming fiscally conservative. One of the best ways \nwe can be careful stewards of their tax dollars is to make sure we \nplace as our highest priority their safety as they travel the highways \nand cross the bridges of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the time remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Vitter amendment, 9 minutes is \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, so I may make a unanimous \nconsent request, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Introduction and Conclusion of a report entitled ``Out of Gas: \nCongress Raids the Highway Trust Fund for Pet Projects While Bridges \nand Roads Crumble'' by Senator Coburn and myself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       One of the many recent government bailouts consisted of $8 \n     billion for the bankrupt\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\n     Highway Trust Fund (HTF)--a fund set up to support, through \n     federal gasoline and other taxes, all federal transportation \n     programs and projects.\n       However, the $8 billion did not solve the problem. The \n     Highway Trust Fund will go bankrupt (again) by the end of \n     August 2009 unless Congress bails it out (again). This week \n     the U.S. House of Representatives voted to spend $7 billion \n     of taxpayers' money, just to keep the Fund temporarily \n     afloat, and the U.S. Senate is poised to do the same. Mere \n     months ago, Congress provided over $27 billion for highway \n     and infrastructure projects as part of the American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n       Yet billion-dollar government bailouts are not the solution \n     to protect our nation's infrastructure. Congress must begin \n     by reprioritizing funds.\n       Flowers, bike paths, and even road-kill reduction programs, \n     are just some of the many examples of extraneous expenditures \n     (some of which are legally required) funded by Congress \n     through federal transportation bills. Many of these projects \n     are funded as earmarks, while others are born from \n     legislators turning their private passions into public \n     programs. Congress instead should allow states greater \n     flexibility to allocate their highway dollars to their most \n     pressing transportation needs. If Congress fails to \n     reprioritize transportation spending, then crumbling bridges, \n     congested highways, and poor road conditions will continue to \n     deteriorate much to the detriment of all Americans.\n       Congress must also curb its addiction to earmarking and \n     setting aside transportation funding for legislators' pet \n     projects and programs. If history is any guide, though, the \n     next highway bill will not be earmark free. Congress has \n     increased significantly the earmarking of federal highway \n     funding:\n       The 1982 highway bill included 10 demonstration projects \n     totaling $386 million;\n       The 1987 highway bill included 152 demonstration projects \n     totaling $1.4 billion;\n       The 1991 highway bill included 538 location-specific \n     projects totaling $6.1 billion;\n       The 1998 highway bill included 1,850 earmarked projects \n     totaling $9.3 billion; and\n       The 2005 highway bill included over 5,634 earmarked \n     projects totaling $21.6 billion.\n\n\n                        gao releases new report\n\n       A new U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, \n     compiled at the request of Senators Tom Coburn and John \n     McCain, details how the U.S. Department of Transportation \n     (DOT) has obligated $78 billion over the last five years for \n     ``purposes other than construction and maintenance of \n     highways and bridges.'' This $78 billion figure does not \n     fully capture how much has been promised, or authorized, by \n     Congress over the last five years for these ``other \n     purposes,'' it just reflects how much has been released for \n     spending, or obligated, so far.\n       The $78 billion, five-year total for obligated expenditures \n     for non-highway, non-bridge construction or maintenance \n     projects includes:\n       Over $2 billion on 5,547 projects for bike paths and \n     pedestrian walkways and facilities;\n       $850 million for 2,772 ``scenic beautification'' and \n     landscaping projects;\n       $488 million for behavioral research;\n       $313 million for safety belt performance grants;\n       $224 million for 366 projects to rehabilitate and operate \n     historic transportation buildings, structures, and \n     facilities;\n       $215 million for 859 projects under scenic or historic \n     highway programs;\n       $121 million on 63 projects for ferryboats and ferry \n     terminal facilities;\n       $110 million for occupant protection incentive grants;\n       $84 million for 398 projects for safety and education of \n     pedestrians and bicyclists;\n       $84 million for 213 road-kill prevention, wildlife habitat \n     connectivity, and highway runoff pollution mitigation \n     projects;\n       $28 million to establish 55 transportation museums;\n       $19 million for 25 projects to control and remove outdoor \n     advertising;\n       $18 million for motorcyclist safety grants; and\n       $13 million on 50 projects for youth conservation service.\n       While some of these expenditures may merit funding, \n     periodic congressional review is essential to determine if \n     all merit continued funding, if measurable outcomes are \n     demonstrating their success, and if their goals could be \n     accomplished with fewer dollars.\n       Upon review, Congress may find some of these expenditures \n     are unnecessary luxuries and others--such as establishing new \n     transportation museums--simply cannot be justified while the \n     Highway Trust Fund has insufficient funds for repairing \n     dangerous roads and bridges.\n\n\n                      re-examine before refilling\n\n       As Congress debates ``refilling'' (by deficit spending) the \n     soon-to-be-empty Highway Trust Fund, it should first look at \n     ways to reprioritize areas of current spending that may not \n     reflect the realities of a decaying national transportation \n     infrastructure. Many politicians are quick to defend spending \n     millions in federal funds on their districts' bike paths, \n     transportation museums, road-side flowers, and even the \n     ``bridge to nowhere.'' Yet, Congress needs to evaluate \n     whether such projects merit federal funding in light of our \n     current trillion-dollar deficit, the economic downturn, and \n     the realities of a collapsing transportation infrastructure \n     that literally is costing American lives.\n\n\n                      the status quo will not work\n\n       Critics of the GAO report and this report will claim these \n     examples are but a small portion of overall transportation \n     spending and do not begin to address the long-term Trust Fund \n     shortfall.\n       Yet, we cannot continue to spend $78 billion in areas other \n     than crucial road and bridge construction and maintenance and \n     beg Congress to steal from our nation's children and \n     grandchildren when the Highway Trust Fund runs dry. We cannot \n     spend hundreds of millions of tax dollars to renovate \n     ``historic facilities'' such as gas stations and then \n     complain that history will look poorly on a nation that let \n     its vital interstate transportation system fall into \n     disrepair.\n       We should not force states to spend approximately 10 \n     percent of all their surface transportation program funds on \n     ``enhancement'' projects like landscaping, bicycle safety, \n     and transportation museums, when fixing a bridge or repairing \n     a road would be a more practical and necessary use of these \n     limited funds.\n       We have asked individuals and families across the country \n     to examine their own budgets and start spending more \n     responsibly. We should expect nothing less of our nation's \n     leaders in Congress.\n     Tom Coburn.\n     John McCain.\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Our country is literally running on empty. Future \n     generations of Americans will inherit a multi-trillion dollar \n     debt because Washington politicians have long relied on \n     reckless borrowing to finance their wish lists of pet \n     projects and programs. There seems to be no crisis facing our \n     nation that Washington politicians believe borrowing or \n     bailouts cannot solve.\n       Now the politicians want to be trusted with yet another \n     bailout, this time of The Highway Trust Fund. Politicians \n     will not make tough choices, so taxpayers must begin \n     demanding them.\n       The choices faced today with the Highway Trust Fund are:\n\n       What is the best way to spend Highway Trust Funds: Is it to \n     make roadways and bridges more scenic, or more safe?\n       What is the best way to pay for our nation's infrastructure \n     needs: Is it to raise taxes on gasoline, borrow more money \n     for yet another government bailout, or reduce spending on \n     non-essential projects that do not strengthen roads or \n     bridges?\n\n       GAO reports our nation obligated $78 billion over five \n     years to projects other than crucial bridge and highway \n     maintenance and repair. Now, Congress is being asked to \n     borrow $7 billion from general tax revenues to only \n     temporarily refill the Highway Trust Fund.\n       No one is saying our nation should be without flowers and \n     ferries or bike paths and boat museums. But today's choices \n     must be about priorities. Should those priorities include \n     spending millions on programs that tell bikers to smile and \n     making states use funds for the safety of their turtles \n     instead of the safety of their citizens?\n       At a minimum, states should be given the flexibility to opt \n     out of the federal Transportation Enhancement funding \n     requirement.\n       The shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund could also be \n     addressed without further deficit spending by shifting unused \n     funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n     2009. Transferring unspent stimulus funds to ensure the \n     Highway Trust Fund remains solvent would be consistent with a \n     stated purpose of the Act to improve our transportation \n     infrastructure to support job growth.\n       Congress should walk the fiscally responsible path. Each \n     chamber should implement a moratorium on all transportation-\n     related earmarks for the remainder of the 111th Congress.\n       Washington politicians should be required to sit down with \n     the new GAO report, the transportation bailout request, and \n     our red pens. From there, crossing out extraneous \n     transportation spending should be our first priority. Lives \n     depend on it.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, while Senator McCain is here, we were \ntalking about the amount of money the government has spent. We talked \nabout how a third of the money has been obligated from this stimulus \npackage. But I advise, according to the CBO report in June, they only \nexpected 11 percent of the money to actually be disbursed by the end of \nthis year, at least the money that deals with highways, mass transit, \nand issues of that kind. That is stunningly low because we were told \nsomething quite different.\n  This Vitter amendment is exactly the kind of thing we need to be \ndoing every single day: try to challenge the conventional thinking to \nfigure out how we can deal with a need today without increasing \nAmerica's debt.\n  What Senator Vitter says is when we passed this $800 billion stimulus \npackage in January, nobody had a chance to read it. We were told \nrepeatedly--and\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\nthe President himself said more than once--it was to build \ninfrastructure, to complete highways, roads, and bridges. That is what \nthe money was going to be for. He said in February: They are not going \nto be make-work jobs but jobs doing the work Americans desperately need \ndone, jobs rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, and jobs \nrepairing our dangerously deficient dams and levees so we won't face \nanother Katrina.\n  I am not sure Congress can stop another Katrina from coming, but we \ncan perhaps be better prepared for it. But what a lot of people do not \nknow, is that less than 4 percent of the money in that bill was \ndirected for highways and bridges. It was a game, a political trick, \nbecause the American people believe that when you need to create jobs, \nyou might as well build something that is permanent, that will benefit \nthe people for years to come and that creates real jobs. In their \nminds, I think most people envisioned stepping up our road projects. \nBut only, as I said, 4 percent of the entire package went for that \npurpose.\n  Now we have a lot of that money not spent. Apparently, 89 percent \nwill not be spent by the end of this fiscal year. Some of it is not \nobligated at all. We have a shortage in the foundational highway trust \nfund bill, and we need to come up with $27 billion. So which do we do? \nDo we take some of the money that was in the stimulus package that we \nwere told was to be for roads and bridges and use that money and not \nincrease the deficit because that money is already showing up as a hit \nto the U.S. Treasury or does the money come from some other source that \nwill increase the debt by $27 billion?\n  The only reason not to oppose this, that I can see, is some people \nhave already spent this $27 billion in their own minds. They don't want \nto see it utilized for this purpose, and they are undermining our \nability to do so. We have a national crisis.\n  Let me show this chart. It is so stunning that people don't believe \nit, but it is based on the budget that President Obama submitted, his \n10-year budget. It was analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, our \nown group here who has a good reputation. Basically, the Director is \nelected by a Democratic majority in the Congress, and this is what they \nshow about our deficit.\n  We have to stop doing this. We cannot sustain a deficit.\n  In 2008, the debt was $5.8 trillion. The debt of the United States, \nsince the founding of the American Republic, was $5.8 trillion. In 5 \nyears, according to the CBO, by following this budget, counting this \nstimulus package but not even counting the trillion dollar health care \nproposal and other things that might get added to it, they scored that \nin 5 years, the debt would be $11.8 trillion--double. In 5 more years, \ntaking it to 10 years, the debt would triple to $17.3 trillion. This is \nthe entire debt of the United States of America since the founding of \nthe Republic--it will triple in 10 years. It is unacceptable. We cannot \nsustain this.\n  Let me show this chart. Trillions is difficult for people to \ncomprehend, but when you borrow money and you go into debt, you have to \npay interest on it. People buy Treasury bills. That is what we do to \nfund the deficit.\n  In 2009, this fiscal year, we will make interest payments of $170 \nbillion on the debt and the money we borrowed. The total Federal \nhighway program, I believe, is $40 or $50 billion, isn't that right \nSenator Inhofe? He is the expert. So this is four times the Federal \nhighway bill annually. We spend approximately $100 billion on \neducation. These interest payments increase every year. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, 10 years from now, we will not be \nspending $170 billion on interest, we will be spending $799 billion. \nThat is the red numbers, $799 billion in interest, for which we get not \n1 foot of highway paved, not $1 to the classroom, not $1 for health \ncare, just interest because we borrowed so much money.\n  I also point out the numbers do not get better. Over the 10-year \nbudget, the Obama budget, the debt goes up rapidly in the outyears. I \nnote that President Bush was criticized for having a big deficit. The \nhighest deficit he ever had--which was unacceptable, I have to say--was \n$459 billion. According to the Congressional Budget Office, there is \nnot 1 year in the next 10 that we will have a deficit that low. The \nlowest year is over $600 billion. They calculate the deficit as it \ngrows, and in the 10th year, they calculate the deficit for that 1 year \nto be $1.1 trillion--$1.1 trillion--on an upward spiral.\n  What I wish to say is there is no plan to pay this debt off. The only \nplan we have is to see surging debts into the future. That is why you \nhave heard this phrase repeatedly, ``This is not sustainable.'' And it \nis not. But when we cannot even use our stimulus money to fix the road \nproblem we have, we are not serious about the challenges facing this \ncountry.\n  The bit about interest, if the interest rates go up higher than CBO \nhas scored based on the amount of money we have to borrow--and that \ncould happen--we could end up with an annual interest payment of over \n$1 trillion.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, we made an effort--and the Senator \nreferenced the Vitter amendment. We have 67 percent of the $789 billion \nthat is not obligated. That means it is not there. The Senator is \nright; in their minds it may be obligated, but it is not obligated. We \ntried to have an amendment to triple the amount of money that would \nhave gone to roads and highways and bridges back during the \nconsideration, and we couldn't get that in. The Senator was a cosponsor \nof my amendment. Now we are trying to do the same thing we were unable \nto do then.\n  This is supposed to be a stimulus bill. The total amount of stimulus \nin this bill, in my opinion, is about 7\\1/2\\ percent. This is an \nopportunity to do something with real jobs and not have any problem in \nincreasing our debt or deficit.\n  So I appreciate the fact that my colleague is coming down, and \nseveral Senators will be coming down, and drawing this to the attention \nof the American people as well as to our friends on the other side. \nThere is our opportunity to save lives, to do infrastructure--one of \nthe major reasons we are here in this Chamber today.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate that comment and my colleague's \nleadership. He has consistently been a champion for infrastructure and \nroads. We face a tight budget, and I feel strongly about this. I know I \nam raising my voice but somehow we have to break through the fog and \nlet the American people know that every time we face a little problem \nwe can't just spend more money. We have to look for ways to solve the \nproblem that doesn't increase our debt.\n  By the way, in case anybody has any doubts, any new spending that we \ninitiate increases the debt because we are running a deficit. So any \nnew spending increases the deficit for the year because it is not \noffset or paid for.\n  So I am worried about where we are heading. I do believe \ninfrastructure will pay for itself in the long run, but there is a \nlimit to how much we can spend on it. However, I will concede that we \ncertainly don't need to have a savaging of our highway bill at this \npoint in time and have hundreds of thousands of people perhaps laid off \nfrom work because we don't have the money to finish projects that need \nto be completed. Instead, let's take the money that is in the stimulus \nbill. Let's take that money and use it now to fix the shortfall in the \nhighway trust fund. Once we do that, we will create jobs. How many, I \ndon't know, but it will create jobs, and that is a double benefit.\n  We get a permanent benefit for the American infrastructure, and we \ncreate jobs for Americans now. We take the money that is sitting there \nand not being spent and accelerate its use in the time we need it.\n  I would point out to my colleague the reason this is important, and \nthe reason the administration was able to ram through this stimulus \nbill--the largest single expenditure in the history of the American \nRepublic, almost $800 billion in one fell swoop, with hundreds of pages \nand people having no idea what was in it--is because they said we are \nfacing rising unemployment, and we need to get this money out in a \nhurry so we can put people to work. Well, only 11 percent of it is \ngoing to be obligated by the end of this year.\n  Unemployment is already at 9.5 percent, and most experts are \npredicting it will probably continue to go up to 10, maybe 11 percent. \nYet we can't get this money out, and we are cutting the highway budget? \nWhen we have this\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nshortfall, what do people come up with? Well, they are going to pay for \nit by adding more debt. We have an economic slowdown, so we no longer \nhave to worry about the deficit. We don't have to worry about the \ndeficit, they tell us. But we do.\n  Our children are going to be paying interest on these trillions of \ndollars for the rest of their lives, and the only people who are going \nto get the benefit from it are the people living today. That is a \nselfish thing. We should use the stimulus in an effective way to create \njobs--and there are even debates about how wise some of those methods \nare economically. But the way this package is being managed, the money \nis not getting out, unemployment is surging, and there doesn't seem to \nbe any hope for the short term for unemployment to abate. So I am \nworried about it. I do believe we can do better.\n  They will say: Well, President Bush had a deficit. We inherited all \nthis. But President Bush didn't ask for the $800 billion in stimulus \nmoney that President Obama asked for this year. That is on top of the \ndebt, and I think anybody who is president needs to be thinking about \nhow to reduce spending not see it spin out of control. I don't believe \nPresident Bush would have submitted a budget that shows in 10 years--in \nthat one year, 2019--it would be $1.1 trillion. We have never seen \nanything like that.\n  There will not be a year of President Obama's Presidency, according \nto this--if he serves 8 years--in which this deficit will be as low as \nPresident Bush's, and they are predicting growth. No recession is \nprojected in the next 10 years, when CBO scored what the deficits might \nbe. So this is a fair analysis of it.\n  Mr. President, I want to say I am pleased Senator Vitter has proposed \na way that will allow us to meet the shortfall in the highway trust \nfund without increasing the debt this year, and it is consistent with \nwhat the people who proposed the stimulus bill promised all along--that \nthe stimulus money would be used for highways and bridges. It is the \nright thing to do. I hope we can pass this, and I think the American \npeople should watch closely on how the votes go on this bill.\n  I thank the Chair, I reserve the remainder of the time, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our national debt is a national challenge \nand a national problem, and we can face it and face it honestly, \nDemocrats and Republicans. We can't leave these debts to our children. \nThat is a fact. But let's have some honesty in recounting the history \nof this debt.\n  When President Clinton left office 9 years ago, he gave to President \nGeorge W. Bush a surplus not a debt, a surplus. He had not only \nbalanced the budget, he was generating a surplus, and it was giving \nlonger life to Social Security. President George W. Bush inherited this \nsurplus and an accumulated national debt over the 200-year history of \nthe United States of $5 trillion--$5 trillion. Remember that number \nbecause 8 years later, when President Bush left office, the national \ndebt had doubled--doubled--with the support of his party.\n  Why did it double? It doubled because he fought a war and didn't pay \nfor it. He accumulated debt year after year--in addition to the \nterrible casualties and losses of our brave fighting men and women--and \nleft that debt to future generations. Then, in the midst of this, he \ncut taxes. For the first time in the history of the United States of \nAmerica, a President, in the midst of war, cut taxes for the wealthiest \npeople in our country, supported by the same party that comes now and \npreaches to us their sermon of fiscal integrity.\n  So when President Bush left office, he left President Obama a deficit \nand a national debt that had doubled under his watch, with Republican \ncongressional leadership support. That is a fact. Those are facts. \nPresident Obama inherited that debt and inherited the problems that \ncame with it and the sickest economy America had seen in 75 years. That \nis what he was given.\n\n  So President Obama said: We have to be serious about our debt, but we \nhave to be honest about it too. Until we get out of this recession, \nuntil we stop this rampant unemployment where people are losing their \njobs and can't fend for their families and can't pay taxes--obviously, \nbecause they do not have work--we are going to see this deficit \ncontinue to grow. To stabilize this economy, we need to put people back \nto work.\n  The President said: I know it is tough to spend money when you are in \ndebt, but at this moment in time it is like buying a tourniquet to stop \nthe bleeding. We have to do it, even if it takes every penny we have. \nAnd he put together a stimulus bill to get this economy back on its \nfeet. With the exception of three then-Republican Senators, not a \nsingle one of them would support this effort to stop the recession.\n  When President Obama came to office, we were losing 741,000 jobs a \nmonth. Now, 4 months into our 24-month stimulus, we have cut that \nnumber by one-third, and I hope we have turned the corner. But this \nmassive economy of ours, connected throughout the world with so many \nother global economies, it is pretty tough to turn this battleship and \nmove it in the right direction. I think the President has done the \nright thing.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana is an amendment \nwhich says: Give up. Give up on stimulating this economy. Give up on \nstopping this recession. Stop building these projects that create \nAmerican jobs--good-paying jobs. Stop investing in our infrastructure \nfor future generations. Stop addressing this recession head on and pray \nfor a good outcome.\n  I am sorry, but I can't buy it. The Senator from Louisiana is \noffering a proposal to take money out of the President's recovery and \nreinvestment package that was determined to stabilize this economy. He \nwants to take the money out of it when we are 4 months into it. He says \nthis morning: We are not spending this money fast enough.\n  Incidentally, he voted against this, but now he is criticizing it \nsaying we are not spending it fast enough. Well, I want to spend it \nquickly, but I want to spend it wisely, and I want accountability. At \nthe end of the day, the taxpayers will hold us all accountable: Did you \nspend our tax dollars wisely? Did you spend them on projects that \nreally do benefit our country? Did you waste it? Was there fraud? I \nwant those questions answered in the positive frame of mind that we \nhave done everything we can do. So it is not being spent as fast as its \ncritics say, but I think it is being spent wisely, and we are creating \njobs all across America.\n  Thousands of projects are on line now creating good-paying jobs. The \namendments we are considering today on the Republican side of the \naisle, all from Members who opposed the President's effort to stop this \nrecession with the stimulus bill, every one of them wants to put an end \nto the stimulus package. With 150 days into this 2-year bill, they want \nto put an end to it by starting to take money out of it. They have \ngiven up on it. They have given up on a package which, incidentally, \nprovided a tax break for 95 percent of the working families in America.\n  Does that help? You bet it does. These families are struggling in the \nrecession too. They have seen their life savings devastated by the \nstock market in the last year. Giving them a helping hand is a sensible \nthing to do.\n  It is a bill they voted against--the President's bill--which says \nlet's give unemployed workers $25 more per week so they can get by. \nSure, it doesn't sound like a lot of money, except when you don't have \na job and every penny counts. They want to criticize, as well, the \nPresident's idea of providing health insurance to unemployed workers. \nNo, they said that was a terrible idea. They voted against it.\n  Think about this: You have just lost your job, you may lose your \nhouse, your child has to go to the doctor with a raging fever, and you \npray to God a diagnosis isn't going to come down that will wipe out \nyour life savings. For them it is an extravagance--the idea of \nproviding health insurance for unemployed people. For me, it is part of \nAmerica, a caring country that stands by people when they are facing \nthe misfortunes of losing their job.\n  The list goes on and on, and they oppose all of it. They now come and \nsay, we not only opposed it at the outset, we are going to start taking \nmoney out of it. We are going to pass it around, moving it in a lot of \ndirections. Some want to put it in the highway trust\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\nfund, some in unemployment insurance, and some want to put it in \nhousing programs. But the net result is the same. It takes the money \nthe President wanted to use to stimulate this economy and create good-\npaying jobs. We need to resist these amendments.\n  Mr. President, I understand Senator DeMint wants to offer an \namendment, and we are supposed to close at 2. So I don't know if he is \nprepared at this time, but if he is, I would be happy to yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank my colleague. I would like to make a few \ncomments. I am not going to offer an amendment at this time.\n  Mr. President, sometimes in this place it is hard to extract the \ntruth from the words. I, frankly, don't understand the opposition to \nusing money for transportation that has already been allocated to \ntransportation.\n  I think we have had enough of saying we need to spend more money and \nborrow more money because the Bush administration spent too much and \nborrowed too much. This is a bipartisan problem. Hopefully, we will \nhave a bipartisan solution.\n  What is being proposed today is we need more money for highways. The \nhighway trust fund is running out of money. We need more money to pay \nunemployment benefits. They are running out of money. We would like \nmore money for FHA loans. We have to decide do we want to use money \nthat is already designated for purposes of our economy and helping \npeople who don't have jobs or do we want to borrow more money and spend \nmore money and add more money to our debt?\n  I don't think this situation is a good reason to say: Hey, we were \nbad in the past, so let's continue those practices. We are not \nsuggesting with these amendments that we should stop the stimulus plan. \nWe are saying we should use it for the same purposes it was set up for. \nLet's use it to build roads and bridges and create jobs. Let's use it \nto make sure those who are unemployed get their benefits. Let's use it \nto restimulate our housing market.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will now suspend. The Senate is \nready to take a recess.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair for all the time to speak, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate stands in \nrecess until 3 p.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8525-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 2 p.m., recessed until 3 p.m., and \nreassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. \nFranken).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8525-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8525-S8533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HIGHWAY TRUST FUND EXTENSION--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the transfer of \nthe highway trust fund money. I do, of course, support having the money \nin the highway fund because so many States need to have this money and \nwe need to assure it is there. I also support the amendments that would \nuse the stimulus money so it would not be new money.\n  But I do wish to talk about the highway trust fund because I think it \nis important, as we are talking about this very important \ntransportation issue for our States, that we begin the debate about \nwhether the highway trust fund is now the appropriate vehicle for \nkeeping our Federal highways repaired and also doing the best for every \nState in transportation. What concerns me is that the first reason for \nthe highway trust fund back in President Eisenhower's day over 50 years \nago has been achieved. Yet we are still continuing to have the same \nformulas where some States are winners and some States are losers. But \nevery State today has the capacity to determine its own priorities and \nthe capacity to fund those priorities, unlike 50 years ago when there \nwere many States that had very little capacity. They had little \nproperty, they had little taxable revenue sources, and therefore there \nwas a need for a national system of highways to assure that we had \nnational security. That was the first reason for it--but also mobility \nand commerce.\n  Today, however, I think it is time for us to start all over. I think \nit is time for us to allow States to opt out of the highway trust fund.\n  Of course, I am speaking for the largest donor State in America. We \ngive more back to other States than any other State. We are a State \nthat has more highway miles than any other State; therefore, we collect \nmore taxes. Because we are a donor State, we give the most away. If \nthese were States that could not meet their own needs and my State of \nTexas was a State that had its needs covered, maybe you could argue \nthat would be OK. But, in fact, that is not the case. In fact, Texas is \nfacing a huge shortage in our highway funding. We now have two cities \nthat have mass transit systems that are certainly very successful but \nvery far behind the curve when it comes to the transportation glut on \nour highways. We need to have the money in Texas to start meeting our \ngreat transportation needs.\n  This also affects our environment, because when we have people \nclogged in traffic, sitting on freeways hour after hour, of course it \nis bad for the ability to get where you want to go, but it is also bad \nfor the environment to have the fumes going in the air.\n  I think today it is time for us to start the debate. Why not let a \nState opt out, agree to keep in good repair the Federal highway system \nand allow the States to use their own taxpayer dollars for their own \npriorities to meet their own transportation and mobility needs? If \nTexas could keep all the money it raises, rather than toll roads, which \nare now being contemplated throughout our State, perhaps we could have \na mobility plan that would include highways, rapid transit, high-speed \nrail, and more innovative ideas that are very costly, which we cannot \nafford at this time.\n  Obviously, today we are going to go forward with extending the trust \nfund and replenishing the highway trust fund because that is what \npeople want to do because we don't have time to address the whole issue \nof reauthorization at this very complicated time. I wish we were not \ngoing to consider an 18 month extension in September because I think we \nought to have a short-term extension, so we do have the reauthorization \nof the highway bill, so we can start discussing these priorities--so we \ncan start maybe thinking outside the box. Maybe we can start all over.\n  The highway trust fund and the highway authorization bill is a \nmishmash of different projects. I don't think there is fairness in the \nsystem at all. You have donor States, you have winner States, and the \nwinner States have all the capacity. The loser States have as much need \nas the winner States, and the winner States have the ability, I \nbelieve, to fund their own options.\n  Even though I know we are going to extend the highway bill for 18 \nmonths by the end of September, and I know we are going to replenish \nthe highway fund today--and I wish it would be from our stimulus \npackage so it would not be yet another deficit-inducing measure from \nthis Congress--I think I am going to lose all the arguments I am \nmaking. But I do think it important that we bring this issue to the \nforefront.\n  There is no reason in this country today for winner States and loser \nStates. Our States should be able to plan for themselves, make their \nown priorities, meet their needs, be able to be more efficient, have \nmultimodal systems--which is what I hope for Texas--and be able to use \nour own tax dollars for our own needs. Were we a State that did not \nhave needs, were we a State that was not growing, maybe we could afford \nto continue giving 8 cents back for every $1 we send to Washington. \nMaybe we could afford to leave the 8 cents in Washington.\n  Instead, we are getting 92 cents back for every $1 we send to \nWashington. That is hundreds of millions of dollars that we need for \nour high-growth State that has many traffic problems and congestion \nproblems today. We will repair our highways. We would sign an agreement \nto repair our highways so there would be no Federal responsibility for \nthat. But I hope this argument will be the beginning of a debate so we \ncan instate a system that will be more in tune with today's times, 50 \nyears after the National Highway System was created--a wonderful system \nthat connects our country but one, now, that is finished. We have our \nNational Highway System. We do have\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nconnectivity among our States. Why not allow the States to go out from \nthose Federal highway miles and lanes, to go into their States in the \nbest way for each individual State?\n  I thank Senator Brown for allowing me to speak on this issue. I hope, \nas we go through, we will have more of a discussion.\n  I do have a bill introduced that would allow States to opt out. It is \nsomething I think the time has come to address.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in time counting against \nthe Ensign amendment. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness and the time be counted against the Ensign amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I first congratulate the Presiding Officer \nfor his first time in the Presiding Officer's chair and wish him many \nmore of these. I know the experience will continue to enrich him and \nenrich the Senate. I thank the Presiding Officer of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, last week, more than 1,500 Ohioans woke up at dawn to \nwait in a line that snaked around the W.O. Walker Center, co-owned by \nthe Cleveland Clinic and University Hospital.\n  Last week, President Obama also visited the Cleveland Clinic--one of \nour Nation's premier health care centers.\n  He observed firsthand how the Cleveland Clinic and cutting-edge \nhealth care centers like University Hospitals and Metro Health are \nproviding high-quality care while reducing patients' costs.\n  But the more than 1,500 Ohioans who stood in line at 5 a.m. last \nSaturday morning were not waiting for President Obama.\n  They were waiting to see one of hundreds of dermatologists, nurses, \nurologists, cardiologists, neurologists, infectious disease \nspecialists, dentists, and other volunteers who were providing free \nhealth care for one of Cleveland's first mass health clinics.\n  Need a pair of glasses? Lead optician Dr. Rob Engel checked your \nvision while volunteer Sharon Connor helped you select a pair on the \nspot.\n  Need prescription medicine? You were able to visit Margo and Rob \nRoth, who ran the clinic's pharmacy.\n  Worried about women's health services? Dr. Laura David, an \nobstetrician from University Hospitals, was ready to help.\n  Along with volunteers Maria Parks and her husband Lee, I helped sign-\nin and register a number of Ohioans.\n  Many of them were members of hard-working families worried that they \nmight join the 14,000 Americans who lose health insurance each day.\n  Maria, Lee, and I heard one organizer call a medical volunteer a \n``hero'' for stepping forward to help their neighbors.\n  That same volunteer responded by saying the real heroes are the \nfathers, mothers, sons, and daughters struggling every day in the \nshadow of a looming health care crisis that threatens to send their \nfamily into financial ruin.\n  In fact, most of the people who sought health services at the weekend \nclinic were from middle class families who had fallen on hard times.\n  Together with MetroHealth, St. Vincent's, University Hospitals, Case \nWestern Reserve University, and the Cleveland Clinic, Medworks \nvolunteers provided the kind of health care all Americans need, but too \nmany don't receive.\n  Medworks founder Zac Ponsky turned not only to his community but to \nhis family to contribute their time.\n  Zach's wife Taryn helped coordinate the many moving parts of the \nclinic. Kim Ponsky, Zac's sister, is a professional photographer who \ndocumented the weekend.\n  Meanwhile, Zac's father Jeff, brothers Lee and Todd, and sister-in-\nlaw Diana--all physicians--provided a standard of care that most of the \npatients that day had never received.\n  During a single weekend, the generous volunteers of Medworks taught \nus the meaning of compassion and humility.\n  They led by example.\n  Many patients received multiple services, while doctors made instant \nreferrals to other Cleveland-area doctors for those patients not \noriginally scheduled.\n  Over the course of the weekend, seven people needing advanced care, \nonce diagnosed, were able to receive it at local hospitals.\n  More than 130 women had pap tests and nearly 100 women received \nvouchers for free mammograms at Women's Diagnostics.\n  Nearly 300 people either walked out of the clinic with a brand new \npair of glasses or will be receiving a new pair soon.\n  A number of patients received vouchers for follow-up eye care at St. \nVincent's Charity Hospital, an exceptional hospital in Cleveland.\n  Approximately 50 people were tested for HIV. But it was not just \nhealth care services that were provided. Each patient also spent time \nwith a social worker who provided counseling and information about \nfollowup services. The Ohio Benefits Bank was on hand to offer \nprescreening for medical, housing, energy, tax, employment and other \nprograms. Approximately 100 patients took advantage of that service.\n  All told, approximately 300 community members, 100 doctors, 175 \nnurses, and social workers volunteered their time and services during \nthis Saturday/Sunday event. This includes a number of volunteers who \nsimply showed up unannounced. It included a few patients who were so \ngrateful for the care they then volunteered to stay after their \nappointments to help.\n  Building on effectiveness of the weekend, MedWorks is now focused on \npatient followup. Currently, a team of doctors is reviewing medical \nrecords to follow up with emergency cases and to help those people \nsuffering from chronic illness.\n  MedWorks volunteer and chief of surgery at University Hospitals, Dr. \nJeff Ponsky, said:\n\n       We're very hopeful that this will become a regular part of \n     our community. We'll get better at it, and we'll be a leader \n     for the country.\n\n  We can do more for the millions of Americans who are one illness away \nfrom financial ruin. We can do more for the 14,000 Americans who lose \ntheir insurance every day. We can do more for the 45 million uninsured \nand the tens and tens of millions of underinsured in this country.\n  Today is the 44th anniversary of President Johnson's signing of \nMedicare. Medicare changed our Nation. It helped pull millions of \nseniors out of poverty; it fostered personal independence; it fueled \nour economy; and it helped retirees live long and healthy lives.\n  Just as those who worked tirelessly 44 years ago to secure health \ncare for America's seniors, the generous MedWorks volunteers in \nCleveland are doing all they can for their community.\n  In Washington, we are working to effect change in our health care \nsystem. That is our duty, to make this historic change, to reform the \nhealth insurance industry, to allow our Nation to move on from human \ntragedy--from the health care related bankruptcies, from the \ncompetitive disadvantage American businesses face from the huge costs, \nthe burden that small businesses face in this country. We can keep \nworking, keep fighting for the change Americans are demanding.\n  The Ohioans I met in Cleveland last Saturday, and every Ohioan from \nLima to Zanesville, from Chillicothe to Ashtabula, every American in \nevery town in every State in this Nation all deserve the humane justice \nof stable and secure health care. That means quality and affordable \nhealth care options, public and private both. It means the health care \nplan that was voted out of the HELP Committee on which the Presiding \nOfficer sits. It means the plan that came out of that committee 2 weeks \nago, a plan that injects competition between private insurance plans \nand a public option, an option that people can choose. It will make \nthose plans work better, cut costs, and keep the insurance companies \nhonest. That will mean people, if they are laid off--if people are laid \noff in Marion or\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\nDayton, OH, people who have lost their insurance, people in Wapakoneta, \nin rural Ohio, all will have a public option to compete with sometimes \nall too few private insurance companies in their areas.\n  To all the MedWorks volunteers, including Jack Ponsky and his family, \nincluding Karil Bialostosky, Joel Goldstein, and Brian Smith, I thank \nall of you for your commitment, your compassion, and your care for \nthose in need.\n  Now it is up to us to provide the kind of health care to protect what \nworks in our health care system and to fix what is broken in our health \ncare system.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent now that the \ndebate time remaining with respect to amendments offered be yielded \nback; that after Senator Thune offers his amendment, then debate time \non that amendment extend until 3:45 p.m., divided as previously \nprovided; that at 3:45 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendments and motion to waive in the order listed, \nwith 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled, in order prior \nto each vote, with the vote time after the first vote limited to 10 \nminutes each as follows:\n  Vitter amendment No. 1907, as modified; Ensign amendment No. 1905, as \nmodified; Bond amendment No. 1904; the Thune amendment I have referred \nto; and the Boxer motion to waive the applicable Budget Act point of \norder; that with reference to amendment No. 1904, if a Budget Act point \nof order is raised against the amendment, then a motion to waive the \napplicable point of order be considered made, further that all other \nprovisions of the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are going to vote on a series of \nRepublican amendments to a bill that has come over from the House of \nRepresentatives that funds the highway trust fund until September 30, \nthat funds unemployment insurance, and that helps us with the housing \ncrisis and allows us to see more mortgages go to qualified families of \nAmerica.\n  It is important to note that if we don't accept the House package, we \nare really playing Russian roulette with the highway trust fund. As the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who works very \nhard with my colleague Senator Inhofe across party lines to ensure we \nhave a robust infrastructure program, I want to be clear: If we don't \npass this House bill, then we are up against the wall. We send a very \nbad signal to the people who are counting the contracts that go out for \nthe highway program and the work that follows. We have many working \npeople who count on these jobs.\n  I support one of these amendments. The Bond amendment makes eminent \nsense. I do take issue with the timing because we have been told by our \nHouse colleagues that this is all we are going to do; if we amend this \nbill, then we are stuck. So it is one of those awkward and difficult \nmoments.\n  Truth be told, the people out there who are working hard are not \ngoing to get all the subtleties of the moment. They want to make sure \ntheir job is there in the morning.\n  So even though I support one of these amendments, the Bond \namendment--and I have stated and Senator Bond understands that I will \nbe supporting him when we reauthorize this bill September 30; we will \ntake care of this rescission--we don't have to take care of it now. \nWhat we must take care of today is the highway trust fund. It is \nrunning out of funds. We have to act. I hope we can do it across party \nlines.\n  The other thing I support is an 18-month extension of highway \nprograms. That is, again, something I have done with my Republican \ncolleagues. We passed out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, on a unanimous vote, an 18-month extension. Senator Baucus, \nover on Finance, was able to come up with an intergovernmental transfer \nthat does not add to the deficit of about $27 billion to ensure that we \ncan go forward for 18 months while we sit down across party lines and \nfigure out the long-term answer to funding our highway and \ntransportation needs over the next 5 years.\n  There is a split between the Senate approach and the House approach. \nThe House approach, which I don't agree with, is to keep making short-\nterm extensions as a way to force us to act in the long term. But we \nall know we have to figure out a funding source that will take us \nthrough the next 5 or 6 years. It is going to take time, and we need to \ndo it right. I believe in making sure we have a pay-go system. I am not \nwilling, as the chairman of the committee, to simply hand off a huge \nbill to the Finance Committee without any recommendations. So it will \ntake us a little while. We have a difference between the House approach \nand the Senate approach.\n  But here is the point and why I believed it was important to be heard \nbefore we vote. The House has a very short-term extension. That is what \nthey have given us. They have told us that if we don't take this, we \nare not going to be able to ensure that the highway trust fund is \nsolvent. I, for one, am not willing to play games with this. It is too \nserious. Even though I don't agree with the House approach, we have \nother days left to make the case.\n  The other point I want to make is that the Republican approach to \nthis is the 18-month extension, which I fully support, and the way they \npay for it is by saying: We are going to take money out of the stimulus \nprogram, the economic stimulus program that has just begun to take hold \nin the country. The Republicans didn't vote for it, most of them--three \nof them did, but the others didn't--and they want to stop it. It is \ncounterproductive, in a time of recession, to stop a jobs program right \nin the middle. These are jobs for highways, transportation, cleaning up \nSuperfund sites. These are jobs that are dealing with water \ninfrastructure, with education. Of all the times to come up here and \nrecommend that we stop this jobs program now, this is wrong.\n  I am totally willing to work with my colleagues so at the end of the \nstimulus bill, at the end of that time, which is in about 18 months, if \nwe have not spent some of those funds, we should take a hard look at \nputting those funds into the Treasury to reduce the deficit, perhaps. \nPerhaps we need at that point to use some of it for the highway trust \nfund. But today is not the day.\n  If I could summarize where I see things today, we have a series of \nRepublican amendments that basically say we should stop this, we should \ntake funds out of the stimulus package now in order to pay for \nunemployment insurance, in order to pay for the highway trust fund, and \nin order to pay to help our people with their mortgages. And it is \ncounterproductive.\n\n  On the one hand, they are doing something to help the economy by \nhelping our people with mortgages, by ensuring there is unemployment \ninsurance, and ensuring there is money in the highway trust fund. On \nthe other hand, they are stopping jobs to do it, and it is not \nnecessary. The House bill, although I do not appreciate the fact that \nit is a very short-term extension of the highway trust fund, is deficit \nneutral. CBO has so scored it. So we do not have to do this, and we \nshould not do this.\n  As I understand it, it is time now to have that series of votes. So I \nmake a parliamentary inquiry as to what time we are having those votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time under the previous order has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. Then I would yield the floor, and I hope we \nwould be voting at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nSessions\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\nis going to get one more amendment in, and then we will start the \nvoting; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, that would be my preference. I would be \npleased to call up this amendment now. I do not know what the time \nagreement is at this point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We are ready to vote as soon as the Senator brings it up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2223\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call the \namendment up and to be able to speak for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That sounds good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have an opportunity to save $200 \nbillion. It is time for us to do the right thing. We cannot keep \nspending more and more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2223.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To restore sums to the Highway Trust Fund and for other \n               purposes in a fiscally responsible manner)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and replace:\n\n     SECTION L.

I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  We cannot keep spending more and more. We have several different \nproblems--we have housing problems; we have a problem with unemployment \ninsurance because more people are unemployed than had been predicted; \nand we have a problem with a shortfall in the highway fund.\n  Some Senators could argue we do not need to fix every one of these \nbecause we do not have the money. But in a way we do have the money \nbecause we passed $800 billion in a stimulus package earlier this year. \nIt was supposed to be primarily, we heard, for roads. But only 4 \npercent went to roads. So we can fix the shortfall in the highway trust \nfund by using some of the $800 billion we have already spent. We can \nfix the other two problems--unemployment insurance and housing--in the \nsame fashion. Those can be fixed out of this fund.\n  This amendment would do that. It would reduce the other accounts \nacross the board. Of course, we will still be in session this year and \nnext year. If we need to adjust other things in some way, we can. Don't \nlet anybody tell you this is going to savage some other account because \nwe can fix those accounts.\n  I will just say--I know my time is short--this is $200 billion that \nwill either go to increase spending and increase debt, or we can meet \nthese needs--which hopefully are all necessary--out of the funds we \nalready have out there. If we do not start making these kinds of \ndecisions soon, we are going to have a real problem. According to the \nscoring of the President's own budget, the total debt of America debt \nhas gone from $5 trillion this year, to $11 trillion 5 years from now, \nto $17 trillion 10 years from now.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1907, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes, \nequally divided, on the Vitter amendment.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise and urge strong bipartisan support \nfor the Vitter amendment. The Vitter amendment simply moves $7 billion \nfrom the stimulus--less than 1 percent of the original stimulus \nprogram--to backfill and take care of the need in the highway trust \nfund.\n  This is important to do for two reasons.\n  First of all, we need to stop the reckless borrowing. We are \nborrowing ourselves into oblivion. We are borrowing our children into \npoor economic times. We need to reverse that trend. The underlying bill \nfixes the hole in the highway trust fund simply by racking up more \ndebt, and that is why there is a budget point of order against it. So \nwe need to stop this never-ending upward spiral of borrowing.\n  No. 2, by doing this, we can focus a little bit of the stimulus on \nsomething I believe we all think it always should have been focused on: \ninfrastructure spending and spending now versus later. This will move \nthe $7 billion toward roadway spending now, which is effective \nstimulus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I urge strong bipartisan support against \nthe Vitter amendment. There is nothing about reckless borrowing going \non. I have already put into the Record today the CBO analysis of the \nHouse bill that is before us that says it even creates a little bit of \nsurplus because of how this is handled. This is not going on the debt. \nSo let's not stand here and say what it is about.\n  The second point is, there are tens of billions of dollars in unspent \nfunds that we authorized on a bipartisan vote on the stimulus package. \nI know most of my colleagues on the other side never wanted to do that \nstimulus package. I understand that. I respect it. But the fact is, we \nfinally see these funds going out and hiring the people we want to make \nsure have jobs. We see and we hear from our Governors that the funding \nis helping them retain teachers, police officers. We see funding is \nhelping them move forward with shovel-ready projects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, the next amendment we are going to vote \non is a very simple vote, similar to the last one. What it says is the \nStates right now are borrowing from the Federal unemployment trust \nfund, and that trust fund has been depleted. There are more States that \nare going to need to borrow from it. It is temporarily putting back \ninto that trust fund a little over $7 billion.\n  Next year, there is going to be about $30 billion that is going to be \nneeded. Does anyone around here, with the dire straits States are in, \nbelieve we will not forgive this debt for the States? That is why I am \nsaying don't just borrow the money--even though CBO says this is \ndeficit neutral, let's not borrow the money, which is what is going to \nend up happening. Let's take it out of the stimulus funds and let's be \nfiscally responsible around here. States need the help. Those who are \nunemployed need help. Let's give the help but do it in a fiscally \nresponsible way. That is really the purpose of this amendment. I \nencourage all Senators to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Ensign \namendment. I know the Senator has the best of intensions. The \nunderlying bill takes care of the unemployment insurance account. It \ndoes it in a deficit-neutral fashion. In fact, it generates a surplus, \nextra funds beyond what is needed for this purpose.\n  What the Senator from Nevada wants to do, if you can imagine, is he \nwants to cut back on spending in the stimulus program, which is \nbuilding highways and projects across America. He wants to reduce the \nPresident's effort to create jobs, thereby creating more unemployment \nin order to have more money for unemployment in America. It does not \nwork.\n  We have a good program here. The underlying program takes care of the \nneed of the UI fund, and the President's stimulus package, now 150 days \ninto operation, is generating jobs and opportunities across America. We \ndo not need to kill the stimulus package at this moment. We need to \nmake sure it works to get America back to work.\n  Please defeat the Ensign amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

There is now 2 minutes evenly divided before a \nvote with respect to the Bond amendment.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, if I could have the attention of my \ncolleagues, please, this measure simply ends the rescission in the \nSAFETEA-LU highway funding bill we passed 4 years ago which otherwise \ntakes $8.7 billion out of highway and bridge contract authority for the \nStates. Best estimates are that this would cost 250,000 jobs in all 50 \nStates.\n  To the argument that we have to take this exactly as the House has \npassed it because they won't stick around--well, they are in session. \nIf this is right, let's do it.\n  And for the Budget Act point of order, if you wanted to have this \npaid for, you should have taken the Vitter amendment. The underlying \nbill requires the Budget Act point of order waived because it is funded \nby claiming the nonexistent interest on intergovernmental transfers. \nThat is a transparent sleight of hand or a sleight of pen.\n  If you want to keep from taking the shovels out of the hands of \nworkers on shovel-ready jobs in every State in the Nation, please vote \naye on the waiver of the Budget Act point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to ask my colleagues if \nthey will follow me for just one moment. This is a little complex, but \nif you will follow me.\n  First, I agree with Senator Bond's amendment and will vote for it, \nbut not at this moment. Here is why. This rescission Senator Bond wants \nto achieve is something most of us agree with. If it doesn't happen, \nthe penalties will come to our States on September 30. What we have is \nthe assurance of the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee that she will put this rescission in the reauthorization of \nthe highway trust fund before September 30 so there would not be any \nloss to States.\n  So what is the problem? Why don't we do it today? Because if we do it \ntoday, we jeopardize this extension of the highway trust fund until \nSeptember 30. We are trying to get this done in short order so we can \nend the session and come back and do the right thing before September \n30. All we are asking today is for you to join us in saying to Senator \nBond: Thank you for your good thought, but hold that thought until \nSeptember.\n  We still have time to make sure we do the right thing, and we have \nthe assurance of the chairman that it is going to happen. It pains me \ngreatly to raise a point of order against my friend from Missouri on an \namendment whose substance I agree with, but if we want to protect the \nhighway trust fund and we want to have an orderly adjournment to the \nsession and not jeopardize jobs, then we need to vote against the Bond \namendment.\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, among some of the things I think most \nMembers would like to accomplish is fixing the highway trust fund, \nfixing the unemployment insurance shortfall, and to do something about \nthe housing loan authority. Those are three matters we can address \nwithout increasing our deficit. There is $7 billion in the highway fund \nthis amendment would fix, which is the short-term fix the House did; \nanother $7 billion for unemployment insurance; and the $185 billion for \nthe housing fix. Those things we can do within the stimulus package.\n  Only 11 percent of the $800 billion will be spent by the end of this \nfiscal year. We can use that money to fund these programs, take care of \nthem as we planned to do from the beginning but without increasing the \ndebt.\n  People say the underlying bill will not increase the debt. That is \nnot accurate. If we agree to this amendment, we will prevent increasing \nthe Nation's debt by $200 billion.\n  I urge your support for the amendment. At this point in time we need \nto save a few billion dollars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I hope colleagues will listen. What this \nSessions amendment does, it takes all the corrections that are in the \nunderlying bill--making sure the highway trust fund does not go bust, \nmaking sure the unemployment trust fund is full, making sure we have \nhelp for our middle-class families seeking to get mortgages--and it \nfunds it instead of in a deficit-neutral way that is in the underlying \nbill which I put in the Record, the CBO score which actually scores \npositive in terms of the surplus over the 10 years, it slashes the \nstimulus funding right as it is beginning to take hold.\n  If you want to take care of all these things, and I think we all do, \nlet's do it the right way. Let us not do it the wrong way and slash \nfunds from the stimulus bill as we are beginning to see it take hold.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Sessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendments failed. I wish \nthey had passed. I voted for them.\n  The thing that bothers me more than anything else is the House put us \nin this position. They said: Here is the bill; you do it; we are \nleaving town. That is exactly what happened.\n  So this is the final vote. We have to have 60 votes. For all \npractical purposes, this is the final vote. I urge my Republican \nfriends to support waiver of the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my ranking member. He and I, as \neveryone knows, don't always agree. But when we do agree, we hope our \ncolleagues will follow. We do not want to play Russian roulette with \nthe highway trust fund. We have to make sure it stays solvent. I urge \nan ``aye'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this is about a budget point of order. \nThat\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\nmeans the bill, since it was not amended as I would have liked, is \ncontrary to the Budget Act. It has more outlays this year. It also \nrequires us to rack up more debt, borrow more money. In the face of $2 \ntrillion of new debt this year, doubling that in 5 years, and tripling \nit in 10, this is a critical vote.

On this vote, the yeas are 71, the nays are \n26. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, when the stimulus bill was \nbeing debated, I advocated that any package include a robust investment \nin rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure. While the stimulus takes a \nbig step in the right direction to address the needs of our aging \ntransportation system, many more steps need to be taken.\n  I believe that the issues that we face with the solvency of the \nhighway trust fund is an opportunity to make sure that more funding \nfrom the stimulus is directed towards our Nation's roads, while not \nadding new spending and increasing the Federal deficit. I would \nencourage any unobligated funding that is redirected as a result of the \npassage of the amendments offered today be in addition to any stimulus \nfunding already provided for road projects; especially in the case of \nlocal road projects. Road projects at the local level will be vital \npart of the engine that drives our Nation's economic recovery in \ncommunities across the country and not maintaining funding for those \nprojects would be a step in the wrong direction.\n  Finally, an investment in our Nation's roads is a two-for-one: it \ncreates jobs while helping to rebuild our infrastructure. By making \nsure the highway trust fund remains solvent and continuing to invest in \nimportant transportation projects, we can rededicate our efforts to \naddressing our transportation system needs.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise in strong support of this \nlegislation.\n  In addition to the important sections dealing with transportation and \nunemployment insurance, the bill before us today includes two important \nprovisions that are crucial to our Nation's housing market--it \nincreases the authority of the Federal Housing Administration--FHA, to \ninsure loans and the authority of the Government National Mortgage \nAssociation--GNMA, to guarantee securities backed by FHA loans.\n  Just about 2 years ago, the housing market started to implode as the \npredatory and abusive loans that were pumped out by banks and mortgage \nlenders started to fail in great numbers. These loans were made by \nlenders who knew these borrowers could not afford to repay them, and \nthey were made under the eyes of regulators who were indifferent to the \nfate of the borrowers and who underestimated the impact on our \nfinancial system.\n  These loans were originated by mortgage brokers or retail lenders \nwith funds provided by Wall Street. Nobody took any responsibility for \nthe quality of these loans because everyone thought they were laying \nthe risk off on the next guy by securitizing the loans and selling them \noff. Regrettably, it is the American people--and the economy--that is \npaying the price today in the form of a severe credit crunch that is \naffecting homeowners, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and every \nconsumer that uses a credit card.\n  As we all know, foreclosures have skyrocketed. Some analysts predict \nthat 8 million homeowners will lose their homes to foreclosure before \nthis crisis is over.\n  In fact, as the mortgage market has ground to a halt, housing prices \nhave fallen all over the country, in many places by 20 percent or more. \nThis problem is being exacerbated by foreclosed homes flooding the \nmarket, driving home prices down further.\n  The only mortgage credit available in this country is credit that is \nprovided, directly or indirectly, by the Federal Government. A key \ncomponent of this, accounting for about 30 percent of the new mortgages \nbeing made in the market today, is FHA-insured mortgages.\n  The legislation before us would increase FHA's authority to insure \nmortgages. If we do not do this, FHA could shut down while we are away \non recess. That would mean that about 30 percent of the mortgage credit \nthat is available today to homebuyers and homeowners would simply \nvanish from the marketplace.\n  The impact of this would be immediate and devastating--a likely spike \nin interest rates; more foreclosures; and fewer home purchases as \nbuyers withdraw from the market.\n  Just this week, we heard some data which indicate that home prices \nmay be stabilizing. But the situation is fragile. If we eliminate FHA \nfrom the marketplace, we could eliminate tens of thousands of potential \nhome buyers from the market, as well. As demand dropped, so would home \nprices, starting a new cycle of economic despair and disinvestment in \nour cities and towns. That is why the National Association of Realtors, \nthe National Association of Home Builders, and the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation all strongly support this legislation.\n\n  The story is much the same with the GNMA increase. GNMA makes it \npossible for lenders to make FHA loans, and then sell them in federally \nguaranteed loan pools. GNMA creates an essential outlet for FHA loans \nso that banks and other lenders can make more mortgage credit \navailable. Without the increased commitment level included in this \nbill, GNMA will also be forced to close its doors.\n  These two provisions of the bill before us are crucial for working \nAmerican families. I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation so that we can send it to President Obama for his \nsignature.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, as the Highway Trust Fund Act moves \nthrough the Senate, I would like to take a moment to stress the \nimportance and urgency of reforming our national transportation system.\n  I commend Chairman Boxer for her leadership on this effort to keep \nthe trust fund solvent. But the fact that we needed this emergency \ninfusion indicates a much greater problem with the transportation \nsystem and how it is funded. I recognize and appreciate the desire to \npass a clean 18-month extension of SAFETEA-LU. However, I think we can \nall agree that fundamental reform will be needed when the time\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\ncomes to consider a full 6-year authorization bill.\n  Our Nation's infrastructure is currently inadequate to preserve our \nglobal competitiveness and the way we allocate funds for surface \ntransportation lacks true accountability. In short, we do not tie \nfunding to performance. To move to a true performance-based system, \nthere are some immediate steps that should be taken.\n  An 18-month extension provides a unique opportunity to take some of \nthese steps. Without making any policy reforms or adding any programs, \nwe can begin to collect information on how well transportation funds \nare serving the public, which will ease our transition to a reformed \nand effective long-term policy. I have drafted an amendment that would \ndirect the Secretary of Transportation to coordinate with states, \nmetropolitan planning organizations and our new chief performance \nofficer to develop metrics to address the following factors: (1) \nNational Connectivity: How have transportation investments improved the \nconnection of people and goods across the Nation?\n  (2) Metropolitan Accessibility: How have transportation investments \nallowed Americans in metropolitan regions to access their jobs and \nother activities more reliably and efficiently?\n  (3) Energy Security and Environmental Protection: How have \ntransportation investments reduced carbon emissions and petroleum \nconsumption?\n  (4) Safety: How have transportation investments improved safety by \nreducing fatalities and injuries associated with transportation?\n  My proposal outlines how States and metropolitan regions can begin to \nreport these measures. The factors above are outcome-oriented, \nobjective and measurable. They are also designed to cut across all \nmodes of transportation, and to measure performance across an entire \nregion as opposed to measuring specific projects in a vacuum.\n  This legislation will help ease the transition to a more performance-\nbased system. Not only will it provide us with actual performance data, \nbut it will help clarify what additional resources states will need to \nbetter provide such data in the future.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this \ninitiative to ensure its inclusion in any extension of SAFETEA-LU.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have worked with the chairmen of the \nEnvironment and Public Works, Banking, Commerce and Finance Committees \nover the last month to put a bill together to address two urgent issues \nfacing the Nation's highway program. First, the highway trust fund is \ngoing to run out of money sometime in the next few weeks and will \nrequire an infusion of $5 to $7 billion to get us through the rest of \nfiscal year 2009. Second, SAFETEA the 2005 highway bill, is set to \nexpire in 9 weeks. With no realistic chance of Congress passing a fully \nfunded reauthorization before the program expires, it is essential to \nprovide funding certainty with a longer term extension. States cannot \nafford to move forward with transportation development activities \nwithout confidence in long-term and consistent future Federal \nreimbursements.\n  Unfortunately, the House chose not to address both issues, but rather \njust provide the money necessary to ensure that the highway trust fund \ndoes not go broke over the August recess. Their decision has put the \nSenate in a situation of taking or leaving their bill. I do not like it \nand frankly think the responsible thing would have been to take up the \nSenate bill, which would have provided for an 18-month extension of the \nexisting program. The House has been short sighted in forcing the \nSenate to only address the trust fund fix; with so many other important \nissues facing Congress, the Senate now must return in 30 days to do \nthis all over again before the program expires at the end of September. \nI also did not like the added provisions of the loans to unemployment \ninsurance fund or the increase in the Federal Housing Administration \ncap on loans they can authorize under the Mutual Mortgage Insurance \nProgram. Finally, I thought all the amendments offered by my Republican \ncolleagues were improvements to the bill, but unfortunately, none of \nthem were adopted. Nonetheless, I supported final passage and most \nimportantly voted to waive the point of order that was raised because \nwe cannot afford to allow the highway trust fund to become insolvent. \nWhile the bill we adopted today only addresses the immediate trust fund \nshortfall I look forward to taking care of the extension of the program \nwhen we return in September along with the fix of the $8.7 billion \nrescission as proposed by Senator Bond's amendment. Given the fiscal \npressures on states and the current economic downturn, I agree with the \nadministration that this uncertainty would be devastating to States and \nwould translate into job losses, and so we need to provide certainty \nuntil we are able to pass a comprehensive bill.\n  I am hopeful that as soon as we return from August recess that we \nwill immediately consider the extension legislation introduced earlier \nthis week by all the relevant committees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will read \nthe bill for the third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to take a moment to thank \neveryone. This was a very complicated series of amendments. It was \ndaunting to figure out what each one of them meant.\n  The bottom line is that we did replenish the highway trust funds \nuntil September 30. Most of us would have liked to have done better \nthan that. We helped with unemployment insurance, and we helped \nfamilies get mortgages. We also made a commitment to Senator Bond that \nwe are going to take care of his amendment at the appropriate moment.\n  I particularly thank Senator Durbin for all his help on the floor. \nAgain, this was a confusing series of amendments. I am pleased with the \noutcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of all members, I have \nhad\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\na number of conversations with Senator McConnell this afternoon. It \nappears, at this stage, we have a path toward completing our work next \nweek. We are going to move forward with the Agriculture appropriations \nbill this evening. We will be on that tonight and tomorrow, and it will \nbe open for amendments. It appears, on that matter, we will either have \na vote after 5 o'clock on Monday on final passage or on cloture on that \nappropriations bill.\n  Tuesday, we will move to the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor. I haven't had a chance to talk with the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. With their approval, we will move to \nthat matter on Tuesday.\n  We will set a time certain to vote on cloture on the Travel Promotion \nAct. We need a time certain because, as everyone knows, Senator \nMikulski is in the hospital now having repair work done on her leg as a \nresult of a fall. We will set that time. And there may be some \nnominations we will need to deal with.\n  At this stage, I think that is where we are headed. There will be no \nvotes tonight or tomorrow. It appears the next vote will be Monday \nafternoon. I have spoken to Senator Kohl and Senator Brownback, and \nthey agree on the appropriations bill that is the way to move forward. \nI appreciate everyone's cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise on an issue of particular \nimportance. I am delighted Senators Burris and Dodd are on the floor. \nAlong with Senator Chambliss, the four of us joined in a very important \npiece of legislation. In fact, in the gallery tonight is a lady named \nJackie Boatwright, whose young son Juan, 8 years ago, was severely \ninjured in a daycare center.\n  For a second, I wish to talk about the legislation we have introduced \nand encourage all the Members of the Senate to support it. On September \n9, 2001, 2 days before the tragedy of September 11, on a Sunday \nmorning, Mrs. Boatwright got up and took her son to daycare and went to \nchurch. On her way home, her cell phone rang. She got a call telling \nher that her son Juan was now in the hospital. While at the daycare \ncenter, he pulled up beside a mop bucket, bent over and fell headfirst \nin the bucket, which was full of dirty mop water and bleach.\n  Juan, today, lies semicomatose in a hospital on a ventilator.\n  The daycare center had no liability insurance. To Mrs. Boatwright's \ncredit, from the day of that tragedy, she has advocated on behalf of \nparents and young children, so that it is required they be able to know \nthe insurance available to them to protect their children in a daycare \ncenter. I mentioned that Senators Dodd, Burris, Chambliss, and myself \nhave introduced legislation, which already passed the House. It \nrequires that any daycare center receiving Federal funds from the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant Program must disclose, upon \nregistration and admittance, to any child and their parents the \nliability coverage they have to protect that child.\n  Mrs. Boatwright wants to make sure that what happened to little Juan, \nand what happened in her life as a tragedy, never happens in the life \nof any other mother anywhere in America. Mrs. Boatwright is a resident \nof Augusta, GA. I am proud of her for the example she has set. So many \ncitizens don't think they can make a difference. Mrs. Boatwright is \ntaking a tragedy and making a difference for thousands of parents and \nchildren for years to come.\n  I am proud to encourage the Members of the Senate to help us get \nunanimous consent to agree with the House and pass this legislation, \nJuan Boatwright's legacy, the Anthony DeJuan Boatwright Act, requiring \ndisclosure of liability insurance coverage to every parent whose child \nis entering daycare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. Along \nwith Orrin Hatch, I am the original cosponsor of the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Program more than 20 years ago, the first \nchildcare program in this country since World War II. It was a long \nstruggle to pass that legislation. There were battles over supporting \npeople who could not afford expensive child care--to be able to do that \nfor working families. In those days, when we drafted the legislation, \nit was very hard to convince people of the importance of establishing \nsome standards in childcare. There was a lot of resistance to it. \nNonetheless, we got the bill done at minimum standards.\n  That bill made a huge difference in the lives of millions of people, \nparticularly working women with young children, raising them on their \nown, to be able to hold down the job and make sure their child could be \nin a safe place. That was important. I remember talking about how we \nhad better Federal regulations when it came to pets being cared for \nthan we did for children. Your automobile got better care, under \nFederal regulations, than your child. Ultimately, that legislation \nbecame law.\n  Along with my colleague from Georgia, I, too, commend Mrs. Boatwright \nfor taking on this issue, showing how one individual can change things \nregarding the minimum requirement that parents be informed as to \nwhether the childcare facility has appropriate insurance. In fact, I \nwould have presumed that was the case, even as author of the original \nlegislation, believing that was something States would have required, \nlet alone Federal legislation.\n  We have a bill that passed the other body before us, and it makes \neminently good sense to me, as someone who has been involved in this \nissue for 25 years, along with Olympia Snowe, from Maine, a terrific \nadvocate for the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program.\n  I don't know where the objections are coming from. I am prepared to \nwork with my colleague and say to Mrs. Boatwright and her family and \nothers that we thank you for raising this issue. I will do whatever I \ncan to see if we cannot get this cleared on the floor of the Senate and \nhave it go to the President for signature. That is a small \naccomplishment on a major issue that can make a difference in the lives \nof families.\n\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the distinguished acting chairman of the HELP \nCommittee for offering that assistance and assisting in the passage of \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8533-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8533-S8534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NAACP 100TH ANNIVERSARY: IMAGES OF HISTORY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the NAACP in \nthis, its 100th anniversary month. I rise in praise of what this \nextraordinary organization has so proudly come to represent to every \nAmerican who deeply believes in freedom, human dignity, and equal \njustice under the law.\n  Yet I rise with a heavy heart, filled with powerful lasting images of \nthe unimaginable suffering surrounding the founding of this great \norganization, images of the savage hand of racism--horrific lynchings \nin the middle of the night, the 1908 race riot in Springfield, IL, the \nbirthplace of Abraham Lincoln, that led a bold band of Americans to do \nall they could, whatever they could, to end the violence against \nBlacks, the vicious, unveiled hatred and intolerance that to this day \nhas left deep and painful scars on this Nation.\n  I rise in recognition of those courageous men and women who, a \ncentury ago, stepped forward to found the NAACP, those who stood \nagainst violence, who stood against hatred, Blacks such as W.E.B. Du \nBois, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Mary Church Terrell, and Whites such as \nMary White Ovington and Oswald Garrison Villard, descendants of \nAmerica's first abolitionists. These men and women came forward, \nechoing the call of W.E.B. Du Bois to secure for all people the rights \nof the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution to end \nslavery, provide equal justice under law, and ensure universal adult \nmale suffrage.\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n  We all know that the full realization of equality, freedom, civil \nrights, voting rights, and equal justice under law has been a long, \nsometimes faltering, journey fraught with dead ends, deep divides, and \nseemingly insurmountable obstacles on the road to a more perfect Union. \nIt has been a journey of starts and stops, with harrowing moments--some \nhorrific, some heart-wrenching, but all equally historic, all part of \nthe American saga, each forever etched in the collective memory of this \nNation.\n  The magnificent building in which we do our work today is a monument \nto that journey. Those who labored to raise this glorious building in \ntribute to American democracy were themselves slaves. They laid the \nfoundation. They cut the stones. They raised the walls and built the \nmagnificent dome of the U.S. Capitol. Those slaves lived here on \nCapitol Hill in the shadow of what is now the Statue of Freedom that \nlooks eastward toward the rising Sun and what was then the new dawn of \na rising nation.\n  They are, in many ways, the ancestors of Freedom herself, the \nprecursors of an event to which we have so boldly stood witness in \nJanuary, in the shadow of their labors, as a Black man raised his hand \non the west front of the Capitol to take the oath of office as \nPresident of the United States. What greater tribute to them.\n  We may have come a long way since they built this monument to \ndemocracy, but every day, with every troubling racial incident we see \non television or read about in blogs or in newspapers, it is clear the \ncentury-long work of the NAACP goes on, the work continues. But it is \nequally clear, with Barack Obama in the White House, we have come of \nage, united by a common history, tragic at times, fought on the bloody \nbattlefields of a civil war and still being waged in the hearts of the \nintolerant and unenlightened among us.\n  Let the images of history tell the story of America plainly, \nhonestly, for what it is--from the labors of those slaves who built \nthis Capitol to the founding of the NAACP; from the battlefields of \nGettysburg and Manassas to the freedom rides and marches through Selma \nand Montgomery; from bloodshed, tragedy and travails, sacrifices and \nsorrows from those who lived and died on plantations or rode the \nUnderground Railroad north, to those freed by the Emancipation \nProclamation; from the devastating inhumanity of slavery to the \nelection of Barack Obama.\n  There are countless images of courage and heroism, humiliation and \nhumility, honor and horror, dignity and indignity; images of hope and \ndespair, fear and frustration; images of fire hoses and police dogs \nturned on Americans whose only crime was the longing to be free and \nequal; images still clear in our minds, triumphant images of Martin \nLuther King at the Lincoln Memorial, millions marching on Washington; \ndeeply moving images of peace-loving men like Congressman John Lewis \nbeaten down by billy clubs because he simply wanted to cross a bridge; \nimages of abject poverty, of two worlds separate and apart and far from \nequal; tragic images of a great man lying in a pool of blood on a motel \nbalcony in Atlanta in April of 1968. But none so powerful, none so \ndeeply moving as Barack Obama taking the oath of office as President of \nthe United States on the west front of the Capitol 41 years later.\n  These are the awesome images of the history of race since the \nfounding of the NAACP. They represent the history of America as much as \nthey represent the history of the NAACP, and we must--all of us, Black \nand White alike--embrace them, understand them, and learn from them; \nlearn from the tragedy and the sorrow; learn from the long, hard-fought \nbattle that was the civil rights movement; learn from the debate on \nthis floor that eventually led to the Voting Rights Act; learn from the \nprosegregationist terrorism that led to the assassination of NAACP \nMississippi field secretary Medgar Evers and the death of Dr. King. \nToday, all of these images, the good as well as the bad, remain part of \nwho we are, part of the American story in which the NAACP has played a \npivotal role.\n  But the Nation has changed, and so the mission of the NAACP has \nevolved from what it was 100 years ago. The violence has lessened, but \nthe virus of racism and prejudice has mutated, as all viruses do.\n  Now too often, intolerance rears its ugly head with the mere mention \nof the word ``immigration.'' And when it does, let us be comforted by \nthe knowledge that the NAACP is still there, still working, still \nfighting the good fight.\n  Today, the NAACP is an expanded organization dedicated to the \nelimination of all race prejudice in America, whether that prejudice be \nagainst Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and all Americans who seek \npolitical, educational, economic, and social equality. For 100 years, \nthe goal of the NAACP has been to tear down the walls of racial \ndiscrimination through the democratic process and make tolerance and \nequality a reality for all of us. Let that goal be realized in our \ngeneration, in our time, and let us continue--one nation, indivisible--\non that long journey to a more perfect Union.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8534-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8534-S8537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2997, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2997) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agency programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2010, and for other purposes.\n\n                           Amendment No. 1908\n\n  (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.)\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I call up the substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself and Mr. \n     Brownback, proposes an amendment numbered 1908.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nstaff have unlimited floor privileges during the consideration of the \nfiscal year 2010 Agriculture appropriations bill: Galen Fountain, \nJessica Frederick, Dianne Nellor, Fitzhugh Elder, Stacy McBride, Phil \nKarsting, and Riley Scott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that Bob Ross, a detailee from the \nDepartment of Agriculture to the Committee on Appropriations, and Katie \nToskey, an intern on the Committee on Appropriations, be granted \nunlimited floor privileges during consideration of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal Year \n2010 appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the \nFood and Drug Administration and related agencies. This bill was \nunanimously reported out of Committee on July 7, and I believe it is a \nwell-balanced bill that deserves the support of all Senators.\n  This bill includes total spending of $124 billion. Of that total, \n$101 billion is for mandatory programs, such as the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as Food Stamps, which is \nfunded at $61 billion, and the Child Nutrition Programs, which are \nfunded at $17 billion.\n  Discretionary spending totals $23 billion, an increase of $2.3 \nbillion, and is within our 302(b) allocation. While this is a \nsignificant increase from last year, the President's request in just \nfour areas--WIC, food and drug safety, humanitarian food assistance, \nand rural rental assistance--account for nearly 90 percent of the total \nincrease. The depth and breadth of the responsibilities held by the \nUSDA and FDA are far greater than I believe most Americans realize.\n  The funds in this bill are used to help ensure the most basic of \nhuman needs are met. This bill provides the funds for the two major \nagencies charged with keeping America's food and medical supply safe, \nsomething we nearly\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\nalways take for granted. It provides funds to ensure that low-income \nfamilies in rural America have access to affordable housing and \nopportunities for homeownership. It provides funds to ensure that over \n11 million kids receive breakfast and 31 million kids receive lunch at \nschool every day. It provides funds to make sure 2 million kids from \nlow-income families receive a nutritious meal during the summer when \ntheir parents are not home. It provides funds to developing countries \nto provide meals to children when they go to school--which is often the \nonly way to get them there. USDA is also responsible for important \nagricultural research, conservation activities, community development, \nanimal and plant health activities, agricultural trade, and much more. \nIt is an important bill--more important than many may realize.\n  There are many specific high notes to mention.\n  Of the total funding provided in this bill, 69 percent is directed to \nnutrition programs. The WIC program is funded at more than $7 billion, \nwhich is an increase of almost $700 million over last year's \nappropriations bill. This is the amount necessary to meet the \nincreasing need for this program, and will provide nutritious food to \nnearly 9.8 million low-income mothers and children each month. There is \nalso language included to ensure that military families are not \ndisqualified from the WIC Program because of increased combat pay--this \nis a small provision, but an important one in recognizing the \nsacrifices that our soldiers and their families make.\n  This bill includes $163 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food \nProgram, which provides supplemental food to nearly 450,000 very low-\nincome senior citizens and more than 30,000 low-income women and \nchildren. The Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free \nfood to food banks, many of which have seen private donations decrease \nsignificantly, will receive $253 million in fiscal year 2010. An \nadditional $7 million is provided to assist food banks in maintaining \nand upgrading their facilities and equipment so they can continue to \nserve those in need. In difficult economic times, these programs are \nvital to those that might otherwise go hungry.\n  In the area of food and drug safety, this bill provides the full \nbudget request for both the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the \nFood and Drug Administration. The FDA is provided $2.3 billion, an \nincrease of nearly $300 million. This increase, one of the largest in \nFDA's history, is necessary to continue the slow turnaround of an \nailing organization whose responsibilities have vastly outgrown its \nfunding over the past several years. The FDA is in charge of ensuring \nthe safety of one-quarter of consumer products, and it is imperative \nthat it has the funding to carry out its responsibilities. Similarly, \nthe Food Safety and Inspection Service is responsible for ensuring that \nall of the Nation's meat and poultry is safe to eat. FSIS is provided \nthe full budget request of more than $1 billion to carry out its \nmission.\n  This bill provides substantial funding to support international \nhumanitarian food assistance. The PL 480, Food for Peace, and McGovern-\nDole programs are funded at the President's request, which together is \nan increase of more than $500 million above last year. These programs \nare vital to helping relieve hunger in some of the most distressed \nparts of the world and to encourage children in developing countries to \nreceive an education. To enhance those programs, funding is provided to \nsupport the use of micro-nutrient fortified foods and to develop new \nfood aid products that can make a real difference in saving lives and \nsecuring long-term health benefits, especially for children. The bill \nalso provides $13 million, as requested by the President, for USDA to \nhelp develop agricultural systems in countries facing severe food \nshortages. We believe that the development of sustainable food systems \nis the proper alternative to emergency food assistance. Therefore, this \nbill provides guidance and support for USDA, in partnership with the \ncountry's land grant institutions, PVOs, and others, to work together \ntoward global food security.\n  America's farmers and ranchers face some of the tightest credit \nconditions they have faced in years. Agricultural producers are having \ndifficulty obtaining capital necessary to maintain operations, and \ndemands for Federal credit have skyrocketed. This bill provides over $4 \nbillion of needed credit, representing an increase of nearly $750 \nmillion over 2009. These funds will help sustain agricultural producers \nas private credit markets stabilize.\n  This bill also provides increased funding for development of rural \nAmerica, including housing, essential community facilities, business \nassistance, and infrastructure. In response to the recent housing \ncrisis, USDA rural housing programs remain among the most important, \nand the most active, for Americans to achieve home ownership. Over $13 \nbillion is available for housing loans and grants, including funds for \nnew construction, repair and rehabilitation, and housing vouchers and \nrental assistance to ensure shelter for the lowest income rural \nresidents. Almost $1.6 billion is available for loans and grants to \nsmall towns to support clean water and sanitary waste disposal systems \nthat are essential for thriving communities.\n  Agricultural research agencies receive a total of $2.5 billion in the \nbill, an increase of nearly $130 million, not counting research funding \nprovided in the 2008 farm bill. The Agricultural Research Service is \nUSDA's premier in-house research agency. Funding is provided in this \nbill for ARS scientists to conduct increased research on bioenergy; \nimproved livestock and crop production; human nutrition, including the \nprevention of childhood obesity; and the reduction of world hunger, \namong other issues. USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, \nNIFA, formerly the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension \nService, CSREES, funds research, education and extension projects at \nuniversities and other partners throughout the country. As part of \nNIFA, the bill includes an increase of more than $94 million for the \nAgriculture and Food Research Initiative that awards competitive \nresearch grants throughout the Nation. These programs allow USDA the \nflexibility to adapt to meet changing research needs and to work with \nleading researchers throughout the country.\n  This bill makes substantial investments to protect the Nation's \nanimal and plant resources from diseases and pests. Almost $40 million \nis provided to combat the emerald ash borer which has been found in \nthirteen states and threatens hardwood forests. Over $30 million is \navailable to fight the Asian long horned beetle, and almost $46 million \nis provided to support the citrus health response program to combat \ncitrus greening.\n  In all, this bill provides a proper balance among all the agencies \nfunded and sets the proper priorities. Conservation, food and drug \nsafety, farm programs, rural development, renewable energy, nutrition, \ntrade, and the day-to-day functions of USDA and FDA are provided \nadequate funding and proper guidance. The programs funded by this bill \ntouch the lives of every American numerous times each day, and impact \nthe lives of people living on the other side of the world. These are \nimportant programs, and I urge each Senator to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to recognize and thank my ranking \nmember, Senator Brownback, for his counsel and support in putting \ntogether this bill, and look forward at this time to his opening \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to first thank my colleague for \nthe work he has done on this bill. Senator Kohl and his staff have done \nan excellent job in putting together a responsible, good, and important \nbill, and I am delighted to be a part of it and a part of the process. \nIt has been a great group to work with.\n  The Appropriations Committee, unlike a lot of other committees in the \nCongress, most of the time has to work in a bipartisan fashion, and \nthat is a good thing. Senator Kohl and his staff have been very good \nfor us to work with, and I think because of that we have what I believe \nis a solid bill and one for which we are going to be able to get strong \nand broad support.\n  Mr. President, this is the first time the agriculture appropriations \nbill has been on the floor of the Senate for a number of years. I think \nthat is too\n\n[[Page S8536]]\n\nbad, but I think it is also good we are finally getting it here. The \n2006 Ag appropriations bill was the last Ag appropriations bill to be \non the floor of the Senate. I think it is a good development that it is \nhere, that it will be pending. I think it also bodes well for us to be \nable to consider this as a separate and stand-alone bill in the final \nprocess so we don't have to put it together with a whole bunch of other \nappropriations bills, which, to me, is the way the process should work. \nIt is a good way to work, and it is my hope we will be able to have a \nseparate agriculture appropriations bill that will make it the whole \nway through the process.\n  I look forward to the debate, and I wish to encourage Members now, \nthis evening, to come to the floor and offer amendments so we can \nconsider this expeditiously but fully. I understand from the majority \nleader that we want to consider a travel and tourism bill and then the \nSotomayor vote and consideration next week. I hope we could get through \nthis bill in an expeditious manner so we could get to the Sotomayor \ndiscussion; I believe most of our colleagues will want to speak about \nJudge Sotomayor being considered for the Supreme Court. Whether you are \nfor or against her, people want to be heard. To have as much time as \npossible for that next week, it will be important we be expeditious on \nthis Ag appropriations bill.\n  Overall, the budget for food aid in the bill has increased to levels \nthat will allow us to depend less on emergency supplemental \nappropriations bills that are not scored, and I think it is important \nwe have a regular scoring process and not just do this on an emergency \nbasis. I think that is an important improvement in this bill. By \nfunding food aid at historical levels in the regular appropriations \nprocess, USDA and USAID will have more certainty about program \nresources so they can make better decisions about which situations they \nare able and need to commit food to.\n  A number of my colleagues have been to refugee camps in different \nparts of the world, and they have seen this food in action. It is \nimportant and it saves people's lives, and these are important food aid \nprograms.\n  While I believe this is a valuable step, I am even more encouraged by \nthe creation of two pilot programs that we have initiated in this bill. \nThe chairman has worked on it and we have worked on it in our office. \nSpecifically, in the area of food aid, we have created two pilot \nprograms. The first is a nutrition fortification pilot program to \ndevelop and field test new and improved micronutrient fortified food \nproducts designed to meet the energy and nutritional needs of school-\naged children, pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, and children \nunder 5 who are served by the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program.\n  This is a program where we supply food to a number of very difficult \nsituations in countries with poor economies around the world that is \ngiven as a school lunch. So it draws students in to go to school, and \nthen it is a lunch for them. It has been a very successful program in \nboth getting nutritional requirements met for children and in getting \nthe educational needs met.\n  What we are talking about in this pilot program is a narrower section \nof it where a number of scientists around the world have said the most \nimportant thing we could fund--that any country actually could fund--to \nimprove the health of the most people would be micronutrients in the \nThird World and developing countries that are having difficulty, so the \nchildren develop their mental capacity, better eyesight, and their \noverall health capacity.\n  This is a relatively low-cost, high-yield, high-benefit program. It \nsaves lives, makes lives more productive, and it makes the United \nStates a lot more popular around the world when we are helping people \nand saving lives. That is one of the pilot programs.\n  The second is a new food aid product development pilot program. It \nhas been nearly 30 years since the last type of food aid was developed. \nThirty years ago, we developed a corn soy blend that is used in many \nrefugee camps and in difficult situations for individuals around the \nworld who can't get enough food. Thirty years ago, we developed an \ninnovative product called corn soy blend, but nutritional understanding \nhas changed in that period of time. What we are looking at is a new \nwave of food aid products and can we do it better. That is in this \npilot program.\n  A number of people working on AIDS around the world, PEPFAR funding \nparticularly in Africa, are saying the big problem with AIDS recipients \nis they are getting the antiretroviral drugs, and they are using those, \nbut their body is weakened because they do not have their nutritional \nneeds being met. This is to target in on what can we do to make sure \nthose vulnerable populations are getting the nutritional needs they \nhave.\n  I am excited about this because I think these are the sorts of things \nwe can do that don't cost much. Indeed, my view would be that we don't, \nin the future, add to the food aid program but we make it a higher \nnutrient program and we target it in better ways so we can get more out \nof this. That is the way we should be working.\n  If young children have access to proper nutrition, the benefits will \nfollow them the rest of their lives. We all know that. That is what we \nare trying to do with these pilot programs.\n  Finally, the bill requires the USDA and USAID to scrutinize how the \nfood aid programs function without seeking to change the basic \nstructure of the Food for Peace or McGovern-Dole Food Aid. We will use \nthe data the Secretary and the administrator provide to the \nsubcommittee to make sure these programs are operating as effectively \nas possible.\n  I would have preferred a hard upper limit on transportation costs \nmyself, but I recognize there are many strongly held opinions on this \nmatter. My hope is that all parties can agree we should strive to make \nthese programs more efficient because greater efficiency means more \npeople will be fed.\n  I have cited, for several of my colleagues, an area of great concern \nto me, in that 60 percent of our food aid dollar presently goes for \ntransportation or administration. Over a majority of it goes for \ntransportation and administration. It seems to me we ought to be able \nto get that to a tighter position. We have worked with the chairman on \nthis. Everybody is concerned that we try to stretch our food aid \ndollars and get as much food to starving people as possible.\n  I greatly appreciate the courtesies Chairman Kohl and his staff have \nshown me in my first year as ranking member. Chairman Kohl has been at \nthis for several years and he has done a very good job.\n  Specifically, I thank Galen Fountain, Jessica Frederick, Dianne \nNellor, and Bob Ross for their efforts on this bill and the \nconsideration they have shown my staff. I look forward to working \nthrough the process on the floor and moving to conference.\n  I would urge my colleagues, again, to start getting their amendments \npending because I think the more expeditious we can be, the more time \nwe will have to consider the amendments and then also to get to the \nnomination of Judge Sotomayor, which I anticipate most of the body will \nwant to speak on, and that is going to take a long time to get through.\n  It is a good bill, and I am looking forward to us working through the \namendments to make it a better bill through the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2230 to Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Tester.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for Mr. Tester, for \n     himself, Mr. Enzi, and Mrs. McCaskill, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2230 to amendment No. 1908.\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I met in my office today with Donna, a \nRhode Islander who suffers from vascular disease. Donna's condition \nforced her to give up her job, and therefore her insurance. She cannot \nafford to buy it on her own, since it would cost her $650 a month--\nmoney she does not have. So she pays for her medications out of pocket. \nThey should be $2,000 per month, but her doctor got them down to $450. \nBut even this is no walk in the park. Donna read me a laundry list of \nprocedures and services she needs but cannot afford, so like so many \nAmericans, she sits waiting, struggling, hoping she does not get worse.\n  I want to tell my colleagues what I told Donna today: the Affordable \nHealth Choices Act, the bill that the HELP Committee passed out last \nWednesday, would mean hope and change and help for Donna. It would mean \nthat insurance companies could not deny her a policy because of her \nvascular disease, as they can, and do, right now. It would mean that \ninsurance companies could not charge her sky-high rates because of her \nvascular disease, as they can, and do, right now. It would mean that if \nDonna needed financial help to purchase a health insurance plan, she \nwould get it. No preexisting condition exclusions, affordable premium \nrates, and subsidies for those who need help purchasing a plan. That is \nwhat the HELP Committee's plan offers every American in this country.\n  I also have heard from Madeleine, a Pawtucket resident who cannot \nafford health coverage despite working two jobs. Her family has a \nhistory of colorectal cancer; both her sister and mother lost their \nfight to this disease. Tragically, Madeleine cannot afford to get a \ncolonoscopy. Without insurance, Madeleine waits and hopes that she \ndoesn't get sick, because that is the only option she has.\n  Under the Affordable Health Choices Act, Madeleine would have the \nfinancial help she needs to buy a comprehensive, affordable plan. But \neven before she did that, even before everything is in place for \nMadeline to go to a gateway and buy a plan, she could sign up for the \nRight Choices program. Under Right Choices, even without insurance, \nMadeline would have access to all basic preventive services. She would \nget a chronic disease health risk assessment, a care plan, and \nreferrals to community-based resources. Most importantly, she would get \nthe colonoscopy she needs, so that she is not another victim of the \nterrible disease that took her mother and her sister. It goes without \nsaying that preventing this disease and treating it early would, in the \nlong run, save money for the healthcare system as well as preserve \nMadeleine's health.\n  I recently had coffee with Shirley, a Middletown resident who \ndescribed her relief at turning 65. For the past 20 years, she and her \nhusband did not have insurance. As self-employed business owners in \ntheir fifties, finding affordable insurance options was impossible, so \nthey went without. They took their chances. Now 65 and eligible for \nMedicare, they finally have peace of mind. Shirley admits she and her \nhusband were lucky to make it through those 20 years without serious \nhealth problems. During our meeting, she urged us to pass health care \nreform for the millions of hard-working Americans--hard-working, \nmiddle-class Americans--who are not as fortunate as she and her \nhusband.\n  Under the bill passed by the HELP Committee, Shirley would not have \nendured 20 years of fear and uncertainty without health insurance. As a \nself-employed, small business owner, Shirley would be eligible for tax \ncredits to either continue to offer health insurance to her employees, \nor to offer it for the first time. Shirley could also take all of her \nemployees to the health insurance gateway, which will give small firms \na choice of multiple insurance plans at a lower cost and of a higher \nquality than what currently exist in the small group market. If you are \na small business owner, this bill is for you.\n  Judith from Warwick, has shared with me a story about her brother-in-\nlaw, whose lungs collapsed during an outpatient procedure. After \nstaying in the intensive care unit for 28 days, he contracted a \nhospital infection and was rehospitalized four times. Thankfully, a \nyear later, he is symptom free. However, the costs stemming from the \ntreatment totaled over $500,000. Like her brother-in-law, Judith and \nher husband are retired and live off of their monthly Social Security \ncheck. She reflects that on such a limited income, if she or her \nhusband faced a catastrophic health issue like her brother-in-law, they \nwould be in ``dire straits.''\n  The HELP Committee bill creates a Patient Safety Research Center at \nAHRQ, which will support research, technical assistance, and process \nimplementation grants to local providers to teach and implement best \npractices. No one should go through what Judith's brother-in-law did. \nNo one should contract a hospital infection that leads to not one, not \ntwo, not three, but four rehospitalizations. We know how to prevent \nhospital-acquired infections; we have seen tremendous results in places \nlike Michigan and Rhode Island for years. The HELP Committee bill \nfinally creates a national infrastructure to support the dissemination \nof these proven techniques so that we can drastically improve the \nquality of care in our system, and in doing so, drastically lower the \ncost.\n  Finally, I recently met David, a self-employed resident from Central \nFalls, who described the astronomical rise in the cost of health \ninsurance for him and his waif. Years ago, he paid $85 per month for \ntheir plan; today, he pays approximately $19,000 a year for their \nhealth insurance. Despite the dramatic jump in price, their health \ninsurance plan does not cover as much as it used to. To keep their \npremiums and overall health costs down, David has been forced to drop \ndental coverage and increase the out-of-pocket expenses he and his wife \npay on their plan. He noted, ``I'm almost afraid to get sick, because \ntoday's health plans have so many holes in them, they can nickel and \ndime you to death.''\n  The Affordable Health Choices Act would do two important things to \nhelp David. One, it would require that plans sold in the gateway offer \na truly comprehensive set of benefits so that ``affordable'' does not \nmean ``skimpy.'' Affordable will mean inclusive, available, and \naccessible. Two, the bill would not allow insurance companies to \n``nickel and dime you to death'' as David fears now. Insurance \ncompanies would be prohibited from imposing lifetime or annual limits \non the dollar value of benefits for any enrollee. So David will not be \nforced to pay out-of-pocket once he exceeds certain levels of benefits, \nas he does now.\n  There is some uncertainty both in this building and around this \ncountry right now about the future of health reform. I want to remind \neveryone--my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, my colleagues in \nthe House, Rhode Islanders back home, and Americans\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\nacross the country, the Senate has already put forth a health reform \nplan that will work for you. It will work for sill-mil businesses. It \nwill work for Americans with pre-existing conditions. It will work for \nAmericans struggling to pay health care premiums. It will work for \nAmericans who are in small businesses. It will work for Americans who \nare one illness away from their family going into bankruptcy. It will \nwork for Americans who are uninsured. It will work for Americans who \nhave been victims of hospital errors. It will work for Americans who \nneed preventive services they cannot afford.\n  Most importantly, it will work for Donna, for Madeline, for Shirley, \nfor Judith, and for David, and it will work for their fellow Americans \nall over this country whose stories are all too similar. Heartache, \nfrustration, exhaustion, and disgust with a health care system that \nhas, at best, disappointed them, and at worst, turned its back on them. \nThe Affordable Health Choices Act offers these Americans a hand up when \nthey need it most, and I am proud to support it.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to take one moment to thank the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Iowa for his courtesy in allowing me \nto proceed. I know he has substantial remarks he wishes to deliver. I \nhope it was not too much of an inconvenience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8538-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8538-S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DEBT AND DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor his kind remarks.\n  We are only 9 months into fiscal year 2009, and for the first time in \nAmerican history the Federal deficit has reached and exceeded $1 \ntrillion. This is not one of those firsts for our great Nation that \ncalls for celebration, and there will not be any celebration.\n  Unfortunately, the bad fiscal news is not yet over for the year. We \nare still on track for a year-end deficit of over $1.8 trillion for \nfiscal year 2009. That is not according to this Senator, that is \naccording to our official scorer, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nnonpartisan organization.\n  This 2009 deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product will be a \nstaggering 13 percent, the highest rate since the end of World War II. \nI have a chart that shows this, a chart that puts the deficit in \ncontext.\n  Here is also a chart that puts the debt into context. I want to \nremind the Senate that I agree with President Obama that he did, in \nfact, inherit part of these deficits and debt. What is not often \npointed out is this: The deficits and debt were bequeathed back then on \na bipartisan basis because the Democrats controlled the last Congress. \nStarting in the year 2007 that Congress wrote the budget, it wrote the \nspending bills; that democratically controlled Congress wrote the \nfinancial bailout bill. A Republican President, George W. Bush, signed \nthose spending bills. President Bush signed the financial bailout bill. \nThe chart shows the bipartisan deficit President Obama inherited--and \nthat would be the gray part of the deficit chart--and the chart shows \nthe bipartisan debt President Obama inherited. That would be on the \nchart as well.\n  Today we have seen more revisionist fiscal history from many of my \nfriends on the other side. It boils down to two very basic \npropositions. The first proposition is, all good economic policy and \nbeneficial fiscal effects are due to the partisan tax hike of 1993. The \nsecond proposition is that all bad economic policy and detrimental \nfiscal effects of this decade are due to the bipartisan tax relief \nplans of 2001 and 2003.\n  How convenient for my friends on the other side of the aisle. If we \ntake this fiscal revisionism to its logical extreme, the answer of some \non the other side might be to tax every dollar of income earned by the \nAmerican taxpayer. There seems to be an attitude that any policy that \nallows Americans to keep more of their own money is just automatically \nbad, while any policy which takes more of their money and spends it is \nautomatically good.\n  I think it is fairly clear the fiscal revisionists on the other side \ndo not have a problem with huge deficits; rather, they are threatened \nby the prospects of Americans deciding what they want to do with their \nvery own money.\n  In fact, the deficit effects of the stimulus bill passed within a \nshort time after Democrats assumed full control of the Federal \nGovernment exceeded the deficit impact of the 8 years of the bipartisan \ntax relief. Again, this is comparing the tax relief with the stimulus \nas you see in the chart.\n  Since the stimulus package spilled a lot of red ink, let's take a \nlook at how the economy has done. Unemployment currently stands at 9.5 \npercent, the highest rate in the last 26 years. The economy has shed \n6.4 million jobs since this recession began, and that also includes, \nthough, 2.6 million jobs lost since President Obama took office.\n  Even with the passage of the massive $787 billion stimulus bill in \nFebruary, the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs that went with that $787 \nbillion stimulus bill, there is still no end in sight to the rise of \nunemployment and job losses.\n  The President himself recently said:\n\n       My expectation is that we will probably continue to see \n     unemployment kick up for several months.\n\n  While the short-term news is bad, I have bad news for you. The long-\nterm news is much worse. If the Obama budget is adopted, by 2019 we \nwill have added over $9 trillion to the national debt held by the \npublic, and our debt as a percentage of the economy will grow in excess \nof 80 percent, in excess of 80 percent, a level also that has not been \nseen since this country was in World War II.\n  Let me say, the 50-year average of that national debt, according to \nthe economy, has been about 40 percent. So we are talking about more \nthan doubling what it has been over the last 50 years.\n  The huge spike in spending that we have seen over the course of the \npast 9 months has been advertised as temporary. But even so, the \ndeficit as a percentage of GDP in 2019 is projected to be 5.5 percent, \na level that everybody, including the President, agrees is \nunsustainable. You can see that on our charts as well.\n  Looking beyond the 10-year window paints an even bleaker picture. I \nhave a chart from the Congressional Budget Office that projects a \nterrifying rise in debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP over \nthe next 40 years. As we can see from the dotted line, the highest \nlevel of debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, 107 percent, \noccurred in 1945 as a result and at the end of World War II. In either \nof the two scenarios outlined in the Congressional Budget Office's \nlong-term budget outlook, shown by the red and green lines on the chart \nrespectively, we are on a course to break this record sometime in the \nnext 15 to 35 years and reach ratios of debt to GDP of up to 128 \npercent or, at the extreme, 321 percent by 2050.\n  The Congressional Budget Office's own words are these:\n\n       The systemic widening of budget shortfalls projected under \n     CBO's long-term scenarios has never been observed in U.S. \n     history.\n\n  Some may ask: Why is this a big deal? What does debt held by the \npublic have to do with my everyday life? The Congressional Budget \nOffice makes three points answering this question. This is the \nCongressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group of experts whose sole \njob is to project, at least 10 years ahead of time, what the situation \nis with every spending bill and the impact of the deficit. This is what \nthey say: If the ratio of debt to GDP continues to rise, lenders may \nbecome concerned about the financial solvency of the government and \ndemand higher interest rates to pay for the increasing riskiness of \nholding government debt. No. 2, if the debt-to-GDP ratio keeps \nincreasing and the budget outlook is not improved, both foreign and \ndomestic lenders may not provide enough funds for the government to \nmeet its obligations. And No. 3, if the first two points happen, no \nmatter whether the government resolves the fiscal crisis by printing \nmoney, raising taxes, cutting spending or going into default, it is \ncertain that economic growth will be seriously disrupted.\n  Whenever economic growth is seriously disrupted, job growth is \nseriously disrupted as well. Clearly, a debt-to-GDP ratio approaching \n100 percent would have a disastrous impact on everybody's everyday \nlife.\n  So where do we go from here? Clearly, we are well on our way to \nfiscal catastrophe unless we change course. What is the best way to \nbreak out of\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nthis recession, to start creating jobs, to reverse the mountainous \ngrowth of deficit and debt and get the economy moving again? That is a \nvery important and long question. Let me see if I can answer. In \ngeneral, Democrats and Republicans seem to have opposing viewpoints \nwhen it comes to the solution to this problem, with Republicans \nfavoring lower taxes and lower spending, while Democrats favor higher \ntaxes and higher spending. However, both Republicans and Democrats \nagree that health care reform is a crucial ingredient to solving the \nlong-term budget crisis.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats agree health care reform needs to be \npaid for as well. The Congressional Budget Office is also on the same \npage, asserting that, in their words:\n\n       In the absence of significant changes in policy, rising \n     costs for health care will cause federal spending to grow \n     much faster than the economy, putting the federal budget on a \n     nonsustainable path.\n\n  Over the past few months, the rising cost of health care has been \ncharacterized by a few creative illustrations. First, we have heard the \nchairman of the Budget Committee refer to the rising cost of health \ncare as ``an 800-pound gorilla.'' Second, we have heard the President \ndescribe the rising cost of health care as ``a ticking timebomb.''\n  Today I wish to add a third illustration. The rising cost of health \ncare is a massive, fire-breathing debt and deficit dragon. In the King \nArthur legend, the greatest knight among the Knights of the Round Table \nwas Sir Lancelot. Sir Lancelot was also a dragon slayer. In order for \nSir Lancelot to strike down the dragon, he had to be equipped with \nsuitable weapons. The same is true today with the rising cost of health \ncare. As Congress contemplates ways to cut down on the massive, fire-\nbreathing debt and deficit dragon, it must wield the proper weapons.\n  As you can see here, we have the debt and deficit dragon.\n  A few weeks ago, House Democrats proposed a graduated surtax of up to \n5.4 percent on taxpayers making over $280,000 to partially offset their \nhealth care reform bill. This small business surtax would push the top \nmarginal tax rates up to between 43 percent and 46.4 percent, a rate \nthat would jump to over 50 percent in 39 States with Medicare and State \nand local taxes added in. This is according to the Tax Foundation. So \nis this small business surtax the proper weapon to strike down the debt \nand deficit dragon? I have a chart that shows not Sir Lancelot but Sur \nTaxalot on his way to slay the debt and deficit dragon with his mighty \nsurtax. This is Sur Taxalot, as we can see. The surtax is a large, \nheavy, painful weapon and lethal to America's job engine, the goose \nthat lays the golden egg, small business America.\n  Take a good look at Sur Taxalot.\n  However, it is not effective against the debt and deficit dragon \nbecause it does nothing to slow the dragon's exponential growth. The \ncost of health care that the dragon feasts upon will continue to \nincrease much faster than the revenues that Sur Taxalot can collect \nwith his surtax.\n  CBO Director Doug Elmendorf testified in front of the Budget \nCommittee 2 weeks ago. Dr. Elmendorf stated: None of the legislative \nchanges looked at by CBO so far, including the House Democrats' small \nbusiness surtax, ``represent the sort of fundamental change of the \norder of magnitude that would be necessary to offset the direct \nincrease in federal health costs from the insurance coverage \nproposals.''\n  Clearly, unlike Sir Lancelot, Sur Taxalot is no dragon slayer.\n  Now let's look at how House Democrats' small business surtax works. \nIn 2011 and 2012, singles making between $280,000 and $400,000 and \nfamilies making between $350,000 and $500,000 will pay an extra 1-\npercent surtax. Singles making between $400,000 and $800,000 and \nfamilies making between $500,000 and $1 million will pay an extra 1.5 \npercent. Finally, singles making more than $800,000 and families making \nmore than $1 million will pay an extra 5.4 percent. Then in 2013 and \nafter, these surtax rates go up to 2 percent, 3 percent, and 5.4 \npercent, respectively. The only way these rates would not go up in 2013 \nis if the President's adviser, the Director of OMB, determines in 2012 \nthat there will be more than $675 billion realized in estimated health \ncare savings by the year 2019.\n  That is right: The trigger mechanism is back. The House Democrats \nhave made the surtax rate increase subject to a trigger. They have left \nthe judgment on whether to pull the trigger in the hands of a partisan \nPresidential adviser, not a nonpartisan organization such as the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  As Members of Congress, we should jealously guard our constitutional \nprerogatives to be the one branch of government tasked with deciding \nwhether revenue is raised by increased taxes or revenue is reduced \nthrough decreased taxes. As the great Chief Justice John Marshall said \nalmost 200 years ago:\n\n       The power to tax is the power to destroy.\n\n  So why would we hand such an enormous power over to the executive \nbranch? I recall, over the last 8 years, hearing from the other side of \nthe aisle that the executive branch was attempting to usurp \ncongressional authority. So where is that jealous guardian of \ncongressional authority now? It seems to be absent.\n  We have seen this trigger mechanism from the Democrats before. While \nit has been a couple years, I have spoken at length about this trigger \nright here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my speech of May 9, 2007, \nentitled ``A Trigger and a Tax Hike on the American People'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Senator Chuck Grassley: A Trigger Will Not Prevent a Tax \n                      Hike on the American People\n\n       Mr. President, press reports indicated we may be in the \n     ninth inning of the budget season. The President sent his \n     budget up to Capitol Hill over three months ago. The Senate \n     Budget Committee marked up a budget resolution. It passed the \n     Senate. That resolution lays out the Democratic Leadership \n     fiscal priorities for the next five years. As everyone knows, \n     the American People spoke last November and sent a Democratic \n     Majority to both Houses of Congress. For the first time in 12 \n     years, Democrats have the privilege and the responsibility \n     for our budget.\n       The Senate spoke very clearly in support of some tax \n     relief. The voice came in the form of the Baucus amendment. \n     My friend, the Chairman, secured $180 billion to prevent part \n     of the big tax increase that will go into effect on January \n     1, 2011. Although the Baucus amendment only provides 44 \n     percent of the tax relief room needed, it is far superior to \n     the House position. The House position is zero tax relief. \n     That's right, Mr. President, zero tax relief. Zero tax relief \n     means a total tax increase of $936 billion over 5 years. \n     That's the largest tax increase in history and one that \n     occurs without a vote of Congress.\n       That tax increase means real dollars out of the wallets of \n     real middle income families. I've got a chart here. The chart \n     shows a wall of tax increase. This chart shows that a family \n     of four at $40,000 will face a tax increase of $2,052. Now, \n     for a lot of my rich liberal friends that may not seem like a \n     lot of money. For a hard working family of four in Iowa, that \n     $2,052 matters.\n       As a senior Republican member of the Budget Committee, I've \n     not been consulted on the budget by our Chairman, but I've \n     made my views clear to our distinguished Chairman. What I \n     know about the budget I've learned from press reports. If \n     those reports are true, I'd encourage the Chairman and Senate \n     Leadership to stand strong for the Senate position.\n       Press reports indicate that the Democratic Budget Committee \n     chairmen are working on a compromise that would condition the \n     tax relief on a surplus. That is, the Baucus amendment would \n     be subject to a trigger. Now, Mr. President, what's a \n     trigger?\n       I have another chart. This chart deals with perhaps the \n     most famous trigger. The chart shows ``Trigger,'' the cowboy \n     actor, Roy Rogers', horse. You can see from the chart that \n     Trigger is a pretty impressive looking horse. Would \n     definitely like to have Trigger on my farm to help with the \n     chores. Am sure my grand kids would want to ride him if \n     Trigger were stabled on my farm.\n       As Western movie buffs know, Trigger is no longer with us. \n     Trigger is stuffed and on display at the Roy Rogers-Dale \n     Evans Museum in Branson, Missouri. Although Trigger was an \n     impressive looking horse, this trigger device the Democratic \n     Leadership is looking at is not impressive.\n       The trigger notion is something that has a long history \n     with the Democratic Leadership. Back in 1996, the Clinton \n     Administration and Democratic Leadership argued for a trigger \n     for the $500 per child tax credit and other family tax relief \n     proposals. They took this position after President Clinton \n     had vetoed the bill containing the family tax relief \n     proposals. If the Clinton Administration and the Democratic \n     Leadership had prevailed, millions of American families would \n     have received the $500 per child tax credit perhaps in 1999 \n     through 2001 only. If the President Clinton and the \n     Democratic Leadership had won and the trigger were in place, \n     millions of families would have lost the child tax credit in \n     the years 2002 to now.\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\n       The same dynamic occurred in 2001. With surpluses, the \n     Democratic Leadership opposed broad-based bipartisan tax \n     relief, including a doubling of the $500 per child tax \n     credit. One of the ideas the Democratic Leadership flirted \n     with was a trigger. There were a few Republicans attracted to \n     the idea.\n       The trigger was debated somewhat, but never found to be \n     workable. It is a complicated matter. It could be suggested \n     that the mechanics of a broad-based tax trigger are like \n     trigonometry. Trigonometry is a division of mathematics that \n     deals with triangles. It is simple on its face, but you can \n     see from this text book, can become complicated quickly.\n       Interweaving the complexity and uncertainty of triggered \n     tax relief with the vast American economy could lead to a new \n     term. That new term would be ``trig-o-nomics.'' As much as \n     folks complain about uncertainty and complexity in tax \n     policy, I don't think the Democratic budget negotiators \n     should want to take us to the land of trig-o-nomics.\n       To some degree, the current law sunset of the 2001 and 2003 \n     is a de facto trigger. If you look at those in opposition to \n     permanence of the bipartisan tax relief, you'll find that it \n     is, with very few exceptions, the same folks who like \n     triggers.\n       The tax system is a very complex and pervasive force in our \n     society. It affects all Americans and all economic activity. \n     Creating conditional tax relief through a trigger mechanism \n     would de-stabilize an already unwieldy tax system. How are \n     families, businesses, and investors supposed to plan their \n     affairs with a trigger hanging over current law tax rules \n     that keep taxes low? Think about that, Mr. President. What \n     would we be doing to the hard working American taxpayer?\n       As an aside, those taxpayers, by the way, are sending \n     record amounts of revenue to the Treasury. The bipartisan tax \n     relief plans of 2001 and 2003 are growing the economy. \n     Revenues are ahead of projections by double digit figures for \n     the third year in a row. It's there in the black and white of \n     Treasury and CBO reports. The American taxpayer is doing his \n     and her part to reduce the deficit. I ask unanimous consent \n     to insert in the record a couple of articles from the BNA \n     Daily Report for Executives, one dated May 3, 2007 and \n     another dated May 7, 2007.\n       So, why trigger on tax increases, when the current law tax \n     levels are bringing in plenty of money to the federal \n     Treasury? It makes no sense to punish the American taxpayer.\n       The biggest problem I have with a trigger is that it \n     creates yet another budget process bias for higher federal \n     spending. If Congress decides to spend more than planned, the \n     trigger gives the American taxpayer the shaft. Spending \n     taxpayers' money trumps future promised tax relief if a \n     trigger is in place.\n       The American taxpayer need look no further than the budget \n     resolution conference to see triggered future tax relief's \n     futility. After winning the November elections by claiming to \n     enforce fiscal discipline, Democrats have done three things \n     with the budgets in conference. One, they've guaranteed new \n     spending of at least $205 billion over the budget baseline. \n     Two, with multiple reserve funds, they've set up many arenas \n     of new spending and new taxes. Three, for the first time in \n     six years, a tax hike on virtually every American taxpayer is \n     built into the budget in future years. Did the American \n     People know that this was how fiscal discipline would be \n     defined after the votes were counted? Higher taxes and higher \n     spending? Did the American People vote for this definition of \n     fiscal discipline in last year's campaign? My guess is the \n     answer is the American taxpayer didn't think fiscal \n     discipline meant higher taxes and higher spending.\n       If fiscal discipline were the real goal of the Democratic \n     Leadership, they'd employ a trigger on the new spending \n     they've baked in the budget cake. Mr. President, how about \n     that? The new spending in this budget would only be triggered \n     if the federal budget were in surplus. Do I have any takers \n     among the Democratic budget negotiators?\n       Mr. President, before the Democratic Leadership rolled out \n     its budget, I challenged them to show a proposal with a \n     single dollar of spending restraint dedicated to deficit \n     reduction. It's a challenge I've issued for several years as \n     bipartisan tax relief has been attacked on fiscal discipline \n     grounds. My challenge has not been met. If you go back a \n     decade, you won't find a proposal for spending restraint from \n     the Democratic Leadership. Check the record. You won't find \n     anything on the spending side of the ledger.\n       The use of a trigger is more evidence of this obsession \n     with taxing and spending. Instead of accepting the Baucus \n     amendment, which is supported by strongly-bipartisan votes in \n     both bodies, the Democratic negotiators are taking a \n     different path. They want to use a trigger as cover. The \n     trigger will likely mean future Democratic spending proposals \n     will gut future tax relief, thereby guaranteeing a tax \n     increase on virtually every American taxpayer.\n       Mr. President, it's not too late. I suggest that, if the \n     Democratic budgeteers want to talk the talk of fiscal \n     discipline, they need to walk the walk of fiscal discipline. \n     Apply the trigger. But apply it to the $205 billion in brand \n     new spending. Don't build a wall of tax relief on America's \n     families. Build a wall of fiscal discipline against runaway \n     federal spending.\n       I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have a chart here from the 2007 speech that deals \nwith perhaps the most famous trigger. Of course, I refer to Trigger, \nthe horse belonging to the cowboy actor Roy Rogers. As I mentioned in \nthe past, Trigger is no longer with us. Today he is stuffed and on \ndisplay at the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Branson, MO. Even so, \nTrigger, in his current stuffed state, is still much more imposing than \nthe House Democrats' trigger device.\n  While past Democratic trigger proposals were bad, the current House \nDemocrats' trigger proposal is even worse because it is under the \ncontrol of a partisan OMB Director and is based upon an OMB Director's \nestimate--I repeat, an estimate--of health care savings for the years \n2013 to 2019.\n  I do not think anyone really expects this trigger to be pulled. Even \nthe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, in its $544 billion \nrevenue estimate of the House Democrats' small business surtax \nproposal, assumes that the estimated savings targets will not be \nreached and the rates will go up, for sure, in 2013.\n  Clearly, on the question of how to pay for health care reform, \nRepublicans and Democrats appear to be drifting in different \ndirections. Republicans want to pay for health care reform through \nchanges in the health care system--mostly on the spending side but also \non the revenue side--to make health care more accessible and more \naffordable. In contrast, House Democrats' most recent proposal to pay \nfor health care reform--the small business surtax--goes far outside the \nuniverse of health care.\n  By abandoning the universe of health care in their financing scheme, \nHouse Democrats are clearly indicating that the goal of their health \ncare reform proposal is increased coverage at any cost. Even the New \nYork Times--now, believe this: Even the New York Times, hardly a \nstrident critic of the Democrats in Congress or the White House, \ncautions against this coverage-at-any-cost approach:\n\n       If the government simply extends subsidized insurance to \n     millions of uninsured people but fails to force fundamental \n     changes in the delivery or financing of health care, then \n     federal health care costs will keep escalating at excessive \n     rates. That will drive up deficits in subsequent decades \n     unless new taxes are imposed or new savings found.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the New York Times.\n  We need to reform our health care system, but we need to do it right. \nThat is why I am working with Senator Baucus, chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, along with Senators Snowe, Enzi, Conrad, and \nBingaman, to reach a bipartisan solution. My Finance Committee \ncolleagues and our staffs have been working hours and hours each day \nand night, and weekends, to navigate through the numerous complex \nissues of health care reform. Has it been easy? Obviously not. However, \nI am very hopeful we can reach a bipartisan agreement that makes health \ncare in America more accessible and more affordable, while at the same \ntime protecting taxpayers and preventing the Federal Government from \ntaking over health care.\n  President Obama, in his prime time press conference last week, \nexpressed his agreement with these principles. While stating generally \nthat the reform he is proposing will keep government out of health care \ndecisions, President Obama specifically made the following promises:\n\n       I'm not going to sign a bill that, for example, adds to our \n     deficit. I won't sign a bill that doesn't reduce health care \n     inflation so that families as well as government are saving \n     money. I'm not going to sign a bill that I don't think will \n     work.\n\n  I will take the President at his words on these promises, but I am \ngoing to hold him to them. The President is sending a clear signal that \nhe could not sign the Pelosi bill, the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions bill, or similar pieces of legislation. Why? Because each of \nthose would drastically expand the Federal Government's control of the \nhealth care system, increase the deficit, and fail to reduce long-term \nhealth care inflation.\n  Here is the bottom line. When the long-term budget outlook warns that \nrising health care costs will cause Federal spending to grow so fast as \nto put the Federal budget on an unsustainable path, Congress needs to \ntake action. But, at the same time, when our goal is to reform 17 \npercent of the economy, while facing a nearly $2 trillion annual\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\ndeficit, more than $9 trillion in new debt over the next decade, and a \nprojected debt-to-GDP ratio of over 300 percent by 2050, we have to \nmake sure we are doing this job right. That is what we are trying to do \nin the Senate Finance Committee. When we get finished, however long it \ntakes, I hope we can send a deficit-neutral health care reform bill to \nPresident Obama that increases access, cuts costs, and puts us on a \nfiscally sustainable path for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8541-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak on the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be the next Associate Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  We all know elections have consequences. Because of this, I have \ntried to give deference to the various nominees submitted by President \nObama. I have not voted for all of his nominees, but I have voted for \nsome even though I did not necessarily believe they were the best \npeople he might have nominated.\n  The case of a nominee to the Supreme Court is unique. This is not a \nCabinet member who will rotate out or leave at the end of the \nPresident's term. Supreme Court Justices are there for life and decide \ncases that will affect present and future generations of Americans.\n  With this in mind, I have reviewed opinions written or concurred in \nby Judge Sotomayor, reviewed speeches and writings of Judge Sotomayor, \ntalked with lawyers who practice in New York, lawyers who have tried or \nargued cases before Judge Sotomayor, and others who know her by \nreputation, and also listened to and reviewed testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee in her confirmation proceeding. In addition, I \nspent the better part of an hour in a one-on-one conversation with the \njudge. Certainly, she has all the education and judicial background to \nbe confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice. Her judicial temperament is \nnot in question. Some lawyers felt she was not qualified for the \nSupreme Court, and others felt she is.\n  Judge Sotomayor has a very compelling personal story, and being \nHispanic and being female and being nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court \nadds more credibility to that saga of living the American dream. As \nAmericans, we should be proud she has been nominated. But the role of \nthe Senate is to give the President advice and consent, and we are \nrequired to go beyond the personal side of the nominee.\n  After reviewing the information I have collected over and over again, \nI have concluded that I cannot support Judge Sotomayor's nomination. My \nreasoning is as follows:\n  First, lawyers nominated to the Supreme Court should be in a class by \nthemselves.\n  My only experience as a Member of the Senate with this process is \nwith the confirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. \nClearly, they are lawyers who are in a premier class. Lawyers with whom \nI spoke who know Judge Sotomayor do not put her in that category. Even \nthose who say she should be confirmed do so in a less than enthusiastic \nway.\n  Second, I am a strong supporter of the second amendment, and I am \nconcerned about the reasoning of Judge Sotomayor in cases where she has \nconsidered this issue.\n  In DC v. Heller, the Supreme Court left unanswered the issue of \napplication of the second amendment to the States. This issue is likely \nto be decided by the Supreme Court in the next year or so. As a member \nof the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor ruled in the negative on this \nissue in the Maloney case without an explanation, simply citing an old \nSupreme Court case that is not really directly on point and is \ncertainly outdated. This is too important an issue to give it no more \nthan a cursory review.\n  Third, I am concerned about the apparent leaning of Judge Sotomayor \nto use foreign law to interpret U.S. laws and our Constitution.\n  In her April 28, 2009, speech to the Puerto Rican ACLU, Judge \nSotomayor said that while foreign law should not be used as a \nprecedent, she stated it should be ``considered.'' My question is, Why? \nJudge Sotomayor's answer in that same speech to that question was to \nalign herself with Justice Ginsburg, who supports the use of foreign \nlaw and recently stated that ``foreign opinions . . . can add to the \nstory of knowledge relevant to the solution of a question.'' Judge \nSotomayor went on to say that unless American courts are more open to \nideas in foreign cases, ``we are going to lose influence in the \nworld.'' From an American jurisprudence standpoint, that line of \nthinking is certainly scary to me.\n  Lastly, the highly publicized Ricci case is very puzzling. A per \ncurium opinion is unusual for such a complex and precedent-setting \ncase. No analysis for the decision is very troubling to the lawyer in \nme.\n  In my conversation with Judge Sotomayor, she stated that the Second \nCircuit panel was simply following precedent and if the Supreme Court \nreversed the Second Circuit opinion, it would be establishing a new \nprecedent. The Supreme Court, of course, did reverse the Second Circuit \nand clearly stated that no precedent was being followed by the lower \ncourt.\n  Judge Sotomayor did not adequately explain what precedent she was \ntalking about and, in fact, did not answer this question when directly \nasked the question by Senator Kyl at her confirmation hearing. Being \nless than forthcoming in every respect is very disturbing.\n  Mr. President, for all of the above reasons, I will cast a ``no'' \nvote on the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor next week.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I inquire, we are in morning business, am I \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, but we have 10-minute \ngrants.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8541-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8541-S8546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what I have done every day over the last \nweek or so is to take the floor to talk about health care, and I do so \nagain this evening, with a note of some sadness. I have just been told \nthere has now been a statement issued that there will be no markup of \nthe Finance Committee bill next week on health care. I know Senator \nBaucus has worked hard at that. I know other members of that committee, \nin that effort, have been working to try to reach some understanding in \nall of that. I regret we will now leave here, I gather, next week, at \nthe conclusion of the nomination process for Judge Sotomayor, for a \nmonth-long recess to our respective States, or whatever other \nobligations our colleagues may have. So I am saddened by that.\n  Let me try to find a good note in all of this--there are five \ncongressional committees between the House of Representatives, the \nother body, and ourselves that have some jurisdiction over the health \ncare debate. Three of those committees reside in the other body, the \nHouse of Representatives; that is, the Energy and Commerce Committee, \nthe Education and Labor Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee. I \nam told that by tomorrow those three committees will have completed \ntheir jobs. They will have reported out a bill. There are two \ncommittees in the U.S. Senate with jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over some \nof the most major components of health care resides in the committee \nchaired by our colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who is \nnot with us, as most Americans know, because of his ongoing battle \ntoday with brain cancer. In his absence, I have been asked to act as \nthe acting chair of that committee. Two weeks and 2 days ago, we \ncompleted our work in that committee. So the only committee remaining \nto do some work is the Finance Committee. So of the five committees, \nfour, by the end of business tomorrow, will have completed their jobs.\n  That does not mean the work is completed. Obviously, a lot of work \nremains in melding these bills together to try to come up with answers \nto the thorny questions that remain on how we structure the health care \nsystem in our Nation to go from a sick care system, which it is today, \nto truly a\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\nhealth care system, to deal with the issues of cost, to try to manage \nthese issues so we bend that cost in the coming decades and beyond in a \ndifferent direction than we are headed today--I will talk about that in \na minute--obviously, to improve the quality of health care, which all \nof us care about. And while we have great quality of health care in \nmany areas of our country, there are still numerous areas where the \noutcome, the overall health condition, the life expectancy of our \nfellow citizens, is far less than it ought to be. So accessibility, \nquality of care, and affordability are still the primary goals. We are \nall working very hard to try to reach that point.\n  So four out of five committees will have acted. The fifth, we hope, \nwill achieve that result at some point here or in some manner in which \nwe can move forward with this critical debate in our Nation.\n  So this evening, I want to spend a few minutes talking about where we \nare on a couple of these issues. I have discussed, on previous \ngatherings, my thoughts on aspects of the legislation. Let me share \nwhere this debate is.\n  There is a strong case to be made--we know the economic argument. I \nam going to get to that in a minute. But there is a moral case to be \nmade as well for health care reform, and it is a very strong one.\n  Maybe that impresses economists or actuaries, but there is a moral \nobligation, it seems to me, in a nation as blessed as ours, with great \nresources and wealth and abundance of resources, natural and otherwise. \nWe live in the wealthiest Nation in the history of mankind. Our \ngeneration is an inheritor of incredible work that was done by those \nwho have come before us, who sacrificed greatly, including their very \nlives, to produce the kind of Nation we live in today. It has been a \nremarkable story for little more than two centuries, which has resulted \nin one of the great miracles in world history--to produce a nation \nwhere the vast majority of our population can live with financial \nsecurity, with job opportunities, with the ability to raise families \nwith security, despite what we have gone through in recent years in \ncertain instances. Nonetheless, there is a sense of stability and \nsecurity about being an American.\n  In many ways, we are the envy of a good part of the world. So it is \nimportant, as we think of the debate on health care, to remind \nourselves what others have given to produce the kind of results that \nleave us with a level of lifestyle that is unmatched anywhere around \nthe globe. In spite of that great news, we should note that also 45 \nmillion of our fellow citizens, many of whom are children, go to bed \nevery night without health care coverage. In the wealthiest Nation in \nthe history of mankind, nobody should be denied coverage for health \ncare because they have some preexisting condition. What is that? That \nis some determination that you had a problem, a healthcare problem, \nbefore. Therefore, that insurance company will deny you coverage \nbecause of that preexisting condition, especially when that excuse is \nused by so many insurance companies to avoid covering victims of \ndomestic violence, for instance, or those suffering from the most \npainful of long-term illnesses--those preexisting conditions.\n  In the wealthiest Nation in the history of mankind, nobody should \nhave to choose between paying their electric bill or taking a sick \nchild to the doctor. I wish that were just in minor cases, small \nanecdotes. It is not. Regardless of which State we represent, every one \nof us represents families who, every single day, make those kinds of \nchoices, such as paying that electric bill or cutting back on the \nfamily budget because they have to make a choice about whether they can \ncare for that sick family member.\n  Nobody should have to lose their home and go into bankruptcy because \ntheir medical bills are too high. I know the Presiding Officer has \nheard me on previous occasions in recent times talk about the \nstatistics. Let me repeat them quickly: 62 percent of all bankruptcies \nin the last several years are health care crisis related--62 to 65 \npercent. Of that 62 percent, 75 percent of those people had health \ninsurance. When I first saw those numbers that 60 to 65 percent of \nbankruptcies are due to the health care crisis, I assumed that the \noverwhelming majority of people in that situation must be those without \nhealth care coverage. It pained me to learn that 75 percent of those \npeople actually had health care coverage. Despite that, they ended up \nin financial ruin, having to go into bankruptcy to survive \neconomically.\n  In the wealthiest Nation in the world, the one that spends far more \non health care than anybody else--some $2.5 trillion a year, and we now \nrank 37th in the world in medical outcomes--that is in terms of our \noverall condition, healthwise, as a people, life expectancy. We now \nhave the first generation of Americans who will live shorter, less \nhealthy lives than their parents. That has never happened before in the \nhistory of our country. Each generation of Americans has been able to \nimprove the quality of the health care of their children. Even in that \n19th century and throughout the difficulties of the 20th century, every \ngeneration did better on that score. We are about to be the first \ngeneration whose children will be less well off--not financially, \nalthough that may be the case, but in terms of their health care.\n  I don't know of anyone in this generation who wants to leave a legacy \nlike that, where because we could not figure out how to deal with \nhealth care we left our children in a condition where they will have \nless healthy lives than we have had. I don't think any one of us--I \ndon't care what our politics are, or where we are from--wants to be \npart of a generation that gets referred to in history because we could \nnot take better care of our children.\n  There is a moral case for health care that I know gets dispelled by \nsome because people don't want to take it seriously or don't want to \ntalk about that. Let's just talk about the economics. I think, as a \npeople, we ought to talk about it. I think it motivates us. I think all \nof us share that common concern that we believe in this great country \nof ours we ought to be able to do a better job taking care of our \nfellow citizenry when it comes to the basic right of being provided for \nwhen a health care crisis comes.\n  Today I want to make the case for reform, in addition to being the \nright thing to do, is also the smart thing to do, the very smart thing \nto do. It is the smart thing to do for our Federal deficit--and my \ncolleague from Iowa talked about the deficit. I think he is right that \nwe need to confront that issue. Six months ago, an American President \nassumed office--how quickly we forget--having inherited the largest \ndeficit accumulated not just by any President but by every previous \nPresident combined. That is a remarkable track record. It is one thing \nto have a larger deficit than your predecessor, but over the previous 8 \nyears the administration that just left town, and the Congresses that \nsupported them, accumulated a deficit in 8 years that exceeded the \ndeficits accumulated by all previous 42 Presidents in our American \nhistory.\n  All of a sudden, President Obama arrives in town on January 20 and he \ngets handed this ``gift'' from the previous administration: a mountain \nof accumulated debt. All of a sudden, now this is the big issue we hear \nabout. Where were those voices over the past 8 years as that debt \naccumulated day after day? All of a sudden they want to lay this at the \ndoorstep of a new President arriving in town.\n  If they are concerned about it--and I believe my colleagues are--then \none certain way to add to it is to do nothing about health care. Let's \njust leave town for another month, without having addressed this issue \nin any concrete and thoughtful manner because, clearly, if we do that, \nthe amount of deficit this country will accumulate--Mr. President, we \nspend 16 cents of every dollar on health care today. I don't know of a \nsingle expert who would tell us that by 2040 we will be spending as \nmuch as 30 to 40 cents out of every dollar on health care if we do \nnothing, with inaction, if the status quo dominates. There is a danger \nof that. We are all painfully aware of that.\n  The bill that passed our committee 2 weeks and 2 days ago--by the \nway, it took a long time, 5 weeks. We had 23 sessions and went through \nsome 60 hours--it was 4 weeks from start to finish, actually, almost 60 \nhours, 23 sessions, on 13 days. We actually considered 287 amendments \nover that month-long process day in and day out. We accepted 161 \namendments offered by our\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\nfriends on the Republican side. Many were technical and many were \nsubstantive amendments.\n  So we went through a long process and considered it at length, with \nlong debates, with 23 of us, one-quarter of the Senate, sitting on the \ncommittee chaired by Senator Kennedy to consider various ideas within \nour jurisdiction.\n  Under that bill we established a very large and robust marketplace \nwhere small business owners can go to comparison shop for various \nhealth care packages for their employees or themselves. Our bill is the \nsmart thing to do for businesses which often today find themselves \nchoosing between reducing coverage for their employees or laying off \nworkers because they cannot afford to provide it.\n  In our bill--the one we passed--if our bill would be adopted, as I \nbelieve it will be, no longer will small businesses in our country be \nforced to act as health insurance experts. No longer would they be \ndenied affordable insurance options. No longer would small businesses \nbe discriminated against because they employ someone with a preexisting \ncondition or one who suffers a sudden unexpected health crisis, thus \ndriving up the premiums for every employee, either making it too costly \nor making it impossible to provide them coverage.\n  In our bill we passed not only do we give small businesses somewhere \nto turn for insurance options, we give them the financial assistance to \npay for it--$1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for families. Every small \nbusiness could get that to assist them in that very business of trying \nto provide for their families.\n  That has been in our bill. It is written in there. If we can pass \nthat bill, I am confident the other body would adopt it.\n  We give employers a healthier, more productive workforce. I point out \nin many parts of our country employers only have one choice or two \nchoices for health care coverage for their employees. That is all that \nexists for them, and they want to shop to find out what is available. \nUnder our marketplace in the bill, they would have a wide range of \noptions to choose from of private carriers offering different packages \nand different levels of cost, allowing the employer to shop on behalf \nof their employees, and we give them the credit to make it available, \nfinancially, to do so. Our bill does more than anything else--\ncertainly, when it comes to small businesses.\n  Importantly, for those employers who are happy, as many are, with the \ninsurance they have--maybe they are a large employer who has invested \nheavily in prevention, or they have negotiated low prices and a wide \nnetwork of providers as exists in some parts of our country. Under our \nbill nothing changes for them. They can keep the insurance as long as \nthey choose to renew it. That is their business. We change none of \nthat.\n  If you like what you have, you keep that. If you are a smaller \nemployer and you want to change that and you want better plans, we \nprovide the credits to do so and the option for you to have more \nchoices.\n  Most of all, we believe reform is the smart thing to do for the \nAmerican consumer, for those employers and employees. Some of our \nfellow citizens are getting a good deal when it comes to their \ninsurance. They like the doctor they have, they like the hospital they \ngo to when they need one, and they like the insurance plan they have. \nThey don't want anything about their health care to change. They should \nnot have to worry about that. Our bill protects that. If you like your \ndoctor, your hospital, and your health care coverage, you can keep \nthat, just as that business who wants the plan they have, they can keep \nthat under our bill, which we wrote 2 weeks and 2 days ago--the 900 \npages we worked on for almost 5 weeks and on which we considered 300 \namendments.\n  Some of our colleagues have tried to scare our fellow Americans into \nbelieving our bill would force change upon them. That is just not true. \nThat is a falsehood. It is being dishonest with the American people. \nThe bill that was crafted in the HELP committee won't make anyone \nchange their doctor or their insurance plan. If they like what they \nhave, they get to keep it. The only change they may see is that there \nmay be more money back in their pocket as a result of what we provided \nin the options available to people to make better choices at lower \ncosts.\n  Here is what our opponents won't tell you: If we don't take action--\nif it is just the status quo and we go back to our States and walk away \nfrom all of this and never deal with this issue, you may very well lose \nthe ability to see the doctor you like. That is at risk with inaction. \nIf we don't take action, you may lose that good insurance plan you \nhave. If we don't take action, you may well find yourself unable to get \nthe kind of care you need when you need it.\n  If we don't take action in the Congress, families with insurance will \ncontinue to pay that hidden tax of $1,100 that the average family pays \nevery single year to cover the costs of the uninsured who show up at \nhospitals.\n  In our country, you will get care. If you walk into the emergency \nroom, we take care of you. But there is a cost for doing so. The cost \nis, on average, $1,100 per family a year. That is the tax we pay today \nbecause of the failure to provide the kind of plans we adopted in our \nbill. So that cost falls on families.\n  Further, Mr. President, if we don't take action, premiums will \ncontinue to rise faster than wages. If you don't believe me, look what \nhappened to my State of Connecticut a few weeks ago when an insurance \ncompany proposed to raise their rates by 32 percent. I wish that were \nuncommon. The rates in my States in the last 6 years have gone up 45, \n46 percent, and since 1996 in the country, they have gone up 86 \npercent, vastly outstripping the rate of inflation, with no end in \nsight.\n\n  For those who say we can wait, we don't need to do this now, we ought \nto postpone all this, it is not necessary, we ought to deal with the \ndeficit or other issues, then consider what is going to happen if we \ndon't move and if we don't come together and get this job done. On \nevery one of these issues, if we don't take action, no matter how \nsecure you may feel today, you may lose that insurance, you may lose \nthat coverage, you may find yourself unable to go to that doctor or \nhospital you believe you would like to and you continue to pay a rising \ncost in premiums to cover the uninsured.\n  Mr. President, 2 weeks and 2 days ago, since our committee acted, \n210,000 of our fellow citizens have lost health care coverage. These \nare people who had insurance 2 weeks ago. Every single day we delay \ntaking action on legislation, 14,000 of our fellow citizens lose health \ncare coverage--every day. So since 2 weeks and 2 days ago, 210,000 of \nour fellow citizens lost their health care coverage, and we are about \nto leave for another month. Do the math on a daily basis.\n  While we as Members of this body go back to our respective States, we \nhave our health care coverage, we have very good health care coverage--\nvery good health care coverage. None of us have to worry about that as \nwe go back and walk away, unfortunately, from a set of issues with \nwhich we should be grappling. But we can do so with the assurance, the \ncertainty, and the stability as elected officials in this body that if \nsomething happens to any one of us, we are going to be fine because we \nhave great health care coverage. But, unfortunately, for 210,000 of our \nfellow citizens in the last 2 weeks, that is not the case.\n  Imagine tonight that you are one of those 210,000 and you wake up in \nthe middle of the night because your child is very sick and you rush \nthem to the hospital, or a spouse or loved one who needs that kind of \ncare because of an accident. These things happen with the least \npredictability. Every one of us knows what happens. We have all had it \nhappen to us with a child, a spouse, where all of a sudden there is a \ntragedy, an accident, an injury, there is an illness, and all of a \nsudden we need that coverage to protect us. Tonight there are 210,000 \nmore people since 2 weeks ago who are in that free-fall hoping that \nnothing happens until they get back on their feet again, maybe get that \nnew job, find that insurance company that will cover them and provide \nthose benefits.\n  Imagine yourself being in that spot--think about that--that lack of \nstability, that lack of certainty, that lack of comfort knowing that if \nsomething happens to my family, I cannot help them.\n  I hope we can get them back on their feet again. I hope they get to \nsee a\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\ngood doctor, and they will have the drugs they need or care they need \nto restore their health. But you never get to that question if you \ncannot even approach it because you don't have the coverage any longer \nto pay for it.\n  Those 14,000 a day are going to continue to mount up under the \npresent circumstances. I am disappointed, to put it mildly, that we \nfind ourselves leaving here without continuing to do work. Not that we \nare going to solve all the problems in the week before we leave, and no \none, of course, argues that we shouldn't do this right and we shouldn't \nbe careful to make sure we are doing it right. It is a silly argument \nto suggest there are people here who don't care about crafting \nresponsible legislation. I will not accept the argument it is too hard \nand that is the reason we cannot get it done. That is why reforming our \nhealth care system is so important, for all those reasons.\n  Even if you are satisfied with your personal health care situation, \nyou ought not have too much comfort and believe it will be there when \nyou may need it the most.\n  The bill we passed provides stability so that care that is available \nto you stays available day after day and provides cost savings that you \nwill see in your family budget. Our bill eliminates entirely the annual \nand lifetime caps on benefits. So even if you suddenly develop a \nserious illness or get into a bad accident, you will be able to get the \ntreatment you need, and it does put limits on how much money out of \nyour income you could be forced to spend on insurance.\n  Today there are no limits. Our bill provides those limits so your \nexpenses will never be more than you can afford to pay.\n  Our bill we passed prohibits insurance companies from discriminating \nagainst people with preexisting conditions. That is gone forever in our \nbill. That argument about preexisting conditions is absolutely gone. If \nwe do nothing, it is still there, and so that certainty you think you \nhave is not certain at all with preexisting conditions that exist \ntoday. Our bill eliminates those.\n  You don't have to stay in a job just because you have an illness that \nwould keep you from getting coverage elsewhere. I cannot tell you how \nmany stories I have heard about that, where people have miserable jobs \nwith miserable pay, but they don't dare leave it because they know if \nthey do and they have a preexisting condition, they will be denied the \nkind of coverage they need to have.\n  Our legislation also prohibits insurance companies from changing or \ndropping coverage or refusing to renew it if you get sick. It mandates \nthat these companies cover the things that will help you stay well, \nsuch as mammograms or annual checkups, at no additional charge to you \nas a patient.\n  The truth is that too many Americans are getting a bad deal, even \nthose who are operating with a comfort that they believe that what they \nhave will be there whenever they need it, and the ones who are getting \na good deal might not be able to keep it unless we take action to \nprovide the kind of stability people are looking for.\n  Even those who somehow are able to ignore the urgent moral imperative \nof reform I think should support the legislation we crafted simply \nbecause it is a better deal for American consumers, and it is the smart \nthing to do.\n  It has now been, as I said, more than 2 weeks since our HELP \nCommittee passed its legislation. It is a good bill. It is not a \nperfect bill, and more work needs to be done. All of us acknowledge \nthat. But it is one that I think every Member of this body can get \nbehind. Every single member of that committee, all 23 of us, every \nsingle member added contributions to the original draft. Every \nDemocrat, every Republican added amendments that were adopted to our \nbill.\n  By the end of this week, as I pointed out earlier, four of the five \ncommittees with health reform bills will have completed their work. I \nknow the Finance Committee, as I said earlier, is working hard to \nproduce a bill as well. When their work is complete, I look forward to \nsitting down with them to merge our efforts, which is clearly going to \nhappen. We are going to merge our efforts. We are going to take what we \nhave done and merge it with what the Finance Committee has done. So the \nSenate will have two committees on equal footing dealing with health \ncare issues. I know the leaders guaranteed that, the President has \nspoken about it, and I am sure my colleagues will support that effort.\n  I heard some of my colleagues mention that now is not the time to \nplow ahead. I disagree. I can't think of a more urgent issue for all \nthe reasons I mentioned this evening and how important it is. I said it \nmay not be as much an urgency for those of us with the stability and \ncertainty of our own health care policies, but for so many of the \npeople we represent--those who are uninsured or underinsured--they have \na right to insist we do the job, face the difficult questions, and have \nthe courage to lead on this issue, to be leaders. That is what we are \nasked to be when people chose us to represent them.\n  I know it is the case in my own State, as it is across the country. A \nlot of the choices we have to make are tough ones and hard to explain, \nin some cases, because they will involve the shared responsibility that \nall Americans must be involved in if this is going to work. That is why \nwe get sent here. Occasionally, there are matters that require us to \nstand and make tough choices. We are at such a moment. For us to do \nless, to walk away from this, I think, will be one of the great \ntragedies of our time.\n  I regret we will not be working on this legislation in the coming \nweeks, although we will in our own way--our staffs will be working and \nwe will be back in our respective States listening to our constituents. \nI hope when we come back in September, we will have a renewed sense of \npurpose and get the job done. We have a President who cares about this \ndeeply. We have Members of both bodies who were elected and ran on this \nissue of reforming our health care system. Major industries, the \ninsurance industry, the providers, the doctors, nurses, the \npharmaceutical industry, all today are on the side of getting something \ndone. There are disagreements on how to do this, but wonderful people \nin public and outside public life are committed to this. It is \ndifferent than it was 14 years ago. We ought to be able to take \nadvantage of that new alignment, if you will, and get this job done.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak after \nChairman Dodd, who has probably, more than anybody else this year, led \nthe health care effort. As he pointed out, in our committee, it was the \nlongest markup of any bill I have ever seen in my years in the House \nand Senate.\n  I spoke today to a Washington Post reporter who said she had never \nseen a markup so thorough. We faced 160 Republican amendments, either \npassed or accepted, many of them substantive, some of them not but \ncertainly a major bipartisan effort. In the HELP Committee, we went \nover it section by section. This is a very good work product.\n  We are joined by three committees in the House of Representatives--\nthe Ways and Means Committee and the Education and Labor Committee, \nwhich have already completed their work on a similar bill, and another \ncommittee is working on it tonight, the Energy and Commerce Committee, \na committee on which I sat in my years in the House of Representatives.\n  All four of these bills are similar. They all protect what works in \nour health care system, and they fix what is broken. They all provide \nthat, if you are happy with your insurance, you can keep what you have. \nBut in addition, your premium is much more likely to stabilize because, \nas Chairman Dodd said, you are no longer subsidizing to the tune of \n$1,100, $1,200 a year uncompensated care for others. You are paying for \nyour health insurance, but others in society will be paying for their \nown health insurance rather than what is called cross-subsidies. This \nlegislation obviously covers millions of Americans who are not insured.\n  All that aside for a moment, I have come to the floor to read letters \nfrom people, which I have done every day for the last several days and \nwill continue. We use words such as ``market exclusivity, gateway, \nexchange, cross-subsidies,'' and all these kinds of terms. When it gets \nright down to it, it is how this affects people individually in our \ncountry and our State. Whether they\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\nare in West Haven or Hartford, whether they are in New London, CT, or \nNew London, OH, people are hurting, and these are some letters from \nconstituents I have received.\n  I would like to share five, six letters with my colleagues and with \nthe Presiding Officer.\n  Diana from Seneca County in Ohio writes:\n\n       I am a middle-aged widow who returned to college. Next \n     month, I will graduate. I have no health insurance and have \n     been seeking employment for a year. Please help the good \n     citizens of Ohio get health care, many of whom have found \n     themselves in a terrible predicament through no fault of \n     their own. Please help me help myself.\n\n  This is an example of people working hard, doing the right thing. \nChairman Dodd said 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance every \nday now, and people such as Diana from the Tiffin area in northwest \nOhio cannot get ahead of the game, cannot get ahead of the curve, \ncannot get insurance, has not found a job. In economic times such as \nthese, there are an awful lot of people similar to Diana from Seneca \nCounty. That is why it is so important we pass legislation when we come \nback in September.\n  Ian from Franklin County--that is central Ohio, the Columbus area:\n\n       I am a 31 year old without health insurance. I have a 4-\n     year degree but work part time. I have no sick days, no \n     vacation days, or personal days. I'm sick and tired of being \n     scared of getting sick. . . . Health care should be based on \n     need rather than ability to pay. Enough.\n\n  Just think of how many people in this country live that way. They \nthink about being sick. They think: What happens if I am sick? I am \nbarely making a living. I know if I get sick, I will have to choose \nbetween my medical bills and paying my rent or choose between my \nmedicine or sufficiently heating my home in the winter.\n  Those kinds of choices are very real choices to hundreds of \nthousands--more than that--Americans every single day.\n  Lee from Cuyahoga County writes:\n\n       I have worked in health insurance in some form or another \n     since 1973. I know Medicare and Medicaid as well as private \n     health insurance. I have seen health insurance from just \n     about all angles and could probably write a book on it. Many \n     times I have told potential clients that ``shopping around \n     for health insurance is like going to a casino and betting \n     against the house--where the house is making up the rules, \n     changing the rules, and not letting you know that the rules \n     have been changed.''\n\n  This is an expert who made his living by dealing with health care \nissues. He knows what happens with insurance companies. That is why we \ndid consumer protection in this legislation--no more preexisting \nconditions, no more dropping coverage indiscriminately, no more caps on \ncoverage, no more gaming the community rating system, no more \ndiscrimination. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  If you have insurance and you like what you have, you can keep it. \nAbsolutely our bill guarantees that. But you also will have these \nconsumer protections because plenty of people who are satisfied with \ntheir insurance get sick and find their insurance has been canceled. No \nmore of that under this legislation.\n  Susan from central Ohio, from Franklin County, writes:\n\n       I am in my mid-50s and have been unemployed for over a \n     year, looking for a new job the entire time. Living without \n     health insurance at this point in my life is terrifying.\n\n  I am 56. This woman is in her midfifties. She has been unemployed for \na year. She is living without health insurance. It sounds like she is \nhealthy but always thinking about it, always scared.\n\n       My father was a physician in private practice in Columbus \n     from the 1950s through the 1980s, in the days when the \n     physicians made the diagnoses and the health care providers \n     trusted them to do so. Please fix the health care system, and \n     make it possible for everyone to have access to good medical \n     care.\n\n  Susan is somebody who understands the health care system from within. \nShe is the daughter of a physician and understands, in her words:\n\n       . . . living without health insurance at this point in my \n     life is terrifying.\n\n  Think about that. With all the worries someone has when they are in \ntheir mid-fifties and thinking about what happens if they get sick.\n  Libby, also from Franklin County, says:\n\n       I need a follow-up CT scan for kidney cancer, but I can't \n     afford the co-pay. I have to take early retirement, but can't \n     wait 2 years for disability. I hope having to wait doesn't \n     kill me, but I am one of many. Please fix our broken health \n     care system.\n\n  We hear stories every day about health care denied and health care \ndelayed--which really is health care denied--and what happens to people \nwhen they have to delay. Libby, from this letter, sounds to me as if \nshe is hoping, hoping, hoping that we can move quickly so she can get \ninsurance and can have the follow-up CT Scan for her kidney cancer.\n  Claudia, from Franklin County in central Ohio, says:\n\n       My husband and I have owned our own successful business for \n     21 years. Our health insurance costs have escalated to the \n     point where we barely can pay the bill and our coverage is \n     truly awful. With a $5,000 deductible per person, we are \n     insuring against catastrophic illness only. Little money is \n     available for regular checkups, recommended annual tests, or \n     dental care. I never thought we would be in this position and \n     there is no relief in sight. Many self-employed people are \n     now discontinuing health care because of the cost. We need \n     help.\n\n  Claudia and her husband are like small business owners all over this \ncountry--people who are self-employed, who have maybe 5 to 10 \nemployees. They can no longer afford health insurance, particularly if \nthey are a business of 30, 40 or 50 people and 2 or 3 of those \nemployees get very sick and they need Remicade or they need Perceptin \nor one of those biologic drugs that cost $10,000, $20,000, sometimes \n$50,000 or even $100,000 a year. What happens to that small business, \nif they have 20 or 30 employees and a couple of those employees end up \nwith drug costs of $50,000 or $100,000 a year? That may cause the \nemployer to have to cancel their insurance because the insurance \npremiums go so high as a result of three or four or five sick people.\n  This legislation, as Chairman Dodd points out, has specific \nprovisions to help small business. It lets them go to the health \nexchange so they can spread out their costs among the larger numbers of \npeople than the small employers of 10, 15 or 20 people--or in the case \nof self-employed people such as Claudia from Columbus and her husband--\nwho simply don't have any chance of getting insurance. They know people \nwith insurance in small businesses will no longer have to pay the cost \nof the uninsured--the extra $1,100, $1,200 a year they have to pay. \nThey will get additional tax credits so they can insure themselves and \ninsure their employees.\n  Almost every employer I know wants to insure their employees. They \nwant to insure their employees. So many simply can't afford it. This \nbill will make a difference for small business. It will make a \ndifference with the consumer protections that will help those people \nwho are happy with their insurance but are always anxious about perhaps \ntheir insurance being canceled or caps being put on their insurance or \nall of those issues that happen to people.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. That is what is \nreflected in these letters from individual people, whether they are \nfrom Zanesville or Mansfield or Urbana or Youngstown. People all over \nmy State are hurting. People all over this country are hurting. People \nin the State of the Presiding Officer--in Boulder, in Denver. Anywhere \nin Colorado or in Connecticut we know these problems are every bit as \nsevere as they are in my State. That is why we need to take action.\n  We have 14,000 Americans every day losing health insurance, and I am \nhearing from a lot of them. I am hearing from people who are looking \nfor work and can't find work and can't find insurance. It is time we \nmove forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio. He has been \na member of our committee, and as I mentioned earlier, he has done a \ntremendous job, as others have as well. Sherrod Brown brings a wealth \nof experience. He has been dealing with these issues, obviously, in the \nother body.\n  And I think in talking about real people with these issues, there is \na tendency of all of us to kind of discuss these matters from about \n30,000 feet, using the language we are familiar with to describe what \nis going on, and too often I think for people across the country, they \nwonder if anybody is\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\ntalking about them. I think by reading letters from citizens in Ohio \nand what they are wrestling with every day, it brings this back down to \na level that we need to think of more often when we debate these \nissues, and that is that every single day, of those 14,000 people who \nare losing their health insurance, there are many who do confront a \nhealth care crisis and lack the ability to respond to it other than \nshowing up in an emergency room or hoping there will be free health \ncare for them because they do not have the capacity to pay for it.\n  So I appreciate tremendously Senator Brown's contribution, not only \nduring those long days we spent day in and day out crafting the \nlegislation that is now before us, but now, when we need to do more \ntalking about what is in that bill. Because from a small business \nperspective, as well as the insured, the prevention, the quality of \ncare, or workforce issues, they are all very significant contributions \nto our debate.\n  The Class Act, which allows individual people, at no government \nexpense, to contribute to their own long-term care needs is one of the \nmost innovative and creative ideas in our bill. That will provide not \nonly substantial resources, but the ability of people to lead \nindependent lives who have disabilities under what might otherwise \nforce them to live under more expensive care or tapping into Medicare. \nIn fact, the projections under the Congressional Budget Office is that \nwe have saved $2 billion in Medicare costs just by having the Class \nAct--that is the long-term care provisions in the bill.\n  I invite all my colleagues to read the bill and to go to the \nbriefings. I spent a little more than an hour today with my colleague \nfrom California, Dianne Feinstein, who requested that I come by with \nstaff, with her staff, and go through the various sections of the bill \nand how it would work; how it would affect people in their State; how \nthese various provisions would work.\n  I don't want to speak for her, but I think she was pleased to hear \nwhat we had done. Obviously, there is more to be done out of the \nFinance Committee, and I don't have answers for that because there is \nno bill out of the Finance Committee as yet, but on the part of the \neffort we have made, as our Members and colleagues look at what we have \ndone, I think they will be pleasantly pleased about the efforts we have \nmade to assist the insured with preexisting conditions, the caps, as I \nhave mentioned, the credits we provide to small businesses to allow \nthem to make that health care insurance available to their employees--\nas many would like to be able to do--at a cost they can afford, without \ncrippling them because one employee ends up with a serious health \ncondition thus raising the cost of every other employee and the cost of \noverall health care. That is gone as a result of what we have written \nin our legislation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to read the bill, to talk with us, to raise \nthe questions you have, particularly over these weeks between now and \nthe time we come back. I think you will again be pleased at the effort \nour colleagues have made to vastly improve the status quo and, I think, \ncontribute significantly to where we need to be going with regard to \nhealth care reform.\n  So I am very grateful to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio for his \ncontribution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8546-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Lieutenant Brian N. Bradshaw\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nselfless commitment of LT Brian N. Bradshaw to the U.S. Army and to our \nNation.\n  Lieutenant Bradshaw died as a result of an improvised explosive \ndevice on June 25 in Kheyl, Afghanistan. He was 24 years old.\n  Coincidentally, Lieutenant Bradshaw's life was taken the same day \nthat pop star Michael Jackson died. A Google News search reveals that \nthe number of news stories in the past month filed about Michael \nJackson is 142,929, the number filed about Lieutenant Bradshaw? Twenty-\nsix.\n  It is time the American people know a bit more about this young man \nwho sacrificed for his country his life, his family, and all his \npotential, giving up all he had and all he was going to be.\n  In his youth, Lieutenant Bradshaw served his community in Steilacoom, \nWA, as a search-and-rescue volunteer, as an altar boy, and as a summer \ncamp counselor. Family and friends describe him as a man with ``a wry \nsense of humor'' and a deep love for American history.\n  He graduated from Pacific Lutheran University in the spring of 2007 \nand joined the Army and began service in Afghanistan in March of 2009. \nAs a member of the U.S. Army, Lieutenant Bradshaw served in the 1st \nBattalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Airborne Brigade \nCombat Team, 25th Infantry Division, and was stationed at Fort \nRichardson, AK.\n  Described as a man who found more meaning in actions than words, it \nis no surprise that Lieutenant Bradshaw found meaning in his service in \nOperation Enduring Freedom. In the course of his deployment, he sought \nto help the less fortunate people of Afghanistan and to improve life \nfor the children there, frequently writing home for packages of gifts \nto give to local children.\n  Lieutenant Bradshaw found his voice in the honor and patriotism of \nthe Army. With a father who is a retired National Guard helicopter \npilot and a mother who is a retired Army nurse, Lieutenant Bradshaw was \na man with the military in his blood.\n  Thus, it is only fitting the transfer of his remains on June 25 to \nBagram Air Force Base was carried out in a ceremony of honor and \npatriotism that typifies the ideals of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Sent to retrieve Lieutenant Bradshaw's body were members of the Air \nNational Guard from my home State of Georgia. On their sad mission, \nthey landed their C-130 using night-vision goggles in blackout \nconditions. What appeared to be hundreds of his fellow soldiers in his \ncompany stood in formation in the dark as Lieutenant Bradshaw's body \nwas carried aboard the plane.\n  In a letter to Lieutenant Bradshaw's family, CPT James Adair and MSG \nPaul Riley of the Georgia Air National Guard, who were present at the \nceremony, described the experience:\n\n       Everyone we talked to spoke well of him--his character, his \n     accomplishments and how well they liked him.

Mr. President, we have come so very far.\n  But there are some who think we should scrap everything we have \naccomplished and go back to square one. The truth is that throwing out \nall the great work we have done until now would be a terrible waste of \ntime, energy and hard work.\n  There are some who do not think now is the right time to reform \nhealth care. In reality, for many who feel that way, there will never \nbe a good time to reform health care.\n  It is easy to talk only about the part of the road we have yet to \ncover. As any parent knows, for some, the only question is, ``Are we \nthere yet?''\n  But it would be a mistake not to also acknowledge and appreciate the \ngreat distance we have traveled.\n  For generations, we have been working to fix our broken health care \nsystem. This has been the No. 1 issue on our agenda for a long time \nnow. Throughout this year alone, we have explored numerous proposals in \nnumerous bipartisan roundtables, committee hearings and constituent \nmeetings.\n  Harry Truman recognized long ago that we must do more to make it \neasier to live a healthy life in America. Shortly after the Second \nWorld War, he lamented the fact that millions of our own lack ``a full \nmeasure of opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health.'' He knew it \nwas wrong that\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\nAmericans had no security against what he called ``the economic effects \nof sickness.''\n  Truman knew in 1945 that ``the time has arrived for action to help \nthem attain that opportunity and that protection.''\n  Senator Kennedy--the man who, more than any other, has dedicated his \nlife to our fight for fair health care--echoed Truman's call. He said:\n\n       One of the most shameful things about modern America is \n     that in our unbelievably rich land, the quality of health \n     care available to many of our people is unbelievably poor, \n     and the cost is unbelievably high.\n\n  Senator Kennedy did not give this speech last month, though it would \nhave been very timely if he had. He did not give it last year, though \nit would have been equally relevant and true. He did not even give it \nlast decade, or the decade before that.\n  It was in 1978 when Senator Kennedy decried our shameful system. Yet \nhis words and his cause are as urgent today as ever. In fact, since \nthen our need for reform has gotten significantly worse.\n  Today we are closer than ever to getting it done. But I know Senator \nKennedy agrees that it should not have taken more than 30 years for \nTruman's call to compel his echo, that it should not have taken another \n30 years for us to come as far as we have today. And I know we cannot \nafford to wait another 30 years--or even 1 more year--to act.\n  But for some, more than 60 years of work to stabilize health care for \nthose who have it and secure it for those who don't is ``rushing it.''\n  Someone who was born when Harry Truman first called for reform in \n1945, but lived his or her entire life without the ability to afford \nhealth care as it got more and more expensive every year, would today--\nfinally--be just months away from becoming eligible for Medicare. I \ndon't think that's ``rushing it.''\n  For too many, the interests of the insurance rackets still outweigh \nthe interests of the American people.\n  The difference is that those of us who know we cannot wait any longer \nknow that the American people must come first.\n  Those who oppose the reform we so desperately need like to talk about \nit in the abstract.\n  They use code words, scare tactics and sound bites. They rely on \nmisinformation--like the myth that your government wants to control \nyour health--and misrepresent the real issues.\n  But reforming health care is not about the abstract, because health \ncare isn't just theoretical. Neither is it about rhetoric or politics. \nIt is about people.\n  Unlike just about any issue we debate and discuss in this body, \nhealth care affects every single living, breathing American citizen.\n  So I find it curious that in the weeks and months we have talked \nabout health care this year, I haven't heard our opponents say a single \nword about real families with real problems--families with real \ndiseases, real medical bills and real fears.\n  This is what health care is about: It is about people like Lisa, in \nGardnerville, NV. Lisa lost her job and with it her health care. Now \nshe can't afford to take her sick daughter to the doctor to find out \nwhy she gets seizures.\n  It is about people like Braden in Sparks, NV. Braden owes a hospital \n$12,000 for a trip to the emergency room--the only place he could \nafford to go for medical care because he doesn't have health insurance.\n  It is about people like Alysia from Las Vegas, NV. Alysia has \nsuffered with a kidney disease since birth, but she can't get coverage \nbecause in the language of the insurance business, her lifelong disease \nis a preexisting condition.\n  It is about people like Steve in Henderson, NV. No health insurance \ncompany will cover Steve because he has Parkinson's disease. That \ndoesn't just mean he can't get the care he needs to help him cope with \nthis terrible illness--it also means that if Steve gets the flu, or \nbreaks his arm or needs a prescription, he can't afford any medicine or \ntreatment at all.\n  It is about people like Caleb, a high school student from outside \nReno, NV. Caleb was born without legs, and needs new pairs of \nprosthetics as he grows bigger in his teen years. But his insurance \ncompany has decided it knows better than Caleb's doctors, and has \ndecided that last year's legs will have to do.\n  When we say we are fighting for health care reform that lowers costs, \nwe aren't talking about a balance sheet--we are talking about people \nlike Lisa, Braden, Alysia, Steve and Caleb.\n  When we say we are fighting for reform that brings security and \nstability back to health care, we aren't talking about policies and \ncontracts--we are talking about people like Lisa, Braden, Alysia, Steve \nand Caleb.\n  When we say we are fighting for reform that will no longer let \ninsurance companies use preexisting conditions as an excuse to deny you \nthe coverage you need, we aren't talking about fine print--we are \ntalking about people like Lisa, Braden, Alysia, Steve and Caleb.\n  We are talking about the hundreds of thousands just like them across \nNevada, and the millions like them across the country.\n  This cannot be about politics. This must be about them.\n  Nearly half a century ago, America fearlessly confronted the most \nconfounding medical and economic issue of its day. And a former Senate \nmajority leader reminded us that we must resist the temptation to let \nthe legislation on the written page distract us from its application in \nthe real world. We were asked to look beyond policy and look instead to \nthe people it affects.\n  It was 44 years ago today--July 30--that President Johnson signed \ninto law the bill that would create the Medicare Program. And on this \nday in 1965, in Truman's hometown and with the former President at his \nside LBJ said the following:\n\n       Many men can make many proposals. Many men can draft many \n     laws. But few have the piercing and humane eye which can see \n     beyond the words to the people that they touch.\n       Few can see past the speeches and the political battles to \n     the doctor over there that is tending the infirm, and to the \n     hospital that is receiving those in anguish, or feel in their \n     heart painful wrath at the injustice which denies the miracle \n     of healing to the old and to the poor. And fewer still have \n     the courage to stake reputation, and position, and the effort \n     of a lifetime upon such a cause when there are so few that \n     share it.\n       But it is just such men who illuminate the life and the \n     history of a Nation.\n\n  Today, each of us can be that leader. We each can fulfill the vision \nof Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson--each of whom brought honor to this \nSenate chamber--and of Ted Kennedy, who still does.\n  Today, if we can each look past our partisan passions and see the \npatients, the parents, the people who need our help, we can once again \nrenew the life and history of America, and of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8547-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8547-S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on my amendment to the \nfiscal year 2010 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.\n  This amendment prevents the Department of Energy from spending \ntaxpayer dollars on companies that invest significant resources or do \nbusiness in Iran's energy sector to fill the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  Earlier this year, the Department signed contracts with energy giants \nShell, Vitol, and Glencore to add almost 17 million barrels to the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. Open source material indicates that these \nthree companies make up a majority of Iran's gasoline imports.\n  Companies that sell gasoline to Iran should not receive the support \nof the American taxpayers, and this body has now gone on record \nmultiple times opposing government contracts with companies that have \nsubstantial investment in or do business with Iran's energy sector.\n  My amendment does not penalize the Department of Energy for this \nactivity, but prevents this sort of thing from happening again. Ending \ntaxpayer support for Iran's energy sector is a commonsense step and \ncrucially important. Most major importers of gasoline to Iran have \nsubstantial ties to the U.S. Government, and unanimous adoption of my \namendment sends a clear message to those involved in Iran's energy \nsector: You can do business with us, or you can do business with Iran--\nnot both.\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\n                     Modeling and Simulation R & D\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, during yesterday's consideration of the \nfiscal year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, I \nnoted that the managers included certain report language related to \nmodeling and simulation capabilities for an unconventional fossil fuels \nprogram. I would like to ask the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee if their intent was to improve modeling and simulation for \nunconventional fossil energy technologies, by working in collaboration \nwith universities and industry to establish joint programs for research \nand development.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, that is our intent. This legislation would spur \ninnovation and improve modeling and simulation efforts.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am pleased to learn that, because the Virginia Modeling \nand Simulation Center--VMASC--at Old Dominion University has extensive \nexperience in modeling, simulation, and visualization of complex \nsystems and events. Its capabilities include a complete suite of \nvisualization software that can incorporate geospatial information with \nsimulation and analysis of energy-related systems and the impact of \nthose systems on various aspects of the environment. It also has \nextensive experience modeling critical infrastructure components of \nfossil fuel, electric and natural gas systems. VMASC has also developed \ncapabilities for modeling policy aspects of global warming that can be \nadapted specifically to fossil fuel systems, and help to identify \nunconventional oil, natural gas, and coal resources.\n  VMASC has developed capabilities to model the production of \nunconventional resources using a combination of computational \ntechniques that can be adapted to simulate a wide variety of scenarios \nassociated with the fossil fuel industry and its relationship to \nenvironmental impacts.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Chairman, I worked to develop this initiative to \nincorporate a capability that the Department has failed to cultivate, \nyet offers tremendous potential to develop our domestic fossil energy \npotential. The University of Utah's Simulation and Computing Institute \nwhich has worked with both the Office of Science and NNSA computing \nprograms is a leading computing program with tremendous potential to \ncontribute to this effort. This outstanding computing capability is \ncoupled with the vast oil and gas production capabilities at the 25 \nyear-old Energy and Geoscience Institute. This organization operates on \nseven continents and shares research and technology with its 66 \ncorporate members that all have energy production experience. The goal \nof this program will be to facilitate the development of unconventional \nfossil energy resources utilizing state of the art computing simulation \nand modeling capabilities.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree that high performance computing applications are \nimportant research tools that can help lead to breakthroughs in energy \nproduction. North Dakota State University, NDSU, uses computational \nmodeling and simulations to help analyze theories and validate \nexperiments that are dangerous, expensive or impossible to conduct. \nThrough its Center for High Performance Computing, NDSU is \ncollaborating with the Department of Energy and its national \nlaboratories on a number of energy research projects.\n  The capabilities of VMASC, University of Utah, North Dakota State \nUniversity and other institutions should receive due consideration as \nthe Department of Energy executes this provision.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8548-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8548-S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXECUTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2009\n\n Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I draw the attention of the Senate to \na bill I recently introduced, S. 1529, the Executive Accountability Act \nof 2009. This legislation is similar to H.R. 473, introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives in January by Mr. Jones of North Carolina.\n  ``Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.'' That \nis Santayana's Law of Repetitive Consequences, and it is the reason I \nintroduced this legislation--that we might learn from history so that \nwe do not repeat it.\n  The Executive Accountability Act certainly addresses lessons learned \nfrom the debate leading to the Iraq conflict, but it is also a lesson \nwe should have learned, and should have corrected, as a result of \nexecutive branch actions leading to and during the Vietnam conflict, \nWorld War II, the Mexican War, the Spanish-American War and other \npoints in our history when Presidents have distorted the facts, \nwithheld critical information, or exaggerated circumstances in order to \nsway public opinion and congressional will.\n  History is replete with examples that know no partisan allegiance. \nPresidents from both parties have fallen into the trap of inflating \nfear and distorting facts, if not resorting to outright fabrication, in \norder to win approval for or justify using military force.\n  Democratic President Lyndon Johnson misled Congress during the Gulf \nof Tonkin incident in 1964, publicly announcing that a second attack \nhad occurred. On the same day, however, a naval commander in the Gulf \nof Tonkin cabled that a review of the second attack was doubtful, \ncalling for a complete evaluation before any further action was taken. \nWithout the complete facts, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution, leading the United States in to a war that ultimately took \nmore than 55,000 American lives.\n  Republican President Richard Nixon expanded the Vietnam conflict in \n1969 by authorizing bombing operations in Cambodia and directing that \nthey be conducted clandestinely. Operational reports of the bombings \nwere either not made or were falsely described as having occurred over \nSouth Vietnam rather than Cambodia. A few Members of Congress were \ninformed, secretly, of the bombings, but the remainder of Congress was \ndeceived about the secret bombing campaign over a nation with which the \nUnited States was not at war.\n  Most recently, of course, another President, his Vice President, and \nother Cabinet officials, used scare-mongering tales of ``smoking guns'' \nand ``mushroom clouds''; of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction; \ndubious tales of mobile biological laboratories; fictional African \ntrips to buy yellowcake; and, improbable and unsupported rumors of \nalliances between dictators and terrorists to stampede a fearful nation \nand a spineless Congress into a so-called ``preemptive'' invasion of \nanother sovereign nation.\n  President Abraham Lincoln, an opponent of the Mexican-American War \nduring his service in the House of Representatives, well understood the \ndangers of preemptive war and the need for the constitutional check on \nexecutive power inherent in the requirement for a congressional \ndeclaration of war or an authorization to use military force. Lincoln \ncondemned President Polk for driving the U.S. into war with Mexico by \nputting U.S. forces in danger on disputed territory. Polk then inflamed \npublic and congressional anger by asserting that Mexican soldiers had \nshed U.S. blood on U.S. soil. Lincoln explained his concerns with his \nusual eloquence:\n\n       Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, \n     whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and \n     you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to say he \n     deems it necessary for such purpose--and you allow him to \n     make war at pleasure. Study to see if you can fix any limit \n     to his power in this respect, after you have given him so \n     much as you propose. If, today, he should choose to say he \n     thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British \n     from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, \n     ``I see no probability of the British invading us,'' but he \n     will say to you, ``be silent; I see it, if you don't.''\n\n  Lincoln went on to say,\n\n       The provision in the Constitution giving the war-making \n     power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the \n     following reasons. Kings had always been involving and \n     impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if \n     not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, \n     our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all \n     Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to frame the \n     Constitution that no one man should hold the power of \n     bringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the \n     whole matter, and places our President where kings have \n     always stood.\n\n  Lincoln's insight considered preemptive wars only against neighbors. \nOne can only imagine what he would think of the global reach that the \ncurrent military might of the United States\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\ngives to an unfettered executive. One can only wonder if Lincoln would \nthink the ``good of the people'' has been served by a war that has \nclimbed to more than $845 billion in direct costs, with a total cost to \nthe U.S. economy estimated by some to be more than $3 trillion. What \ngood has been served that is worth the more than 4,000 U.S. combat \ndeaths and more than 31,000 U.S. casualties?\n  S. 1529 is a simple piece of legislation that applies only in the \nmost limited but most important intergovernmental communications--the \nwarmaking power. It prohibits the President, Vice President, and other \nexecutive branch officials from deliberately misleading Congress in an \neffort to persuade the Congress to authorize the use of force by the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  Officials are not prohibited from being wrong or having incomplete \nfacts, but they may not knowingly and willfully falsify, conceal, or \ncover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make any \nmaterially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or \nrepresentation. They may not make or use any false writing or document \nthat they know to contain any materially false, fictitious, or \nfraudulent statement. If the Congress finds that it has been deceived \nor lied to, the official can be referred to the Attorney General by \neither House of Congress for investigation and judicial action, if \nwarranted.\n  The Executive Accountability Act is limited to executive branch \nofficials only, and only with regard to lying to Congress and only \nabout decisions on the use of force. Therefore, its penalties are \nunlikely to inhibit the normal flow of intergovernmental communications \nby creating a fear that any statement made before Congress might result \nin the threat of prosecution.\n  To those who say that there are already laws that prohibit \nindividuals from making false statements to Congress, rendering the \nExecutive Accountability Act unnecessary, I urge them to read the \nhistory of the False Statements Act, section 1001 of Title 18, U.S. \nCode.\n  In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled in Hubbard v. United States that \nsection 1001 covered only false statements made to the executive \nbranch, not to the judiciary or to Congress. Congress then moved to \nreverse the ruling by legislating changes to section 1001 in 1996. \nHowever, that bill, as enacted, applies only to administrative matters \nwithin Congress and any investigation or review conducted pursuant to \nthe authority of any committee, subcommittee, commission or office of \nthe Congress.\n  The Executive Accountability Act clarifies the requirement for honest \ntestimony and discussion with the Congress about the most important \nquestion debated by Congress and provided by the most authoritative \nofficials of the government.\n  The Framers were absolutely clear about the warmaking power: they \ngave the President the authority to lead troops after war was declared \nand to repel invasions of the United States, but only the Congress \ncould authorize the use of force--the ability to send troops into \nbattle. The Framers were well aware of the dangers inherent in vesting \nthe warmaking decision with a single executive, having the history of \nthe world's kings and emperors as their foundation.\n  Our recent history has shown us that a powerful and persuasive \nexecutive can, and too often has, used his command of the intelligence \nand information gathering and dispensing functions of government to \npaint a distorted picture designed to frighten and sway Congress into \nceding even more power to him. Presidents of all political parties have \nshown themselves to be equally susceptible to the lure of absolute \npower, making the Executive Accountability Act a non-partisan solution \nto a deep-seated problem.\n  S. 1529 restores balance to the system of checks and balances by \nreinforcing the role of Congress in decisions to use force. Congress \ndoes not have millions of civil servants working for it. It does not \nhave its own intelligence community or its own diplomatic corps. \nCongress must rely upon the executive branch for those missions and for \nthe product of those missions. So Congress must be confident that the \ninformation it receives is complete and factual--particularly when that \ninformation is used to inform a decision to commit U.S. troops and U.S. \ntreasure to any foreign battlefield. Testimony and communications from \nthe White House and the executive branch must be reliable--not \nfictional, not distorted, not embellished, not cherry-picked for the \npurpose of supporting only the decisional outcomes desired by the \nPresident.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1529. It is not retroactive. It \nwill not reach back to affect any statements made by previous \nadministrations. We can learn from the past, make this necessary \ncorrection, and move into the future with greater assurance that the \nmost difficult and consequential decisions made by Congress--those \ninvolving the use of military force--will be made on the basis of open \nand frank discussion based on all of the facts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8549-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING ITEMS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I am honored to remember U.S. \nBorder Patrol agent Robert Rosas, who was killed in the line of duty at \nthe age of 30.\n  On July 23, 2009, Agent Rosas was shot and killed after responding to \na call in Campo, CA. Every day he placed duty ahead of his personal \nsafety while protecting our Nation's Southwest border. In spite of the \nknown dangers, Agent Rosas and thousands like him answer the call to \nservice.\n  Agent Robert Rosas was born and raised in El Centro, a border city in \nImperial County. He joined the U.S. Border Patrol in May 2006, and was \nassigned to the Campo Station in the San Diego sector. Agent Rosas was \nalso a reserve officer for the El Centro Police Department, known as an \noutstanding officer and a positive role model in the community.\n  Agent Rosas is survived by his wife Rosalie, a son, Robert, age 2, \nand a daughter, Kayla Alisa, 11 months.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Rosalie, Robert, and Kayla Alisa \nRosas at this tragic time. They have lost a husband and father. I also \nsend my deepest condolences to Agent Rosas' colleagues in the Border \nPatrol service. Theirs is a difficult and too often dangerous job. I \ncommend their service, protecting our Nation, and our people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8550-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING DR. GARY V. WHETSTONE\n\n Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Dr. Gary V. \nWhetstone, the senior pastor and founder of Victory Christian \nFellowship and of Gary Whetstone Worldwide Ministries. He is a \nDelawarean who, over the past quarter century, has touched the lives of \nthousands through his proactive and inspirational ministry.\n  This week marks the 25th anniversary of Pastor Whetstone's ministry, \nand it will be celebrated in Wilmington this Thursday through Sunday at \nthe Riverfront Center. The festivities will include renowned gospel \npreachers, including T.D. Jakes, Donnie McClurkin, Martha Munizzi, and \nRod Parsley.\n  A man of great charity, Pastor Whetstone established over 85 outreach \nministries throughout Delaware and the surrounding area. This includes \nthe very successful ``Blessings, Dressings, and More'' program, begun \nmore than a decade ago, which serves over 2,500 Delawareans in need \nwith food and clothing each week.\n  His work with victims of HIV/AIDS, substance and alcohol abuse, and \nthe incarcerated are testament to his mission to improve lives.\n  His hands-on approach to ministry has not stopped at the State line. \nInternationally, Pastor Whetstone has founded over 400 Bible schools in \ncountries as far and varied as Ireland, Nigeria, and India. His vision \nto spread the teachings of his faith across the globe has undoubtedly \nbeen furthered by his comprehensive Bible learning programs.\n  Pastor Whetstone recently presented ``Murder What's Next,'' an \noriginal dramatic production that teaches about effects on children of \nbeing raised in a fatherless home. This show, with its large cast and \nprofessional quality, delivers a powerful message about the benefits of \ninvolved fathers and of a strong spiritual foundation. Over the past 2 \nyears, the production has been seen by over 35,000 people and has \nreceived local and national acclaim, including from the premiere \nChristian periodical, Charisma Magazine.\n  I am proud to offer Dr. Gary V. Whetstone my congratulations on the \n25th anniversary of his ministry. I also wish him and his wife, Pastor \nFaye Whetstone, all the best as they continue in their noble \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8550-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8550-S8551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING COUNTY SUPER SPUDS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, residents in Aroostook \nCounty took part in the 62nd Annual Maine Potato Blossom Festival, a \nweeklong celebration of the indispensible role agriculture has played \nin Northern Maine's economy. Indeed, early in the 20th century, \nNorthern Maine was known as the Potato Capital of America. While the \ntimes have changed and varieties of crops have expanded, potato farming \nremains a prevalent way of life in rural Aroostook County. With this in \nmind, I wish to recognize a fifth-generation family-owned small potato \ncompany from Mars Hill, County Super Spuds, whose owners, the McCrum \nfamily, have been harvesting potatoes in Northern Maine since the mid-\n1880s.\n  It was Lemuel McCrum who, in 1886, moved across the border from New \nBrunswick, Canada, to the small town of Mars Hill in order to establish \na future for his family in potato farming. Lemuel and his wife Ada had \n14 children, teaching them the value of good stewardship of the land \nand work ethic, thus ensuring that future McCrums would harvest \nbountiful crops on the same land. In the 1960s, Dana McCrum, a member \nof the family's third generation, moved to a new location in Mars Hill, \nwhere County Super Spuds has been situated ever since. The fourth \ngeneration of McCrums Jay and David began their farming in the early \n1970s, and they were joined by their sister's husband, Bobby Lunney, in \n1981. By 2004, the family's fifth generation, Jay's sons, Darrell and \nWade, and David's sons, Nicholas and Jonathan, began cultivating their \nown futures at County Super Spuds.\n  Since its founding, County Super Spuds has grown into a thriving \nbusiness that now encompasses three subsidiaries: JDR Transport, a \nfamily trucking firm launched in 1992; Penobscot McCrum, LLC, a potato \nprocessing plant in Belfast that supplies spuds to customers and \nrestaurants around the world; and Sunday River Farms, a 500-acre \nfarming operation in Rumford Point. McCrum family members all operate \nand manage these firms, which stretch across the State of Maine. \nAdditionally, the McCrum principle of seeking and finding resolutions \nto issues of quality assurance with their crops was epitomized by their \ndecision in 2006 to begin utilizing a new GPS system. This technique \nassists the McCrums in accurate equipment placement within its fields \nin order to maintain the highest quality product for the Nation's \ndinner tables.\n  A proud family with a rich tradition of potato farming, the McCrums \nhave been lauded with prestigious awards on numerous occasions. Jay \nMcCrum was named Young Farmer of the Year in 1986 by the Maine Potato \nBoard, the State's foremost advocate for the potato industry, and a \ndecade later was also named as the Farmer of the Year. And in 2001, \nCounty Super Spuds received the Maine Potato Board's highest honor, as \nthey were recognized as the Farm Family of the Year. These awards \nexemplify that this family has been and continues to be an example of \nthe dedication and determination of the McCrum spirit to succeed within \nthis prestigious profession through every season and every economic and \nenvironmental trial and tribulation.\n  However, many across Maine, and indeed the Nation, may know County\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\nSuper Spuds best for its most recent work. The company was one of five \npotato growers selected from farms across the Nation by FritoLay to \nstar in a nationwide advertising campaign for Lay's Potato Chips, \nincluding television and print media, as well as on-pack and in-store \ndisplays. In fact, County Super Spuds has been working with Lay's for \n23 years, and in that time, the firm has sold approximately 2,300 \ntrailer loads of its delicious potatoes to FritoLay. In the television \nadvertisement, Darrell McCrum, manager for the company's Northern Maine \nFarm Operations, states that, ``We grow potatoes in New England, and \nLay's makes potato chips in New England, so that's a pretty good fit.'' \nAs part of the ad campaign's rollout, Darrell was invited to New York \nCity in mid-May to join the four other farmers and ring the opening \nbell at the New York Stock Exchange. This was a well-placed honor for a \ntruly distinguished family-owned business with such deep roots in the \nlocal community. He simultaneously discusses a photograph showing \nnearly two dozen family members, once again showcasing that Lemuel and \nAda McCrum planted their feet firmly in Aroostook County in 1886 with \nhigh hopes for their future and their family and over 12 decades later \na legacy of 5 generations stand firmly on the foundation they built.\n  With annual growth of between 11 and 18 percent in recent years, \nCounty Super Spuds and the McCrum family have certainly made a positive \nimpact not only within the Maine economy but across this Nation. Their \nhigh business acumen and work ethic have distinguished them as a \nprofitable and trusted company. As the McCrum family continues in the \nfootsteps of their forefathers, they remain an invaluable asset in one \nof Maine's most prestigious and vital industries. I congratulate the \nMcCrums and everyone at County Super Spuds for their work to promote \nMaine potatoes across the country, and I wish them continued success in \nthe decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8551-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \nRESPECT TO THE ACTIONS OF CERTAIN PERSONS TO UNDERMINE THE SOVEREIGNTY \n     OF LEBANON OR ITS DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND INSTITUTIONS--PM 28\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo The Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Despite some \npositive developments in the past year, including the establishment of \ndiplomatic relations and an exchange of ambassadors between Lebanon and \nSyria, the actions of certain persons continue to contribute to \npolitical and economic instability in Lebanon and the region and \nconstitute a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the \nnational security and foreign policy of the United States.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to maintain the \n     private, dual charter banking system as well as to preserve \n     the thrift charter and mutuality; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 114\n\n       Whereas, the United States currently uses a dual banking \n     system that allows FDIC insured financial institutions to \n     choose between state and federal bank charters and multiple \n     regulators when organizing their business; and\n       Whereas, the architecture of this dual banking system has \n     been developed over a long period of time, adapted to \n     changing markets, needs and innovations at the national and \n     state level, and has proven remarkably efficient and \n     effective; and\n       Whereas, FDIC insured banks and thrifts in Louisiana are \n     safe and strong, highly regulated, and have not experienced \n     many of the issues being encountered in the financial \n     services industry at the national level; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana banks and thrifts have remained true to \n     their core business and have greatly outperformed their \n     United States counterparts as a whole, especially in the \n     areas of loan growth, deposit growth, and asset growth; and\n       Whereas, many of the problems experienced in the financial \n     services industry at the national level were the result of \n     unsound lending practices by loosely regulated, non-FDIC \n     insured institutions; and\n       Whereas, as a result of the problems experienced by the \n     financial services industry at the national level and in the \n     economy as a whole, Congress has and will continue to explore \n     ways to restructure the financial services industry; and\n       Whereas, in 2008 the United States Department of the \n     Treasury proposed, under its ``Blueprint for a Modernized \n     Financial Regulatory Structure,'' ending the dual banking \n     system by requiring all state chartered banks and state and \n     federally chartered thrifts to convert to federally chartered \n     banks, thereby eliminating the state bank and thrift charters \n     entirely; and\n       Whereas, eliminating the dual charter banking system would \n     require a large percentage of Louisiana banks and thrifts to \n     change charters, thereby reducing regulator options and \n     forcing many financial institutions to accept a federal \n     regulator that may not have the same familiarity, as a state \n     regulator, with the specific needs of a particular financial \n     institution or with the local banking environment; and\n       Whereas, abolishing remarkably efficient state banking \n     regulatory regimes in favor of one, consolidated federal \n     regulator just does not make sense when federal oversight of \n     Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs), such as Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac, and Wall Street investment firms have proven to \n     be an utter failure; and\n       Whereas, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) regulates \n     federally chartered thrift institutions; and\n       Whereas, the idea of eliminating the OTS has also been \n     discussed as part of regulatory restructuring of the \n     financial services industry; and\n       Whereas, eliminating OTS would serve to eliminate charter \n     and regulator choice for thrifts operating in Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, some thrifts operating in Louisiana organize as \n     mutual institutions, whereby the depositors are also the \n     owners of the institution; and\n       Whereas, a financial institution's ability to organize as a \n     mutual institution should be preserved by Congress. \n     THEREFORE, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to take such actions as are \n     necessary to maintain the private, dual charter banking \n     system as well as to preserve the thrift charter and \n     mutuality; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-70. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana memorializing Congress to protect Louisiana \n     consumers and competition by opposing efforts to interfere \n     with free markets in order to artificially regulate payment \n     system interchange fees; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 145\n\n       Whereas, credit and debit cards are held and used by tens \n     of millions of Americans; and\n       Whereas, the development of the electronic payment card \n     system in the competitive environment has benefitted \n     consumers, merchants, and the United States economy; and\n       Whereas, the current payment card system has greatly \n     enhanced consumer convenience, merchant sales, and overall \n     commerce in Louisiana and in this country; and\n       Whereas, interchange fees paid by merchants for use of the \n     payment card system help defray the extensive infrastructure \n     costs, increasing fraud losses, and nonpayment possibility \n     that are assumed by Louisiana financial institutions involved \n     in the payment card system; and\n       Whereas, for merchants, interchange fees are a legitimate \n     cost of doing business that entitle them to all of the \n     benefits they receive from the payment card system, including \n     fast and guaranteed payment while bearing little, if any, \n     risk; and\n       Whereas, consumers and merchants are free to choose from a \n     selection of payment options to complete their transactions, \n     including cash, checks, ACH, prepaid cards, debit cards, \n     credit cards, and alternative online payment options; and\n       Whereas, merchants are free to choose not to accept credit \n     cards, debit cards, cash or checks or other payment methods; \n     and\n       Whereas, merchants are free to offer discounts or \n     incentives for the use of cash and checks; and\n       Whereas, merchant groups have had various interchange fee \n     proposals introduced in Congress in an attempt to shift their \n     legitimate costs of doing business and to pass such costs on \n     to consumers and financial institutions; and\n       Whereas, such proposals would seriously disrupt the proper \n     functioning of our nation's electronic payment system to the \n     detriment of consumers, businesses, and the broader economy; \n     and\n       Whereas, one such merchant proposal that recently failed in \n     Congress would have created a new federal bureaucracy that \n     had the ability to price fix interchange fees paid by \n     merchants to financial institutions for access to the payment \n     card system; and\n       Whereas, consumers could be harmed if the protection of \n     antitrust laws were removed to allow for anti-competitive \n     behavior in connection with negotiation of payment card \n     acceptance and interchange fees; and\n       Whereas, government imposed price controls on the payment \n     system would make many Louisiana financial institutions less \n     competitive and potentially make them unable to afford \n     issuing payment cards to Louisiana customers, thereby likely \n     decreasing competition and increasing the cost of obtaining \n     credit for consumers; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Justice has \n     strongly warned that antitrust exemptions should be strongly \n     disfavored by Congress, and cautioned that strong antitrust \n     laws are critical to promoting and protecting consumer \n     welfare; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to protect Louisiana \n     consumers and competition by opposing efforts to interfere \n     with free markets in order to artificially regulate payment \n     system interchange fees; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-71. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Texas \n     urging Congress to enact legislation facilitating the ability \n     of cities to access appropriate financing for critically \n     needed municipal projects; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 1085\n\n       Whereas, Deteriorating conditions in the credit markets \n     have severely diminished the ability of cities to access \n     traditional sources of funding for projects that meet \n     critical local needs; consequently, many municipal projects \n     today are in jeopardy or are being delayed, with prospects \n     for their future realization highly uncertain; and\n       Whereas, Municipal projects provide important, effective \n     economic stimulus and are worthy of partnership with the \n     federal government; civic projects instantly create and\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\n     cause the retention of multiple thousands of jobs in many \n     different industries; city projects often include \n     partnerships with the private sector that create a leveraging \n     of mutual interests and maximum economic benefit for the \n     greater community; many city projects are transit oriented, \n     which spurs additional economic benefit; moreover, when \n     projects involve the enhancement or development of public \n     mass transit, they result in reduced highway congestion, \n     reduced air pollution, and reduced dependence on foreign oil; \n     and\n       Whereas, Projects supported by municipal bonds are vetted \n     locally, approved in elections by local voters, and \n     administered locally, conditions that promote the highest \n     level of transparency and accountability; and\n       Whereas, Recently passed amendments to the Troubled Assets \n     Relief Program (TARP) legislation that are contained in H.R. \n     384, Section 402, clarify the authority of the U.S. Treasury \n     regarding municipal securities; exercising the authority to \n     directly purchase such bonds, and/or provide credit \n     enhancements for them, would provide an opportunity to \n     realize immediate, significant contributions to our economic \n     recovery; and\n       Whereas, Directly purchasing municipal securities at \n     appropriate interest rates, or providing credit enhancements \n     that allow cities access to traditional market interest rates \n     for bonds, would give the federal government the opportunity \n     to be repaid, with interest, the entire sum it furnishes \n     through the partnership; in addition, providing this relief \n     in the municipal credit markets would result in a significant \n     tax reduction for local taxpayers in the form of dramatically \n     reduced publicly funded interest costs; and\n       Whereas, Working together to construct an efficient \n     application of the authorization provided in H.R. 384, \n     Section 402, would greatly enhance our country's progress \n     toward economic recovery; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 81st \n     Texas Legislature hereby respectfully urge the United States \n     Congress to enact legislation facilitating the ability of \n     cities to access appropriate financing for critically needed \n     municipal projects; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk of the house forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-72. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Texas \n     expressing opposition to any federal legislation that would \n     create an optional federal charter for insurers; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 798\n\n       Whereas, For more than 150 years, state insurance \n     regulators have provided effective consumer protection and \n     industry oversight; some members of the United States \n     Congress, however, have proposed to undermine this time-\n     tested regulatory system by allowing insurance companies to \n     opt out of state oversight and into a new federal system of \n     chartering, licensing, regulation, and supervision; and\n       Whereas, State lawmakers have a unique understanding of the \n     needs of their constituents and of the specific conditions \n     and characteristics that apply in their insurance \n     marketplace; they are able to assess and respond to changing \n     circumstances specific to their states with appropriate \n     modifications to regulations; and\n       Whereas, A federal charter system would permit companies to \n     circumvent carefully crafted consumer protection laws and \n     strong solvency requirements that have been put in place by \n     individual states; proponents of such a federal system have \n     cited the recent collapse of the American International Group \n     as justification for a federal charter, but in fact, the \n     insurance subsidiaries of AIG that are regulated at the state \n     level have generally retained their value while federal \n     oversight failed to prevent the meltdown of the parent \n     company; and\n       Whereas, Given the faltering economy, it is more important \n     than ever for state officials to exercise strong oversight of \n     the insurance industry for the benefit of consumers and to \n     maintain the stability of insurance companies; moreover, \n     premium taxes on insurance are a significant source of \n     revenue for the general funds of all states, providing more \n     than two percent of state tax revenues according to the \n     United States Census; experts estimate that an optional \n     federal charter could eventually draw away from the states \n     more than $14 billion in premium taxes and fees; and\n       Whereas, The bifurcation of the insurance regulation system \n     is unnecessary and likely to promote confusion, ambiguity, \n     and fragmentation; it would create an expensive new federal \n     bureaucracy that would inevitably be less nimble and \n     responsive than state regulatory systems, while weakening the \n     ability of the states to protect the interests of their \n     residents; the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 affirmed the \n     role of states as principal regulators of insurance, and \n     there is no compelling reason to make a change in the \n     regulatory rights and responsibilities of the states: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 81st \n     Texas Legislature hereby express its opposition to any \n     federal legislation that would create an optional federal \n     charter for insurers; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk of the Texas House of \n     Representatives forward official copies of this resolution to \n     the president of the United States, to the speaker of the \n     house of representatives and the president of the senate of \n     the United States Congress, to the members of the U.S. House \n     Financial Services Committee, to the members of the U.S. \n     House Banking Committee, to the U.S. secretary of the \n     treasury, and to all members of the Texas delegation to \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       P0M-73. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana memorializing Congress to consider \n     appropriate legislation that would require the Federal \n     Communications Commission to prescribe auditory volume \n     standards for commercial advertisements broadcast on \n     television; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 106\n\n       Whereas, network television plays a prevalent part in \n     society and, to retain that competitive edge amongst the \n     plethora of digital media and other telecommunication \n     advancements, must be sensitive to consumer preference and \n     choice; and\n       Whereas, commercial advertisers spend millions of dollars \n     annually to purchase brief intervals of broadcast time in \n     which to promote the purchase of their products and to \n     influence consumer behavior in a positive manner; and\n       Whereas, to capitalize on these fleeting and costly time \n     periods, many advertisers resort to an excessive increase in \n     the decibel level of commercials during a telecast in \n     comparison to the programming in which each advertisement is \n     embedded, all in an effort to grab the attention of the \n     viewer and to market the product; and\n       Whereas, these erratic, excessive volume levels sometimes \n     have an adverse effect on the well-being of consumers and \n     often have a negative effect on consumer behavior, purchasing \n     decisions, and viewing preferences; and\n       Whereas, proposed legislation introduced in the 111th \n     Congress for 2009-2010, H.R. 1084: Commercial Advertisement \n     Loudness Mitigation Act (CALM), referred to the House \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, addresses this \n     controversial issue; and\n       Whereas, implementation of CALM would order the Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC), to create and to enforce \n     governmental regulations that require that the volume level \n     of commercials on television is broadcast at an equal \n     auditory level as the programming in which it is embedded; \n     and\n       Whereas, commercial advertisement makes the entertainment \n     and information of over-the-air free television possible, \n     offers a myriad of products and services to public view, and \n     sustains mass communication as an integral part of market-\n     driven economics; and\n       Whereas, control of decibel levels for advertisements \n     broadcast over commercial airwaves falls within the purview \n     of federal regulation, and that control is essential to the \n     comfort and sensibilities of the viewing public: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to consider appropriate \n     legislation that would require the Federal Communications \n     Commission to regulate auditory volume standards for \n     commercial advertisements broadcast on television; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-74. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging and requesting support and \n     assistance in providing funding for the Wood to Electricity \n     Program; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 49\n\n       Whereas, the major focus of the Wood Products Development \n     Foundation is the expansion or development of new uses of \n     wood and wood waste products that result in a positive impact \n     on the economic conditions of the state; and\n       Whereas, the timber industry has experienced a serious \n     decline in recent years, and this downturn will continue \n     unless new use sources are developed in the immediate future; \n     and\n       Whereas, after studying numerous potential industries, the \n     foundation determined a project that used wood and wood waste \n     products to create electricity would be the most economically \n     viable expansion of raw wood products for the long term; and\n       Whereas, the use and need for electricity will continue to \n     increase, and these projects will provide a renewable, green \n     source of electric power that does not affect the nation's \n     food supply or demand for food-based agricultural products \n     and materials for an indefinite period; and\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\n       Whereas, these wood to electricity projects provide an \n     additional market for raw wood products even in a distressed \n     market, provide an additional source of electricity at a \n     market rate that is carbon neutral, and provide a dedicated \n     electrical source available locally to supply viable defense \n     structures and critical facilities in times of natural \n     disasters; and\n       Whereas, the foundation has completed plans for two \n     centrally located plants within the state that will use wood \n     waste products from wood producers in the vicinity; and\n       Whereas, the electrical production will be made equally \n     available to wood-related industries and a grid for the \n     benefit of low-income households within reasonable vicinity \n     of the plant sites; and\n       Whereas, the two proposed projects will inject sixty \n     million dollars into the economy in terms of construction and \n     start-up costs and will create a minimum of thirty permanent \n     full-time jobs at the plant sites and approximately one \n     hundred jobs for suppliers of the wood fuel feedstock; and\n       Whereas, in the last several months, significant regional \n     job losses in the wood industry make this effort even more \n     vital to securing new alternatives for value-added market \n     activity related to the wood resources of the state; and\n       Whereas, there is a current need for additional funding to \n     complete the necessary regulatory, environmental, \n     engineering, and administrative functions to fulfill the \n     requirements for construction loan approvals: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the Louisiana congressional delegation, the \n     governor, the Department of Economic Development, the \n     Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Public \n     Service Commission to assist in providing funding for any \n     necessary additional requirements, documentation, or studies \n     that may be needed to secure long-term funding, and to assist \n     in developing state and federal policies for wood to \n     electricity projects that put them on a commensurate funding \n     and taxation level with wind and solar generated electricity; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the Louisiana congressional delegation, the governor, the \n     Department of Economic Development, the Department of \n     Agriculture and Forestry, and the Public Service Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       P0M-75. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana memorializing Congress to support the \n     American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 158\n\n       Whereas, a federally mandated energy efficiency and \n     renewable energy standard for utilities is currently being \n     debated in Congress; and\n       Whereas, federal standards for the regulation of climate \n     change gases, primarily carbon dioxide, are also being \n     actively debated in Congress; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's coast is comprised of forty percent of \n     the nation's coastal wetlands and it recognizes the \n     importance of coordinated and effective actions to reduce the \n     emissions of climate change gases; and\n       Whereas, in areas of the country with limited wind and \n     hydroelectric resources, renewable energy standards, if \n     improperly implemented, can have significant adverse impacts \n     on non-participating ratepayers; and\n       Whereas, renewable energy resources that are non-\n     dispatchable and non-reliable do not reduce capacity \n     requirements of utilities and thus present an undue adverse \n     impact on non-participating ratepayers; and\n       Whereas, energy efficiency can produce energy and demand \n     savings for a fraction of the cost of most forms of renewable \n     energy; and\n       Whereas, renewable portfolio standards are traditionally \n     based solely on electrical energy production; and\n       Whereas, in air conditioning-dominated climates, electrical \n     energy usage is a much larger component of total energy use \n     compared to heating dominated climates; and\n       Whereas, heating energy sources such as heating oil pose \n     both environmental and national security risks as they \n     contribute to air pollution emissions and increased oil \n     imports: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to support the \n     American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the Louisiana congressional delegation to \n     take appropriate action to insure the following:\n       (1) Any federally mandated renewable portfolio standard \n     contain provisions whereby states with limited, currently \n     available, affordable renewable energy resources, such as \n     Louisiana, be allowed to utilize verifiable energy efficiency \n     improvements to existing loads to meet a minimum of sixty \n     percent of any such standard.\n       (2) That the state be allowed to set up a mechanism whereby \n     Louisiana utility companies taking action in advance of the \n     imposition of the standard be allowed to bank any energy \n     efficiency savings and renewable energy production achieved \n     in order to help meet the requirements under any such \n     standard.\n       (3) That tax credits and rebates offered by the state of \n     Louisiana or any local jurisdiction within the state be \n     declared by the United States Internal Revenue Service to be \n     nontaxable income and will not reduce the tax credit basis of \n     any federal energy efficiency or renewable energy tax credit.\n       (4) That mandates for renewable energy production that is \n     not dispatchable and reliable be limited to no more than ten \n     percent of the required production standard.\n       (5) That any energy efficiency and renewable energy \n     standard be based on a percentage of total energy \n     consumption, not just electrical energy consumption, \n     regardless of how it is implemented and collected; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and to each \n     member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-76. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana memorializing Congress to review and \n     consider eliminating provisions of federal law which reduce \n     Social Security benefits for those receiving pension benefits \n     from federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension systems, plans, or funds; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 32\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor Social Security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned Social \n     Security benefit for any person who also receives a federal, \n     state, or local retirement or pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a person who \n     had worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of Congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security: and\n       Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and the WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, because the Social Security benefit statements do \n     not calculate the GPO and the WEP, many public employees in \n     Louisiana are unaware that their expected Social Security \n     benefits shown on such statements will he significantly lower \n     or nonexistent due to the service in public employment \n     through which they are required to be members of a Louisiana \n     public retirement or pension system, plan, or fund; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation and the longer \n     life expectancy of women; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     GPO and the WEP Social Security benefit reductions and to \n     consider eliminating or reducing them by enacting the Social \n     Security Fairness Act of 2009 (H.R. 235 or R.S. 484) or a \n     similar instrument; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8556-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8556-S8557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs, without amendment:\n       H.R. 774.

A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and \ntitle 5, United States Code, to provide leave for family members of \nmembers of regular components of the Armed Forces, and leave to care \nfor covered veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Supporting \nMilitary Families Act of 2009.\n  The sacrifices made by our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and \nCoast Guard are matched only by those made by their families. When a \nloved one is serving abroad, and in cases where he or she returns \nwounded, it can take an immense emotional toll on a family.\n  But it does not have to take an equally staggering economic toll.\n  The bill I introduce today clarifies and improves upon provisions \nincluded in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008, which \nprovided important benefits for family members of our brave service men \nand women.\n  More than 20 years ago, I began the effort to bring job protection to \nhard-working Americans so they wouldn't have to choose between the \nfamily they love and the job they need. This effort, after more than \nseven years, three presidents, and two vetoes, eventually led to the \nenactment of the Family Medical Leave Act, FMLA, which provides 12 \nweeks of unpaid leave for eligible employees so they may care for a \nnewborn or adopted child, their own serious illness, or that of a loved \none. Since its passage, I have worked to expand this Act to cover more \nworkers and to provide for paid leave, so that more employees can \nafford to take leave when necessary.\n  We must also ensure that we care for the health and well-being of our \nwar heroes, many of whom return from deployment with serious injuries \nand illnesses. Two years ago, I introduced legislation to provide up to \n6 months of FMLA leave for primary caregivers of servicemembers who \nsuffer from a combat-related injury or illness. The FMLA currently \nprovides three months of unpaid leave to a spouse, parent, or child \nacting as a caregiver for a person with a serious illness. However, \nsome of those injured in service to our country rely on other family \nmembers or friends to care for them as they recover, and many of these \ninjuries take longer than 3 months to heal from. That is why, following \na recommendation of the President's Commission on Care for America's \nReturning Wounded Warriors, headed by former Senator Bob Dole and \nformer Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, I offered \nthis legislation. It was included in the 2008 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, along with another provision providing exigency \nleave for servicemembers' families, which allows the families of \ndeployed servicemembers to take leave to manage their family or \npersonal affairs.\n  These two provisions were important steps toward giving our \nservicemembers and their families the support they need during \nextremely challenging times. The legislation I introduce today builds \non those efforts and will accomplish three things. First, a number of \nservice-related illnesses and injuries may not manifest themselves \nuntil after a servicemember has left the military, including traumatic \nbrain injury and post traumatic stress disorder. This bill extends the \nannual 26 weeks of unpaid leave to family members of veterans for up to \nfive years after a veteran leaves service, if the\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\nveteran develops a service-related serious injury or illness that he or \nshe needs time to recover from. Second, this legislation extends \neligibility for exigency leave to those deployed to a foreign country, \nand not only in support of a contingency operation, in order to provide \nthe benefit to all of those families who struggle with the challenges \nof a deployment. Finally, the DOL regulations limited access to \nexigency leave to Reserve and National Guard members only. This was not \nthe intent of the initial legislation, and this bill extends exigency \nleave to cover all active duty members who are deployed to a foreign \ncountry.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues Senators Kennedy, Lieberman, and \nMurray are joining me in introducing the Supporting Military Families \nAct of 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n        Kerry, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1547. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, and the United \nStates Housing Act of 1937 to enhance and expand the assistance \nprovided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to homeless veterans and veterans at risk \nof homelessness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Zero Tolerance for \nVeteran Homelessness Act. This comprehensive bill enhances and expands \nthe assistance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to homeless veterans and \nveterans at risk of becoming homeless.\n  It is one of our Nation's great tragedies that on any given night, \n131,000 veterans are homeless. The Department of Veterans Affairs \nestimates that more than 200,000 veterans experience homelessness each \nyear and that nearly 1/5 of all homeless people in the United States \nare veterans. These numbers are expected to climb as our servicemembers \nfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan return home to face tough economic \nconditions.\n  We know that veterans are often at greater risk of becoming homeless. \nSome return from deployments to discover that the skills they have \nhoned in their military service can be difficult to transfer to jobs in \nthe private sector. Others struggle with physical or mental wounds of \nwar. Still others return to communities that lack safe, affordable \nhousing.\n  Our veterans have made great sacrifices to serve our country, and it \nis especially important to honor our commitment to them. The Department \nof Veterans Affairs is certainly a part of that commitment, providing \nbenefits, medical care, support, and a sense of community to homeless \nveterans. However, a number of other federal agencies provide service \nto veterans, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nand this legislation builds on that existing infrastructure.\n  Many programs through HUD and the VA are already helping homeless \nveterans with transitional housing, health care and rehabilitation \nservices, and employment assistance. However, a more comprehensive and \ncoordinated approach would strengthen these programs and prevent more \nat-risk veterans from becoming homeless.\n  That is why I have joined with my colleagues Senators Bond, Murray, \nand Johnson to introduce this much-needed legislation. The Zero \nTolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act seeks to merge housing programs \nand support services for veterans from the start so that there is an \nintegrated approach to address their risk of homelessness.\n  First, this bill would create a new Homelessness Prevention program \nthat would enable the VA to keep at-risk veterans in stable housing and \noffer increased assistance to veterans who have fallen into \nhomelessness. Specifically, the VA could provide short-term rental \nassistance, housing relocation and stabilization services, services to \nresolve personal credit issues, payments for security deposits or \nutility costs, and assistance for moving costs. These up-front expenses \ncan be the major obstacle that puts low-income or unemployed veterans \nat risk of becoming homeless. These homelessness prevention and rapid \nre-housing techniques have been successfully used in numerous \ncommunities to significantly reduce family homelessness, and this bill \nwould give the VA resources to put these strategies into practice.\n  Second, this bill would authorize additional housing vouchers through \nthe HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing, VASH, program. This \ncollaborative program provides homeless veterans with vouchers to rent \napartments in the private rental market, as well as case management and \nclinical services at local VA medical centers. In this way, veterans \nreceive the supportive housing they need to recover and thrive.\n  The HUD-VASH program has grown in recent years. Twenty thousand \nvouchers were funded in the last two appropriations cycles, and 10,000 \nmore will likely be funded-in Fiscal Year 2010. However, more homeless \nveterans could benefit from this important resource. As such, the Zero \nTolerance for Veterans Homelessness bill authorizes up to 10,000 \nadditional vouchers each year to reach a maximum of 60,000 vouchers by \n2013.\n  Third, this legislation would make it easier for non-profits to apply \nfor capital grants through the VA's grants and per diem program to \nbuild transitional housing and other facilities for veterans. This \nwould streamline the process for non-profit organizations to be able to \nuse financing from other sources to break ground on new housing \nconstruction. This is particularly important in the current economy, \nwhen non-profits are stretched and have to be more creative than ever \nto fund new capital projects.\n  The Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act would also create a \nSpecial Assistant for Veterans Affairs within HUD. The Special \nAssistant would ensure that veterans have access to HUD's existing \nprograms and work to remove any barriers. The Special Assistant would \nalso serve as a liaison between HUD and the VA, helping to connect and \ncoordinate the services the two departments provide.\n  Additionally, this legislation recognizes the need to measure \nprogress of efforts to combat homelessness. It establishes a new \nHomeless Veterans Management Information System, to be developed by the \nVA, in consultation with HUD and the United States Interagency Council \non Homelessness. This data collection system will be used to provide \nannual reports to Congress on the number of homeless veterans and they \ntypes of assistance they receive. This information will help illustrate \nhow programs are performing and inform future policy.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in \nconsultation with other agencies, to analyze existing programs and \ndevelop a comprehensive plan with recommendations on how to end \nhomelessness among veterans. Establishing a plan with appropriate \nbenchmarks will enable the VA to more easily track progress towards \nthis important goal.\n  This bipartisan bill also complements a bill that I am cosponsoring \nwith Senator Murray to enable programs at the VA and the Department of \nLabor to better serve homeless women veterans and homeless veterans \nwith children.\n  Only by working together, across the federal government and in \npartnership with non-profits and local housing authorities, will we be \nable to comprehensively help homeless veterans and reach those in \ndanger of becoming homeless. We owe it to our veterans to ensure that \nthey and their families have safe, affordable places to live and to \nprovide the services and benefits they have earned. The nation's brave \nveterans deserve nothing less.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in supporting this important, \nbipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1547\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\n       (1) veterans are at a greater risk of becoming homeless \n     than other people in the United States, because of \n     characteristics that include--\n       (A) having employment-related skills that are unique to \n     military service and that can be difficult to transfer to the \n     civilian sector;\n       (B) combat-related health issues;\n       (C) earning minimal income or being unemployed; and\n       (D) a shortage of safe, affordable housing;\n       (2) the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that--\n       (A) 131,000 veterans are homeless on any given night;\n       (B) more than 200,000 veterans experience homelessness each \n     year; and\n       (C) veterans account for nearly \\1/5\\ of all homeless \n     people in the United States;\n       (3) approximately 1,500,000 veterans, nearly 6.3 percent of \n     the veterans in the United States, have an income that falls \n     below the Federal poverty level, and approximately 634,000 \n     veterans have an income below 50 percent of the Federal \n     poverty level;\n       (4) the Department of Veterans Affairs is only adequately \n     funded to respond to the health, housing, and supportive \n     services needs of approximately \\1/3\\ of the veterans in the \n     United States; and\n       (5) it is expected that significant increases in services \n     will be needed to serve the aging veterans of the Vietnam war \n     and members of the Armed Forces returning from Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 to allow for a private civil action against a person that provides \nsubstantial assistance in violation of such Act; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I have sought recognition to urge support \nfor the legislation I just introduced, the Liability for Aiding and \nAbetting Securities Violations Act of 2009. My legislation would \noverturn two errant decisions of the Supreme Court--Central Bank of \nDenver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. 164, 1994, and \nStoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 522 \nU.S. 148, 2008, by amending the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to \nauthorize a private right of action for aiding-and-abetting liability.\n  The Act's main anti-fraud provision, Sec. 10(b), makes it ``unlawful \nfor any person, directly or indirectly,'' to commit acts of fraud ``in \nconnection with the purchase or sale of any security.'' Nearly fifty \nyears ago the Court implied a private right of action under Sec. 10(b). \nThe result was that investors could recover financial losses caused by \nviolations of 10(b) and the companion regulation issued by the SEC \ncommonly known as ``Rule 10b-5.''\n  Until Central Bank, every circuit of the Federal Court of Appeals had \nconcluded that Sec. 10(b)'s private right of action allowed recovery \nnot only against the person who directly undertook a fraudulent act--\nthe so-called primary violator--but also anyone who aided and abetted \nhim. A five-Justice majority in Central Bank, intent on narrowing \nSec. 10(b)'s scope, held that its private right of action extended only \nto primary violators.\n  When Congress debated the legislation that became the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PSLRA, then-SEC chairman \nArthur Levitt and others urged Congress to overturn Central Bank. \nCongress declined to do so. The PSLRA authorized only the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, SEC, to bring aiding-and- abetting enforcement \nlitigation.\n  It is time for us to revisit that judgment. The massive frauds \ninvolving Enron, Refco, Tyco, Worldcom, and countless other lesser-\nknown companies during the last decade have taught us that a stock \nissuer's auditors, bankers, business affiliates, and lawyers--sometimes \ncalled ``secondary actors''--all too often actively participate in and \nenable the issuer's fraud. Federal Judge Gerald Lynch recently observed \nin a decision calling on Congress to reexamine Central Bank that \nsecondary actors are sometimes ``deeply and indispensably implicated in \nwrongful conduct.'' In re Refco, Inc. Sec. Litig., 609 F. Supp. 2d. \n304, 318 n.15, S.D.N.Y.\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\n2009. Professor John Coffee of Columbia Law School, a renowned expert \non the regulation of the securities markets, has even laid much of the \nblame for the major corporate frauds of this decade on the \n``acquiescence'' of the ``outside professionals''--especially \naccountants, securities analysts, and corporate lawyers--responsible \nfor ``preparing, verifying, or certifying corporate disclosures to the \nsecurities markets.'' Coffee, ``Gatekeeper Failure and Reform: The \nChallenge of Fashioning Relevant Reforms,'' 84 Boston University Law \nReview 301, 304, 2004.\n  The immunity from suit that Central Bank confers on secondary actors \nhas removed much-needed incentives for them to avoid complicity in and \neven help prevent securities fraud, and all too often left the victims \nof fraud uncompensated for their losses. Enforcement actions by the SEC \nhave proved to be no substitute for suits by private plaintiffs. The \nSEC's litigating resources are too limited for the SEC to bring suit \nexcept in a small number of cases, and even when the SEC does bring \nsuit, it cannot recover damages for the victims of fraud.\n  Last year's decision in Stoneridge made matters still worse for \ndefrauded investors. Central Bank had at least held open the \npossibility that secondary actors who themselves undertake fraudulent \nactivities prescribed by Sec. 10(b) could be ``held liable as . . . \nprimary violator[s].'' Stoneridge has largely foreclosed that \npossibility. A divided Court held that Sec. 10(b)'s private right of \naction did not ``reach'' two vendors of a cable company that entered \ninto sham transactions with the company knowing that it would publicly \nreport the transactions in order to inflate its stock price. The Court \nconceded that the suppliers engaged in fraudulent conduct prescribed by \nSec. 10(b), but held that they were not liable in a private action \nbecause only the issuer, not they, communicated the transaction to the \npublic. That remarkable conclusion put the Court at odds with even the \nRepublican Chairman of the SEC.\n  My legislative response would take the limited, but important, step \namending of the Exchange Act to authorize a private right of action \nunder Sec. 10(b) (and other, less commonly invoked, provisions of the \nAct) against a secondary actor who provides ``substantial assistance'' \nto a person who violates Sec. 10(b). Any suit brought under my proposed \namendment would, of course, be subject to the heightened pleading \nstandards, discovery-stay procedures, and other defendant-protective \nfeatures of the PSLRA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 1552. A bill to reauthorize the DC opportunity scholarship \nprogram, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues, \nSenators Collins, Feinstein, Voinovich, Byrd and Ensign to introduce \nthe Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act, SOAR, which seeks to \nreauthorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, OSP, also known as \nthe DC voucher program. This important initiative offers scholarships \nto low-income students, especially those from failing schools, to \nattend better private schools. In doing so, the program gives parents \nof economically disadvantaged children a choice that's available to the \nmore affluent, including many of us in Congress and in the White House. \nThis program offers DC students a choice that has improved the quality \nof their education and lives; it is a program that works. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to support the reauthorization of this \nimportant program.\n  Since 2003, Congress has supported a tri-sector approach to improving \neducation in the District of Columbia. This has included funding the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program, which provides low income students in \nthe District with scholarships of up to $7,500 to attend private \nschools, as well as new funding for ongoing efforts to reform and \nimprove public schools and public charter schools in the District.\n  Critics of this program argue that it takes away funds from public \nschools. This is simply not the case. I remind my colleagues that we \nintentionally designed the scholarship program to ensure that any \nfunding for opportunity scholarships would not reduce funding for \npublic schools. We provided additional new money for the DC Public \nSchools and for DC Public Charter Schools. We have not changed the \nthree part-funding design of the initiative. The tri-partite funding is \ncentral to the compromise approach that originally brought Democrats \nand Republicans together in support of the Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram. This bill preserves that important requirement. It is our \nintent that any funding for DC Opportunity Scholarships will result in \ncontinued additional new money in support of public charter and public \nschools.\n  This funding mechanism is an important point as it reflects the goal \nof the Opportunity Scholarship Program: to be supportive of the reforms \nthat are helping to improve education in the District of Columbia. \nThere is absolutely no intention to undermine the public schools--quite \nto the contrary. But as Ronald Holassie, one of the students receiving \na scholarship, told us at a recent hearing on the program before the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee: ``public schools \nin the District did not go bad over night and they won't get better \nover night.'' That's the point: despite having amongst the highest per \npupil expenditure for public school districts in the country, the \npublic school students in the District score at the bottom on national \ntests. Ronald and others cannot wait for reforms to take effect in the \nworst of DC's public schools. They deserve a good education today and \nthe Opportunity Scholarships respond to that need.\n  Much progress has been made in improving DC schools over the years \nbut even school Chancellor Michelle Rhee admits that much remains to be \ndone. According to the Washington Post, Chancellor Rhee was asked \nrecently to give herself a grade for her efforts. She said she would \ngive herself a failing grade as long as any children were in schools \nthat were not providing a quality education. That's a modest answer \nthat obscures the progress she has made. DC test scores are up in the \nmost recent study of academic performance. Undoubtedly, we will see \nadditional improvements in the years to come. Chancellor Rhee will \ncontinue to have my full support and I am confident that Ms. Rhee will \nsoon be able to claim the ``A'' grade that I believe she already \ndeserves. In the new bill, we have made the connection between the \nscholarship program and the ongoing reform effort more explicit. Our \nbill acknowledges an intent to reexamine the program when DC public \nschool students are testing at the national average in reading and \nmath.\n  The bill also responds to early criticisms of the Opportunity \nScholarships with some important changes. It requires all participating \nschools to have a valid certificate of occupancy and to ensure that \nteachers in core subjects have an appropriate college degree. It \ncontinues to target students from lower income families who are \nattending those DC schools most in need of improvement but it increases \nthe tuition amounts slightly to levels consistent with the tuition \ncharged at a typical participating school, and adds an inflation \nadjustment. The new amounts are still well below the per pupil cost of \neducating a child in the DC public schools. While we have kept the \nincome ceiling for entry into the program unchanged, we have increased \nslightly the income ceiling for those already participating in the \nprogram to ensure that parents are not forced to choose between a \nmodest raise in their income and the scholarship, or marriage and the \nscholarship.\n  It is very important to recognize that the Opportunity Scholarship \nschools are producing impressive results. Opportunity Scholarship \nstudents attending private schools showed a five month advantage in \nreading levels compared to students attending public schools who \napplied but did not receive the scholarship, in the most recent study \nof the program conducted by the Department of Education's Institute of \nEducation Sciences. The study showed significantly higher levels of \nparental satisfaction with regards to safety and the quality of the \nschool for those in the program. The study has not yet even looked at \nthe effect of the program on graduation rates and attrition though \nstudies of other voucher programs indicate this impact could very well \nbe significant. We will see those results in next year's study.\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\n  It is also imperative to put the results of the program in context. \nRarely are there statistically significant results with any educational \ninnovations, particularly those targeted at low income students. Of the \neleven recent educational innovations studied under the auspices of the \nDepartment of Education using the same rigorous testing designs, only \nthree showed any statistically significant achievement results. The \nOpportunity Scholarship was one of the three. Dr. Patrick Wolf, an \neducation specialist and the lead researcher in the IES study, \ntestified at a recent hearing on the scholarship program that in his \nprofessional opinion the results were exceptional and warranted \ncontinued study of the program. According to Dr. Wolf, ``by \ndemonstrating statistically significant impacts overall in reading \nbased on an experimental evaluation, the DC OSP has met a tough \nstandard for efficacy in serving low-income inner-city students.''\n  Academic programs should be evaluated in terms of their impact on \nstudents' progress and achievement. In his speech before the Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce earlier this year, President Obama laid down that \nmarker as a guideline for considering which education programs should \nbe funded. On that basis, it is clear that we should continue to fund \nthe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program--a program that has been good \nfor students, good for parents and even good for public and charter \nschools in the District. Let us do the right thing for kids in DC and \nreauthorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Lieberman \nand my Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to reauthorize the \nDistrict of Columbia's pilot scholarship program for 5 more years.\n  This important program currently provides scholarships to 1,700 low-\nincome children who attend 49 private schools in the District. The \nscholarships of up to $7,500 help these students pay for tuition and \ntransportation expenses to school.\n  However, if the program is not extended soon, children will not be \nable to continue their education at the schools of their choice.\n  This legislation would:\n  Extend the life of the District of Columbia's pilot scholarship \nprogram for five more years.\n  Increase the program's funding to $20 million for fiscal year 2010 \nand as may be necessary the following four years to allow new students \nto participate in the program and provide a higher scholarship.\n  Increase the scholarship amount to $9,000 for children in \nkindergarten through 8th grade, and $11,000 for youngsters in high \nschool--this amount is still lower than the $15,500 cost of educating a \npublic school student in the District and will help low-income families \nafford the high cost of private school tuition.\n  Protect low-income families whose children are already in the program \nfrom ``earning out'' of it by setting the maximum income level for them \nat 300 percent of the Federal poverty level, about $63,000 for a family \nof four.\n  However, it maintains the current income eligibility requirement for \nstudents to enter the program of 185 percent of poverty, $41,000 for a \nfamily of four.\n  It would improve evaluation by assessing students' college admission \nrates, school safety, and the reasons why parents choose to participate \nin program to better learn about its impact on children's lives and \ntheir families.\n  It would give priority for awarding scholarships also to students \nwhose household includes a sibling or other child already participating \nin the program.\n  When students entered the program 5 years ago, they were performing \nin the bottom third on reading and math tests.\n  Students are now improving academically--despite the many challenges \nthat these children face outside the classroom living in some of the \nDistrict's toughest neighborhoods.\n  The most recent evaluation from this past April by the Education \nDepartment's Institute of Education Sciences found that although math \ntest scores have not increased so far, there are significant gains \nbeing made in reading test scores.\n  Specifically, pilot program students scored 4.5 points higher in \nreading on the SAT-9 national standardized test with a total score of \n635.4 when compared to the District's public school students' score of \n630.9.\n  This means students are making gains in reading test scores by the \nequivalent of 3 months of additional schooling, and moved to the 35th \npercentile on the SAT-9 from the 33rd percentile where they were before \nentering the program.\n  These youngsters still have much more catching up to do, but they are \nimproving and this is important.\n  I believe the results of the more comprehensive evaluation of student \nperformance that will be released next spring are critical.\n  Next year's evaluation will also include important data on the \nprogram's impact on students' college enrollment and how the District's \npublic schools are changing in response to the pilot program.\n  I would like to share two examples of how the program has helped to \nchange the lives of the District's most disadvantaged youngsters and \ngive them a chance to succeed.\n  Shirley-Ann Tomdio is the 8th grade Valedictorian at Sacred Heart \nMiddle School, located in the District's neighborhood of Columbia \nHeights.\n  The scholarship allowed Shirley-Ann to attend Sacred Heart School for \nthe past four years since 5th grade.\n  She will be attending Georgetown Visitation in September for high \nschool.\n  She wants to go to college and become a surgeon.\n  Shirley-Ann said at her 8th grade graduation speech this past June:\n\n       The D.C. OSP [Opportunity Scholarship Program] is important \n     to me because without it I wouldn't be able to receive the \n     best education possible. It should continue so that my \n     brother, sister, and other students get the same chance. \n     Every child should get the chance to go to a good school.\n\n  Oscar Machado is a graduate of Archbishop Carroll High School where \nhe was on Honor Roll.\n  Oscar is attending Mount Saint Mary's University in Maryland in the \nfall and plans to major in biology. He received three college \nscholarships that will cover nearly all of this tuition.\n  He was in the pilot program for 4 years.\n  At Archbishop Carroll High, he was President of the Robotics Team \nwhere he used pre-engineering skills to build robots, and also played \nthe saxophone in the school band.\n  When speaking of his experience as a D.C. Opportunity Scholarship \nrecipient Oscar said:\n\n       The scholarship was great. It gave me the opportunity to \n     attend a school I otherwise couldn't have attended.\n\n  Oscar hopes that the same opportunity should be available to other \nstudents.\n  We should listen to students like Oscar and Shirley-Ann, and continue \nto provide this important program to the District's neediest children.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8566-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8566-S8567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 231--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ANY \nHEALTH CARE REFORM PROPOSAL SHOULD SLOW THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF HEALTH \n    COSTS AND REDUCE THE GROWTH RATE OF FEDERAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING\n\n  Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Johanns, Mr. \nCoburn, and Mr. Crapo) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 231\n\n       Whereas health care spending has risen close to 2.4 \n     percentage points faster than gross domestic product (GDP) \n     since 1970; and\n       Whereas the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n     projects health care spending to be 17.6 percent of GDP in \n     2009 and 20.4 percent of GDP by 2018: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any health care reform proposal should reduce total \n     spending on health care in the United States during the next \n     decade to below current projections by the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services; and\n       (2) any health care reform proposal should reduce the \n     growth rate of Federal health care spending.\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\n  Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution on the future of \nhealth care spending. It is both simple and straightforward. It states \nthat health care reform shouldn't cost the Federal Government more \nmoney. As health care proposals have received their scores from the \nCongressional Budget Office, we have seen figures ranging from $597 \nbillion to over $1 trillion. In fact, when asked point blank in a \nSenate Budget Committee hearing if the current reform proposals would \nhelp bend the cost-curve of health care spending in this country, CBO \nDirector Elmendorf replied that it would worsen an already bleak budget \noutlook, increase deficit projections and drive the nation further into \ndebt. It would raise, instead of lower, the cost-curve of health care \nspending and, simply iterated, this nation cannot afford it.\n  Already this year Congress has spent $787 billion on a stimulus \npackage with diminutive effects, passed an omnibus appropriations \npackage and an emergency supplemental appropriations with a price tag \nof $105.9 billion. We cannot continue to spend as if there is an \nendless supply of resources and as if this spending doesn't affect \nAmerican families.\n  I am an advocate for health reform. I have cosponsored the Healthy \nAmericans Act with Senator Wyden because we need to reform our \ncountry's health care system. However, I believe we need to do it in a \nway that does not significantly increase the federal responsibility for \nhealth care costs.\n  This resolution expresses the Sense of the Senate that health care \nreform proposals should reduce total spending on health care in the \nUnited States during the next decade to levels below current \nprojections by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and reduce \nthe growth rate of Federal health care spending. Not only is this \nfeasible, but it should be our goal. Health care reform at the expense \nof our economy is not reform we should support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8567-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 232--CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                 TILLAMOOK COUNTY CREAMERY ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 195) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 195\n\n       Whereas Bishop Museum was founded in 1889 in Honolulu, \n     Hawai`i by Charles Reed Bishop in memory of his beloved wife, \n     Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the great granddaughter of \n     Kamehameha I, to house the personal legacies and bequests of \n     the royal Kamehameha and Kalakaua families;\n       Whereas the mission of Bishop Museum since its inception \n     has been to study, preserve, and tell the stories of the \n     cultures and natural history of Hawai`i and the Pacific;\n       Whereas the collections of Bishop Museum include more than \n     24,000,000 objects, collectively the largest Hawai`i and \n     Pacific area collection in the world, which includes more \n     than 1,200,000 cultural objects representing Native Hawaiian, \n     Pacific Island, and Hawai`i immigrant life, more than 125,000 \n     historical publications (including many in the Hawaiian \n     language), more than 1,000,000 historical photographs, films, \n     works of art, audio recordings, and manuscripts, and more \n     than 22,000,000 plant and animal specimens;\n       Whereas a primary goal of Bishop Museum is to serve and \n     represent the interests of Native Hawaiians by advancing \n     Native Hawaiian culture and education, protecting the \n     collections and increasing access to them, and strengthening \n     the museum's connections with the schools of Hawai`i;\n       Whereas the national significance of Bishop Museum's \n     cultural collection lies in the Native Hawaiian collection, \n     which collectively represents the largest public resource in \n     the world documenting a way of life, and has been a source of \n     knowledge and inspiration for numerous visitors, researchers, \n     students, native craftsmen, teachers, and community and \n     spiritual leaders over the years, especially since the \n     cultural revival, which has been steadily growing and gaining \n     in popularity;\n       Whereas more than 300,000 people visit Bishop Museum each \n     year to learn about Hawaiian culture and experience Hawaiian \n     Hall;\n       Whereas the desire to see Hawaiian Hall and to learn about \n     Hawaiian culture is the primary reason 400,000 visitors each \n     year give for visiting Bishop Museum;\n       Whereas Hawaiian Hall is the Nation's only showcase of its \n     size, proportion, design, and historic context that is \n     devoted to the magnificent legacy of Hawai`i's kings and \n     queens, and the legacies of its Native Hawaiian people of all \n     walks of life and ages;\n       Whereas Hawaiian Hall, constructed between 1889 and 1903 \n     and 1 of 3 interconnected structures known as the Hawaiian \n     Hall Complex, is considered a masterpiece of late Victorian \n     museum design with its Kamehameha blue stone exterior \n     quarried on site and extensive use of native koa wood, and is \n     one of the few examples of Romanesque Richardsonian style \n     museum buildings to have survived essentially unchanged;\n       Whereas Hawaiian Hall, designed by noted Hawai`i architects \n     C.B. Ripley and C.W. Dickey in 1898, was placed on the \n     National Register of Historic Places in 1982, based on its \n     unique combination of architectural, cultural, scientific, \n     educational, and historical significance;\n       Whereas the restoration and renovation of Hawaiian Hall and \n     its exhibits by noted Hawai`i architect Glenn Mason and noted \n     national and international museum exhibit designer Ralph \n     Appelbaum are integral to the museum's ability to fulfill its \n     mission and achieve its primary goal of serving and \n     representing the interests of Native Hawaiians;\n       Whereas the restoration and renovation of Hawaiian Hall, \n     begun in 2005, included the building of a new gathering place \n     in an enclosed, glass walled atrium, improved access to the \n     hall through the installation of an elevator in the new \n     atrium to all 3 floors of the hall and other buildings in the \n     Hawaiian Hall Complex, improved collection preservation \n     through the installation of new, state-of-the-art \n     environmental controls, lighting, security, and fire \n     suppression systems, and restored original woodwork and \n     metalwork;\n       Whereas the restoration and renovation of the hall's \n     exhibits bring multiple voices and a Native Hawaiian \n     perspective to bear on Bishop Museum's treasures, by \n     conveying the essential values, beliefs, complexity, and \n     achievements of Hawaiian culture through exquisite and \n     fragile artifacts in a setting that emphasizes their ``mana'' \n     (power and essence) and the place in which they were created;\n       Whereas the new exhibit incorporates contemporary Native \n     Hawaiian artwork illustrating traditional stories, legends, \n     and practices, and contemporary Native Hawaiian voices \n     interpreting the practices and traditions through multiple \n     video presentations;\n       Whereas the new exhibit features more than 2,000 objects \n     and images from the museum's collections on the open floor, \n     mezzanines, and the center space, conceptually organized to \n     represent 3 traditional realms or ``wao'' of the Hawaiian \n     world--Kai Akea, the expansive sea from which gods and people \n     came, Wao Kanaka, the realm of people, and Wao Lani, the \n     realm of gods and the ``ali`i'' (chiefs) who descended from \n     them;\n       Whereas the new exhibit's ending display celebrates the \n     strength, glory, and achievements of Native Hawaiians with a \n     large 40-panel mural titled ``Ho`ohuli, To Cause An \n     Overturning, A Change'', made by students of Native Hawaiian \n     charter schools in collaboration with Native Hawaiian artists \n     and other students, and interpreted by Native Hawaiian \n     artists and teachers in a video presentation; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States wish to convey \n     their sincerest appreciation to Bishop Museum for its service \n     and devotion: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the reopening of historic Hawaiian Hall on \n     the 120th anniversary of the founding of Bishop Museum in \n     Honolulu, Hawai`i; and\n       (2) on the occasions of the reopening and anniversary of \n     the museum, honors and praises Bishop Museum for its work to \n     ensure the preservation, study, education, and appreciation \n     of Native Hawaiian culture and history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/30/senate-section/article/S8618-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S.
