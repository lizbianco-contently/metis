Madam President, the bill the Senate will vote on \nlater today represents a missed opportunity. In the midst of a serious \neconomic downturn, the Senate had a chance to show it could impose the \nsame kind of restraint on itself that millions of Americans are being \nforced to impose on themselves at the moment. The bill costs far too \nmuch for a government that should be watching every dime. If the \nPresident is looking for a first bill to veto, this is it.\n  The original version of the bill showed no recognition whatsoever of \nthe current economic climate. With the stock market plunging, \nunemployment at a 25-year high, and millions struggling to pay their \nmortgages, the bill sent over from the House included an across-the-\nboard 8-percent increase in spending over last year. That is twice the \nrate of inflation.\n  Republicans in the Senate tried to cut the bill's cost. Our ideas \nwould have saved billions of taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, every \nsingle effort was turned aside.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona proposed an amendment that would have \nheld spending in the omnibus at last year's level. The senior Senator \nfrom Texas offered an amendment that would have cut spending on the 122 \nprograms that were already funded in the stimulus bill--the so-called \ndouble dipping that many of us warned would take place if Congress \nmoved the stimulus before the omnibus. Remarkably, even that was too \nmuch for some. The junior Senator from Oklahoma proposed an amendment \nthat would have cut projects that benefited a lobbying firm under \nFederal investigation. That too was rejected.\n  These Republican ideas were sensible, commonsense ways to cut \nspending. Unfortunately, the majority did not like any of them. This \nwould have been irresponsible in good economic times.\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nAt this moment, this total unwillingness to cut a single dollar from \nthis bill is simply indefensible.\n  Just as troubling as the lack of restraint is a provision to \nliterally shut down the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program which helped \n1,700 students in the District of Columbia attend private schools last \nyear at a fraction of what the city spends per pupil on public \neducation. This program is clearly--clearly--popular among parents, \nsince the city receives four applications for every available slot. Yet \nour friends on the other side will reject an amendment to preserve it.\n  On this issue, it is incredibly difficult to see how the majority can \nmatch their rhetoric with their actions. It should be unthinkable to \nterminate a program aimed at giving inner-city students the same \neducational opportunities that middle-class or affluent students enjoy.\n  Republicans tried to improve the omnibus with commonsense proposals \nthat Americans support. The junior Senator from Arizona proposed an \namendment that would have required the Secretary of State to certify \nthat none of the funds made available for reconstruction efforts in \nGaza are diverted either to Hamas or to entities controlled by Hamas. \nThe junior Senator from South Dakota offered an amendment that \nprohibits the use of funds for any effort aimed at reviving the \nfairness doctrine, which limited free speech until its repeal more than \ntwo decades ago. Unfortunately, the majority said no.\n  In the midst of an economic crisis, a government has an obligation to \nshow restraint. But as our friends turned aside every effort to trim \nback spending on the omnibus bill, it became clear that many in \nCongress still think Government operates in a different realm of \nreality than the rest of the country. Apparently, they do not think the \nFederal Government is obligated to make any of the tough decisions that \nmillions of American families are making every single day.\n  Spending and borrowing at this dizzying rate is simply unacceptable. \nWe need to be thinking about the long-term sustainability of our \neconomy and creating jobs and opportunity for future generations. We \nshould have started on this bill by insisting that it include some of \nthe hard choices on spending that Americans themselves are making every \nsingle day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/10/senate-section/article/S2920-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I direct everyone's attention to today's \ncolumn in the New York Times written by David Brooks. David Brooks is a \nRepublican columnist, conservative, but basically he is saying that the \nRepublicans are opposing everything. It does not matter what it is, \nthey are opposing it. And I think that is basically what we have here \ntoday with Senator McConnell. I mean, I cannot imagine how he could \nstand before this body, after having talked favorably of this bill in \nthe past--and his statements have been read in the Record on previous \noccasions about how much he believed in this omnibus bill. In fact, he \nsaid--and I am paraphrasing--that there had been input by Democrats and \nRepublicans, it had been fully vetted. But suddenly--using the David \nBrooks theory of Government--they are opposed to everything.\n  It is not helping the Republicans around this country. You have to be \nin favor of something. And for my friend, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, to stand before this body and lament the deficits--``this \nspending that has to stop''--where were they during the 8 years of the \nred ink of George Bush? The biggest deficits in the history of this \ncountry are all held by George Bush: the unending spending on the Iraq \nwar, not putting that in the budget in an effort to hide it from the \nAmerican people--how much it cost--the tax cuts that were never big \nenough for the Republicans that ran us into this deep hole President \nObama has inherited.\n  So everyone should read David Brooks. Let's have the Republicans \nstart being in favor of something. That would be the right thing to do.\n  The fairness doctrine. What a ghost that does not exist. None of us \nwants to go back to the way it was before. It is an issue they brought \nup to talk about. No one wants to reestablish the fairness doctrine, \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  I know the State of Nevada is prideful in determining what the \neducation standards should be in the State of Nevada. I think we should \ndo more in the State of Nevada. I am not happy about where our \neducational levels are, the spending levels in the State of Nevada. But \nNevada determines that, and that is the way it is around the other 49 \nStates, that it is a prerogative Governors have protected for many \ngenerations--that the Federal Government should stay out of local \neducation. But when it comes to the District of Columbia, they do not \ncount, I guess. So how would the rest of the States feel if we suddenly \ndetermined what was going to happen in those States as it related to \nvouchers, school choice, charter schools?\n  So I hope we can get these amendments out of the way and pass this \nlegislation and go on to other things. I am sorry I had to file cloture \non three nominations. I hope we do not have to take those votes because \nit goes in opposition to what the Republicans always told us: What \nright does the party in the minority have to hold up Presidential \nnominations or judges? We are finding that is happening. I hope we can \nwork our way through that.\n  This legislation is important. It is important because it takes care \nof these Government agencies that had been, over the Bush years, so \nunderfunded, underresourced that we had--because of the 8 years of \nneglect--to increase spending for these Government agencies so they can \ndo their job. I met yesterday with new Secretary of the Interior Ken \nSalazar. He is lamenting how the parks in our country are in such bad \nshape, terrible shape. The Mall out here, because the Republicans \ncomplained about the money for the Mall--there was a major feature on \nall public radio stations yesterday about the Mall, what terrible shape \nthis Mall is in. It is used. It is an American landmark. But they do \nnot want money spent on that.\n  When I read David Brooks this morning, I thought: Gee whiz, he has an \nunderstanding of what is wrong with the Republican Party. And no one \nmore than a Republican can probably say it as strongly as he did. David \nBrooks--I have told him how on a number of occasions I disagree with \nhis end line, but his reasoning is always brilliant, as it was today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/10/senate-section/article/S2920-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prevent collection of excessive contingency legal fees by \n             lawyers hired to protect the public interest)\n\n       On page 366, line 24, strike ``rule.'' and insert the \n     following: ``rule, provided that an attorney general of a \n     State may not enter into a contingency fee agreement for \n     legal or expert witness services relating to a civil action \n     under this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     'contingency fee agreement' means a contract or other \n     agreement to provide services under which the amount or the \n     payment of the fee for the services is contingent in whole or \n     in part on the outcome of the matter for which the services \n     were obtained.''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment 673 to the \nOmnibus appropriations bill. As a former State attorney general, I am \nvery concerned that the current bill lets State attorneys general \noutsource their responsibilities on behalf of their citizens to enforce \nthe Truth in Lending Act. This is a very important piece of legislation \nthat was passed in 1968 to protect consumers in credit transactions by \nrequiring clear disclosure of key terms of the lending agreement at all \ncosts. As I said, this is an important piece of legislation. However, \nthe current provision in the bill allows the attorney general, the \nelected representative of the people--the people's lawyer--to basically \nhire trial lawyers on a contingency fee arrangement. Thus, the \nlitigation that might follow under this piece of legislation would \nbenefit not just the citizens, not just the public, not just the \ntaxpayers but trial lawyers too. I don't believe that should be the \nintent of Congress.\n  Specifically, this amendment clarifies that State attorneys general \nmay not outsource these lawsuits to outside lawyers or expert witnesses \non a contingency fee basis. As we all know, contingency fee means you \nget a piece of the pie if you win. This would not prohibit attorneys \ngeneral from hiring lawyers on a more reasonable basis, such as a set \nfee or an hourly rate, but the new causes of action created by this \nbill could add up to significant money damages, and this money, as I \nindicated, should be paid to the people, not to private lawyers.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed some concerns about the \nenforcement of this Truth in Lending Act by State attorneys general. \nSenator Dodd, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, said that \n``giving such broad authority to State attorneys general would be a \ndeparture from the current regulatory regime,'' and he is right.\n  This amendment prevents the authority to enforce the Truth in Lending \nAct from being further disbursed by State attorneys general delegating \nit to trial lawyers on a contingency fee basis. Without this amendment, \nit is likely that plaintiffs' lawyers will develop class action \nlawsuits, then go to their State attorney general proposing to pursue \nthese cases on a contingency fee basis, perhaps reaping millions of \ndollars in attorneys' fees awards.\n  My colleagues have expressed concerns the bill would increase the \nnumber of authorized enforcers from 1 to 51. I would submit that unless \nthis amendment is adopted, we are effectively increasing the number of \nauthorized enforcers of this legislation from 1 to 5,100 or more.\n  Hiring outside counsel on a contingency fee basis, unfortunately, as \nwe have learned through hard experience, can lead to other problems, \nincluding the appearance of corruption or outright corruption. For \nexample, my predecessor in office, the Texas attorney general, entered \ninto contingency fee agreements with outside lawyers in the tobacco \nlitigation, which was then being pursued across the country. These \nlawyers ended up making roughly $3 billion in attorneys fees through \ncontingency fee provisions that my predecessor in office entered into. \nUnfortunately, my predecessor also falsified records in an attempt to \nfunnel some of that money to a friend, and he paid the price. He went \nto the Federal penitentiary.\n  This is not just a problem in my State; this is a national problem as \nwell. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported and editorialized \nabout the appearance of corruption in Mississippi, where the State \nattorney general had retained as many as 27 law firms as outside \ncounsel to pursue at least 20 different State lawsuits over a 5-year \nperiod. In 2007 alone, the attorney general received almost $800,000 in \npolitical contributions from those same lawyers and law firms and, \nthus, the appearance of conflict of interest, if not an outright \nconflict, was created.\n  This kind of conflict of interest has no place in the attorney \ngeneral's job, which is to protect the legal interests of the people of \nhis or her State. Amendment No. 673 would ensure that State attorneys \ngeneral either do the work themselves in enforcing this law or hire an \noutside lawyer at a reasonable, competitive hourly rate or flat rate; \nno windfall attorneys' fees for hitting the long ball over the fence.\n  When Federal agencies bring suits to enforce the Truth in Lending \nAct, they are barred from hiring outside counsel on a contingency fee \nbasis. All I am suggesting is that this same rule should apply to the \nState attorneys general who are now authorized enforcers under the law. \nParticularly at this time in our Nation's economic history, it should \nhardly be one of Congress's priorities to increase the number of \nlawsuits. We cannot sue our way to recovery. Unless amendment 673 is \nadopted, the bill would give trial lawyers a share of the public's \nmoney and will disrupt the Federal credit regulatory regime and, as I \nindicated a moment ago, create dangerous incentives to corruption. I \nask my colleagues to support amendment No. 673.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 674\n\n  Madam President, I have another amendment, Cornyn amendment No. 674, \nso I now ask unanimous consent to set aside temporarily my previous \namendment and ask for the immediate consideration of amendment No. 674.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 674.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to implement an Executive Order \n    relating to employee notice of rights under Federal labor laws)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I of division F, insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __.  No funds made available under this Act shall be \n     used to implement the Executive Order dated January 30, 2009, \n     entitled ``Notification of Employee Rights Under Federal \n     Labor Laws'' to the extent that the implementation of such \n     order is in conflict with Executive Order 13201, dated \n     February 17, 2001.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, my second and final amendment to this \nOmnibus appropriations bill would help protect workers' paychecks and \nincrease transparency, something we all heard our new President speak \nabout just a few short weeks ago--I believe about 50 days ago now--when \nhe said he believed increased transparency would increase \naccountability and help restore the public's confidence in their \nGovernment. This amendment is offered in that vein.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, in Communication Workers v. Beck, said \nworkers could not be forced to pay dues for purposes other than \ncollective bargaining. That means workers have the right to keep more \nof their money rather than support political action committees, \nlobbying and gifts, things they may not even agree with.\n  We know every dollar counts in this economy, and many workers object \nto scenes such as the one we saw last week in Miami. There, the AFL-CIO \nheld a meeting at the Fontainebleau Resort, which describes itself as \n``the epicenter of style, fame, and glamour.'' Now, if workers don't \nwant to support that kind of extravagance based on their union dues, \nthey shouldn't have to. And, frankly, who can blame them?\n  The Bush administration issued an Executive order that required \nemployers to post signs at the workplace that informed workers of these \nrights regarding union dues. These notices are similar to those that \ninform workers of\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\ntheir rights regarding family and medical leave, workplace safety, \nequal employment opportunity, and other rights they have under the law.\n  Now, this chart shows what the notice says. It says:\n\n       Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a \n     union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain \n     their jobs. Under certain conditions, the law permits a union \n     and an employer to enter into a union security agreement \n     requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and \n     initiation fees. However, employees who are not union members \n     can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes \n     and can only be required to pay their share of union costs \n     relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, \n     and grievance adjustment.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used \n     to support activities not related to collective bargaining, \n     contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are \n     entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment.\n\n  Meaning your payment of your union dues.\n\n       If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or \n     fees used in part to support activities not related to \n     collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance \n     adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to \n     appropriate reduction in future payments. For further \n     information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact \n     the National Labor Relations Board, either at one of its \n     regional offices or at the following address.\n\n  The Supreme Court has said when a worker pays their dues, they cannot \nbe forced to financially support things they don't agree with, whether \nit is extravagant spending at the Fontainebleau Resort or perhaps even \na political speech where a union might use those dues to help finance a \ncampaign against a political candidate or perhaps an incumbent.\n  President Obama, unfortunately, has signed an Executive order that, \namong other things, rescinds the requirement to inform workers of their \nrights regarding union dues. This Executive order, contrary to what we \nheard a few short weeks ago, actually reduces transparency in the \nworkplace, and it places unnecessary limits on the information \navailable to help workers make informed decisions about their union \ndues.\n  Amendment No. 674 would prohibit Federal funds from being used to \nimplement that part of President Obama's Executive order related to \nthis notice to workers. It would have no other effect on the Executive \norder, other than to reinstate this notice to workers that you don't \nhave to join a union; and, No. 2, if you do not join a union, you \ncannot be forced to finance points of view or activities you disagree \nwith, and you can assure that your money can only be used for \nlegitimate collective bargaining contract administration and grievance \nadjustment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 674.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 673\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise today to speak against an \namendment filed by Senator Cornyn of Texas. The amendment deals with \nthe ability of State attorneys general to hire outside counsel for \nvarious lawsuits they may be pursuing. I wish to talk about that \namendment for a few minutes and tell my colleagues how that works in \nthe real world.\n  One of the things we did when I was in the State attorney general's \noffice is we looked at several cases on which we considered hiring \noutside counsel because the State did not have the resources to front \nthe costs of the litigation. We ended up not retaining any outside \ncounsel. We did not pursue those matters. Nonetheless, the fact that we \nhad the ability to look at that option is very important for States. It \nis also very important for State sovereignty. In fact, I am not \nconvinced--I have to look at the U.S. Constitution--I am not convinced \nthat the U.S. Congress can limit a State's ability to file a lawsuit. \nMy sense is that the States have that authority. They can do what they \nwant to do. They are sovereign. My guess is that this amendment may be \nunconstitutional. I have not yet done a thorough analysis of it, but \nthat is my suspicion.\n  I say this too. One of the points my colleagues need to remember \nabout the State AGs is that most of them--I think over 42, 43, 44 State \nattorneys general are just like us: they are elected by the people. \nThere are a few appointed one way or another--by a supreme court, a \nlegislature, a Governor. That happens State to State, but the vast \nmajority of them are elected just as we are. They have accountability. \nThey are responsible to the people who elected them. There is that \ncheck and balance that already exists. I am not sure about other States \nbecause I don't know how their outside counsel statutes work, but in \nour State, in order for us to hire outside counsel, we have to go to \nthe legislature and get their approval, and we also have to get the \nGovernor to sign off on it. Again, States are going to be different on \npoint.\n  Again, in Arkansas, we have another check and balance beyond just \nthat the State attorney general is elected and is accountable to the \npeople. There is also a check and balance between the State attorney \ngeneral's office and the legislature and the Governor. Everyone has an \ninterest to make sure this is done right and done well. It works very \nwell in our State. If we had a lot of State attorneys general here, \nthey would agree that it worked very well for them as well.\n  Another point I wish to address in the Cornyn amendment is the \nunderlying premise of this amendment. My understanding is it is based \non some language dealing with the Federal Trade Commission in the \nomnibus bill we are discussing today and will vote on later today. We \nhave to recognize that the Federal Government does not always have the \nmanpower or the attention span or the ability, for one reason or \nanother, to go after some bad actors out there. The States do not \nalways have that manpower, attention span, or ability either, but the \nfact that the States can help augment and supplement the enforcement of \nthe Federal Trade Commission and other Federal agencies can be very \ngood for the people of this country.\n  Again, we need to allow the States the flexibility to be on the team. \nThey need to be on the team because these folks--again, most of them--\nare elected by their people. Most of them have some sort of consumer \nprotection function or some sort of public safety function. Most of \nthem have an office that is ready, willing, and able to make sure their \nState's citizenry is protected and taken care of sometimes when the \nFederal Government cannot do it or is not able to do it or is not \nwilling to do it. The State AG enforcement can be a very important part \nof that protection.\n  With regard to the narrow issue of whether States can hire outside \ncounsel, let me speak about that point for a moment.\n  When I was elected to the State attorney general's office in Arkansas \nin 1998--we all remember the tobacco case, the big, mammoth tobacco \ncase. I was elected and within weeks it settled. By the time I became \nattorney general, sworn into office, the case was over. It was done, \nand we were in the enforcement phase. The case itself was behind us.\n  One of the first things I had to do--this literally happened on the \nfirst day I was in office--is I had to undo an outside counsel \nagreement my predecessor had entered into. Here, again, not only have I \nnever entered into an outside counsel agreement as an attorney general, \nbut I undid one my predecessor tried to enter into. That puts me in a \ndifferent position than most people because I had been around this \nissue a lot during my years in the attorney general's office.\n  The other point we need to keep in mind about the tobacco case--and \nthis is just true for how State AGs work--one of the reasons, and I \nwould say the primary reason, that the States brought that case in the \nfirst place is because Washington failed to act. Washington failed to \nact. We may remember those days in the nineties. President Clinton \nwanted to do something with the tobacco companies. He wanted to have a \nglobal settlement of these claims. I was not around then. A lot of my \ncolleagues were around then\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nand remember the details of those discussions and the bill that came \nthrough. It got bogged down in the Congress. In fact, I remember \nlistening to the news media saying it came like a Christmas tree--\neverybody was adding an ornament as it went through the process. It \nnever passed. It got burdened down, and it never passed and never got \nto the President's desk for his signature. So when Congress did not \nact, the States did.\n  We have seen that in other context as well. When there is a void, \nwhen there is a vacuum and the Federal Government is not out there \ntrying to take care of an issue, whatever it may be, oftentimes the \nStates want action. It could be the Governors, it could be the State \nAGs, it could be the State legislatures, but--what is the old saying \nabout power abhors a vacuum? That is what happens in this country. \nAgain, we need to keep the States' flexibility in bringing lawsuits if \nthey need to do that.\n  The other point we need to keep in mind is that a lot of today's \nlitigation, a lot of the litigation the States are either involved in \nor are looking at is very complex and very expensive. I personally \nbelieve that an outside counsel contract can make a lot of sense. \nAgain, we looked at these contracts when I was in the attorney \ngeneral's office. We never did one, but we looked at them very closely \nbecause there are cases where it is very complex, it is very expensive, \nand you can structure an agreement with an outside counsel. It is not a \nget-rich-quick scheme by the outside lawyers, by the plaintiffs' \nattorneys, but it really is good for public policy, and if it is done \nright and done well, the public interest is very much served.\n  I think we should look at the Cornyn amendment. With all due respect \nto my colleague and friend from Texas, I think we should vote against \nthe Cornyn amendment. We should not limit the States' ability to hire \noutside counsel if they feel they need to. Let the States make that \ndecision. As I mentioned before, constitutionally, I am not sure we \nhave the authority to limit the States anyway.\n  In the end, the interest of our people back home would be disserved \nif we adopted this amendment because what we would do would be to take \nsome of the authority, some of the ability away from the State to \nprotect its citizenry. As this amendment is voted on--apparently later \nthis afternoon; I don't know exactly when it will be voted on--as it is \nvoted on, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on the Cornyn \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I take the floor to give a little \nbackground, important background on the amendment I will call up later \ntoday. That Vitter amendment would do away with the system that is now \nin place under the law whereby Members of Congress get automatic pay \nincreases annually without any open debate and without any open, clear \nrollcall vote.\n  Madam President, I have to say, Americans--certainly Louisianans in \nmy State--are frustrated about a lot that is going on in Washington and \nin Congress. They are frustrated about the direction of the country, \nabout runaway spending, about bailouts, but they are also frustrated \nwith how we in Congress often seem to do our business. They are not \nfrustrated so much with disagreement. People can have legitimate \ndisagreements, vast differences in points of view and philosophy and \napproaches to issues. What they are most frustrated about is pure \npartisanship for partisanship's sake, political games, and a cynical \napproach to doing what should be the people's business in the Halls of \nCongress.\n  Unfortunately, a lot of voters and citizens in Louisiana and across \nthe country are going to view some of the maneuvering and some of the \npolitical strategizing over attempts to defeat my amendment in that \nlight, and they are certainly going to consider it more of the same. \nWhat am I talking about? Well, we have a big omnibus spending bill on \nthe floor of the Senate, and last week the majority leader took great \npains to say--including from his spot on the floor several times--we \nare going to have an open amendment process; that the floor is open for \nbusiness, it is open for amendments. He invited Members to come on \ndown. We will consider them. We are moving forward and taking care of \namendments, having votes, and getting back to the proper procedure of \nthe Senate.\n  I was excited to hear that because I had an amendment I very much \nwanted to call up for debate and a vote. The problem is, when I tried \nto do that, both through staff and individually, we were blocked every \nstep of the way. At every turn, my amendment would never be put in \norder. It was never allowed to be called up, and I was never allowed to \nget that vote on this pay raise amendment.\n  Thursday night, that changed, and it changed for one simple reason: \nThe majority leader needed to cancel a vote. He needed 60 votes for \ncloture. He didn't have the votes, as he explained from his podium. To \ncancel that vote, under the rules of the Senate, he needed unanimous \nconsent--the consent of each and every Member of this body. Well, I \ntook the opportunity--after a week of being frustrated and blocked and \nhemmed in at every turn from getting a vote on my amendment--to say \nvery simply, in a straightforward way: I will be happy to grant that \nunanimous consent request with regard to my role in this if--if and \nonly if--I will finally be guaranteed a vote on my amendment. The \nmajority leader had to agree, and he did agree.\n  So here we are today, the following week, debating the Vitter pay \nraise amendment to stop pay raises on autopilot. This will finally lead \nto a vote. But as soon as that vote was scheduled, a sort of funny \nthing happened. The next day the majority leader introduced his own \nbill, coauthored by the entire Democratic leadership, which would do \nthe same thing. Now, if I thought I had gained that many enthusiastic \nconverts to the cause, I would be excited. But even though I was born \nat night, I wasn't born last night. I know--and every observer to the \nprocess knows--something else is going on. The something else is \nsimple: The majority leader filed his own bill regarding automatic pay \nraises simply to be able to point to it and say: I am offering this \nbill, we can push this forward through this vehicle, and therefore you \nmust vote against the Vitter amendment to the omnibus spending bill.\n  Again, I think the American people are going to be frustrated by the \nmaneuvering and the cynical political games. I think they want a full, \nstraightforward open debate. I think they want to hear where people are \ncoming from. If folks support this idea of changing and doing away with \nautomatic pay raises--pay raises on autopilot and no debate, no votes, \nthey just happen every year--then I think they are going to want to see \nthose Members vote for the Vitter amendment on the floor of this body \ntoday.\n  Quite frankly, I think it is a cynical maneuver to point to a bill \nthat will never pass, that is controlled by individuals who don't want \nthe measure to pass, in order to defeat an amendment that can pass and \nthat can be the vehicle for this important change and reform. So I \nwould encourage all Members to support the Vitter amendment, to support \nthe idea in the form in which it can actually be passed into law.\n  This is a must-pass bill. This is an appropriations bill--something \nto fund this part of the Government. Something has to pass within the \nnext several days. In this bill--in the original version of this bill--\nthe pay raise issue is already there. It is a perfectly germane and \nnatural amendment to the bill and agrees with my provision to do away \nwith automatic pay raises. Nothing could be more natural than to debate \nthe issue on this bill, to offer this amendment on this bill, and it is \nthe legitimate and appropriate and effective way if we actually do want \nto pass this into law.\n  The way to never pass it into law is to have a stand-alone straw man; \nto point to a separate bill that will never be passed, certainly in the \nHouse.\n  Now, I expect what will happen is, the majority leader will not only \npoint to this stand-alone bill, but he will actually ask unanimous \nconsent that it be passed through the Senate and sent down the road to \nthe House in the process. Well, that would be very promising if there \nwas any hope whatsoever that the Speaker of the House and the House \nleadership would take up the matter and put it on the House floor.\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nSo I would ask the majority leader and the Speaker of the House if they \nhave had those discussions. Is there a commitment to putting any stand-\nalone bill passed through the Senate on the House floor for a vote in \nthe very near future?\n  If there is that commitment, I would love to hear that expressed \npublicly, clearly, and in a straightforward way, and then that would \nrebut my argument that this is all a cynical, political game. I am \nafraid we are not going to hear those assurances. We are not going to \nhear that public commitment because I am afraid what is swirling around \nmy amendment is a cynical political game. Let us treat the people's \nbusiness the way it should be treated. Let us come to the floor, let us \nexpress our opinions. If we have legitimate differences of opinion, let \nus express them and let us debate them. But let us do it in that \nstraightforward way and then let us have a vote on the Vitter \namendment--the amendment that would do away with automatic pay raises--\nwhich is the true effective way to pass this reform into law on a must-\npass appropriations bill.\n  I urge all my colleagues to come to the floor in that spirit. I urge \nall my colleagues to express themselves and wherever they are coming \nfrom in that straightforward way, in that straightforward spirit and \nnot to drop in stand-alone bills the day after I was finally able to \nsecure a vote on this matter, particularly when this proposal--thanks \nto my good friend, Senator Russ Feingold--has been around at least \nsince the year 2000, 9 years. Neither the majority leader nor any of \nhis Democratic leadership who are cosponsors to his brand new bill have \never reached out to Senator Feingold to express support and join him in \nsupporting his bill, which, as I say, has been around since the year \n2000.\n  I am now happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 604\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to speak on another amendment. \nI spoke on Senator Vitter's amendment yesterday, and I spoke in support \nof it. I will now speak on the Sessions amendment.\n  I rise in support of the Sessions amendment to extend the E-Verify \nProgram for a period of 5 years. The E-Verify Program is an effective \nWeb-based tool that provides employers with a process for the purpose \nof verifying the Social Security numbers and, at the same time, for the \nmain purpose of determining the legal status of newly hired employees.\n  As my colleagues know, it is unlawful for employers to knowingly hire \nor employ aliens not eligible to work in the United States. Under \ncurrent law, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear \non their face to be genuine, then the employer has met the obligation \nto review the worker's documents. Unfortunately, counterfeit documents \nand stolen identities have made a mockery of this law. But with the E-\nVerify Program, employers can electronically verify a new hire's \nemployment authorization through the Social Security Administration \nand, if necessary, follow it up with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity databases.\n  E-Verify has been an extremely successful program for employers who \nare seeking to comply with the law. The program is voluntary and free \nfor all employers. Right now, over 100,000 employers have signed up for \nthe program, and, in addition, each week more than 2,000 employers sign \nup. E-Verify has a proven track record--more than 5 million queries by \nemployers were made last year and, of those, 96.1 percent were verified \nautomatically.\n\n  The small percentage of applicants who receive a tentative \nnonconfirmation must sort out their records with the Social Security \nAdministration. I would think if the Social Security Administration has \nbad information about you, you would want to clear that up for sure \nanyway. Many times this is a simple misunderstanding with the Social \nSecurity Administration or a case in which records were not updated. In \nthe event a person receives a tentative nonconfirmation after his \nemployment application, that person can still continue to work and \ncannot be fired.\n  The Sessions amendment would extend the E-Verify Program for 5 more \nyears. Now, frankly, I would like to see more reforms to the E-Verify \nProgram. For example, I would like to make E-Verify mandatory for all \nbusinesses. I would like employers to check all their employees through \nE-Verify, not just new hires. I would also like to see the program made \na permanent provision in our immigration laws. But for now, I am happy \nto support this first baby step in extending E-Verify for 5 years.\n  There is a bottom line to everything we do around here, and the \nbottom line is that this amendment is a jobs amendment. Our economy is \non the skids. Americans are losing their jobs. The E-Verify Program \nwill help stimulate the economy by preserving jobs for a legal \nworkforce. It will help root out illegal workers who are taking jobs \nfrom Americans. We need the E-Verify Program to encourage employers to \nuse the system to prevent them from hiring foreign labor that has come \nhere illegally.\n  I wish to make clear this has nothing to do with whether we have \npeople coming to this country. It has nothing to do with whether we \nhave people coming to this country to work. It only has to do with laws \nbeing followed--following the rule of law--to make sure people are \nworking here legally and are conforming with our laws. That is all this \nis about, and E-Verify is a process--not mandatory, but a process to \nhelp people who are employers to verify whether the people who apply \nfor the jobs are here legally and are registered with our Social \nSecurity system in a legal way.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, then, to support the Sessions amendment. Of \ncourse I appreciate very much the leadership of Senator Sessions in \nthis E-Verify Program extension for 5 years, which is what the \namendment calls for.\n  I yield the floor and I don't see anybody yet ready to speak so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 621\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, for Senator Vitter, I ask his \namendment be called up. It is amendment No. 621.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Grassley), for Mr. Vitter, for \n     himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Ensign, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 621.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the provision of law that provides automatic pay \n                  adjustments for Members of Congress)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise today to speak a little bit about \nwhere we are in our economic situation in\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\nthis country and specifically as it is affected by the President's \nbudget as he has brought it forward. I want to begin by acknowledging \nmy respect and appreciation for what this administration has tried to \ndo in the area of stabilizing the financial industry of this country. \nThey, in conjunction with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Treasury \nSecretary Geithner, and Larry Summers, the Special Adviser to the \nPresident, along, obviously, with the input of Chairman Volcker, have \nput together a very comprehensive effort to try to use the strengths of \nthe Federal Reserve and the Federal Government to basically inject \nliquidity into the system and put stability into the financial system \nof the country.\n  There has been a tremendous amount of commentary on this and much of \nit has reflected a lack of confidence in the initiatives that have been \nbrought forward by this administration because, in many instances, they \nhave not been as specific as they might have been. But the general \nthrust of what the administration has done in this area has been \npositive and I believe we are starting to see it work. The initial TARP \ndollars, which were put in by the prior administration, did stabilize \nthe banking industry during a critical time. That has been followed on \nwith additional TARP dollars from this administration, followed on by \nthe initiatives from the Fed in the area of TALF, which basically is \npotentially over $1 trillion of support for new loans in the area of \nconsumer credit and maybe commercial real estate; trying to do \nsomething in the mortgage area--initiatives have begun there using the \nFDIC and also the Treasury and the Fed again; in the area of basically \nunderwriting the stability of major banking systems in the country, \nsignificant efforts have been made; and we are now hearing there is \ngoing to be an additional effort made to take toxic loans off the \nbalance sheets of the banks using the leverage from the private sector.\n  All this has been, in my opinion, the right way to go. I didn't \nsupport the stimulus package because I thought it was unfocused and I \ndid not think the dollars were used as effectively as they might. I \nwanted to see the dollars in the real estate area. But as a very \npractical statement, on balance the efforts of this administration to \ntry to stabilize the financial industry, because stabilizing the \nfinancial industry is critical to getting the economy going, have been \npositive in my opinion. There is still a long way to go and there are \nmore specifics that need to come and I guess more of that is going to \ncome this week.\n  But that initiative to try to get this economy going and try to \naddress the issue of people's concerns about their jobs and the value \nof their homes and their ability to live their lives in a constructive \nway in the face of severe financial distress which is being caused by \nthis recession, stands in juxtaposition to this budget they have sent \nup. It is as if they have a ying and yang personality down there at the \nWhite House because they sent us up a whole group of ideas in the area \nof stabilizing the financial industries and trying to get the economy \ngoing with their stimulus package, the purpose of which is to lift the \neconomy using the Federal Government.\n\n  Then they sent us up a budget which essentially creates a massive \nexpansion in spending, a massive expansion in taxation, a massive \nexpansion in borrowing, not only in the short run when you might be \nable to justify more spending, when you can justify more spending and \nborrowing, but as far as the eye can see with the practical effect of \nhaving a dampening effect, throwing a wet blanket on top of this \ncountry's productivity capabilities and this country's ability to be \nmoving forward as an entrepreneurial society.\n  Look at the budget in specifics. The budget, in the short run, spikes \nthe deficit dramatically. I am not going to argue with that. That may \nbe necessary--maybe not at the levels they are doing it, but it may be \nnecessary. It is necessary in order to put liquidity into the market, \nput liquidity into the American economy.\n  But then it continues to expand the size of Government; 28 percent of \nGDP will be the size of the Government this year. That is massive \ncompared to our historical size of the Government as part of the GDP. \nThat has got to come down. It does come down, but it does not come down \nall that much. By the fifth, sixth, seventh year, we still have \nGovernment spending that is 22, 23 percent of GDP. We have a deficit in \nthe fifth year that is 3 to 4 percent of GDP.\n  The debt of the Federal Government, the public debt, is doubled in 5 \nyears under this budget. It is tripled in 10 years under this budget. \nTaxes are increased by $1.4 trillion under this budget, $1.4 trillion. \nWhat are those taxes used for? Not to reduce the deficit but to expand \nthe size of the Government even further.\n  Health care is essentially put on a track toward nationalization. \nEducational loans are nationalized. Discretionary spending goes up by \nalmost three-quarters of a trillion dollars. And there is absolutely no \nrestraint in any accounts of any significance on the spending side of \nthe ledger in this budget. So that by the time we get to the fourth and \nfifth year of this budget, rather than seeing the numbers come down to \nsomething that is manageable for our society, rather than seeing the \ndebt-to-GDP ratio come down to what might be a manageable number, it \nremains at a very high level, 67 percent.\n  Historically, debt to GDP in this country has been about 40 percent. \nThose are numbers. What do they mean? Well, essentially, instead of \nhaving a traditionally strong industrialized society, where your debt \nis manageable at 40 percent of your GDP, you are heading toward a \nbanana republic society or country where your GDP-to-debt ratio is up \naround 70 percent. You cannot sustain that. Yet this budget presumes we \nare going to have a debt-to-GDP ratio of the banana republic type as \nfar as the eye can see.\n  And the deficit? It is claimed that it is cut in half. Well, if you \nincrease the deficit four times, and then you cut it in half, you do \nnot gain very much. That is like taking four steps backward and only \ntwo steps forward. The practical effect of that is that we still end up \nwith a deficit 4 or 5 years out, well after we are past this \nrecessionary period, hopefully. I am sure we will be past it by then \nbecause we are a resilient nation. A deficit which is still way above \nthe historical norm for this country, a $712 billion deficit is \nprojected by the year 2019 under this budget, 3 to 4 percent of GDP. \nThat is not sustainable. What is the practical effect of this?\n  Well, the practical effect is that we give our kids a country they \ncannot afford. We put on them a debt burden which basically stymies \ntheir ability to succeed and prosper.\n  In addition to this, you have got to look at the policies underlying \nthis budget. What are the policies that are driving this massive \nexpansion of Government in this massive expansion of debt? Well, they \nare basically policies which say, we are going to take the Government \nand we are going to explode its role relative to the private sector \nactivities.\n  There is a proposal in this budget, as I mentioned earlier, to \nnationalize the student loan program. That is certainly an unnecessary \nact. We had a very vibrant private sector student loan program and a \nvibrant public sector student loan program. There is no reason we \ncannot have both. That is no longer acceptable. We are going to \nnationalize the student loan program.\n  There is a $636 billion place holder in this budget for the expansion \nof health care. They say it is a downpayment. Well, if it is a \ndownpayment, we are talking about health care expenditures exceeding $1 \ntrillion under this budget, growth in health care costs. Well, health \ncare already absorbs 17 percent of the gross national product. That is \nabout 5 percent higher than any other industrialized nation. It is not \nthat we do not put enough money in our health care system, it is that \nwe do not use it very well. And to increase the dollars going into \nhealth care by those numbers means what you are proposing is \nessentially for the Government to take over the entire health care \nsystem at some point in the future--another great expansion in the size \nof Government.\n  Then you have got this expansion on the discretionary side of the \naccount. Every discretionary program expanding, except for defense, \nwhere they play a gimmick for the purposes of claiming budgetary \nsavings that do not even exist on spending that will not occur.\n  So the goal of this budget is not to contain or to slow the rate of \ngrowth of\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\nGovernment in the outyears after we are past this recession, it is \nrather to explode the size of Government as we move out of this \nrecession, and put in place a government that continues to grow at a \nrate which the economy cannot afford and which obviously our children \ncannot afford.\n  How is this paid for, this dramatic expansion of Government? Well, \nmost of it is borrowed, borrowed money. But some of it comes out of \ntaxes. There are major new taxes proposed. We have all heard about the \ntaxes on the wealthy. Let me point out that essentially what is being \nproposed here is that if you make more than $250,000, your income is \ngoing to be nationalized. Well, there are a lot of wealthy people who \nmake more than $250,000, but there are also a lot of small businesses \nin this country that make $250,000.\n  That is where jobs come from in this country--the person running the \nlocal restaurant, the person running the local garage, the person who \nstarted a software company, the person who has initiated a new product, \na new catalog product, maybe, selling something. All of these are small \nbusinesses, and they are across this Nation, and they are what create \njobs. When you say to those folks, well, we are going to tax away \nwhatever you make above a certain amount, $250,000, you are saying to \nthem they do not have the assets to reinvest in their small businesses. \nYou are basically going to create a huge disincentive. This creates a \nhuge disincentive for small businesses to expand and for people to be \nadded, for employees to be added to their businesses. It throws a wet \nblanket on the expansion of small business.\n  There is another tax in here that is not talked about too much. They \ncall it a carbon tax. This is a massive new tax on everybody's electric \nbill. If you described it fairly, it should be described as a national \nsales tax on electricity. If you use electricity for anything, \nsomething in your home, if you use energy basically for anything--and \nalmost every American does; I cannot think of anyone who does not--you \nare going to find yourself hit with a new tax, this carbon tax, this \nnational sales tax on energy.\n  And what does it amount to? It is not a small sum. It is scored in \nthis budget. It is understated in this budget. It is scored at, I \nthink, $70 billion a year or something like that. That is still a lot \nof money, by the way. But it is understated. According to the MIT study \nand according to the numbers which were being used last year when this \nwas being discussed, the actual number is closer to $300 billion, $300 \nbillion in a brandnew tax burden on the American consumer.\n  And what is this tax used for? Well, it is used, in large part, for \nwalking-around money for various constituencies who have an interest in \ngetting money from the Federal Government. It is not used to contain \nthe Federal Government or to reduce its size by reducing the deficit. A \nlarge percentage of these tax revenues are going to be added to various \ninitiatives around here which are the projects of Members--worthwhile, \nI am sure.\n\n  But it is pretty hard to justify hitting Americans with a brandnew \nnational sales tax on their energy bills for the purposes of expanding \nthis Government, which is already too large to begin with. And, \nremember, none of this expansion in the Government taxes takes into \naccount the huge costs which we have coming at us which we do not know \nhow we are going to handle. Those are the costs of the retirement of \nthe baby boom generation, for as this baby boom generation continues to \nretire--it has begun retiring now--it is going to generate massive \ncosts on our Government.\n  We know we have $60 trillion of unfunded liability to pay for \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid for the baby boom generation as \nit retires. And why is that? Why are there all of those trillions of \ndollars? Why is all of that money out there and obligated?\n  Because we have created a massive cost, and we have the largest \ngeneration in America retiring that is going to push that cost onto our \nchildren. We go from 35 million retired people to 70 million retired \npeople, and most of that is going to occur by the end of this \nadministration's term in office should the President be reelected.\n  So you would think that in this budget they would have said, well, we \nbetter start addressing that issue. We better start disciplining \nourselves relative to how we are going to handle this massive increase \nin spending, which we know is coming at us--I call it a fiscal \ntsunami--as a result of the baby boom generation retiring. But, no, not \none word in this budget about containing or slowing down or in any way \naddressing the issue of entitlement spending as a result of retirement \nof the baby boom generation.\n  The practical effect is there is an elephant in the room that we know \nwe are going to have to address relative to cost that is not addressed, \nbut at the same time the budget radically expands the size of \nGovernment, using resources that might have been used to address \nentitlement reform.\n  It is a budget which, if you look at it, essentially says to the \nproductive and entrepreneurial side of our Nation: We are going to tax \nyou. We are going to regulate you. And we are going to create an \natmosphere where we are going to crowd out your ability to borrow money \nbecause the Federal Government is going to borrow so much money.\n  It is simply an attack on the entrepreneurial elements of our \nsociety, the people, the small business people who go out there and \ncreate jobs. That is why I said there is a conundrum here. On the one \nside this Government is proposing all sorts of initiatives, which I \nagree with, to try to float the economy using the liquidity of the \nFederal Government in a lot of different areas but primarily focused on \ngetting stability back into our financial system and helping people who \nhave mortgages that they cannot pay.\n  But, on the other side, you have this budget sent up here which is a \nclear and present attack essentially on the productive side of our \nledger as a nation, while it expands radically the size of Government. \nSo you can understand why the stock market and others are saying, whoa, \nwhat is happening here? Who am I to believe, the part of the \nadministration which says we are going to try to get this economy going \nor the part of this administration that says, once we get it going, we \nare going to stuff it down with a major new tax burden and a dramatic \nexpansion in Government?\n  So much more could have been accomplished in this budget than what \nhas been proposed. If it had come forward with any reasonable ideas in \nthe area of disciplining and managing the entitlement accounts, there \nwould have been strong bipartisan support for that. But none were put \non the table.\n  The opportunity to move forward in the area of Social Security was \nnot taken. The opportunity to do something significant in the area of \nMedicare was certainly not taken in this budget, and the practical \neffect of that is, that if you are looking at this budget, and you are \nan investor from somewhere around the world buying American bonds--and, \nremember, most of our debt today is being bought by people outside the \nUnited States. They are basically funding our capacity as a nation to \nfunction--you are going to look at this budget and you are going to \nsay, do I have confidence that the bonds I am buying are going to have \nthe value that I am putting into them 5 or 10 years from now?\n  If I look at this budget, I am going to conclude that the American \nGovernment is not going to discipline itself, that it is going to \ncontinue to run a debt-to-GDP ratio that is not sustainable, and that, \ntherefore, it is very likely that maybe my debt that I am buying from \nthe United States, the Treasury bonds I am buying, are not going to be \nthe value I am paying for them.\n  This budget not only stifles the entrepreneurial spirit of America in \nthe outyears--and people looking 4 or 5 years down the road are not \nthinking that far now, but in October, this budget repeals many of the \ntax initiatives which create entrepreneurship and tax people at a \nheavier rate; it starts pretty soon here--at the same time it is \nputting at risk the value of our currency and the value of our debt. It \nis saying to the world: We are not going to discipline ourselves in the \noutyears.\n  When we raise taxes, which this administration is proposing--and that \nis what they said they would do--one presumes they would do what \nPresident Clinton did when he raised taxes. He\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\nused it to try to reduce the deficit. With the help of a Republican \nCongress, which limited spending, we were able to accomplish that. This \nbudget does not accomplish that. This budget takes $1.4 trillion in new \ntaxes and spends it on a massive expansion of the Federal Government in \nthe area of health care and the way we finance student loans, all the \ndifferent initiatives basically expanding Government's role.\n  The practical effect of that will be to weaken the dollar, our \ncurrency, and to cause people to question the value of our debt. That \nis serious. That is very serious for us as a nation.\n  I agree with those who say the market is confused by this \nadministration. It is confused because, on one hand the administration \nis pursuing what is a necessary policy to get liquidity into the market \nand stabilize the financial industry, stabilize the housing industry, \nbut, on the other hand, it has put forward a budget which is probably \nthe largest expansion of Government in the history of the country or \nthe largest proposed expansion of Government in the history of the \ncountry, unpaid for and, therefore, threatening the future of our \nchildren with debt they can't possibly afford.\n  As we move forward in this effort, I suggest a better course of \naction would be for this administration to come forward with some \nfiscal discipline. Why don't they propose some specific ideas which \nwill address the impending fiscal tsunami? There are bipartisan \ninitiatives in the Senate to do so. Senator Conrad and I have proposed \na procedure which would allow us to put in place a process which would \nlead to policy, which would lead to a vote, which would actually limit \nand make affordable a large percentage of the outyear cost of \nentitlement programs as we try to fund the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration.\n  Take us up on that offer. It has very significant bipartisan support. \nWhy not take up an initiative in the area of trying to get the deficit \nand the debt back to the prerecession period? When we went into the \nrecession, the debt was 40 percent of GDP. The deficit was down to \nabout 1.5 percent of GDP. Let's get back to those numbers. If we are \ngoing to raise revenues, let's use them to reduce the deficit, not to \nexpand the size of Government.\n  These are initiatives that would get a lot of Republican support, \ncertainly on the first point. There might even be some support on the \nsecond idea of getting the deficit down. I would certainly support \nlowering the debt. But the proposal as put forward now is confusing. \nNot only is it confusing, but if it were actually put in place, it \nwould put our country in a very serious situation as our children try \nto lead their lives and move forward in a nation which gives them an \nopportunity for prosperity.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 629 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yesterday I spoke to my pending amendment \nNo. 629, an amendment that would have required an assurance that none \nof the funds in the underlying legislation would be used to resettle \nGazans in the United States. There had been a flurry of news stories \nsuggesting that an Executive order by the President might have that \nresult.\n  In contacting the State Department, we have been assured that is not \nthe case. As a result, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment and to have printed in the Record a letter from the U.S. \nDepartment of State, Michael Polt, Acting Assistant Secretary, \naddressed to me, dated March 9.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: Thank you for your inquiry regarding \n     Presidential Determination No. 2009-15, signed on January 27, \n     2009, which approved a $20.3 million drawdown from the \n     Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (ERMA) to \n     assist Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza. \n     These funds will be used to provide humanitarian assistance \n     to Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza. None of \n     these funds will be used to resettle Gazans in the United \n     States.\n       We appreciate your inquiry regarding this U.S. humanitarian \n     program. If we can be of further assistance on this or any \n     other issue, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Michael C. Polt,\n\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will read the two specific sentences from \nthe letter that cleared up this matter. The letter says:\n\n       These funds will be used to provide humanitarian assistance \n     to Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza. None of \n     these funds will be used to resettle Gazans in the United \n     States.\n\n  As a result of that assurance, the amendment is not necessary, and \nthat is one less vote my colleagues have to take this afternoon.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 615\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I wish to talk about my amendment \ndealing with the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. Unfortunately, if \nthe current bill should pass, this program will end. There is specific \nlanguage in the bill that says unless this program is reauthorized and \nthe DC City Council approves it, 1,700 children will lose their \nopportunity scholarships that allow them to attend a private school in \nthe District of Columbia. That is unfortunate, and that is why my \namendment must be adopted.\n  When we take a close look at the data on DC schools, it is no wonder \nthe DC opportunity scholarship parents are so vocal about keeping this \nprogram alive. Here in the District of Columbia, public schools spend, \non average, over $14,000 per year per student. The DC class size has \none of the lowest student-teacher ratios in the country, 14 to 1. Yet \nreading scores continue to languish at or near the bottom in every \nnational assessment. Recent data shows that 69 percent of fourth \ngraders in the DC Public Schools are reading below basic levels as \ndefined by the Department of Education. DC students in DC Public \nSchools ranked last in the Nation in both SAT and ACT scores. About 42 \npercent of DC students drop out of school.\n  Beyond the low performance in the classroom, DC schools are often \nviolent and dangerous. A Federal government study found that roughly 12 \npercent of DC students were threatened or injured by someone possessing \na weapon on school property during a recent school year. This \npercentage is well above the national average. Perhaps, it is because \nof these statistics, that President Obama chose to enroll both his \ndaughters in a private school.\n  Let's see what his Secretary of Education said about the DC \nscholarship program:\n\n       I don't think it makes sense to take kids out of a school \n     where they're happy and safe and satisfied and learning. I \n     think those kids need to stay in their school.\n\n  Secretary Duncan was referring to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram, the same program we are trying to save today.\n  Michelle Rhee, the Chancellor of DC city schools said:\n\n       I would never, as long as I am in this role, do anything to \n     limit another parent's ability to make a choice for their \n     child. Ever.\n\n  That is what she said.\n  DC Mayor Fenty said:\n\n       We should not disrupt the education of children who are \n     presently enrolled in private schools through the DC \n     Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n\n  Last Friday, Senator Durbin, the senior Senator from Illinois, made \nsome charges against this DC Opportunity Scholarship Program that I \nwish to address. Senator Durbin claims the program doesn't work. He \nclaimed the Department of Education study proves the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program doesn't work. What Senator Durbin failed to mention \nwere some of the fundamental flaws of the Department of Education \nstudy. First, the study fails to examine the performance\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\nof students who actually took advantage of the scholarship and actually \nattended private school versus the performance of those who attended \npublic schools. Instead, it compares the students who were just offered \nthe scholarships to those in public schools. In fact, over a quarter of \nthe students who were considered private school participants for \npurposes of this study did not even attend the private schools.\n  This study has many flaws and we could go through all of them. How \ncan the program be considered not working yet there are 1,700 kids \nwhose parents showed they are satisfied and that think their kids are \ngetting a better education? The parents are happier, and they can sleep \nwell knowing their kids are going to safer schools. I believe that if \nthere were more than 1,700 scholarships available, there would be a lot \nmore people who would be enrolled in the program because of the \nsatisfaction of both the parents and the teachers.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, 37 percent of the members in \nthe House of Representatives and 45 percent of Senators send their \nchildren to private schools. That is almost four times the rate of the \ngeneral population. The senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nstated on Friday that he and his wife sent their children to private \nCatholic schools. He said this was their choice, and it was a personal \nfamily decision. I respect Senator Durbin's choice to send his own \nchildren to private schools, but why should the choice to send children \nto private schools be the right of only a privileged Senator's family \nor those who make a lot of money?\n  Keep in mind, the 1,700 children we are talking about come from \nfamilies whose average income is less than $23,000 a year. A good \neducation is a civil right, and this should not be the exclusive \npurview of the rich or the well connected.\n  Before closing, I wish to highlight some of the stories of success in \nthe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program so it can be clear who is losing \nout because of the Democrats' efforts to kill the Program. I wish to \nput some names with some of the faces and show how important this \nprogram truly is.\n  Sarah and James Parker attend the Sidwell Friends School in our \nNation's Capital with President Obama's children. Here they are right \nhere. Unlike the Obama girls, they could not afford this school without \nthe $7,500 voucher they received from the DC Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram. Now, keep in mind, these two students are funded at half what \nit costs to send a child to DC Public Schools. Every time we take these \nstudents out of the public schools in Washington, the DC Public Schools \nsave money. So why would we want to end this program? Plus the fact \nthat these kids love going to school where they are going.\n  Now, Sanya Arias is a scholarship recipient who lives in Adams \nMorgan. She said some of her friends she went to school with in middle \nschool and who now attend public high school speak using profanities \nand aren't making the kind of progress she is making academically. This \nis Sanya, here. Sanya said in middle school she started slacking off \nand she would have probably followed her friends' path if she didn't \nreceive the scholarship to attend private school. Sanya currently has a \nGPA of 3.95. She is vice president of her class, captain of the soccer \nteam, a player on the lacrosse team, president of the International \nClub, and a peer minister. This is the type of student the Democrats \nare going to take out of a school that she loves so much.\n  Rashawn is 16 years of age and started school in 1996. His father had \nhim tested and found he was 3 years behind his grade level. The \nscholarship program gave him the opportunity to attend Academia De La \nRecta Christian Day School where Rashawn has said: ``I can now do my \nclasswork with very little help'' because of this scholarship.\n  Dominique, who is Rashawn's sister, is a 14-year-old girl who lives \nin Washington, DC. She is now attending the same school and, in \nDominique's own words, she says: ``I love my school, and I am working \non my level and my grade.''\n  Breanna Williams is a 9-year-old girl in the fourth grade. She loves \nher new school, St. Peter's, because she is getting all As and Bs. She \nloves to read and is doing that at a level above her grade. In \naddition, Breanna plays the clarinet in the school band and when \nBreanna grows up, she wants to be a translator who travels the world.\n  I would be remiss if I did not reintroduce you to Ronald Holassie. He \nis a 10th grader at Archbishop Carroll High School in the District, \nwhere he is thriving--running track, studying physics, mentoring \nmiddle-school students. Further, he has just been appointed as DC's \ndeputy youth mayor. Ronald said that maintaining the DC opportunity \nscholarship is his chief legislative priority. Ending the program will \nsend Ronald, who is just a sophomore, to Woodson High School, a failing \nschool under the No Child Left Behind Act, for his senior year.\n  Individually and collectively, these students demonstrate just how \nimportant it is to continue the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program and \njust how wrong the program's opponents are to eliminate it for \npolitical purposes. We should continue this scholarship program and \nhelp students like the ones I just pointed out--help them to continue \nto succeed and to develop in our Nation's Capital. I ask President \nObama and the Democrats to keep Sarah, James, Sanya, Rashawn, \nDominique, Breanna, and Ronald in mind before deciding to kill the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program. I ask my colleagues to please join me \nin supporting this critical program.\n  Madam President, I will close with this. I met Ronald last week. I \nmet him and his folks. I met his little brother who is also in the \nprogram. I looked in their eyes and saw their heartfelt pleas to keep \nthis program going. I challenge any member to look into their eyes and \nthen vote against this program. We should be putting kids before \nspecial interest groups. Shouldn't our educational system be about \nkids? Shouldn't it be about their education and providing them the \nopportunities to compete in the 21st century?\n  I think the people who are against this program are afraid of this \nprogram for one reason--because it is actually working. This program is \nvery popular. The senior Senator from Illinois sends his kids to \nprivate school. Parents choose to send their kids to private schools \nbecause they want better education for their kids.\n  Let's give these children a chance at a better education. Let's prove \nthat it is working. Let's study the students and the program. Don't \nstop this program when it is still in its infancy. Let's decide how we \nneed to measure it, prove it is working or not working. But I predict \nthat at the end of the day, if we really follow these kids in an \nobjective manner, we will show this program has great promise, and \nmaybe we can even take it to other places in the country and help other \nlow-income kids get a better chance at a better education.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am glad I am here to speak in \nreference to the Ensign amendment. Senator Ensign mentioned my name \nseveral times during the course of that debate, which he is entitled to \ndo on the floor of the Senate. I would like to respond.\n  Five years ago, we started a program in the District of Columbia. It \nwas never tried before by the Federal Government. Here is the program. \nWe said we would give to the parents of up to 2,000 students Federal \nmoney to pay for the tuition costs of sending their kids to private \nschools. It was called the DC Voucher Program. At the time--it was \nproposed 5 years ago--it was proposed as a pilot program. It basically \nsaid we are going to do this on an experimental basis to see whether it \nworks, whether at the end of the day these kids going into private \nschools will turn out to be better and more successful students, and \nthen at the end of the authorizing period Congress will make a decision \nwhether to proceed forward with this program.\n  Sometime last year, I ended up with the responsibility of funding \nthis program just as it was about to expire. It was going to expire \nthis June, at the end of this school year. I said: I don't think that \nis fair. We have not done the evaluation we were supposed to do. We \nhave not considered reauthorizing the program as we planned to do. And \nwe do not want to leave 1,700 students and their families in suspense \nabout their future. So, unlike the statement\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\nmade by the Senator from Nevada, I did not end the program in the bill. \nI think he knows I did not. Instead, we extended it an additional year \nbeyond the authorization period. We said that we will cover the kids in \nthis program for not only the school year we are in right now but the \nnext school year, 2009 to 2010. I did not think it was fair for these \nkids to be uncertain about where they would be in the next school year \nwhile Congress did its work.\n  What has happened to this DC Voucher Program? Let me tell my \ncolleagues what happened initially to the DC Voucher Program. I offered \nthree amendments in the Senate Appropriations Committee to this \nprogram. Here is what they were, I say to Senator Ensign:\n  No. 1, I said that any DC voucher school teacher had to have a \ncollege degree. Is that a radical idea? Do you have any public schools \nin Nevada where the teachers do not have a college degree? We don't in \nIllinois. We put this up for a vote, and the people who were supporting \nthe DC Voucher Program voted it down. They said: We can't require \nteachers in these private schools to have a college degree. Imagine \nthat.\n  The second amendment I offered said the buildings that we will call \nDC voucher schools have to pass the Life Safety Code. They have to be \nsafe buildings so that if there is a fire in the building, the kids \nwill survive. I don't know of a single school in Nevada or Illinois \nthat is not in a safe building, an inspected building. Do you know what \nhappened to the amendment in the committee? They voted it down. They \ntold me: Don't get in the way of creativity. We have these voucher \nschools that are very creative. The teachers may not have college \ndegrees and the building may not be judged safe, but these are creative \nideas. This could work, Senator, step aside.\n  The third thing I said was that it is only fair, since we are all \ncritical of the current DC public schools and what is happening there, \nin most instances, that we have the same achievement test offered in \nthe voucher school as in the DC public school so that at the end of a \nyear or 2 years or 3 years, we can compare the results. Are the kids \nreally doing better? It was voted down.\n  Durbin, you are standing in the way of creativity. These are voucher \nschools. They don't need teachers with college degrees. They don't need \nto be in buildings that are inspected and safe. We don't need to have \ncomparable tests. You are missing the point.\n  I guess I did miss the point. Do you know what happened when the \nGeneral Accountability Office took a look at these schools? They found \nthat many of them were world-class schools. And I bet you the students \nthe Senator from Nevada was pointing to were the products of those \nschools. Do you know what they also found, I say to Senator Ensign. \nThey also found schools where somebody's mom or somebody's wife \ndeclared themselves principals and teachers and went in to teach \nwithout college degrees and received Federal subsidies to do it.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield when I finish.\n  They also found schools that did not pass the Life Safety Code \ninspection. They found schools where they had misrepresented what the \nbuilding was being used for. And, of course, there were no comparative \ntests they could use.\n  In my mind, if this were to be an experimental program, a pilot \nprogram, and we wanted to make sure that the kids were protected and \nthat at the end of the day we could measure the results honestly and \naccurately, you would have included these provisions. Unfortunately, \nthey were not included.\n  So now the question is, Should the Federal taxpayers continue to \nsubsidize the education of the students in the DC voucher schools? It \nis a legitimate question, and it is one that a serious committee should \nlook at. In fact, I think it should be a committee the Senator serves \non, and that is what we suggested. He is a member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Senator \nLieberman. He came to the floor when the Senator asked 2 weeks ago and \nstated publicly: Yes, I will have a hearing on the reauthorization of \nthe DC Voucher Program, and, in fact, has indicated to many of us that \nhe supports the program. He is no enemy of the program.\n  So when our bill says we ought to take a look at the total results of \nthe millions of dollars we put into DC voucher schools, let's judge how \nthe students are doing--incidentally, in the first year or two, it \nturned out that the test scores, when they tried to compare them, they \nsaid there doesn't seem to be much difference between students \nin voucher schools and those in public schools. Maybe that has changed. \nIt is certainly worth asking the question.\n\n  In this bill, I also require now that the teachers in the DC voucher \nschools in this next year have a college degree. Is that what you call \nending the program? I think it makes the program more responsible. I \nthink it makes the program more likely to produce students with a good \neducation.\n  Let me tell you what else happened. When the Department of Education \ntook a look at this program, they raised questions about whether the \npeople administering the program were spending the money wisely, \nwhether they were watching how the resources were gathered and spent. \nThere is a lot of talk about oversight here and a lot of criticism that \ntaxpayers' money and Government funds are being wasted. That is a fair \ncriticism of everything we do on the floor. Why should this program be \nany exception? Why should we create a standard for this program that is \ndifferent from any other program in Government or any agency of \nGovernment? I think it ought to withstand the oversight and review that \nevery single program does.\n  I want to also tell you that this provision which created these \nschools--the law is a DC City Council ordinance. It was codified. It \nwas made a law in the DC City Council, where it said specifically:\n\n       The Secretary may make grants under this section for a \n     period of not more than 5 years.\n\n  We have gone beyond 5 years. I have not only allowed it, I said we \nshould. It is only fair it go beyond at least an additional year. Now \nthe Senator from Nevada objects to the DC government itself deciding \nwhether to continue this program. For a lot of people who come to this \nfloor and talk about home rule, local control of schools, they are \nbasically saying to DC: You don't have any voice in this matter. You \nare our laboratory. We will decide what happens to your school right \nhere in Congress.\n  The Senate and the House of Representatives are filled with many \ngifted politicians, people who have served in many offices throughout \ntheir careers and bring that service as an experience to help them \nserve in the Senate. But it turns out that many of them, more than \nanything else, always wanted to be mayors, and in particular Mayor of \nthe District of Columbia. Time and again, this Congress--and an attempt \nis being made right now--tries to preempt the District of Columbia from \nmaking its own choices for its own citizens. I would no more think of \nimposing on Las Vegas, NV, an education program that its school \ndistrict did not want, would not accept, without saying to them: You \nought to have a voice in this as well.\n  So at the end of the day, we say the program needs to be reauthorized \nto make sure it is working, that the money is not being wasted, and the \nprogram needs to be approved by the DC City Council.\n  I have met some of these students to whom Senator Ensign has \nreferred. They are truly impressive. They tell a wonderful story about \nlives that were turned around and new opportunities. And that is \nexactly what I wanted to create for my children and what everyone else \nwants to create. But believe me, we are not going to create new \nopportunities when we have DC voucher schools stuck in the basement of \na home where the principal has no academic credentials and the teachers \ndo not have college degrees. We are not going to create excellence in \nbuildings which are dangerous for kids to be in. We are not going to \ncreate excellence until we have accurate measurement between the \nprogress students are making in the DC voucher schools and in the \npublic schools as well.\n  While we are engaged in this conversation, many on the other side--I \nam not pointing at the Senator from Nevada when I say this--many on the \nother side have completely given up on the DC public schools. They are \nwrong.\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\nMichelle Rhee is the new chancellor of education in the District of \nColumbia. She is an extraordinarily talented young woman who has come \nfrom the Teach For America Program, one of the most successful new \nprograms and largest employer of college grads in America. She was \nsuccessful in Baltimore in bringing back a classroom that had fallen \nbehind. She went up to New York to recruit nontraditional teachers. And \nshe is now here with the same dedication and commitment. I am not about \nto give up on DC public schools. I honestly believe the vast majority \nof kids are going to be in those public schools, and they deserve a \ndecent education. As much as we can help them, we should. To despair \nand say there is no hope for these public schools is not fair to \nMichelle Rhee, to the new Mayor, Mayor Fenty, or to those who want to \nsee this new day in education in the District of Columbia.\n  I think an honest evaluation of the DC voucher schools, as well as \nthe DC charter schools, and a commitment to reform in the DC public \nschools is the answer. For those who want to stop and say no \nevaluation, no reauthorization, no investigation, spend the money on \nthe program, no questions asked, I am going to say no. I am going to \nfight this amendment because I think it is a move in the wrong \ndirection. It is a move away from accountability. It is a move away \nfrom a local voice in the future of the education of kids in the \nDistrict of Columbia. And it is a movement away from quality and back \nto the DC voucher original model that did not include the most basic \nstandards we require of virtually every public school in America.\n  I can tell you that many who are participating in the DC Voucher \nProgram agree with the reforms I have suggested. I have talked with \nthem about it. There are those who will resist it. We cannot let them \nwin the day by adopting the Ensign amendment.\n  Now I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank Senator Durbin for yielding.\n  Madam President, is the Senator aware that in all of the private \nschools these kids are attending the core subject teachers have 4-year \ndegrees and that it was only in subjects such as art and wood shop that \nthey did not necessarily have 4-year degrees? Madam President, I ask \nthe Senator from Illinois, through the Chair, whether he is aware of \nthat.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Nevada that \nthe complement of teachers in the DC voucher schools has changed and \nimproved over the years, there is no question about that. But it is \nalso true to say that the standards imposed on the DC public school \nteachers are not being followed by the teachers in the DC voucher \nschools. We have created a double standard. As far as I am concerned, \nif you are arguing that we shouldn't require all teachers to have the \nappropriate academic credentials based on the course they teach, I ask \nin response, through the Chair, is that the standard you are suggesting \nfor your home State of Nevada?\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I actually send my kids to schools where \nnot all of the teachers in core subjects have 4-year degrees. But if a \nteacher is teaching art, if a teacher is teaching woodshop, or some \nother kind of program, I would ask: Does the Senator from Illinois \nreally believe imposing that on private schools is necessary?\n  You send your kids to private schools just as I am sending my kids to \nprivate schools. We sent them where we thought they would get a good \neducation. Does the Senator think these parents who are taking \nadvantage of these programs don't care enough about their kids to send \nthem to the best schools? That is why they are choosing to get them out \nof public schools. Wouldn't the Senator from Illinois agree those are \nwise parents signing up voluntarily for this program because they care \nabout their kids?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to respond to the Senator--I know our time \nis about to end--by saying that when the GAO did their study, \nincidentally, they found what you stated on the floor was not exactly \nthe case. It turned out there were teachers in so-called ``core \nacademic subjects'' without college degrees. Those subjects include \nEnglish, reading, and language arts, math, science, foreign language, \ncivics and government, economics, art, history, and geography. That is \nthe definition of core academic subjects. And the teachers in many \nvoucher schools did not meet those requirements.\n  I might also say to the Senator from Nevada that my wife and I made a \npersonal decision to send our children to Catholic schools, knowing we \nwould be paying public property taxes in my hometown of Springfield, \nIL, to support public education, and we had an additional financial \nburden on our family to pay for tuition, as you have. We accepted that \nburden, and I believe it is part of the bargain. We support public \neducation, but we made a family decision to pay for our kids to go to \nCatholic schools.\n  I have supported public school referenda throughout my time in my \nhometown. I believe public education is the core when it comes to the \ndevelopment of the community. In my hometown of East St. Louis, when \nthe public schools went to Haiti, the Catholic schools followed quickly \nbehind. They are all in this together.\n  Madam President, I know we have run out of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/10/senate-section/article/S2930-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, what is the pending order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no pending order. There has been no \nunanimous consent. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill that is before us. I think this debate \nhas been good. We have had amendments. I thank the majority leader for \nallowing amendments to be offered. I note that not one amendment has \nbeen agreed to, but nevertheless we have had the debate and I think the \nAmerican people do deserve to know more about this bill and why there \nare so many objections to it.\n  I am speaking against it today because of its sheer size. It is a \n$408 billion bill. But when you account for the previous bills that \nhave already passed appropriations this fiscal year for defense, \nmilitary construction, veterans affairs, and homeland security, the \nbottom line is for fiscal year 2009 we are going to spend $1 trillion. \nPassage of this bill will mark the first time in U.S. history that our \nregular appropriations process, funding Government in the routine and \nregular order, will surpass $1 trillion.\n  Last week I offered an amendment. Senator McCain offered an \namendment, Senator Coburn offered several amendments, Senator DeMint, \nSenator Vitter, Senator Kyl--so many amendments have been offered but \nthey were basically different ways to bring down the cost of this bill \nto some kind of responsible, agreed-upon area so we can say we are \ndoing the people's bidding by taking care of taxpayer dollars. That is \nwhat we tried to do.\n  First, Senator McCain offered an amendment to say let's do a \ncontinuing resolution that funds Government at 2008 levels until \nOctober 1, the end of the fiscal year. Next, an amendment was offered \nby Senator Ensign that basically said 2008 spending levels, but with \nthe new bill, with the new authorizations. It will have all of the \ncongressional imprint but it will be 2008 levels. That failed.\n  My amendment was 2008 levels with the rate of inflation, so instead \nof an 8-percent increase in spending in a 1-year period, double the \nrate of inflation, it would have been a 3.8 percent increase from 2008, \nwhich I thought was quite reasonable. Furthermore, I said let's decide \nthat we will only take it from the accounts in the bill before us that \nduplicate what we passed in the stimulus bill weeks ago. In that way, \nwe would say to the American people we are going to fund the Government \nat 2008 levels plus the rate of inflation, and the way we are going to \ncut it back is to let the Appropriations Committee decide which of the \nduplicated accounts that were passed in the stimulus bill 2 weeks ago \nwould be taken\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\nout--either the stimulus bill or the bill before us. That was my \namendment and it too failed.\n  We have tried everything we know how to do in a reasonable and \nresponsible way to say to the American people: Everyone is hurting \nright now and we should not be spending in the regular order on regular \nGovernment business, 8 percent above last year's rate. My amendment \nwould have been a 1-percent cut from this bill and the Appropriations \nCommittee could have chosen where that went. I also suggested that we \ntake it out of the duplicate measures that we passed within 1 month of \neach other. The American people expect more responsible actions from \nCongress than spending without restraint.\n  I hear from my constituents all the time. A lot of common sense is \ncoming out of my constituents. I wish we could export the good old \nTexas common sense to the Congress because what we are saying is why \ndon't we look at the big picture here? Instead of a $1 trillion \nstimulus spending package on top of $1 trillion to fund Government for \nthe next 9 months, and furthermore we have not even dealt with the \nfinancial institutions yet, why don't we step back and look at the \nproblem we have, which is that our financial institutions are not \nworking, our small businesses are not getting credit so they are not \nable to borrow to stay in business, and the housing market is in the \ntank? We have not addressed those issues yet and here we are, spending \nas if there is no restraint, adding to the debt because we do not have \nthe money in the bank. I cannot think of anything more irresponsible \nthan what we are doing in these last couple of months in the Congress.\n  Actually, the stimulus packages from last year were also erroneous. \nBut couldn't we have learned from the mistakes? Couldn't we have \nlearned from what did not work in the first stimulus package? But, no, \nwe do not seem to have learned, even though it was less than a year \nago. I think the American people are showing the concern they have \nbecause the stock market is low, and is not getting stabilized.\n  Now we have coming on the heels of this omnibus bill, which we are \nnot accounting for, a $3.6 trillion budget proposed by the President \nwith a deficit for 2010 projected at $1.75 trillion. The cumulative \ndebt of America today is $11 trillion. The proposed budget plan \nrecently suggested a doubling of this debt over the long term.\n  Mr. President, 25 percent of the national debt that we are \naccumulating is owned by foreigners. The Chinese Government owns almost \n$700 billion of our debt. This is the same Chinese Government that last \nweekend took a rather hostile action toward one of our naval vessels in \nthe South China Sea. I think we should be looking at the national \nsecurity implications of having so much of our country's debt in the \nhands of any foreign country or any foreign national.\n  In addition to the concerns about whether the borrowers are going to \nbuy our debt--what if they say: $10 trillion, $11 trillion, you know, \nmaybe we will buy your debt, but the risk is too great and we will have \nto jack up the interest rate? What is that going to do to an economy \nthat is teetering so badly?\n  I do not think we can turn a blind eye to the long-term consequences \nof this debt burden. It is not only irresponsible but it borders on \nbeing reckless. When are we going to stop it? If not today, then when? \nWe have a chance today to say to the American people we will go back to \nthe drawing boards and we will put reasonable limits on the amount of \ndebt we are accumulating. We will put limits on the deficits that are \nbeing created. I think we should go back to 2008 levels because we \npassed a $1 trillion spending plan. Why not go back to 2008 levels and \ntake out the duplication from the stimulus bill and what is in the bill \nbefore us today? That would be a responsible action that might start \ngiving confidence to the American people that the Congress and the \nPresident will be able to work together in a bipartisan way to act \nresponsibly, with the big picture in mind. I urge the President of the \nUnited States not to go forward with the budget that he has put \nforward, not to go forward with an energy plan that is going to start \nincreasing taxes on every electric bill that every consumer in this \ncountry will have, but instead to step back and say let's fix the \nfinancial industries. Let's fix the financial institutions. The idea \nhas been propounded is that the FDIC is going to start putting an \nassessment on every bank deposit to pay for these other schemes that \nhave no impact whatsoever.\n  There are a lot of things coming out of here that do not make sense. \nI think it is time for us to begin to show the American people we are \ngoing to step back. We are going to fix the financial markets so people \ncan borrow to make payroll and keep people working, so people can stay \nin their homes and not get foreclosed, and to shore up the housing \nindustry and help them start building and selling homes again.\n  If we can start there, then we will know what kind of stimulus we \nneed, or what kind of further spending would be in the best interest of \nthis country to get our economy going again. But until then, we should \nnot pass the bill before us today. We should go back to the drawing \nboard and begin responsible, bipartisan leadership from Congress and \nthe President on behalf of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 662\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 662, and make it pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune], for himself, Mr. \n     DeMint, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 662.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by the Federal Communications \n           Commission to repromulgate the Fairness Doctrine)\n\n       On page 410, after line 2, insert the following:\n       Sec. 753.  None of the funds appropriated in this Act may \n     be used by the Federal Communications Commission to prescribe \n     any rule, regulation, policy, doctrine, standard, guideline, \n     or other requirement that has the purpose or effect of \n     reinstating or repromulgating (in whole or in part) the \n     requirement that broadcasters present or ascertain opposing \n     viewpoints on issues of public importance, commonly referred \n     to as the ``Fairness Doctrine'', as such doctrine was \n     repealed in In re Complaint of Syracuse Peace Council against \n     Television Station WTVH, Syracuse New York, 2 FCC Rcd. 5043 \n     (1987).\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, 87 Members of the Senate voted \nto uphold our first amendment rights by supporting a statutory \nprohibition on the so-called fairness doctrine. The amendment was \noffered by Senator DeMint and was accepted as part of the DC voting \nrights bill which is currently awaiting consideration by the House of \nRepresentatives. I am concerned that once the House considers this \nbill, whenever that might occur, and the Senate and House versions are \nconferenced together, this provision will no longer be a part of the \nfinal DC voting rights bill.\n  I will say I am hopeful that the DeMint amendment is retained in the \nfinal version of the DC Voting Rights Act, but I am fearful it will be \nstripped out behind closed doors when the conference committee gets \nunderway.\n  So I filed an amendment to the Omnibus appropriations bill that would \nprohibit the FCC from using any funds to reinstate the fairness \ndoctrine during the current fiscal year.\n  If this amendment is accepted to the omnibus bill, then the 87 \nSenators who supported this prohibition last week will have assurances \nthat the fairness doctrine will not be reinstated for the remainder of \nthis year regardless of whether the DeMint amendment remains part of \nthe DC Voting Rights Act.\n  I would also like to remind my colleagues a similar provision was \nincluded as part of the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus appropriations bill, \nsection 621, that was enacted into law last year. However, that \nlanguage was not included as part of the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  Now, one of the arguments that has been made against this amendment \nfrom my colleagues on the other side is, well, this issue is not that \nimportant. Nobody really cares about it. It is not going to happen.\n  If that is the case, then why is it that the prohibition on funding \nto reinstate the fairness doctrine was stripped out of this bill after \nit had been included in the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill?\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\n  The so-called fairness doctrine has a long and infamous history in \nour country. The FCC promulgated the fairness doctrine in 1949 to \nensure the contrasting viewpoints would be presented on radio and \ntelevision. In 1985, the FCC began repealing the doctrine after \nconcluding that it actually had the opposite effect.\n  They concluded then what we still know today, and that is the \nfairness doctrine resulted in broadcasters limiting coverage of \ncontroversial issues of public importance.\n  Now, recently, many on the left have advocated reinstating the \ndoctrine. They argue that broadcasters, including talk radio, should \npresent both sides of any issue because they use the public airwaves. \nHowever, recent calls to reinstate the fairness doctrine failed to take \ninto account several considerations, which I will mention in just a \nmoment. But in the event that there would be any question about whether \nthere are those out there who would like to see this happen--because \nthat has been one of the arguments raised in the course of the debate, \nthat nobody in here is very serious about really doing this--if you \nlook at what the Speaker of the House said when she was asked: Do you \npersonally support revival of the fairness doctrine? She said, ``Yes.''\n  The leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives recently \nsaid:\n\n       There is a real concern about the monopoly of information \n     and the skewering of information that the American public \n     gets.\n       First, as to the monopoly. Obviously if one group or a \n     large group controls information and only allows one \n     perspective to be presented, that is not good for democracy. \n     That is not good for the American public.\n\n  That is, of course, what the fairness doctrine is directed at. It can \nhave great merit. Those are the two top Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives, and those are statements made within the last year.\n  Then perhaps even more telling is what was said by a top staffer in \nthe House. And it says:\n\n       Conservative radio is a huge threat and political advantage \n     for Republicans, and we have had to find a way to limit it.\n\n  I would submit that really is what this is all about. We have had \nMembers on this side, in the Senate, on the other side of the aisle, \nwho have made similar statements. Recently, on a radio program one of \nmy colleagues on the other side was asked: Do you think there will be a \npush to reinstate the fairness doctrine? ``I don't know; I certainly \nhope so'' was the answer.\n  Do you support it? ``I do.''\n  I mean, would you want this radio station to have to change? ``I \nwould. I would want this station and all stations to present a balanced \nperspective and different point of view.''\n  What we are talking about is a first amendment right. In reality, the \nfairness doctrine resulted in less, not more, broadcasting of issues \nthat are important to the public because airing controversial issues \nsubjected broadcasters to regulatory burdens and potentially severe \nliabilities. They simply made the rational choice not to air any such \ncontent at all.\n  Now, the number of radio and TV stations and development of newer \nbroadcast media, such as cable and satellite TV and satellite radio, \nhave grown dramatically in the past 50 years. In 1949, there were 51 \ntelevision stations and about 2,500 radio stations in the entire United \nStates.\n  In 1985, there were 1,200 television stations and 9,800 radio \nstations. Today, there are nearly 1,800 television stations and nearly \n14,000 radio stations. There is simply no scarcity to justify content \nregulation such as the fairness doctrine.\n  The third point I will make is this: Development of new media, social \nnetworking, and access to the Internet has changed media forever. \nSupporters of government-mandated balance either ignore the new \nmultiple sources of media or they reveal their true intention, which is \nto regulate content on all forms of communication and ultimately stifle \ncertain viewpoints on certain media such as talk radio.\n  Fourth, broadcast content is driven by consumer demand. Consumers of \nmedia show whether they are being served well by broadcasters when they \nchoose either to tune in or turn off the programming that is being \noffered. The fairness doctrine runs counter to individual choice and \nfreedom to choose what we listen to or see on the air or read on the \nInternet.\n  The fairness doctrine should not be reinstated, and 2 weeks ago the \nSenate acted in a strong bipartisan manner in opposition to the \nfairness doctrine. I am asking the Senate to agree to my amendment \nbecause it simply prohibits any funding from being used to reinstate \nthe fairness doctrine just as we included as part of last year's \nOmnibus appropriations bill.\n  Adoption of my amendment would ensure that our first amendment rights \nare protected and that consumers have the freedom to choose what they \nsee and hear over our airwaves. This amendment ensures that the Federal \nCommunications Commission does not use any resources to reinstate the \nfairness doctrine through the end of the fiscal year until a more \npermanent solution can be reached through a statutory prohibition.\n  As I said, 2 weeks ago, the Senate adopted this by a vote of 87 to \n11. There were 87 Senators in the Senate who agreed to language that \nwas contained in the DeMint amendment to the DC Voting Rights Act.\n  Similar language prohibiting the FCC from reinstating the fairness \ndoctrine again, as I said earlier, was contained in last year's Omnibus \nappropriations bill. The administration of President Obama is on record \nopposing efforts to reinstate the fairness doctrine. It makes sense, in \nmy judgment, that we echo all of those statements and the vote that was \nmade by the Senate a couple of weeks ago by including a prohibition on \nfunding for the FCC to reinstate the fairness doctrine.\n  Again, we do not know what is going to happen in the DC Voting Rights \nAct, whether this provision is going to be stripped out, whether the \nDeMint amendment is going to be stripped out. So it is important, in my \nview, that we reinforce the vote by making a strong statement, at least \nfor this fiscal year's funding, that funding in the FCC cannot and will \nnot be used to reinstate the fairness doctrine.\n  There is no reason for the Senate not to vote for this language. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment and \nputting us on record when it comes to the funding that would be used to \nreinstate the fairness doctrine that this appropriations bill will not \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to engage my colleagues, Senator \nNelson and Senator Martinez, in a colloquy. And as I do, let me start \noff by saying, we want to take a moment to discuss some important \nprovisions in the omnibus bill. I discussed these provisions at length \nlast week on the Senate floor, and I want to give an update as to where \nthings stand today.\n  As I discussed last week, this bill includes three important foreign \npolicy changes with respect to Cuba that have not been subjected to \ndebate in this body. They have not gone to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, they have not been subject to a vote in either body, and \nthese modifications deserve a full examination. This has not taken \nplace. Instead, this body would have been forced to swallow these \nchanges in the crudest process I can imagine, without analysis, and \nwithout inclusion.\n  Since we have been unable to debate the substance of these \nprovisions, I have asked for a clarification, along with my colleagues, \nto the Secretary of the Treasury on the implementation of these \nprovisions and expressed my concern for their possible implications and \nthe unproductive signals they might send to those who are fighting for \ndemocratic change on the island.\n  We did this to get clear, first, of what might have been major \nloopholes that could have been exploited by individuals or \norganizations seeking to circumvent the longstanding and necessary \neconomic embargo. In response, Secretary Geithner has provided me with \ntwo letters that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2009.\n     Senator Robert Menendez,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I understand that you have concerns with \n     provisions of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 that would \n     amend Cuba sanctions on travel and agricultural and medical \n     trade. As you know, the Obama Administration had nothing to \n     do with these or any other provisions of that bill.\n       We are, however, currently reviewing United States policy \n     toward Cuba to determine the best way to foster democratic \n     change in Cuba and improve the lives of the Cuban people. \n     Your views and the views of others on Capitol Hill will be \n     important to that review, and the President remains committed \n     to consulting with you as we consider changes to Cuba policy.\n       I understand that one of your chief concerns with the \n     Omnibus is Section 622, which would prohibit the Treasury \n     Department from using funds to administer, implement, or \n     enforce the current definition of ``cash in advance,'' which \n     is one of the permissible ways to finance exports to Cuba. \n     Treasury believes that this change likely will have no \n     influence on current financing rules. The term ``cash in \n     advance'' is in the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n     Enhancement Act of 2000 and therefore private parties are and \n     will continue to be statutorily required to comply with those \n     payment terms. Because the bill's language does not modify or \n     negate the statutory requirement in the 2000 Act, exporters \n     will still be required to receive payment in advance of \n     shipment and will not be permitted to export to Cuba on \n     credit other than through third-country banks.\n       I also understand you are concerned about Section 620. As \n     you know that is a provision that will also be administered \n     by the Department of the Treasury. I can assure you that \n     regulations promulgated pursuant to that provision will seek \n     to ensure that only travel for credible sales of food and \n     medical products is authorized.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Timothy F. Geithner,\n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Robert Menendez,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Menendez: You have expressed concerns to me \n     about provisions of H.R. 1105, the FY 2009 Omnibus \n     Appropriations bill, regarding Cuba sanctions. You have also \n     shared your views regarding Section 620 of the bill, which \n     relates specifically to travel to Cuba for the commercial \n     sales of agricultural and medical goods pursuant to the Trade \n     Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.\n       Section 620 would be administered by the Department of the \n     Treasury. The regulations promulgated pursuant to that \n     provision would provide that the representatives of only a \n     narrow class of businesses would be eligible, under a new \n     general license, to travel to Cuba to market and sell \n     agricultural and medical goods. Any business using the \n     general license would be required to provide both advance \n     written notice outlining the purpose and scope of the planned \n     travel and, upon return, a report outlining the activities \n     conducted, including the persons with whom they met, the \n     expenses incurred, and business conducted in Cuba. All \n     travelers who take advantage of the general license would \n     also have their daily expenses limited to the then-applicable \n     State Department per diem rate.\n       It is my hope that this letter has assisted you in \n     understanding how the Treasury Department would implement \n     Section 620 of H.R. 1105, the FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations \n     bill. If there is anything that I can do to be of assistance \n     in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Timothy F. Geithner,\n                                        Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Section 620 liberalizes individual travel regulations \nto Cuba for the promotion of agricultural and medical sales. This \nprovision would systemically broaden the category of licenses available \nand allow individuals, in a self-policing manner, to travel to the \nisland under the auspices of selling such supplies.\n  While I am sympathetic to the U.S. agricultural industry, I remain \nconcerned that provision was written with the aim not of benefitting \nthe private sector but, rather, of undercutting the current travel \nregulations for individuals and putting a wedge in a broader issue of \ndenying our currency to the Castro regime. Depending on how this \nprovision was implemented, it could encourage a radical break in \nexisting travel regulations and provide the Castro regime with enhanced \nfinancial benefit in the pursuit of its repressive policies.\n  As a result, we asked Secretary Geithner specifically how the \nprovision would be implemented. Secretary Geithner assured us in his \nletter dated March 5, 2009:\n\n       Regulations promulgated pursuant to that provision, \n     [Section 620] will seek to ensure that only travel for \n     credible sales of food and medical products is authorized.\n\n  In his letter dated March 9, 2009, Secretary Geithner wrote:\n\n       The regulations promulgated pursuant to that to provision \n     [Section 620] would provide that the representatives of only \n     a narrow class of business would be eligible, under a new \n     general license, to travel to Cuba to market and sell \n     agricultural and medical goods. Any business using the \n     general license would be required to provide both advance \n     written notice outlining the purpose and scope of the planned \n     travel and, upon return, a report outlining the activities \n     conducted, including the persons with whom they met, the \n     expenses incurred, and business conducted in Cuba.\n\n  Section 622 concerns cash in advance payments. This provision would \nstrip the ability of the Department of the Treasury to enforce a 2005 \namendment that defined the term ``cash in advance.''\n  In his March 5 letter, Secretary Geithner wrote that the U.S. \nTreasury ``believes that this change likely will have no influence on \ncurrent financing rules. The term `cash in advance' is in the Trade \nSanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 and therefore \nprivate parties are and will continue to be statutorily required to \ncomply with those payment terms. Because the bill's language does not \nmodify or negate the statutory requirement in the 2000 Act, exporters \nwill still be required to receive payments in advance of shipment and \nwill not be permitted to export to Cuba on credit other than through \nthird-country banks.''\n  Which is the law today.\n  This comes particularly at a moment that is very important. The Paris \nClub recently announced that Cuba has defaulted on over $9 billion of \nobligations. At a time that we are facing challenges in the United \nStates in terms of our financial institutions and credit, in general, \nto be giving credit to a country that has not only a repressive policy \nbut has $30 billion in default is not, in my mind, good policy.\n  President Obama said:\n\n       My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word: \n     Libertad----\n\n  Which means freedom--\n\n     and the road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with \n     justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the rights of free \n     speech, a free press and freedom of assembly; and it must \n     lead to elections that are free and fair.\n\n  I could not agree more with President Obama on this point, and I \nfully support him in moving forward in this direction.\n  Finally, I know some of my colleagues might be confused about my \npersistence with this issue over the last couple of weeks. So let me \nclarify what, for me, is a principled position.\n  First, I have many citizens in New Jersey whose personal stories \nspeak powerfully to the repression of the Castro regime. Many of them \nhave spent 10 to 20 years of their lives in a prison cell. Their only \ncrime was trying to seek peaceful change in their country. They are now \nproud U.S. citizens. But they languished in a jail for a decade or two \ndecades simply for seeking to make peaceful change. Many of them were \ntortured in that process. They are a powerful reminder to me every day, \nwhen I am back in New Jersey, of that reality.\n\n  Second, let me propose that for some it is difficult to imagine the \ndeep personal significance these changes have for the human rights and \ndemocracy activists on the island who fight for the ability to speak \nfreely and think freely, as well as my own personal convictions on this \nissue that my family has both lived under and died trying to change.\n  Changes in our Nation's policy toward Cuba, such as changes in our \nNation's policy toward any nation our country determines a state \nsponsor of terrorism--such as Iran, Sudan, and Syria--are extremely \ndelicate policy issues. Any such changes in our policy with these \ncountries deserve a democratic debate and careful deliberation. It is \nsimply undemocratic to tuck them in the middle of a large unrelated but \nmust-pass spending bill.\n  I thank Secretary Geithner for his understanding of the sensitivity \nof these issues, working with Senator Nelson and myself to ensure that \nthe spirit of the legislation is carried out\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\nin a responsible manner. I also thank my colleagues in the Senate who \nhave worked with us on this and others who have understood and Majority \nLeader Reid for working with me on getting clarification on the \nimplementation of these provisions. It is disappointing that the \nprocess unfolded in this way. We will look just as unkindly upon any \nfuture attempts to make significant foreign policy decisions of any \nsort, not only about Cuba, in this type of secretive and undemocratic \nmanner. Instead, I wish to work with my colleagues in an open and \ntransparent manner to deliberate the substance before we get to this \npoint, even though, at the end of the day, we may still not find common \nground. I would, of course, prefer that the provisions not be in this \nbill at all. But the assurances I have received from Secretary Geithner \nhave allayed my most significant concerns, and I will vote in favor of \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  I yield to the distinguished senior Senator from Florida, who has \nbeen an ally in this effort to ensure that the clarifications needed \nwere there. He is a tremendous advocate for freedom and democracy for \nthe people of Cuba. I was privileged to work with him in getting the \nclarifications and making sure we are in a position so human rights \nactivists and political dissidents in Cuba still have their opportunity \nto create change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I commend Senator Menendez for \nthe conviction and passion with which he comes to this important \nposition of influencing the Senate on this particular issue. I likewise \nwish to say the same thing about my colleague from Florida who has been \nmy good friend for 31 years and who comes to this issue with equal \npassion and commitment. I thank my colleague from Florida for coming \nout here on the floor. Even though this issue was negotiated among \nSenator Menendez and myself and Secretary Geithner, he is willing to \ncome and stand to embrace the product of our work.\n  I wish to call to the attention of the Senate that our majority \nleader, Senator Reid of Nevada, came up to me and indicated he supports \nthis and wanted me to state that to the Senate.\n  I came to Congress 30 years ago. This issue has been an issue that \nany Floridian has lived with for a long time. I have supported an \neconomic embargo against Cuba along with a ban on tourist travel to the \nisland. I am a supporter of isolating the regime in Havana and giving \nthe Cuban people the democracy they so desperately seek. The provisions \nin this omnibus that came out of the Appropriations Committee did not \ndo away with the embargo but did weaken it. I think the better course \nis to allow our new President to undertake his own review of U.S. \npolicy toward Cuba before pushing hasty and ill-advised language \nthrough on an omnibus bill, as Senator Menendez said, that was crafted \nbehind closed doors, kept from public view, and kept from the rest of \nthe Senate's view until it was disgorged from the full committee only a \ncouple weeks ago; ``it'' being the omnibus, a must-pass piece of \nlegislation to keep the Government functioning.\n  As Senator Menendez has outlined, we reached out to the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and to the White House to clarify the implementation and \nenforcement of these regulations. Senator Menendez has already put into \nthe Record Secretary Geithner's letter of March 5 and his responsive \nclarification in a letter of March 9. I wish to enter into the Record \nthe letter Senator Menendez and I sent to Secretary Geithner on March \n6, memorializing the personal conversation we had with him, to which he \nso graciously then followed up with his letter of March 9.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2009.\n     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,\n     Secretary of the Treasury, Department of the Treasury, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Geithner: We appreciate your recent \n     correspondence clarifying the implementation of Sec. 622 of \n     the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009. As we discussed last \n     night, we continue to have serious concerns with Section 620. \n     Thank you for your personal commitment that the Department of \n     the Treasury will promulgate regulations pursuant to Section \n     620 that:\n       1. Provide a narrow definition of the eligible businesses \n     that may travel to Cuba to sell agricultural and medical \n     products under a general license;\n       2. Require written notice to the Office of Foreign Assets \n     Control (OFAC) in advance of travel to Cuba outlining the \n     purpose and scope of such travel to Cuba, pursuant to the \n     provisions as defined above;\n       3. Require a filing upon return of travel to Cuba by \n     travelers outlining activities conducted, including persons \n     with whom they met, the amount of expenses incurred, and the \n     business conducted; and\n       4. Limit such travelers to the current Department of State \n     per diem.\n       Currently, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) \n     pursues significant enforcement with regard to travel \n     regulations relating to Cuba. We would expect that such \n     enforcement would not be diminished in the ultimate \n     enforcement of the regulations outlined above.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Menendez.\n     Bill Nelson.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would like to engage my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Martinez, in this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank my two colleagues from New \nJersey and Florida for what they have had to say but most of all for \nthe work they have done. They have done good work. We have stood \ntogether, the three of us, along with others but particularly the three \nof us with the most immediate concern with this issue, in a way that is \nheartening. To me, oftentimes I have seen our names written as \nhardliners on Cuba. I prefer to think of ourselves as voices of freedom \nstanding to oppression. That is what is at stake. People in the \ndistrict of Senator Menendez and people in Florida, countless of them, \nwe know their stories. We know their names. We know their suffering. It \nisn't about settling an old score because these conditions continue \neven today. Oscar Elias Biscet, to name one. He is in jail. His family \nseldom gets to visit him. His health is in peril. It is because of all \nthese things that are not only part of history, but they are also part \nof today's reality, that we stand on the side of freedom. That means a \nstate that is a sponsor of terror needs to be treated differently.\n  I daresay that while I might not agree with everything that might be \ndone, I trust President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton to do a \nreview of our policy toward Cuba and then, perhaps in the light of day, \nhave a discussion about what would and would not be appropriate. What I \nwould object to is anything that would be unilateral, that simply would \nsay: We will do this, that and the other thing and expect nothing on \nbehalf of those oppressed people of Cuba. We need to expect that there \nwill be reciprocity of some type, that there will be steps taken by the \nCuban Government contrary to what they seem to have done last week, \nwhich is to circle the wagons and hint of more military control of the \nGovernment and more repression for the people.\n  I deeply thank both Senators Nelson and Menendez for what they were \nable to accomplish in this misguided piece of legislation. I agree with \nthem, it was inserted in the dark of night with no debate and \ndiscussion. The letters and the understanding they have reached with \nthe Secretary of the Treasury handles the problem as it relates to \nagricultural sales to Cuba as well as the related licensing for travel \nrelating to doing business in Cuba.\n  We talk often about an embargo. This embargo supposedly is limited to \ntrade sanctions because we sell almost a billion dollars in \nagricultural goods to Cuba. We sell medicine. More humanitarian aid \nflows to Cuba from here than any other country in the world, hundreds \nof thousands, into the billions of dollars in remittances that go from \nfolks in this country to those in Cuba. Sadly, the Cuban Government \ntakes too big a cut out of it.\n  I look forward to this implementation, which I think fixes the \nproblem created by this misguided legislation. I thank both the \nSenators for their yeoman work in getting this accomplished. I remain \nconcerned about travel by family members. While I am not one to \nbegrudge anyone who wants to see an uncle or aunt, there will be a need \nfor regulations that will enshrine what I know will be a different \npolicy\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\nunder President Obama, and I respect that completely. But there needs \nto be some regulation about the frequency of travel and also about the \namount of per diem dollars carried back and forth to Cuba. I am sure \nthose will be forthcoming down the road.\n  I believe it is important we continue to request that if there is \ngoing to be legislating on this topic, that it be done in the open air, \nthat we have an opportunity for fair debate and for a legislative \nprocess that is worthy of the kind of institution we are.\n  I thank both my colleagues for the great work and appreciate the fact \nthat we have been able to maintain what is an important foreign policy \ninitiative that should never be disturbed in the way this was done but \nshould be left in the hands of the Executive and be done carefully, \nmeasuredly and after study and consideration.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank Senator Martinez again. \nIt is important we understand that when we have that full and fair and \nopen debate in the sunshine, we remember what Candidate Obama said \nduring the campaign. He said what he wanted to do was go back to the \nstatus quo ante on travel to Cuba by family members every year instead \nof once every 3 years and to have more remittances every quarter than \nwas cut back a few years ago by the previous administration. That seems \nto be common sense and family value oriented. That is what the \ncandidate who became our next President articulated.\n  Then once the new President announces his declaration of that policy, \nwe can come out here and openly debate that issue. While there has been \ndisagreement within this body over the most effective way for us to \nhelp the Cuban people, I believe if there is to be a new strategy \ntoward Cuba, we must have the opportunity for the Commander in Chief to \nlay it out, not have it come from the tinkering of a few lawmakers \ninserting language in a must-pass appropriations bill without any \nopportunity for debate.\n  I stand with our Cuban American families, many of them in Florida, \nwho have ties to loved ones still on the island. That is why I support \nPresident Obama's efforts to allow increased family travel once a year, \ninstead of only once every 3 years, and the increased remittances to \nfamily members.\n  Our job in guiding U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba is to isolate the \nCastro regime but not to prevent families from being able to take care \nof their loved ones. On the basis of these letters entered in the \nRecord today and on the personal assurance of the Secretary of the \nTreasury, which we appreciate very much, I have been assured by the \nadministration as to the implications and enforcement of these \nregulations. Although I agree with many of my colleagues that this \nomnibus bill is far from perfect, I believe it is in the best interests \nof the country to provide the badly needed operational funding for the \nU.S. Government and for other important initiatives.\n  This bill includes funding for lifesaving equipment at Florida \nhospitals, for sheriffs' offices, and for police departments to upgrade \ncommunications systems or to prevent kids from joining street gangs. It \nprovides money for cleaning up blighted downtown neighborhoods, for \nretraining workers who are losing their jobs, and for projects to save \none of the world's greatest natural treasures, the Florida Everglades. \nThese are just a few of the reasons why this legislation is so \nimportant.\n  If this bill, shepherded through this body by our esteemed chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye, were not to pass, \nNASA's contractors would have to start laying off skilled aerospace \nworkers developing the replacement of the space shuttle. So it is my \nintention to vote for cloture on the 2009 omnibus bill, and I urge our \ncolleagues to do so.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me now make some broader comments about the omnibus, having \nexpressed my concerns. And, again, in recognition and in light of the \nassurances we have received on the matter that Senator Nelson, Senator \nMartinez, and I have discussed, I have come to the floor today to \nsupport the omnibus bill.\n  It is an important measure to help our economy recover and keep \nessential public services running. It includes important funding for my \nhome State of New Jersey, including everything from an initial burst of \ncapital for a new trans-Hudson tunnel--incredibly important to move \nlarge numbers of people across the Hudson River to New York, and also \nfor reverse commutes, for economic opportunity, access to hospitals, a \nwhole host of critical issues in a way that is promoting mass transit \nand does so not only in terms of economic opportunity and an enormous \nnumber of jobs that will be created as a result of that but also as it \nrelates to the quality of life and the environment by moving a lot more \npeople in a high-speed, nonpolluting process versus through a car--to \nsupport for flood control and protection of our shore--which is \nincredibly important in terms of the tourism and fishing industry and \nthe economy of New Jersey--to grants that allow local law enforcement \nto have the latest technology to help the police officer on the beat.\n  This bill invests in education, strengthening our commitment to \nscience over the next decade so we can have a workforce that can \ncompete on a global playing field and be second to no one in terms of \nthat ability in those fields that are going to be the competitive \nfuture opportunities for our citizens and for our Nation.\n  It makes strong advances in health care. It includes more than $30 \nbillion for lifesaving research so that the National Institutes of \nHealth leaves no stone unturned in the search for treatment for cancer, \nfor diabetes, and the Alzheimer's that I have watched take over my \nstrong and proud mother.\n  The bill allows us to immunize an additional 15,000 children against \ndebilitating diseases. And it funds the Patient Navigator program I \nestablished to help citizens make their way through a complicated \nhealth care system.\n  The legislation puts resources toward revitalizing local communities \nand keeping families in their homes--because the housing crisis is at \nthe root of our overall economic crisis. It funds community and \neconomic development in over 1,000 cities and towns, gives competitive \ngrants to revitalize neighborhoods, and renews section 8 vouchers to \nhelp nearly 45,000 families keep a place to call home.\n  In short, the omnibus makes a broad range of the kind of worthy, \nneeded investments that will help our economy recover and our citizens \nget through this difficult time. I am happy to see the Senate move \nforward on this vitally important legislation. Although I know I am not \nthe only Senator to have felt frustration in this process, I wish to \ntake this opportunity to express that I am always open to discussions \nwith my colleagues, and I hope we can work together in the future to \nmake sure in the greatest deliberative body in the world we will all do \nour part to deliberate before we take significant action.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 662\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 662, \nan amendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota. This amendment \nwould prevent the Federal Communications Commission from reinstating \nthe fairness doctrine.\n  This amendment is totally unnecessary. There is no funding in this \nbill for the FCC to reinstate the fairness doctrine. This bill does not \ncontain any provisions directing the FCC to reinstate the fairness \ndoctrine.\n  Further, President Obama does not support reinstating the fairness \ndoctrine. The FCC repealed this doctrine in 1987, and has no plans to \nbring it back.\n  Finally, last week, 87 Senators, including myself, voted to include a \nsimilar amendment to the voting rights bill that would prevent the FCC \nfrom reinstating the fairness doctrine, which is exactly what this \namendment would do. So there is no question about Democratic support \nfor the position being proposed by the South Dakota Senator.\n  I wish to take a few seconds and talk about the history of this \nissue. The\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nfairness doctrine, which was originally adopted by the FCC in 1949--60 \nyears ago--is a concept that broadcasters should cover issues fairly, \nallowing for different viewpoints to be presented in a balanced way.\n  I agree with the goals the fairness doctrine advanced, but the need \nfor this policy today has become obsolete. In the 1950s, there were \nonly three nationwide broadcast stations--NBC, ABC, and CBS. There was \na legitimate public concern that the small number of media outlets \ncould abuse their power and present a biased public agenda. At that \ntime, the fairness doctrine was the right answer to a small and heavily \nconcentrated media world.\n  A lot has changed since the 1950s. Technology has exploded. There are \nmore ways than ever to hear a variety of perspectives and opinions on \nany number of issues. There are hundreds of channels on cable TV. We \nhave public broadcasting, which was nonexistent at that time. We have \nmore than 14,000 AM and FM radio stations, and hundreds of satellite \nradio stations. We also have the Internet.\n  As I stated earlier, the FCC repealed the provision in 1987, and has \nno plans to reinstate this doctrine. The amendment is simply an attempt \nto take an issue on which a vast majority of the Members of this \nChamber voted in agreement last week and offer it to an unrelated bill \nof significant importance to the day-to-day operation of our \nGovernment.\n  It does not belong in this bill. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nmatter so we can send the bill to the President of the United States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 604\n\n  Mr. President, if I may, I wish to speak on another amendment. This \nis amendment No. 604.\n  The bill before us, the Omnibus appropriations bill, would provide \nfunding for the majority of the Federal Departments which have been \nfunded under a continuing resolution since October of 2008.\n  This bill, the omnibus bill, is not an authorization bill. At the \nrequest of both the chairman and ranking member of the authorizing \ncommittee of jurisdiction, this bill includes a simple 1-year extension \nof the E-Verify employment verification system, known as the Basic \nPilot Program, and includes a simple extension of the EB-5 program.\n  The Appropriations Committee chose not to include the controversial \nauthorization measures associated with the E-Verify Program. Rather, \nthe extension provided in the Omnibus appropriations bill provides the \nauthorizing committee ample time during this session of Congress to \nconsider the 6-year authorizing legislation contained in this \namendment.\n  The continuing resolution expires at midnight this Wednesday, March \n11 and, therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this controversial \nauthorization language, particularly since this bill provides time to \nthe authorizing committees to address this issue through the \nauthorizing process.\n  I oppose that amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 674\n\n  Mr. President, now, if I may, I wish to speak on another amendment. \nThis is amendment No. 674, which would prohibit the use of funds to \nimplement Executive Order 13496 which was issued on January 30 of this \nyear.\n  This Executive order requires Federal contractors to post a notice \ninforming workers of their existing labor rights under Federal labor \nlaws. The pending amendment, however, prohibits President Obama's order \nfrom being implemented unless it uses the same exact language as a \nprejudiced order issued by former President George W. Bush in 2001.\n  The Bush Executive order required Federal contractors to post a \nFederal labor rights notice, but that notice only provided one-sided \nmaterial about the right to not join a union or pay certain union dues. \nUnlike President Bush's order, President Obama's executive order does \nnot limit the notice to pro- or anti-union material, and it does not \ndictate what specific language must be used. It simply requires the \nDepartment of Labor to issue guidelines within 120 days from January 30 \nof this year about the notice, and for the notice to be more \ncomprehensive and informative than the Bush Executive order.\n  Mandating that the one-sided Executive order from the previous \nadministration be restored defies logic. Many new federally funded \nprojects to improve our Nation's infrastructure are underway and \nproductive labor relations are more important than ever. Ensuring that \nworkers are aware of their rights promotes better working relationships \nbetween labor and contractors.\n  Federal law gives the President discretion to determine what is in \nthis notice. President Bush exercised that right during the 8 years he \nserved as President, and issued an Executive order on this matter that \nmany of us in this Chamber believed to be one sided. President Obama \ndeserves the same authority and discretion that was afforded to \nPresident Bush to issue Executive orders. The Congress should not take \nsteps to intercede on this matter by adopting this amendment and, \ntherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 615\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to speak once again about my \namendment dealing with the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program we have \nhere in the District of Columbia. Currently, 1,700 children from lower \nincome families are able to attend a private school with a $7,500 \nvoucher thanks to this program, a program we implemented about 5 years \nago.\n  It seems the No. 1 priority for the National Education Association, \none of the largest unions in the country, is to eliminate this program. \nWe are talking about real children here. These are two of the kids who \nattend school with President Obama's children. It is a great school. \nThe President and Mrs. Obama could afford to send their kids to any \nschool. They chose this particular school because it is an excellent \nschool. They chose not to send them to a public school in Washington, \nDC. After seeing some of the statistics on the DC public schools, it \ndoesn't surprise me. Why should these two happy, healthy kids who are \nenrolled at the same school as the President's children be forced to \nleave?\n  The bill before us allows the program to continue for one more year, \nthen, if not reauthorized and approved by the DC City Council, the bill \nde-funds the program and forces 1,700 children out of private schools \nwhere they are happy, healthy and learning.\n  I quoted these statistics earlier: forty-five percent of Senators and \n37 percent of members of the House send their children to private \nschools. That is almost four times the rate of the general population. \nQuality education shouldn't be only for a privileged few. We should be \nable to send kids such as Sarah and James here to the schools where \nthey can get a better education, where they are safer.\n  The safety of DC public schools is a major concern. One-half of all \nteenagers attending DC public schools are in a school that has enough \ncriminal activity to be classified as persistently dangerous. In school \nyear 2006-2007, DC Metropolitan Police reported that over 6,500 crimes \nwere committed in D.C. public schools. Too many of these schools are \nnot safe.\n  It is a civil right to get a good education. So we came up with a \nplan a few years ago that took up to 2,000 poor children in the metro \nDC area and sent them to a school of their parents' choice. Washington, \nDC, spends more than any school District in America per student. The \nDistrict of Columbia spends over $15,000 per student per year--three \ntimes as much as we spend in my home State of Nevada. Yet the public \nschools are failing here in Washington. So we decided to design a \nprogram to see if we can help some of those kids escape the failing \npublic schools in Washington. We thought: if it works as a pilot \nproject, maybe we can expand it to other places.\n  Well, the National Education Association has come out with their No. \n1 priority, which is to destroy this program. My question is, Why? I \nbelieve they are afraid this program is working, so it is a threat to \ntheir power. It\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\nis a threat to union member dues. That is unfortunate because when it \ncomes to education, our only concern should be in the quality of \neducation for our children. They need that kind of quality education to \ncompete in the 21st century.\n  I have a couple other kids to tell my colleagues about.\n  This is Sanya. She is a beautiful, happy young lady, and is receiving \na great education in a private school here in DC. Today, she has a 3.95 \nGPA. She is the vice president of her class. She is the captain of her \nsoccer team, a player on the lacrosse team, president of the \nInternational Club, and she is a peer minister. She is a future leader \nwhom we are going to be taking out of the school she loves if this bill \nis enacted without my amendment.\n  Rashawn is 16 years old and a handsome devil. He started school in \n1996. His father had him tested and found out he was 3 years behind his \ngrade level. The scholarship program provided him the opportunity to go \nto the Academia De La Recta Christian Day School. Rashawn said he can \nnow do his classwork with very little help because of the scholarship. \nHis sister, Dominique, who is 14 years of age, is now attending the \nsame school, and these are her words. She says: ``I love my school now. \nI am working on my level on my grade.''\n  Do we really want to take these kids out of their schools? Do we \nreally want to do that? We have to ask ourselves, Do we want to protect \nthis bill and the special interests this bill is addressing so much \nthat we are actually going to pull 1,700 children from lower income \nfamilies out of the schools they are attending today? I think it is \nunconscionable that we are going to be doing that.\n  Breanna Williams is 9 years of age and in the fourth grade. She loves \nher new school, St. Peters. She is getting all A's and B's. She loves \nto read and is reading at a level above her grade. In addition, Breanna \nplays clarinet in the school band. When she grows up, she wants to be a \ntranslator and travel the world.\n  Lastly, I wish to tell my colleagues about Ronald Holassie. He is \ncurrently Washington, DC's deputy youth mayor. I had the honor of \nmeeting this young man, and I had the honor of meeting his little \nbrother, Richard. His little brother, Richard, 8 years of age, came to \nour press conference and stole the show. These are two incredibly \nbright young men. Ronald, a tenth grader, runs track, he is studying \nphysics, mentoring middle-school students, and absolutely loves every \nminute of it. As the Youth Deputy Mayor, he considers saving this \nprogram his chief legislative priority, because he has seen what it has \ndone for him and what it has done for his little brother.\n  So individually and collectively these programs are working. We just \nhave to put ourselves in a commonsense position.\n  There have been some studies quoted here claiming that this program \nwasn't working. First of all, the studies were incredibly flawed. We \npointed out all of the flaws of the study. But we just have to ask \nourselves, if 45% of the Senators send their kids to private schools, \nand they pay a lot of money to do that, would they do that if they \nthought the educational opportunity was inferior? Of course not. It \njust makes common sense. Do you think the parents of these 1,700 \nchildren would voluntarily send their kids to the DC schools of their \nchoice if these schools were inferior or if their kids weren't getting \na better education? Well, of course not.\n  This is what President Obama's Education Secretary said about the DC \nscholarship program. He said:\n\n       It is a mistake to take kids out of a school where they're \n     happy and safe and satisfied. I think those kids need to stay \n     in their school.\n\n  So we need to adopt my amendment to keep the DC scholarship program \nfunded. It is the right thing to do for these kids. Showing them we \ncare more about their education than we do some special interest group \nis the right thing to do.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues, when they are voting, to think of \nRonald. Think of the kids we have talked about and many others. Instead \nof doing away with this program, let's study it. Let's study what is \nworking about it. If it is working, let's expand it to other places in \nthe country.\n  America leads the world when it comes to higher education. Our \ncolleges and universities are the best. One of the reasons they are the \nbest is because you can take a GI bill, student loan or Pell grant, and \nyou have the opportunity to attend any college you desire. You have a \nchoice. About 5 years ago, this program gave these kids a choice. Our \npublic, K-12 school system is in bad shape when compared to the rest of \nthe industrialized world. We are falling behind, especially in science, \nmath and in the technical fields. If we want our kids to have the \nchance to compete in the 21st century, we have to improve our school \nsystem. One of the ways to do that is through competition. This is just \na little experiment and a little competition that some people now want \nto come to this floor and destroy.\n  So let's think of these kids, and let's think of kids all over \nAmerica when we are thinking about the educational choices we are going \nto be making in the Senate. Let's give children in DC a choice. We, as \nsenators, are fortunate enough to have a choice for our children. \nForty-five percent of the Senators chose private schools, including the \nchief opponent of this amendment, Senator Durbin.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 604\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I hope that in a little bit we will vote \nin favor of the amendment I have offered to extend the E-Verify system \nfor 5 years. It is time we do that. It is a proven, effective system \nthat brings integrity to our immigration system.\n  The E-Verify system is up and working today all over America. Between \n1,000 and 2,000 businesses a week are signing up voluntarily. Over \n112,000 have already signed up. When an applicant submits an \napplication for a position with a company, the company can input their \nSocial Security number into an electronic system, and the computer \nchecks it to see whether it is a valid Social Security number.\n  People who are not authorized to be in the U.S. know they can use any \nSocial Security number you choose. We found a few years ago that \nhundreds of people were using the exact same Social Security number to \nget a job. People were also using the same fake ID and getting jobs in \nthat fashion. E-Verify is a program that would help eliminate the jobs \nmagnet, the ability of a person who enters America illegally to get a \njob. If employees aren't authorized to work after they have been \nchecked through E-Verify, nobody will be arrested. Police officers are \ngoing to be called out. Nobody is going to be put in jail under this \nsystem. What would happen is the employer would simply say: You don't \nqualify. You are not a legal resident. If there is any doubt about it, \nthe applicant has a mechanism to very quickly validate their status if \nthey have a legitimate status to validate. It can make a big \ndifference.\n  The Heritage Foundation and I believe the Center for Immigration \nStudies a few days ago did a study, and they estimate that under the \nstimulus bill, 300,000 people who are not legally American will be \ngiven jobs.\n  My colleagues probably saw the article--I am sure many of my \ncolleagues did--a couple of days ago where 700 people signed up for a \njanitor's job in Ohio. The American people are seeing an increase in \nunemployment. I don't think the numbers are going to reach as high as \nthey did in the 1980s--at least that is the testimony we just had at \nthe Budget Committee at two different hearings--where employment \nreached 9.4 percent, 8.6 percent. People were estimating what \nunemployment will reach. I don't know what it will reach, but I know a \nlot of good people are out of work and looking for a job. We created a \nstimulus package, $800 billion worth, and that stimulus package was \nsupposed to create jobs. The President says he wants to create 3 \nmillion, and we have just been given a report that says almost 10 \npercent of those jobs could go to people who are in the country \nunlawfully.\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\n  Let me just say as an aside something that worries me. I think every \nMember of this Congress should be worried about it. Under President \nBush's Executive order 12989, which was supposed to be implemented in \nFebruary of this year, every business that got a contract with the U.S. \nGovernment must use the E-Verify system. As I said, over 112,000 are \nusing it voluntarily today.\n\n  What worries me is that President Obama pushed back implementation of \nthat Executive Order. He has now put it off until May 21. At the same \ntime, our Democratic leadership is blocking an effort to make E-Verify \npermanent or even extend it for just 5 years.\n  What does that signal, I ask? Do we want people here unlawfully in \nthis country to get jobs working for the Government when there are \nhundreds of people applying for a janitor's job? Do we want contractors \nwho hire illegals to get Government work while Americans cannot get the \njobs? I don't think so.\n  I will just say with regard to extending the E-Verify Program, in the \nHouse they had a square vote on it last July. It passed 407 to 2. So \nnow we are not going to put that in this legislation. I was blocked 3 \ntimes in my attempt to get a vote on the amendment as part of the \nstimulus package. At least, I have to say, I am pleased I will \napparently get a vote on this bill. But I am troubled with what I am \nhearing that the leadership is going to put pressure on Democratic \nMembers to vote no. There is a majority there, and if they do, it will \nnot even pass today.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the telephone calls. I am getting \ncalls asking that I vote for it. It is my amendment. People care about \nthis issue. The American people wonder what it is we are doing here. Do \nwe not get it? Do we not understand what this is all about? It is about \na jobs package to create jobs for lawful American workers. They can be \nnoncitizens, but they need to be lawfully present in the country.\n  The first thing you do in dealing with a situation of illegality is \nstop rewarding it. You do not give them good jobs.\n  I am amazed there is an objection to this amendment. I had a \nsuspicion that a move was afoot to keep my amendment from passing on \nthe stimulus bill, and that turned out to be correct. In addition to a \n5 year extension, the House accepted an amendment making E-Verify \nmandatory for stimulus money recipients without objection in the House \nAppropriations Committee. It was in their bill, but Senate leadership \nwas able to block us from getting a vote on it. So we did not get a \nvote and it was not in the Senate bill.\n  What happened when they went to conference? Speaker Pelosi and the \nmajority leader meet. They control the conference. And, oh, goodness, \nthey decided the House would concede and the amendment would be taken \nout of the bill. Since the Senate had not put it in the bill, it would \nbe stripped from the legislation. That is how the stimulus package \npassed without any E-Verify extension. I think it has expired now, \nactually.\n  We need a long-term extension because it is going to cause businesses \nthat don't use it to wonder whether they should sign up if they do not \neven know it is going to be a continuing system. It would be very bad.\n  The new Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Napalitano, \nPresident Obama's Secretary, says she does favor this program. Michael \nChertoff, the previous Secretary of Homeland Security, strongly \nsupported this program. A bipartisan group of people support it. We \nneed to extend it. We need to actually make it permanent, and we need \nto make it apply to all Government contractors, as even President Bush \nrequired in his Executive order, which has now been abrogated by \nPresident Obama.\n  To sum up, this amendment does not make E-Verify required for \nGovernment contractors. All it does is extend the E-Verify system for \nanother 5 years. I cannot imagine we would let this cornerstone of a \nplan to establish a lawful system of immigration to expire. We are on \nthe verge of that now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 622\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, one of the amendments we are going to have \nthe opportunity to vote on this afternoon is the Thune amendment. I \nhave some strong feelings about it. I wish to make a couple \nobservations that I think are necessary dealing with the fairness \ndoctrine.\n  As indicated by the vote on Senator DeMint's amendment to the DC \nVoting Rights Act, any attempt on the part of any Senator to reinstate \nthe fairness doctrine clearly goes against the will of Congress and the \nAmerican people. It is a dangerous policy to enact more Government \npolicing of our airwaves.\n  With the onset of the Internet and other media technology, there are \ncountless sources of information at our fingertips. I can remember, and \nyou can remember, I say to the Chair, many years ago when we had \nnothing but three networks, and we didn't even have talk shows at that \ntime. Then CNN came along. I guess it was the first cable network.\n  At the time, there was limited opportunity. As it is now, with all \nthe information that is going around, that is no longer a problem.\n  Senator DeMint's amendment addressed this issue. It was similar to \nthe intent of the Thune amendment that will be coming up this \nafternoon. The DeMint amendment was adopted by a margin of 87 to 11. \nOne would believe, then, that the Thune amendment would pass by an \nequally substantial margin. However, it was obvious at the time the \nvote on the DeMint amendment was merely a political game on the part of \nsome of my colleagues to mask their true intent to regulate broadcast \nmedia, and I suspect the vote on this amendment will be different. I \nencourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to hold true to \ntheir earlier conviction and pass this measure by an equally \nsubstantial margin.\n  A lot of mail went out after that vote. People were talking about how \nthey were going to protect first amendment rights, and we were not \ngoing to try to infringe on the airwaves with the fairness doctrine.\n  While reinstatement of the fairness doctrine still poses a threat to \nfree speech on the airwaves, the debate over Government regulation of \nbroadcast media has changed. Media ownership diversity and broadcast \nlocalism are the new liberal tools they intend to use to regulate the \nairwaves.\n  Two weeks ago, in a straight party-line vote, Democrats chose to \nadopt an amendment--it was amendment No. 591 sponsored by Senator \nRichard Durbin of Illinois--which calls on the FCC to ``encourage and \npromote diversity in communication media ownership and to ensure that \nbroadcast station licenses are used in the public interest.''\n  That is very nebulous, very vague language, just enough to scare \npeople who are in business but not enough to define what they are \ntrying to do. There is no indication in the legislation as to what \n``encourage and promote diversity'' and ``in the public interest'' \nmeans. These clauses can be interpreted by the FCC in any manner they \nchoose.\n  The Durbin doctrine, as I refer to it, is legislation that is so \nincredibly vague and so potentially far reaching that there is no \ncertainty what the end result will be. This is not good governance. \nThis is not a good idea.\n  Another threat to our freedom of speech is a proposal called \nbroadcast localism. We have two different issues. We have localism and \nthen we have, of course, the diversity issue. Neither one is well \ndefined. The FCC gave notice of proposed localism regulations in \nJanuary of 2008. While the proposal was ultimately dropped, it is \nindicative of future attempts to regulate the airwaves and is something \nall Americans need to know about.\n  Among other things, the proposal would have required radio stations \nto adhere to programming advice from community advisory boards. It \ndoesn't say what kind of advice. It doesn't say who these boards are. \nIt could be ACORN. It could be just about anybody, I suppose. Then to \nreport every 3 months on the content of their programming, they have to \nreport what the content is when it has been a matter of public record \nanyway. They talk about how their program reflects the community \ninterest. If you have one biased source of localism, they can dictate \nthe content of broadcast material.\n  The localism rule, if it were promulgated, would mean that radio \nstations\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\nwould have to comply with blanket regulations and broadcast programming \nthat may not be commercially viable and be forced to take into account \nthe advice of community advisory boards over their regular listeners.\n  Right now it is market driven. That is what people do not understand. \nThe reason we have content--I admit it is biased on the conservative \nside because most people are biased on the conservative side. In my \nState of Oklahoma, it does not matter if you are Democrat or \nRepublican. They are people who are conservative. They want limited \nGovernment. They want limited taxation. I think Oklahoma is not the \nonly State that is unique in that respect. Although the rule was \nultimately abandoned, President Obama has expressed support for a new \nlocalism regulation, and it is expected to come up again under this \nadministration.\n  Both localism and diversity--those are the keywords--in media \nownership will force radio stations to comply with blanket regulations \nand to broadcast programming that is not commercially viable rather \nthan taking into account the needs of their communities.\n  I was in Bartonsville, OK, last week. There is a guy up there named \nKevin Potter who owns a station. That is his whole livelihood. He has \nbeen doing it for as many years as I can remember. It is a very \ncompetitive business he is in. He has to comply with something if it is \nspecific, but this is so nebulous he doesn't know what he has to comply \nwith. He is panicking that they would have the power under this new \nregulation to shut him down.\n  I think what is most concerning to me is the enforcement procedure \nfor breaches of localism and diversity. Certainly, no one has been able \nto determine what that is or what the definition is.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment requires affirmative action on the part of \nthe FCC stating ``the Commission shall take actions to encourage and \npromote diversity.'' It doesn't stipulate what actions or to what \ndegree but instead leaves the enforcement mechanism up to the \ndetermination of the FCC, which is likely to be emboldened by the \naffirmative language of the amendment. I find it to be extremely \ndangerous and this, too, should be a concern of everyone.\n  We tried to do this on the Senate floor, I think it was 2 years ago, \nwhen there was an objection that most of the broadcast radio talk shows \nand television shows were biased on the conservative side. I admit they \nare. There is no question about that.\n  There was an attempt made--I think it was Senator Harkin at that \ntime--to change the content of what our troops overseas would be \nlistening to on the overseas radio.\n  Frankly, that probably would have passed. We arranged to have a \nsurvey done through the Army Times of all those overseas, and it was 97 \npercent wanting the market to determine--in other words, the \nconservative type of programming.\n  I hope when the Thune amendment comes up that we will support it. To \ndo otherwise, to me, is a little bit disingenuous and would show that \nthe 87 people who voted in favor of the DeMint amendment are not really \nconcerned about it.\n  I have often been concerned. I hear all over my State of Oklahoma \nthat it is a tough enough business to deal with, to have a station that \nmakes money and survives. On the issue of localism, Kevin Potter told \nme: We pay attention to localism because we have to sell products. We \ninterrupt these nationally syndicated programs with weather reports and \nwith all the local things.\n  So localism is there, and it is there because the market demands it, \nnot because Government says you have to do it. I just think, let's let \nthe market take its effect. I will certainly support the Thune \namendment and hope that our colleagues will do what they did with the \nDeMint amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 615\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, later this afternoon, the Senate will \nconsider an amendment by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, relative \nto the DC Voucher Program. Senator Ensign has been on the floor several \ntimes today to discuss this program. I wanted to make certain the \nrecord was clear on both sides as to the issue before us.\n  This was an experimental program that was started 5 years ago. At \nthat time, under the Bush administration, with a Republican Congress, \nthey made a proposal to the District of Columbia. They basically said: \nWe will give you somewhere in the range of $14 million to $18 million \nfor your public schools--which any school district would gladly \naccept--and another $14 million to $18 million for your charter schools \nif you will use a similar amount to start a DC voucher program. So we \nstarted this program 5 years ago and had some $14 to $18 million, and \nit was said to the District of Columbia, we will pay tuition, we will \ngive families up to $7,500 to pay the tuition of children who want to \nattend private schools.\n\n  The argument was made that the DC Public Schools were not as good as \nthey should be; that many of these children would have a much better \nopportunity if they attended these voucher schools. So this was an \nexperiment. It had never been tried before. There was some controversy \nassociated with it. I offered amendments in the Appropriations \nCommittee to try to establish what kind of standards there would be at \nthese DC voucher schools. In fact, I thought my amendments were rather \nstraightforward--the kind of amendments most people would take for \ngranted.\n  The first amendment I offered in the committee said: I hope all the \nteachers in the DC voucher private schools will have college degrees. \nThat amendment was defeated. The argument was made that we shouldn't \nrestrict the teachers in those schools, who may be nontraditional. They \nmay not have a college diploma. Though we require in the public schools \nthat all teachers have college degrees, they didn't want to require \nthat in the DC voucher schools.\n  The second amendment I offered said the buildings where the DC \nvoucher schools are being conducted should meet the basic life safety \ncodes--health and fire safety code of the District of Columbia. That \nwas rejected as well because these would be nontraditional buildings. \nNow what kind of comfort does that give a parent whose kids are going \nto school--whether it is a public school, a charter school or a voucher \nschool--if there is any question of safety? But my amendment was \nrejected.\n  The third amendment I suggested was one I thought was only fair. If \nwe are trying to create a private school voucher so students can have a \nbetter learning opportunity, at the end of a year or two we need to \nmeasure success. The only way to measure success is if the DC Public \nSchools and the voucher schools use the same achievement test so we can \nsee if a fourth or fifth grader in one school or the other is doing \nbetter. That was rejected too. They wanted no comparison.\n  Excuse me if I am suspicious of this program if you can't mandate \nbachelor's degrees for teachers, if you can't mandate the buildings \npass the health and safety code of the District of Columbia, and you \ncan't mandate they have the same basic tests so we can compare them. So \nI went into this skeptical. I thought the fix was on. They were going \nto create this program with few, if any, rules and take it or leave it.\n  Well, it went forward and it was funded. After a year or two, the \nDepartment of Education and the General Accountability Office took a \nlook at it and they raised serious questions about all this money--\nthese millions of dollars coming into this program in a hurry--and \nwhether they had the proper management techniques, whether they were \nhandling the money right, whether they were giving it out properly, and \nwhether the right families were receiving it--some fundamental \naccounting and bookkeeping issues which we should ask of every program, \nparticularly those using taxpayers' money. So there was a question of \nthe administration of the program. Then they went on to find some \nthings which were troubling. For example, the GAO report said schools \nthat didn't traditionally charge tuition were now being funded. In \nother words, they were free schools before we created this program and \nnow they were charging tuition.\n  What does that mean? For the school year 2006-2007, they offered \nscholarships to about 30 students in one of\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\nthese schools, and a school that traditionally had asked only for a \nsmall monthly fee as a sign of commitment to the school. They raised \ntheir money from charity and donors. Now, since the Federal Government \nwas here with this DC voucher scholarship program, they decided that 30 \nof their students should qualify for these scholarships. Well, that \ncomes out to $210,000 being spent by the Federal Government in a school \nthat traditionally didn't even charge tuition. Does that raise a \nquestion? It raised a question in my mind.\n  They also found out there were a number of schools that lacked these \noccupancy certificates. Even after I offered this amendment raising a \nquestion about the safety of the schools, the schools went on to \noperate without filing the adequate certificates with the District of \nColumbia--the City of Washington, DC--that they were safe and that \nthey, in fact, offered the kind of facilities they said they did. The \nGAO report said District officials provided documentation indicating \nthat 3 of 18 schools the GAO selected for review lacked certificates of \noccupancy--3 out of 18. Six of them had permits that did not specify \ntheir use as a private school, child development center or before and \nafter school care center, and 7 of the 18 appeared to have occupancy \npermits that designated use as child development centers with before \nand after school care.\n  It turned out there wasn't a consistent presentation by these schools \nof what they were. They included in the GAO report photos of two of \nthese schools. One of these schools looked like a single-family \nresidence in a neighborhood where they were supposedly holding school \nin the basement. Another one looked like some kind of commercial \nbuilding. It didn't look like a school at all. It raised a question in \nmy mind as to why we would allow them to get by with this. If they were \nreceiving Federal money to sustain their program, at a minimum they \nought to have teachers with a bachelor's degree, they ought to meet the \nrequirements of safety, and they ought to have a test they can compare \nwith the DC Public Schools. They didn't.\n  Now, what happened? The program was 5 years in duration. It was \ndescribed as a pilot program--an experimental program--and the idea \nwas, at the end of the day, to take a measurement as to whether this \nworked: Did this provide better education for the millions of dollars \nwe put into it? Well, if we followed the law, that program would have \nexpired in June of this year. I was in charge of the Appropriations \nCommittee for the District of Columbia, and I decided that wasn't fair \nto the 1,700 students currently in the DC voucher scholarship program. \nTo cut them off as of June of this year, without any certainty as to \nwhat is going to happen the next year, I thought was unfair to the \nstudents and their families. So instead of ending the program, which \nwould have happened without an authorization, I extended it 1 year so \nit will cover the students in these programs for the school year 2009-\n2010.\n  I thought that was fair. And I said in that period of time Congress \nhad to do its job. We had to go in and ask these questions about the \nschools: Are they working? Are they worth the money spent? Are the \nteachers doing a good job? Are the students better off at the end of \nthe day?\n  Senator Ensign has brought some impressive photographs of young \nstudents who have been successful using this program, but we have to \nask about 1,700 students and what is working and what isn't.\n  The second thing we said in the bill which we are considering is that \nthis is a program that affects one public school district--Washington, \nDC--that is managed by the DC City Council. I believe that if they are \ngoing to extend this program beyond next school year, the government of \nWashington, DC, should decide whether they want it in their school \ndistrict. I wouldn't want it in Chicago--which I am proud to represent, \nor in Springfield, IL, my hometown--to have someone come in from the \nFederal Government and say: We are creating a new school program here. \nWe don't care what the local voters say or the local school board says. \nWe are from the Federal Government; we are only here to help you.\n  I don't buy that logic. So we said those two things are required: \nReauthorize the program, have the DC City Council approve the program, \nand then we can consider going forward. Now, the committee that \nconsiders this reauthorization is not a hostile and angry committee. It \nis chaired by Senator Joe Lieberman from Connecticut, who has expressed \nhis support for the DC voucher program. So it isn't as if I am sending \nit to a committee that is going to deep six it and forget it. He is \ngoing to have a hearing about the future of the DC voucher schools. \nSenator Ensign, who comes to the floor and argues we should not ask the \nquestions, we should not demand reauthorization, we should not ask the \nDC City Council whether they want the program to continue, is also a \nmember of that committee. So he will have his chance under the bill \nthat is before us to make this evaluation.\n  Now, let me be very candid about this. Half the students are in \nCatholic schools. The archdiocese of Washington is offering education \nto many of these students. I have had teachers and parents and others \nwho have come to me and said it is working. A lot of these kids who \notherwise wouldn't be getting a good education are getting a good \neducation. I don't believe the archdiocese and schools should be \nfrightened by this examination. If they are doing what they say they \nare doing--and I trust they are--this examination is going to prove it, \nand they are going to find out, at the end of the day, that the money \nis being well spent.\n  In the recent version of the Catholic newspaper here, which was \npublished in the Washington, DC, area--and I will not read it in \ndetail--there was some language about how a reauthorization could take \nyears. Well, that is not the fact. It can be done on a very expeditious \nbasis by the committee. Senator Reid, the majority leader, has said he \nwill bring this matter to the floor for consideration.\n  Let us assess where we are with this DC voucher program, which would \nhave expired in June of this year. We have extended it another year. We \nhave said the 1,700 students are protected. They can continue to go to \nthe schools they are attending right now. We have said that in that \nperiod of time Congress will take a look at the program and decide if \nthe money is well spent and then report a bill if they want to \nreauthorize the program to the Senate floor for consideration. I think \nthat is fair.\n  I hope those who are opposed to my language in this bill can come \nbefore the Senate and explain the alternative. If we are going to \ncontinue this program, literally for millions of dollars each year, and \nnever ask any questions, it is not only unfair to taxpayers, it is \nunfair to the students. We have to make sure this is working and \nworking effectively.\n  I had it within my power, I believe, to have ended this program, as \npromised, in June of 2009. I didn't do it. I extended it for an \nadditional year. So those who argue the language in this bill kills \nthis program are ignoring the obvious.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 665, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:15 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following \namendments in the order listed, with the time until 4:15 p.m. equally \ndivided and controlled between the leaders or their designees, that the \nBunning amendment No. 665 be withdrawn as soon as this order is \nentered: Cornyn No. 673; Cornyn No. 674; Thune No. 662; Sessions No. \n604; Ensign No. 615; that there be 4 minutes equally divided and \ncontrolled prior to the Ensign vote; and Vitter No. 621; provided \nfurther that prior to the vote in relation to amendment No. 621, the \nmajority leader be recognized, and that the time the majority leader \nconsumes not count as time against the debate time previously provided \nunder the orders of March 6 and 9; further that the other relevant \nprovisions of those previous orders remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, amendment No. 665 is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska.) Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 673\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 673, offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if amendment No. 673 is adopted, State \nattorneys general could still enforce the Truth in Lending Act, they \ncan still hire outside counsel, they just could not do so on a \ncontingency fee basis.\n  Contingency fee contracts offer three hazards in this context that \nare not presented with more traditional fee arrangements. First, there \nis a serious risk of overcompensating the lawyer at a loss to \ntaxpayers, since typically they work on 30 percent up to 50 percent of \nwhatever is recovered goes to the lawyers and not to the taxpayers, as \nshould be the case.\n  Second, the proposed prospect of contingency fees actually creates an \nincentive for trial lawyers to encourage litigation that State would \nnot otherwise bring. State attorneys general could initiate this \nlitigation when it is in the public interest. With contingency \narrangements, too often the lawyer decides who should initiate the case \nbecause, of course, of the profit motive. And this undermines the \ncurrent regulatory regime.\n  Third, contingency fee agreements have been proven to be a temptation \nfor corruption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. For that reason I ask my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Cornyn \namendment, and I do this for three reasons. First, the Federal Trade \nCommission does not have the resources to pursue all bad actors in the \nlending markets under their jurisdiction.\n  The States need the ability to enforce what the FTC is doing in their \nState. Occasionally State governments do not have adequate resources or \nthe expertise on these very complicated matters. Sometimes they need \noutside counsel. And in order to get outside counsel, they need to put \nthat in a contingency fee in many cases.\n  Also, I have great concern that this amendment may be \nunconstitutional. I am not sure that the Congress can limit the States' \nability to bring an action or to structure a contract for outside \ncounsel.\n  So for those three reasons, I would respectfully ask my colleagues to \nvote against the Cornyn amendment.\n  I thank everybody for their hard work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 674 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment would protect workers' \npaychecks and promote transparency. Currently, the NLRB permits an \nemployer and union to enter into a contract that requires all employees \nin a bargaining unit to pay union dues as a condition of employment \nwhether or not the employee actually is a member of the union.\n  In a Supreme Court case recently, Communication Workers v. Beck, the \nCourt ruled that nonunion workers could get a refund for that portion \nof their dues which would be used for political action or other \npurposes other than collective bargaining. President Obama has now \nchanged the rules by Executive order, and now Federal contractors are \nno longer required to post signs in the workplace informing workers of \ntheir rights regarding union dues. President Obama's Executive order \ndoes not change the law, for workers are still entitled to the refund. \nIt is just that now, under the Executive order, employers don't have to \ntell the workers of their rights, which they should.\n  My amendment prohibits omnibus funds from being used for this \nprovision of the Executive order. I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Cornyn amendment and \nurge my colleagues to oppose it as well.\n  On January 30, President Obama issued Executive Order 13496 to inform \nFederal contractor employees of their rights under Federal labor law. \nUnder the Executive order, there are 120 days of rulemaking to \nprescribe the size, form, and content of this notice to be posted. In \nother words, it is underway at this moment.\n  I am opposed to this amendment because we didn't restrict the ability \nof former President Bush to inform employees of Federal employers of \ntheir labor rights. We should allow President Obama the same \nopportunity.\n  I urge Members to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ.

Under the previous order, \nthere will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote \nin relation to amendment No. 662, offered by the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Thune.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, amendment No. 662 is simply a prohibition \non funding being used to implement the fairness doctrine.\n  A couple of weeks ago, the Senate had a vote, and 87 Members of the \nSenate voted for a statutory prohibition on reinstating the fairness \ndoctrine. In fact, the appropriations bill last year included similar \nlanguage to what I am proposing in my amendment that would prohibit the \nFCC from using funds, appropriating funds to implement the fairness \ndoctrine. So it is consistent with what the appropriations bill \nincluded last year. It was not included in this year's bill. All this \nsimply does is makes it consistent with what we did in last year's \nappropriations bill.\n  Furthermore, the legislation that was actually passed by the Senate 2 \nweeks ago, the DC voting rights bill, my hope is the prohibition on \nimplementing the fairness doctrine will stay in that legislation, but I \nhave a fear that when it gets to conference with the House, it might be \nstripped out. This is yet another way of ensuring that funds will not \nbe used to implement this very bad idea.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, this amendment is unnecessary. There is \nno funding in the bill to reinstate the fairness doctrine. The bill \ndoes not contain any provisions directing the FCC to reinstate the \ndoctrine. President Obama does not support it. The FCC has no plans to \nreinstate the doctrine. Opposition to the amendment is not based on \nsubstance, it is based on fact. It does not belong in the bill.\n  Things have changed since the fairness doctrine was adopted in 1949. \nToday, there are more ways than ever to hear a variety of opinions on \nany issue. We have hundreds of channels on cable TV, over 14,000 AM and \nFM stations, and we have the Internet. Therefore, we don't need it.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, 1 minute or 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Excuse me, 1 minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this amendment simply will extend the \nauthorization for the E-Verify system for 5 years. On this current \nbill, it will be extended only for 6 months. I ask why we would not \nmake it a more extended period of time unless we have doubts about it, \nunless we don't like it, unless we are looking for a way to eliminate \nit.\n  It is the core system businesses are signing up to use voluntarily. \nOver 100,000 are now using it. They punch in a Social Security number \nand determine whether the job applicant who is before them is legally \nauthorized to be employed, if they are legally in the country. That is \nwhat it is. It is not required to be used even in Government contracts. \nIt does not require there to be any police officers, detention spaces, \nor any enforcement. It simply allows businesses to use this system \nvoluntarily.\n  We cannot allow it to expire. I am amazed we are not extending it \npermanently. We need to do that. And we need to soon pass legislation, \nwhich this bill does not do, that would require all Government \ncontractors to use the system because that would have been the law as \nof January until President Obama stopped that Executive Order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my good friend from Alabama knows that \nthe bill contains an extension of the E-Verify Program through \nSeptember 30 of this year. I share his frustration about short-term \nextensions. Similarly, I have been trying to work in good faith to \nextend the EB-5 Regional Center Program, which is as important to \nAlabama as it is to Vermont.\n  Much to the detriment of the economic benefits created by the EB-5 \nprogram, such as capital investments and new jobs in American \ncommunities, the Senator from Alabama and others have refused to pass \nan EB-5 extension without simultaneously extending the E-Verify \nProgram. I believe they should both be extended.\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\nWhile I have no objection to reauthorizing the E-Verify Program for a \nlonger term, so long as it remains voluntary and free of mandates, I \ncannot vote for one that leaves the EB-5 program behind.\n  Besides, in the context of this bill which has to be passed and \nenacted to keep the Federal Government running, this amendment is \ninappropriate. It is the wrong action at this time and would jeopardize \nthe swift passage of this legislation.\n  I support the efforts of Chairman Inouye, Senator Byrd, and others to \noppose it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion to \ntable?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the Senate to allow me to make a \nstatement prior to this next vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Senator Leahy\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I pause to honor the senior Senator from \nVermont, Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He will \ncast his 13,000th vote.\n  (Applause.)\n  This is a remarkable tally that few men or women in the hallowed \nhistory of this Chamber can match. But I guess what we note most about \nour friend from Vermont--I think I can say ``we''--is not the quantity \nof his votes so much as the quality. In his 3\\1/2\\ decades of service \nin the Senate, Pat Leahy has been a reliable friend in the cause of \njustice.\n  Pat was elected to the Senate at the age of 34. Few gave this young \nprosecutor from Burlington much of a chance to win. After all, not a \nsingle Democrat had ever been elected to the U.S. Senate from Vermont. \nAnd, of course, Vermont was one of our early States.\n  Senator Leahy recalls that the Republican Senator George Aiken was \nasked by some to resign his seat a day early to give Senator Leahy a \nheadstart in seniority among his fellow freshmen, which you could do. \nSenator Leahy recalls Senator Aiken replying:\n\n       If Vermont is foolish enough to elect a Democrat, let him \n     be number 100.\n\n  On the contrary, the people of Vermont acted wisely by sending \nPatrick Leahy to Washington and sent him again and again and again and \nagain.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy has been a \nnational leader for an independent judiciary, the promotion of equal \nrights, and the protection of our Constitution. He also has been \nchairman in the past of our Agriculture Committee, where he did \nremarkably good work protecting the State of Vermont and all \nagricultural interests. As a senior member of the Appropriations \ncommittee, Senator Leahy has ensured that all communities throughout \nVermont and across America have access to the tools they need to grow \nand to prosper. Senator Leahy is a leading voice for conservation and \nenvironmental protection. He has led the charge to expand broadband \naccess to rural communities.\n  Senator Leahy is also a leader on foreign policy, working to protect \nhuman rights across the world while ensuring our men and women in \nuniform have the training, equipment, and respect they need and \ndeserve.\n  This is a fine man, and it can best be shown as a result of his \nwonderful wife Marcelle. I am fortunate to call Senator Leahy my \nfriend. I am fortunate I have had the good fortune of being able to \nserve in the Senate with this senior Senator from the State of Vermont, \nPatrick Leahy.\n  Congratulations, Patrick, on your 13,000th vote as a U.S. Senator.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me add to our friend and \ncolleague from Vermont for this side of the aisle how much we admire \nand respect his extraordinary record. He and I had an opportunity to \nserve together as either ranking member or chairman--we switched hats \nseveral times--of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of \nAppropriations.\n  I will pick out one area for which I think Pat Leahy is known around \nthe world, and that is his efforts with regard to demining all over the \nworld.\n  He has made an extraordinary contribution, not only to his State but \nhis Nation. I know I speak for all Republicans in congratulating my \nfriend from Vermont for his--how many votes is this?--13,000th vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I join in congratulating the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Vermont. I have had the pleasure of \nknowing him longer than his Senate colleagues because we met in 1970 at \na district attorneys convention where I was the host in Philadelphia. \nWe have been fast friends ever since, going on the 29th year I have \nbeen working with him on the Judiciary Committee and on the \nAppropriations Committee. We have disagreed very infrequently. Mostly, \nwe have been able to carry forward bipartisanship, which has been in \nthe interest of the Senate and in the interest of the country.\n  I could commend him for many of his votes, but I would pick out his \nvote in favor of Chief Justice Roberts at a time when there were \nconsiderable political considerations and strengths against an \naffirmative vote. He saw the importance of a unifying factor being the \nranking member--I chaired at that time--and saw the importance of a \nunifying factor with a courageous vote.\n  He has been an extraordinary Senator. I look forward to seeing him \nserve many years, and I hope to serve with him.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I don't want to hold up the votes, but I \ndo want to thank my dear friend, the majority leader, and my good \nfriend, the Republican leader, for their kind remarks and, of course, \nmy friend, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. As he said, we first \nknew each other when we were much younger and prosecutors.\n  I will just take a moment. When Marcelle and I first came here in \nJanuary 1975 with three young children--Kevin, Alicia, and Mark--we \nnever thought we would be here this long. I have enjoyed every moment \nof it. But especially, I have served with hundreds and hundreds of \nSenators, both Republican and Democratic Senators. I have enjoyed my \nrelationship with every single one of the men and women with whom I \nhave had the privilege to serve.\n  We have often said we are the conscience of the Nation--the Senate. \nOnly 100 of us have the privilege to serve here at any given time to \nrepresent a great and wonderful Nation of 300 million people. It is a \nprivilege, and it is an honor.\n  I thank my colleagues for this tribute. This is something I will long \nremember.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Johanns).\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 93 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Johanns\n     Kennedy\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CARPER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 615\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 615, offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, in the underlying bill there is language \naddressing the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program that would \neffectively, after next year, kill the program. It requires that not \nonly it be reauthorized by Congress but also that the DC City Council \napprove the program. There are 1,700 kids from families making an \naverage of less than $24,000 a year that now participate in this \nprogram. The parents love this program. The kids love this program. I \nam a big believer in the public school system, but the DC Public \nSchools, which spend more than any other school district in the \ncountry, over $15,000 per student per year, are failing too many kids \nin Washington. So this program was put in to give some low-income kids \nthe opportunity to succeed.\n  Guess what. They are thriving in this program. Earlier, the senior \nSenator from Illinois said we have to make sure all the teachers have \n4-year degrees. The omnibus bill before us requires that. My amendment \ndoes not touch that requirement. He also says we have to make sure they \nare in structurally safe schools. The bill before us requires that. My \namendment does not touch that. So those are both side issues that are \nnot affected at all by my amendment.\n  We need to put special interests aside and focus on the children from \nWashington, DC, especially those low-income children\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the Mayor of \nWashington, DC, Adrian Fenty, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   March 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for contacting me about \n     the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. I appreciate your \n     continued interest in matters that are vitally important to \n     the residents of the District of Columbia.\n       As my staff had the opportunity to advise your staff last \n     week, the position of the Administration is consistent with \n     our position during the last two budgets--we support the \n     three sector approach initiated by the Williams \n     Administration because in the past two years the District has \n     made tremendous strides toward improving the educational \n     experience of all students.\n       Accordingly, we do not support any measures that would \n     reverse the three sector approach or strategy. We further \n     agree with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan: that while the \n     ultimate goal is to fix the entire school system it would not \n     be productive to disrupt the education of children who are \n     presently enrolled in private schools through the DC \n     Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n       Once again, thank you for your inquiry and continued \n     support of the District of Columbia. If you have any \n     questions please feel free to contact me or Bridget Davis in \n     my Office of Policy and Legislative Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Adrian M. Fenty,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mayor Fenty is agreeing with the Education Secretary, who \nsays these kids should not be pulled out of this program, and this \nprogram should not end. There are so many scholarship recipients across \nthis town who want to stay in their private schools. We should stand up \nfor the kids and not the special interest groups, such as the National \nEducation Association, that want to end this program.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment by \nSenator Ensign to continue funding for the DC Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram, which has given thousands of children in the District of \nColumbia a chance to escape failing schools. Unfortunately, the \nunderlying bill contains language which would have a devastating impact \non low-income families in the District of Columbia by prematurely \nending the program.\n  Many of us are outraged that a Member of the Senate has included a \nprovision to kill the program. The provision has not gone unnoticed. On \nMarch 6 The Washington Post asked why ``anyone would want to force \nchildren out of schools where they are happy, safe and satisfied'' and \non March 9, Newsweek asked why lawmakers would consider stopping a $14 \nmillion program which is a ``rounding error'' on the General Motors \nbailout figure. Finally, The Wall Street Journal calls it what it is: \n``perhaps the most odious of double standards in American life today: \nthe way some of our loudest champions of public education vote to keep \nother people's children--mostly inner-city blacks and Latinos--trapped \nin schools where they'd never let their own kids set foot.'' Whoever is \nresponsible should be ashamed and admit who put them up to it. I think \nI know who is behind efforts to end this program.\n  The program provides 1,700 children with scholarships of up to $7,500 \neach to attend the school of their choice. To qualify, students must \nlive in the District and have a household income of no more than 18 \npercent of the poverty line. For 2008-2009, the average income for \nfamilies using the program was just over $23,000 a year.\n  Since 2004 when the program began, approximately 7,200 families have \napplied for spots in the program--nearly four applicants for each \navailable scholarship. It is a program that has repeatedly shown \nimproved family satisfaction and increase parental involvement.\n  The students themselves are perhaps the best testimonials. Tiffany \nDunston, valedictorian of Archbishop Carroll High School's class of \n2008, who was a four year scholarship recipient, is now studying \nbiochemistry at Syracuse University. Tiffany's thoughts on the program \nunderscore why this program must continue: ``I am determined to build a \nbetter life and want others in my community to have that chance as \nwell.'' Another scholarship student, Ronald Holassie, was recently \nsworn in as deputy youth mayor for the District. Ronald says he \n``wouldn't be where he is today'' without his scholarship.\n  It is premature to add conditions to this important program. This \nspring, Congress will have the results of the comprehensive analysis of \nthe program. Chairman Lieberman has committed to holding a hearing to \nreview the program and discuss proposals for improvement in advance of \nthe Senate's debate on reauthorization. I appreciate the majority \nleader's commitment to a fair debate on long-term reauthorization.\n  My colleagues know that I have been through this fight before. As \nGovernor I supported opportunity scholarships for Cleveland in 1992. \nWith hard work and dedication, we managed to get the bill through in \n1995 and within 3 years, over 3,600 children were attending the school \nof their choice. Just last year, there were over 6,000 students \nparticipating!\n  It wasn't easy. After we stood-up the Cleveland Scholarship and \nTutoring Program, the American Federation of Teachers, National \nEducation Association, and others filed a lawsuit and for nearly a \ndecade Ohioans fought for the program. All along I had advocated that \nthe program was constitutional. I will never forget the day when the \nU.S. Supreme Court agreed the program was constitutional in Zelman v. \nSimmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, on June 27, 2002. The program continues \nto thrive and expand because of its success. I consider it one of the \nmajor contributions to our country's educational system. It is a morsel \non our smorgasbord of educational opportunities.\n  And the benefits go far beyond the academic. A study by the Buckeye \nInstitute found that students involved in\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\nthe Cleveland program are gaining access to a more integrated school \nexperience. Here in Washington, a Georgetown University study found \nthat with their children in safer schools, parents were free to focus \non their child's academic development and the school's curriculum.\n  Now, after so much progress and money invested, some Members of \nCongress wish to establish premature roadblocks for the program. What \nis lost in the underlying language is the need for the children of the \nDistrict of Columbia to have every opportunity to receive a high-\nquality education. How offensive for Members of Congress, many with the \nmeans to send their children to any school, to limit the ability of \nDistrict students to do the same.\n  Just last week, one of my esteemed colleagues came to the floor and \ndiscussed how he had sent his children to private Catholic School. He \nsaid that it was a family decision and that they made the ``extra \nsacrifice'' to pay for it. What my colleague fails to realize is that \nmany of the parochial schools that participate in the program do so \nbecause they are giving witness to the Second Great Commandment.\n  During the State of the Union, President Obama said that ``good \neducation is no longer just a pathway to opportunity--it is a \nprerequisite . . . to ensure that every child has access to a complete \nand competitive education--from the day they are born to the day they \nbegin a career.'' The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program provides \nDistrict students the pathway to meet the President's goal. Shame on \nthe President for not getting involved and telling his friends in the \nSenate how embarrassed he is about what they are attempting to do to \nthe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program in this bill.\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate voted by supermajority to give voting \nrights to the District of Columbia--which I was proud to cosponsor. I \nam sure if we were to let parents in the District vote on this \namendment--let the parents tell Congress what they want for their \nchildren--their answer would be to continue funding the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program.\n  The language in the base bill takes away the opportunity for parents \nof limited means to choose the best education available for their \nchildren. The Omnibus appropriations bill provides $410 billion to fund \nFederal programs through the end of the fiscal year. Surely my \ncolleagues would be willing to continue to spend $14 million on a \nprogram that continues to give quality education to thousands of \ndeserving children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I wanted to briefly comment on the remarks by the senior Senator from \nNew York in opposition to Ensign amendment 615 to H.R. 1105. The \nSenator emphasized the importance of local support for educational \nprograms. My colleagues may be interested to know that the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program had the support of the District of \nColumbia government when it was created.\n  On June 24, 2003, in testimony before the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform, then District of Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams \ntestified, ``I support the President's desire to create a scholarship \nprogram in the District. I believe, if done effectively, such a program \ncould truly expand choice to low-income families, who currently do not \nhave the same freedom of choice enjoyed by more affluent families.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 5 years ago we created an experimental \npilot plan for 5 years that would expire in June of this year. Rather \nthan let it expire and these 1,700 students and their families be \ndisadvantaged, we extended it for a year in this bill. What is going to \nhappen in the course of that year? Senator Lieberman's committee is \ngoing to take a close look to see if the over $70 million we spent on \nthis program has worked. Are the students getting a good education, \nbetter than they would in public schools, better than in charter \nschools? Are the teachers competent in this program? Are the schools \nthey are learning in safe buildings?\n  These are fundamental questions we should ask of every school \nprogram. I do not understand reluctance on the other side to have an \nhonest evaluation of the program that has cost us over $70 million in \ntaxpayer funds.\n  At the end of the day, those schools that are doing a good job will \nbe given good grades. Those that are failing in this process do not \ndeserve to be renewed. I have extended this program for a year in the \nbill, and the other provision, which I am going to allow Senator \nSchumer to address, gives to the DC City Council the same thing you \nwould want the Las Vegas City Council to have if Congress tried to \nimpose a program on them.\n  I yield my remaining time to Senator Schumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for his excellent remarks. The \nbottom line is this: On the issue of vouchers in DC schools, some \npeople are for them; some people are against them. We are all for our \nlocal school districts determining what they ought to do. I would not \nwant Washington to tell any of my 800 school districts in New York they \nmust have vouchers or they can't have vouchers. Yet this law, which was \nput on the books 5 years ago, forces DC to use the program.\n  The amendment is very simple. It says leave it up to the DC City \nCouncil. I think every one of us would support that kind of \nindependence and autonomy for our local school boards.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 542\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week the junior Senator from Louisiana \noffered an amendment to the Omnibus appropriations bill that would \nchange the way the cost-of-living adjustments are given to Members of \nthe House and the Senate. The bill before us, which has already passed \nthe House, ensures there will be no cost-of-living adjustment in 2010. \nMost Senators, me included, have indicated support for that provision \nthat is in this bill.\n  Senator Vitter's amendment would require the House and the Senate to \nvote every year on cost-of-living adjustments rather than having those \nadjustments take effect immediately. I\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\nagree with Senator Vitter that cost-of-living adjustments for Members \nof Congress should not be automatic. That is why I introduced a \nfreestanding bill last week that would do just that. That is why we \nseek consent to pass this bill before we are scheduled to vote on the \namendment by the Senator from Louisiana.\n  By passing this legislation as a stand-alone, it can become law \nwithout threatening completion of this appropriations bill. If Senators \nwant to demonstrate their support for the proposed automatic cost-of-\nliving adjustments, they can and should support my stand-alone \nlegislation. It is fiscally responsible, responsible to the state of \nour economy, and will allow us to continue the good progress we have \nmade toward passing this bill.\n  Objecting to this request will have two negative results: It will \njeopardize our ability to pass legislation ending the automatic COLAs, \nand it will deal a serious blow to our efforts to pass this \nappropriations bill. Any Senator who wishes to end the automatic COLA \nshould support this consent request I will shortly make. Likewise, any \nSenator who wishes to move forward with the omnibus will support my \nrequest. The only way to accomplish these objectives is to support my \nrequest, take up and pass the stand-alone pay adjustment bill.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this unanimous consent pay \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 29, S. 542, a bill which repeals the \nprovisions of law to provide for an automatic pay adjustment to Members \nof Congress; that the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  This is a serious piece of legislation. It accomplishes what the \nSenator from Louisiana obviously wants to accomplish. I would hope we \ncan do this tonight. It would end all discussion on autopay \nadjustments. We should do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I believe the way to actually get this \ndone, to actually pass this into law, is to include it in a must-pass \nbill, such as the appropriations bill before us, not to point to a \nstand-alone to give people cover for votes; a bill that would not be \ntaken up on the floor of the House. So in that regard I would simply \nask the majority leader, does he have a commitment from the Speaker of \nthe House that his bill will be given a vote on the House floor in the \nnear future?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is obvious that this is an important \nissue. We have an economy that is in distress. That is why we should \npass this. I have not gotten commitments from anyone in the House. But \nit seems to me there is tremendous movement to get this accomplished.\n  I say to my friend from Louisiana, this is an important piece of \nlegislation. We should go ahead and pass this. We know there are not \ngoing to be any amendments to the appropriations bill that I can get \nthrough the House. That is clear.\n  Everyone read in the newspaper what happened there Thursday night. So \nI would hope that in good faith this is not an effort to avoid \nanything, this is not an effort to try to play any legislative games. \nThis is important legislation, I repeat for the third time, that we \nshould adopt, and the House will take care of this itself.\n  Now, for me to stand and say what the House is going to do--I think \nit is pretty clear that with what is going on around the rest of the \ncountry, there is going to be significant support for this legislation, \nas I hope there is here in this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, certainly I agree with the distinguished majority \nleader on one point: there is movement on this issue. Just 12 hours \nafter I was finally able to secure a vote on my amendment, after being \nblocked at every turn for a week, the majority leader himself adopted \nthe cause and introduced, out of the blue, a stand-alone amendment. I \nwish he had been with his colleague, Senator Feingold, on this issue \nsince at least the year 2000, when Senator Feingold has had legislation \non the topic. I applaud Senator Feingold for that.\n  But, again, I renew my objection because I think this stand-alone \nbill is nothing more than cover, nothing more than something to point \nto, when it will not be taken up on the floor of the House. I would be \nhappy to lift my objection to the majority leader's stand-alone bill if \nthe Speaker of the House publicly commits to a vote of his bill on the \nHouse floor in the very near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I will certainly yield to my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I did not block his amendment last week. I never heard \nfrom him until we were here Thursday night, late. I have had a number \nof Republicans come to me--as I look through this crowd here, there \nwere a number of Senators who came to me and said: We would like our \namendments to be offered. There was general agreement Thursday night \nafter final passage did not take place; Senators told me they wanted to \noffer amendments. They talked during the week the same way.\n  So I did not block his amendment. The Democrats did not block it. No \none knew he wanted to offer it, that I know of, on this side of the \naisle.\n  I am using leader time so no one feels constrained.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, is it not \ntrue that if this amendment were to pass on this bill, that, in fact, \nit would never take effect because it will not be taken up in the \nHouse? But if we pass it independently, as our leader has put forward, \nand we all support it, it would, in fact, pass immediately in the \nSenate and then go to the House for consideration?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Michigan, it is clear as the \ndaylight hour that my friend from Louisiana doesn't want the underlying \nbill to pass. Common sense dictates the best way to go is by adopting \nthis consent agreement I made.\n  Let me also say this: I will be happy to ask consent--I ask unanimous \nconsent the Senate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 29, this \nlegislation, S. 542, tomorrow, March 11, at 3 p.m. I make a commitment \nthat I will bring this bill up. If there are people who don't want to \nagree to this tonight, assuming the Senator from Louisiana is that \nperson, I will bring it up some other time. I am committed to doing \nthis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object, again, unfortunately, the \nsame game is at work. I would object. I would also be happy to lift my \nobjection if the Speaker of the House would offer a public commitment \nto give Senator Reid's bill a vote on the House floor in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to show how--what is the right word--how \nSenator Vitter is not serious, he knows that I can't represent what the \nSpeaker is going to do. She doesn't know I am here doing this. She runs \nher little show over there, and I do my best to have some input on what \nhappens here. But I can't make that kind of commitment.\n  I can't imagine why anyone would object to our passing this. It would \nmove this down the road a long way. I am sorry the Senator from \nLouisiana obviously is not serious about passing this legislation, \nbecause I have asked that we do it right now. I have asked that we go \nto it tomorrow. He objects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. There is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 621\n\n  Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 621 offered by the \nSenator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in this economy there are millions of \nAmericans who are seeing their savings dwindle to nothing, who are \nlosing their jobs, their homes. Yet they also see, as recently as last \nJanuary 1, Members of Congress getting an automatic pay raise, in that \ninstance $4,700. It is wrong. The system that has these pay raises on \nautopilot is wrong. We should have full, open debates and votes. That \nis what my amendment would ensure.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Vitter wants to bring this bill \ndown. He wants to score political points. Do you know what is in this \nbill? We stop our pay raise from next year. He wants to bring this bill \ndown. We stop our pay raise in this bill. Senator Reid offered a \nunanimous consent request. All of us could have gone right down the \naisle here together saying every year we vote on a cost-of-living \nraise. So don't be fooled by this. The people need our help, the help \nthat is offered in this bill. People are unemployed. There is funding \nin this bill to get them back to work, to do the business of \ngovernment. This bill stops our pay raise. This is a cheap shot, in my \nopinion. We ought to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from California is absolutely right. If this \nbill goes down, the work we have done, in keeping with Senator \nFeingold--that is, to not have a cost-of-living adjustment next year--\nwe would have to start all over. This is wrong. We should move forward \nand defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 seconds.\n  Mr. VITTER. People do need our help and the people are watching. So \nif you want to change the law that puts our pay raises on autopilot \nwhile they suffer, that system, not pass on it one year but change that \nlaw, vote for this amendment. If you want to kill that concept, vote \nagainst the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the yeas and \nnays on the motion to table?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Johanns).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 95 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Johanns\n       \n     Kennedy\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I opposed the amendment offered by Senator \nVitter to the Fiscal Year 2009 Omnibus appropriations bill that would \nrepeal the automatic cost of living adjustment, COLA, for Members of \nCongress starting in fiscal year 2010. The Omnibus appropriations bill \nalready eliminates the Members of Congress COLA for fiscal year 2010. I \nchoose to give my COLA to worthy charities because I know that many \nfamilies in Massachusetts and across the Nation are struggling to make \nends meet and need help.\n  I opposed the Vitter amendment because it could have jeopardized the \nenactment of the omnibus legislation which includes critical \ninvestments in America's future. Given the process of the bill winding \nits way through Congress, the Vitter amendment would have essentially \nstopped the omnibus in its tracks. We can't afford to have this bill \ndelayed. The bill increases our energy security by prioritizing \nresearch and development of renewable energy and energy efficiency \nincluding solar power, biofuels, vehicle technologies, energy-efficient \nbuildings, and advanced energy research. It also includes strong \ninvestments into cutting-edge science so that our Nation will maintain \nits preeminence in the global economy and create new jobs. The bill \nalso keeps Americans safe by supporting the Community Oriented Policing \nServices, or COPS program, and the Byrne justice assistance grants, \nwhich help State and local law enforcement fight and prevent crime in \ncommunities across America.\n  The Vitter amendment should be considered on another legislative \nvehicle that would not jeopardize our national priorities.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I support annual votes on congressional pay \nraises to avoid automatic cost of living increases. I was a cosponsor \nof an alternative by Senator Reid that would have accomplished this \ngoal without derailing the Omnibus appropriations bill. The underlying \nOmnibus appropriations bill cancels the pay raise that would have gone \ninto effect in January 2010. Additionally, I have previously stated \nthat I will give the 2009 cost of living increase to charity.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment was nothing more than political \ngrandstanding and a poison pill designed to block necessary \nappropriations bills from passing and I was forced to vote against the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 30 minutes \nprior to the cloture vote be reduced to 10 minutes, to be divided as \npreviously ordered, with the remaining provisions of the previous order \nin effect, meaning that Senator Inouye will control 5 minutes and \nSenator Cochran will control 5 minutes.\n  Let me say this, Mr. President: I simply want to tell everyone--\nDemocrats and Republicans--this has been very difficult, but I think it \nhas been good for this institution. And I, frankly--I do not want to \nlay out all of my dirty laundry, but I think it has been good for me. I \nthink the situation that has developed on the Republican side--I had a \nnumber of Republican Senators come to me and say: We need a few more \namendments, and I had enough votes to pass it, and I ignored them. That \nwill not happen in the future. I am going to try to be more aware of \ntrying to create a better feeling in this body, not necessarily count \n60 or 51, whatever it is.\n  So I appreciate what everyone has done here, but especially do I \nappreciate the two managers of this bill. This has been extremely \ndifficult for them. All of the difficult issues had to be resolved by \nthem. I think people looking at this Senate today should know how \nfortunate we are as a country to have two people such as Dan Inouye and \nThad Cochran being the managers of this bill. These are two of the \nbest, and I want to personally extend my appreciation. I applaud and \ncommend both of them for doing an excellent job on a very difficult \npiece of work.\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\n  I have spoken to both of them. Everyone should understand, we are \ngoing to move into an appropriations process we can all be proud of. No \nmore of these big, lumpy bills. We are going to move forward and try to \ndo a bill at a time.\n  Again, thanks for everyone's cooperation.\n  Mr. President, there is a unanimous consent request pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There is now 10 minutes equally divided.\n\n\n                         LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Senate, I would \nlike to discuss with the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Water the congressional intent with respect to the funding \nprovided by the pending legislation, H.R. 1105, regarding the \nDepartment of Energy's loan guarantee program.\n  The pending legislation provides a total of $47 billion for eligible \nprojects pursuant to title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to \nremain available until committed, of which $18.5 billion shall be for \nnuclear power facilities.\n  In order to address budget scoring issues raised by the Congressional \nBudget Office, regarding third party financing, the conferees included \nlegislation recommended by CBO counsel. CBO staff believes there is \nconcern that the Federal Government might incur mandatory spending as a \nresult of entering into power purchase agreements for energy projects \nthat also receive loan guarantees from the Department of Energy.\n  While CBO acknowledges that this scoring issue is separate from the \n1-percent subsidy cost that CBO has assessed the title XVII since \nfiscal year 2007, the conferees were obliged to include language \ndrafted by CBO that would mitigate the possible scoring impact.\n  The language is drafted to capture as many possible third party \nfinancing options and as a result has created several unintended \nconsequences. Specifically, the omnibus language could inadvertently \nhave an adverse impact on a number of pending projects, for numerous \ntitle XVII eligible projects including the American Centrifuge Plant, \nACP. The ACP project will employ more than 3,000 people in Ohio and \nthousands of employees with contracts to build this facility including \nATK and Hexcel located in Utah.\n  First, I would like to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Water for his work since taking over this subcommittee in \n2007 to support the loan guarantee program and his willingness to find \nthe necessary resources, when budget requests were insufficient.\n  I know the chairman is familiar with this frustrating interpretation \nand ask if he would be willing to work with me and others to find a \nsolution to these inadvertent problems and to correct them in the first \npossible legislation following the enactment of this legislation?\n  Would the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water also agree \nwith me that the Department of Energy should therefore continue to work \non the pending loan guarantee applications for those projects which \ncould be adversely impacted by this legislation if not corrected, such \nas those for renewable projects and for USEC's loan guarantee \napplication for its ACP project?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I agree with the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water that the House-passed language \ncontains flaws that we would all like to see remedied. In response to \nhis two questions I will state the following.\n  First, I am willing to work with him and any other Member who has a \nsimilar concern about the unintended impact of the language on these \nenergy projects.\n  Second, I agree that the Department of Energy, including its Loan \nGuarantee Office, should not cease, delay or slow down its processing \nof any of these pending loan guarantee applications.\n  The Department of Energy should continue to take all actions and \nsteps necessary and predicate for the issuance of a final loan \nguarantee so that a final loan guarantee can be issued upon enactment \nof the necessary technical corrections and competitive selection.\n  I can assure the ranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee \nthat I will work with him to try to correct this situation. \nAccordingly, the Department of Energy and its Loan Guarantee Office \nshould proceed to process these loan guarantee applications \nexpeditiously so as to be prepared to act immediately on these pending \nloan guarantee applications to issue final loan guarantees if \ncorrective legislation is enacted.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am very pleased with the commitments \nof the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Energy and Water to fix these flaws in the pending legislation. All \nof these energy projects are very important to the future of our \ncountry as we work towards achieving energy independence and cleaner \nenvironment.\n  USEC's American Centrifuge Plant project is not only very important \nto Ohio, it is particularly important to the Nation.\n  The ACP project is shovel-ready and is estimated to create over 3,000 \njobs in Ohio where it is located, and another 3,000 or more jobs in 11 \nother States around the country through manufacturing and engineering \ncontracts.\n  The ACP project will have the capacity to provide domestically \nenriched uranium to fuel over one-half of the 104 domestic nuclear \npowerplants that provide nearly all of our emission-free base-load \nelectricity.\n  Once built, the ACP project will be the only U.S.-owned source of \nnuclear fuel that is critically important for various national security \nreasons.\n  I would like to observe that the Governors of Ohio, Maryland, \nTennessee and Kentucky strongly support USEC's ACP project.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nGovernors of Ohio, Maryland, Tennessee and Kentucky be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  I would also like to observe that President Obama, during his \ncampaign visits to Ohio last summer, expressed his support for USEC's \nACP project, as articulated in his letter to Governor Strickland of \nOhio dated September 2, 2008, and I will ask unanimous consent that \nthat letter also be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I also thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water for their willingness to \nwork on addressing the unintended consequences associated with this \nlanguage. Ensuring that the language is appropriately modified is \ncrucial to ensure the U.S. has the flexibility to maintain a \ndomestically owned and produced source of enriched uranium, rather than \nrelying on other nations.\n  I am not happy with the long delay in getting the next generation \nenrichment technology up and running in Piketon, OH. Good paying jobs \nare at stake. Our national security is at stake. And, freedom from \ndependency on foreign sources of uranium is at stake.\n  I look forward to working with the senior Senator from Ohio and the \nchairman and ranking member to address the concerns arising from this \nlanguage.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 2 \nletters to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 19, 2008.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Our states provide the domestic \n     infrastructure to support the proposed American Centrifuge \n     Plant (ACP) in Piketon, Ohio. We are asking that you direct \n     your Administration to act promptly within existing funding \n     authorities and take the steps needed to reach a Department \n     of Energy (DOE) conditional loan guarantee agreement for this \n     project. Prompt action is essential in order to avoid \n     demobilization of the project and workforce layoffs within \n     the next several months.\n       Also, ACP represents the only U.S. advanced technology for \n     uranium enrichment that can meet both domestic energy \n     security and national security needs; the use of which would \n     mitigate the present need to import over half of the domestic \n     nuclear fuel supply from Russia. It is critically important \n     that\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\n     we develop our domestic enrichment capabilities so we as a \n     Nation do not create an unhealthy reliance on foreign nations \n     for our sources of enriched uranium. It is especially \n     important to our States that ACP will create a new domestic \n     manufacturing infrastructure of 6,000 high-skilled jobs in 12 \n     states. In addition, many of the technologies ACP would \n     utilize, such as high precision machining and carbon fiber \n     fabrication, will be able to support the growth of other new \n     domestic industries.\n       Your Administration has taken a leadership role in \n     promoting the resurgence of safe and secure domestic nuclear \n     energy. The ACP project offers the opportunity to put a \n     tangible capstone on this effort.\n       While DOE has made significant progress with its loan \n     guarantee program, continued implementation of the ACP \n     project is vulnerable without timely action and a conditional \n     loan guarantee agreement. Therefore, we are seeking your \n     commitment to set the appropriate timetable for decision-\n     making, without compromise to the creditworthiness standards \n     set for the program. Your leadership also would send a strong \n     message that the business of government has not been \n     diminished during this time of turmoil in the financial \n     markets.\n       We will continue to work with your staff to reach a \n     conditional loan guarantee agreement by the end of this \n     Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ted Strickland,\n       Governor of Ohio.\n     Martin O'Malley,\n       Governor of Maryland.\n     Phil Bredesen,\n       Governor of Tennessee.\n     Steven L. Beshear,\n       Governor of Kentucky.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 2, 2008.\n     Governor Ted Strickland,\n     Riffe Center,\n     Columbus, OH.\n       Dear Governor Strickland: You have continued to be a strong \n     advocate for the workforce and surrounding communities of the \n     Piketon Enrichment Plant and throughout Ohio. This workforce \n     and community have made significant contributions to our \n     nation's defense and energy security needs for over the past \n     half-century.\n       There are a number of steps I will take as President to \n     assure the future health and prosperity of this community and \n     its workforce. Under my administration, the Piketon site \n     workforce and the surrounding communities will play a central \n     role in our nation's domestic energy supply through private \n     sector and government initiatives. The Piketon site is ideal \n     for either traditional or advanced energy programs, or both. \n     The Piketon site has vast infrastructure and potential reuse \n     applications are very promising.\n       Under my administration, energy programs that promote safe \n     and environmentally-sound technologies and are domestically \n     produced, such as the enrichment facility in Ohio, will have \n     my full support. I will work with the Department of Energy to \n     help make loan guarantees available for this and other \n     advanced energy programs that reduce carbon emissions and \n     break the tie to high cost, foreign energy sources.\n       I will ensure that workers' rights, pensions and retirement \n     health care benefits are fully protected and facilitate \n     pension portability for workers among the various contractors \n     and subcontractors as new missions unfold with the Department \n     of Energy. We will work with the respective union leadership \n     at the Portsmouth site to assure that their members' rights \n     are fully protected.\n       I will assure that the benefits due under the ``Energy \n     Employee Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act'' of \n     2000 will be provided in a timely and equitable manner. I \n     understand that it is imperative to help those workers who \n     were made sick or ill while serving in our nation's defense \n     nuclear facilities. The delays and foot-dragging over the \n     past several years is simply inexcusable. If necessary, I \n     will support legislative reforms to assure that workers will \n     be promptly compensated. I will not tolerate further excuses \n     or delays in the implementation of this important \n     legislation, which has left deserving workers waiting. I will \n     also support the on-going medical screening program to help \n     workers identify occupational illnesses that may have been \n     caused from work at this facility.\n       I will work with Congress to provided adequate funding and \n     will direct the Energy Department to commence Decontamination \n     and Decommissioning activities of those facilities which are \n     no longer needed, and maximize the employment of site workers \n     to achieve this end. The failure to clean up this site \n     quickly will delay future economic development opportunities \n     and only add additional mortgage costs and pose undue \n     environmental risks.\n       I will help assure the Depleted Uranium Hexaflouride (DUF-\n     6) Conversion Facility in Piketon will be operational on an \n     expedited time schedule. This project was authorized through \n     legislation in July 1998, however, it is still not \n     operational. I will work with Congress to fund this project \n     and the disposition of the 20,000 plus cylinders of legacy \n     uranium material. This project will create jobs for at least \n     20 years and remove thousands of tons of depleted uranium.\n       I will support funding the cleanup of soil, groundwater and \n     hazardous waste from legacy operations. I want to assure that \n     when we declare the Piketon site is cleaned up, it will mean \n     that health and environmental hazards are not left behind so \n     that new businesses can locate at the Piketon facility \n     without concern.\n       I will direct my Administration to work with the community \n     leadership to develop a long-term site plan to include \n     opportunities to reuse the Portsmouth plant site and maximize \n     the vast infrastructure while creating needed jobs in the \n     Southern Ohio region. I ant committed to making the Piketon \n     facility a ``multi-mission site'' to drive economic \n     development and environmental improvements.\n       Combined. I recognize these steps will assure energy \n     security, environmental restoration and job creation for \n     Southeastern Ohio and I look forward to working with you on \n     this important project for the state.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama.\n\n\n              Clerical Error on Beef Improvement Research\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to join with our Chair, \nSenator Kohl, in a colloquy to correct a clerical error in the \nattribution table accompanying Division I of H.R. 1105. Senator Bond is \nlisted as having requested the ``Beef Improvement Research'' project \nunder the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \nCooperative State Research Education and Extension Service. My staff \nhas confirmed that this project was not requested by Senator Bond and, \nas such, Senator Bond's name should not be listed as a requestor.\n  Mr. KOHL. My colleague and former subcommittee ranking member, \nSenator Bennett, is correct. This resulted from a clerical error \ninvolving confusion between two different projects on beef research. \nSenator Bond should not be listed as a sponsor of the Beef Improvement \nResearch project.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair for his assistance in this matter.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a provision in \nthe statement to accompany the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus appropriations \nbill that seeks to address a critical issue in our country, the rising \nrate of childhood obesity. Over the last several years, Senator Harkin \nand I have worked jointly to address this issue.\n  During this time, we have focused our efforts on bringing together \nthe different sectors in our society that are equipped to address this \ncrucial issue for our Nation's children. It is my firm belief, that \nthere is not just one solution to reducing the rates of childhood \nobesity but this should be a collective effort.\n  To that end, I am encouraged that there are those in the food and \nbeverage industry, the advertising industry and media industry that \nhave taken voluntary steps to address this issue.\n  I am pleased that the Ad Council has also worked to address childhood \nobesity as well with donated multimedia efforts since October 2005 that \nhave equaled $170 million. This initiative includes creative \npartnerships with NFL, Qubo, an NBC-owned children's network, and the \nU.S. Olympics.\n  It is my firm belief that the best option to address this issue is \nnot by rushing into government regulation but by working together to \naddress this issue within our spirit of a free-market society--and that \nis the intention behind this language that directs the Federal Trade \nCommission to create a working group among the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the \nSecretary of Agriculture. I also hope that as this working group \nconvenes they will first study the Better Business Bureau's Children's \nFood and Beverage Advertising Initiative, and determine whether \ninitiatives such as these would suffice to address this crucial issue, \nbefore they implement the remainder of the directive. And, consistent \nwith the current focus of self-regulatory initiatives, I think it would \nbe more appropriate to limit the scope of the working group activities \nto children under the age of 12.\n  I have found that oftentimes the best results are rooted in industry-\nled reforms and it is my intention that this working group will keep \nthis intent in mind as they study and develop ways in which to address \nfoods marketed to our children. For example, in July 2007 and again in \nSeptember 2008, the Grocery Manufacturers Association commissioned \nstudies of U.S. advertising trends through Georgetown Economic \nServices. These studies have shown that as food and beverage marketers\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\nhave shifted the mix of products advertised to children, not only are \nchildren today seeing fewer food, beverage and restaurant ads on \ntelevision, they are seeing far fewer ads for soft drinks, cookies, \nsnacks and candy, while being exposed to more ads for soups, juices, \nfruits, and vegetables and water than they were in 2004.\n  I truly believe that with everyone coming together around a free \nmarket principled approach that we will have more expedient and \neffective results for our children.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Omnibus Appropriations Act. I \nappreciate all of the efforts made by my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii, to develop and manage this tremendously important bill. I \nalso value the effort of the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee as well as all of the work done by the subcommittee chairmen \nand ranking members to draft the omnibus.\n  Continuing resolutions hinder the ability of agencies to meet the \nneeds of our communities and address changing circumstances. We must \nenact this legislation in order to have a more effective and responsive \nFederal Government in dealing with many of the problems that our Nation \nis confronted with currently. This legislation improves access to \nhealth care, education, housing, and economic development \nopportunities. It also provides essential support for financial \nliteracy programs, transportation infrastructure investments, \nsustainable energy development, natural resource preservation, and \ninvestor protection efforts.\n  This bill will help further promote medical research. Investments in \nmedical research have tremendous potential to improve the lives of so \nmany people by developing better methods to prevent, detect, and treat \ndifferent illnesses. I am also proud that the legislation increases the \nability of our federally qualified community health centers to better \nmeet the medical needs of our communities.\n  The fiscal year 2009 omnibus bill will help ensure that our Nation's \nstudents are prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. This \nincludes funding for programs to help disadvantaged students reach \ntheir potential as well as funding to help recruit and retain highly \nskilled and talented teachers. The fiscal year 2009 Omnibus also \nincludes $1.2 million in funding for Impact Aid. Impact Aid assists \nschool districts that have lost property tax revenue due to the \npresence of tax-exempt Federal property, including Indian lands and \nmilitary bases. It is vital to a State like Hawaii where there is a \nsignificant military presence.\n  This legislation also provides vital resources for housing. Ten \nmillion dollars is provided for the Native Hawaiian housing block \ngrant, which is administered in the State of Hawaii by the Department \nof Hawaiian Home Lands, DHHL. DHHL is the largest affordable housing \ndeveloper in the State of Hawaii. Although these resources provide only \nabout one-tenth of the DHHL's spending, it is extremely important to \nsupport additional home ownership opportunities for residents \nthroughout Hawaii.\n  I also appreciated the inclusion of funding for the Laiopua 2020 \nCommunity Center. Economic Development Initiative resources will \nfacilitate the development of this comprehensive community center. The \ncommunity center will improve the quality of life for residents in the \ngrowing Kona community by increasing access to social services, \nrecreational facilities, and educational and economic opportunities.\n  The omnibus provides a slight increase in resources for the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant, CDBG, Program. CDBG provides essential Federal \nresources to help meet the specific needs of communities. In Hawaii, \nour counties utilize CDBG resources to help provide affordable housing, \nassist the homeless, expand day care facilities, provide meals to low-\nincome families, strengthen our medical infrastructure by making \nphysical improvements to our community health centers, and expand \nopportunities to help individuals with disabilities find employment.\n  This bill provides essential resources intended to improve our \nNation's financial literacy lending and improve individual \nunderstanding of economics and personal finance. This bill includes \n$1.447 million in funding to implement the Excellence in Economic \nEducation Act, which promotes economic and financial literacy among \nstudents in kindergarten through high school. An additional $1.6 \nmillion is provided for the Department of the Treasury's Office of \nFinancial Education to increase access to financial education and \nprotect consumers against predatory lending. Also, I applaud the \ninclusion of a directive in the bill that requires the Internal Revenue \nService, IRS, in consultation with the National Taxpayer Advocate, to \neducate consumers about the costs of refund anticipation loans and \nexpand access to alternative methods of obtaining timely refunds.\n  The act also will improve our roads, transit, and airports; \nstrengthen Hawaii's transportation infrastructure; and increase the \nmobility of our residents.\n  Provisions contained within the act enable the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers to address our Nation's critical navigation, flood control, \nand environmental restoration needs. I was pleased that more than $1.6 \nmillion was provided for Hawaii projects.\n  Recognizing that shoreline erosion threatens upland development and \ncoastal habitats along much of Hawaii's shoreline, I worked to provide \nfunding for a regional sediment management demonstration program to \nfurther understand the dynamics of complex coastal processes and \npromote the development of long-term strategies for sediment \nmanagement. On the island of Molokai funding has been provided to \ncomplete a much needed water resource study in order to more \neffectively manage ground-water resources. Wise stewardship and \nmanagement at a watershed level has a significant impact on the health \nand quality of numerous natural resources. Inclusion of funds to \naddress stream management and restoration is critical for Hawaii. These \nresources will assist and protect communities in Hawaii from \ndestruction caused by severe weather and flooding, as well as promote \nconservation and revival of our islands' ecosystems.\n  The fiscal year 2009 omnibus includes provisions that will go a long \nway to improve advancements in science and technology, as well as \nenhance U.S. competitiveness. In Hawaii and the Pacific, we are \nuniquely confronted by climate fluctuations and its impact on the \npublic, economic development, and health of our ecosystems and \nwildlife. I am proud to have supported the inclusion of $1.75 million \nfor the International Pacific Research Center at the University of \nHawaii to conduct systematic and reliable climatographic research of \nthe Pacific region. Improving our understanding of climate variability \nempowers us to use data and models to mitigate adverse impacts.\n  Hawaii is home to some of the world's most critically threatened and \nendangered species, including the endemic Hawaiian monk seal. For years \nI have been an advocate for the conservation and recovery of the \ncritically endangered monk seal and other cetaceans in the Pacific. The \nNational Marine Fisheries Service issued the first Hawaiian monk seal \nrecovery plan in 1983 and a revised plan in 2007. The Hawaiian monk \nseals are vulnerable due to a variety of influences, including human \ndisturbances of birth and nursery habitats, entanglement in marine \ndebris, and commercial fisheries. In the last 50 years the Hawaiian \nmonk seal population has fallen by 60 percent. To address this need, I \nworked to include $2.6 million in this act to address female and \njuvenile monk seal survival and enhancement, as well as efforts to \nminimize monk seal mortality. In addition, these funds will strengthen \ncoordinated regional office efforts for field response teams and \nenhance implementation of the 2007 recovery plan.\n  The preservation of our national parks, forests, and public lands has \nbeen a priority of utmost importance. Public lands are valued assets \nthat must be properly managed for the benefit of all Americans and \nfuture generations. I am encouraged that the act supports the \npreservation of our natural landscapes, furthers conservation of \nwildlife, expands water resource assessment, and fosters wise \nmanagement of our Nation's natural resources.\n  Given the unique needs of Hawaii, I supported funding in the Fiscal \nYear 2009 omnibus to fortify the preservation of four endangered \nHawaiian\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\nwaterbirds located within the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge, \nas well as combat the threat of invasive species on our natural and \ncultural heritage. Invasive species are the primary cause of decline in \nHawaii's threatened and endangered species, and cause hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in damage to Hawaii's agricultural industry, \ntourism, real estate, and water quality. Funding will continue the \nongoing, collaborative, interagency, and community-based effort to \naddress invasive species impacts. Such joint action, cooperative \nagreements, and collaboration will be needed to control invasive \nspecies that are crossing geographic and jurisdictional boundaries.\n  I am pleased that the omnibus supports the development of sustainable \nand clean energy. We must continue to invest in development and \nimplementation of energy from renewable, efficient sources as this \nNation transitions away from foreign oil. Our energy security and \nindependence depend on conducting advanced research and better \nutilizing energy from sources including the sun, wind, ocean.\n  Included in the act is $3.1 million to support the ongoing Hawaii-New \nMexico Sustainable Energy Security Partnership. In order to develop, \ndemonstrate, and deploy technologies that enhance usage of renewable \nresources, the Partnership evaluates electric and transportation \ninfrastructure, tests technologies, and provides sound science to \ninform debate and the implementation of public policy. Building upon \nits successful development of a comprehensive model of the \ntransportation and electricity infrastructures on the Big Island and \nMaui, these funds will be used to support promising projects identified \nfor implementation on those islands, as well as extend efforts to \nevaluate and address the energy infrastructure needs on Oahu and Kauai.\n  I am encouraged by the inclusion of funding to improve Hawaii's \ninfrastructure and nurture sustainable agriculture production. Our \nagricultural industry is a key component of our State's economy, and I \nhave long supported the policies and programs cultivating opportunities \nfor our farmers and rural communities. Further, funds supporting \nresearch, extension, and teaching efforts are necessary as we prepare a \nskilled and thriving workforce focused on developing sustainable \nsolutions that improve the health of our environment, as well as the \nquality and efficiency in production.\n  Another important provision I want to highlight is the critical \nsupport included for the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, to \nbetter protect investors. I will continue to work with the SEC to \nensure it has the statutory authority and resources necessary to better \nprotect and educate investors and promote market stability.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank the senior Senator from Hawaii for all \nof his extraordinary efforts to develop and shepherd this comprehensive \nbill through the legislative process. The Nation and our home State of \nHawaii will benefit tremendously from its passage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Congress will hopefully with this vote \nfinally complete action on the fiscal year 2009 appropriations bills. \nThis bill addresses some of the Nation's critical needs. It also \naddresses some of Michigan's special needs such as protecting the Great \nLakes, improving our transportation infrastructure, and supporting our \nmanufacturers and small businesses. In addition, it supplies our local \nlaw enforcement with tools they need to protect our citizens and \nprovides support for our communities to help our most vulnerable \ncitizens during this economic crisis.\n  This bill includes funding for a number of important Great Lakes \nprograms. With the funding in this bill, the Thunder Bay Marine \nSanctuary and Under Water Preserve will be able to complete the \nexhibits in the new visitor's facility. The bill provides a $2 million \nincrease for the Great Lakes Legacy program which has made a positive \nimpact on the Lakes by removing contaminated sediment. This bill also \nprovides funds to the Corps of Engineers to complete construction of \nthe permanent dispersal barrier in order to stop Asian carp and other \ninvasive species from entering the Great Lakes.\n  I am pleased that funding of over $50 million that I requested for \ndredging and other operation and maintenance needs for Michigan's ports \nand harbors was included in this bill. The Great Lakes navigational \nsystem faces a backlog of 16 million cubic yards of dredging needs, \nwhich has had very real negative impacts on Great Lakes shipping. \nSeveral freighters have gotten stuck in Great Lakes channels, ships \nhave had to carry reduced loads, and some shipments have simply ceased \naltogether. While an increase in some water levels is helping somewhat \nin this regard, the Great Lakes navigational system has an accumulation \nof maintenance needs. The additional funding that was included will \nhelp address this backlog, and I will keep working to increase \nappropriations and the budget so this important maritime highway, so \nthat one of the lowest cost ways to transport supplies to industry and \nproducts to consumers, is not impeded.\n  The bill also provides $17 million to the Corps of Engineers for the \nSoo Lock replacement project, which would serve as a backup for the \ncurrent Poe Lock. Total annual shipping on the Great Lakes exceeds 180 \nmillion tons, over half of which goes through the Soo Locks. Funding \nfor the lock is critical to ensuring that this system remains \noperational.\n  This bill provides a boost in funding for our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure which will put people to work while improving mobility, \nsafety and competitiveness in Michigan and around the country. The bill \nprovides $15.39 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, an \nincrease of $865 million over the fiscal year 2008 levels. Included in \nthat total is $9.04 billion for Federal Aviation Administration \noperations that would be used to improve safety and air traffic \norganization, and to increase the hiring and training of air traffic \ncontrollers and aviation safety inspectors. The bill provides $40.7 \nbillion in highway funding, $483.9 million above fiscal year 2008 \nlevels. It also provides $1.45 billion for the National Railroad \nPassenger Corporation, Amtrak, a $128.1 million increase over the \nfiscal year 2008 level. It also provides $10.1 billion for Federal \nTransit Administration, $773 million over fiscal year 2008 levels.\n  This bill also includes a number of programs to help technology \ncompanies and manufacturers in Michigan and throughout the country, \nincluding funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, and \nthe Technology Innovation Program, TIP. The bill includes $110 million \nfor the MEP program. President Bush proposed to eliminate the program \nin his fiscal year 2009 budget. MEP is the only Federal program \ndedicated to providing technical support and services to small- and \nmedium-sized manufacturers. MEP is a nationwide network of proven \nresources that enables manufacturers to compete globally, supports \ngreater supply chain integration, and provides access to information, \ntraining and technologies that improve efficiency, productivity, and \nprofitability. In fiscal year 2007 alone, based on services provided in \nfiscal year 2006, MEP helped to: create or retain over 52,500 jobs, \ngenerate more than $6.765 billion in sales, and stimulate more than \n$1.65 billion in economic growth. MEP is needed now more than ever as \nour small and medium manufacturers struggle to survive in this serious \nrecession.\n  The bill includes $65 million for the Technology Innovation Program, \nTIP, the successor to the Advanced Technology Program, ATP. While \nslightly less than the fiscal year 2008 level it is still significant \ngiven the fact that President Bush proposed zeroing out the program in \nhis fiscal year 2009 budget. TIP is a cost-sharing program that \npromotes the development of new, innovative products that are made and \ndeveloped in the United States, helping American companies compete \nagainst their foreign competitors and contribute to the growth of the \nU.S. economy. During this terrible recession the TIP program is an \nimportant way to stimulate job growth and high technology R in the \nUnited States.\n  I am pleased that this bill continues the current ban on using \nFederal funds for future Federal contracts to so-called ``inverted'' \nU.S. companies that, to avoid certain U.S. taxes, have reincorporated \nin an offshore tax haven country but left their offices and production \nservice facilities here in the\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\nU.S. We should not further reward inversion by granting them Federal \ncontracts. It is unfair to the U.S. companies left to operate on an \nuneven playing field, and it is unfair to the rest of our taxpayers who \npay their fair share.\n  The fiscal year 2009 omnibus bill includes an increase in funding \nover fiscal year 2008 in a number of important areas at the Department \nof Energy. In particular, this bill includes $273 million for advanced \nvehicle technologies, an increase of $58 million over fiscal year 2008, \nwith additional funding included for research and development on \nadvanced battery technologies. The bill also includes $217 million for \nbiomass and biorefinery systems, an increase of $17 million over fiscal \nyear 2008, which should allow for continued and increased support of \ninnovative technologies for production of ethanol and biofuels produced \nfrom cellulosic materials. The omnibus also includes modest increases \nfor both solar and wind energy research and development that will \ncontribute to ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency and decrease \nthe cost of commercialization of these technologies. I am also pleased \nthat this bill includes additional new funding for loan guarantees for \nadvanced innovative technologies, specifically providing up to $18.5 \nbillion for loan guarantees for renewable energy, energy efficiency, \nand manufacturing that will be available for important projects such as \nbiofuels production and advanced battery manufacturing.\n  This bill includes a significant increase in several areas of funding \nfor science and technology. Within the Department of Energy, this bill \nincludes an increase of $754 million for the Office of Science, which \nwill increase federal support for basic research and support the goals \nand programs of the America Competes Act, which called for a doubling \nof the U.S. investment in science over 10 years. It also includes \nincreases in science programs at the National Science Foundation and \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, both of which have \na significant role to play in development of advanced technologies that \nwill keep the U.S. competitive in the global market.\n  This legislation provides funding for state and local law enforcement \nand crime prevention. It includes much needed funding for the Community \nOrganized Policing Services, COPS, program, which provides our police \ndepartments with the technology and training tools needed to prevent \nand detect crime and for the Office of Justice Programs that provides \nfunding for Byrne justice assistance grants, juvenile justice programs, \nand drug courts. It also provides $415 million to the Office on \nViolence Against Women so that we can better prevent and prosecute \nviolent crimes against women. Finally, I am pleased that the \nlegislation includes $185 million for interoperable radio systems.\n  During this economic crisis, it is especially important that this \nbill includes vital funding for our Nation's nutrition, housing and \neconomic development programs that will provide much-needed help to our \ncommunities. This bill includes increased funding for the Supplemental \nNutrition Program, SNAP, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program \nfor Women, Infants, and Children, WIC, which help provide nutritious \nfood to many in this country who are in need. It also includes \nincreased funding for public and affordable housing programs that \nprovide housing to low-income Americans and $1.7 billion, which is $91 \nmillion above the 2008 funding level, for homeless assistance grants \nwhich provide rental assistance, emergency shelter, transitional and \npermanent housing, and supportive services to homeless persons and \nfamilies to help break the cycle of homelessness and to move homeless \npersons and families into permanent housing. In addition, this bill \nprovides $3.9 billion, $34 million above the 2008 funding level, for \nthe community development block grant, CDBG, program which will fund \ncommunity and economic development projects to revitalize our \ncommunities.\n  This bill includes funding I requested for the redevelopment of part \nof the old Tiger Stadium and its ball field. This funding will help the \nsurrounding community move forward on a plan to preserve part of the \nold Tiger Stadium and its ball field as a premier baseball field for \nyouth leagues and to redevelop part of the stadium structure and \nadjacent land to be used for retail shops and restaurants and other \ncommercial and entertainment attractions. This funding will not only \nhelp preserve this part of Detroit and baseball history, but also bring \nmuch needed jobs and economic activity into this neighborhood and to \nthe city of Detroit.\n  I am glad that we have finally completed the fiscal year 2009 \nappropriations bills. While it is unfortunate that we once again had to \nconsider nine different bills packaged into a single omnibus spending \nmeasure, I am very pleased that this bill includes funding for many \nimportant national programs and projects that will especially benefit \nMichigan. It is my hope that we will be able to complete a timely, open \nand transparent appropriations process in the coming year.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, these are difficult times in our \ncountry. American families are facing challenges that we have not seen \nin decades, we have record budget deficits, and we are fighting two \nwars.\n  The national economic crisis is affecting so many people across our \nNation and in West Virginia, and we must give the economic recovery \nplan time to do what it was designed to do--create jobs and reinvest in \nthe American dream.\n  In West Virginia, factories and businesses are closing their doors. \nUnemployment rose in all 55 counties in January 2009. Our statewide \nunemployment rate jumped from 4.4 percent in December to 6.2 percent in \njust 1 month. And February and March have brought additional plant \nclosures, and more employees have lost their jobs.\n  As we work in Congress on ways to get our economy back on track and \ncreate new jobs, I stand ready to help and take bold action that will \ndeliver real, workable solutions to families. And I am committed to \nworking with our State leaders to do everything we can to bring \nopportunities to West Virginia.\n  It is very important that we in Congress do everything possible to \nuphold the public trust, protect taxpayer dollars, and show with our \nactions and not just our words that we take seriously our obligation \nand honor to serve the people.\n  One of the ways the legislation before us today, H.R. 1105, the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, does that is by prohibiting the \nannual cost-of-living pay adjustment, COLA, for Members of Congress \nfrom taking effect in calendar year 2010. This is a good, small, but \nimportant step, and I thank our leadership for including this important \nprovision. Now is not the time for an increase in the COLA for Members \nof Congress.\n  I represent constituents who earn $25,000 to $35,000 annually, and \nthe notion that we in Congress would allow a COLA increase for \nourselves, while they are just trying to put food on the table and make \nends meet, is completely unacceptable. Given the state of the economy, \nand the income and job losses across this Nation, I strongly oppose a \ncongressional pay increase in this bill.\n  I also strongly support efforts to suspend permanently the automatic \ncongressional COLA. It will be some time before our economy turns \naround and the American people feel a sense of financial security \nagain. And especially in a recession, any congressional pay increase \nshould be subject to an up-or-down vote each year, and not simply occur \nautomatically.\n  That is why I am glad to be a cosponsor of S. 542, legislation \nintroduced by Majority Leader Reid to repeal the provision of law that \nprovides automatic COLAs for Members of Congress. I do not believe we \nshould amend the pending bill to do this--the amendment, like so many \nothers offered by the minority over the past week, is really a Trojan \nhorse to kill or delay the Omnibus Appropriations Act, which is already \noverdue and meets our basic obligation to keep the government running. \nBut the issue is an important one, deserving of immediate action and I \nappreciate the leader's commitment to act quickly on it.\n  I believe having transparency, accountability, and an up-or-down vote \non the COLA every year makes a lot of sense--both for Congress and the \nAmerican people. The American people deserve to be represented by \nMembers of Congress who are in touch with the everyday struggles of the \nvery people\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\nwho elected them. Just like their family budgets, Congress has to \nbudget and live within our means and make careful spending decisions \nbased on our most pressing priorities.\n  I support this bill today because it is the absolutely right thing to \ndo and West Virginia families deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to support the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act and encourage my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  This bill provides additional resources so our Government will be \nbetter able to meet the challenges of the economic crisis we face \ntoday.\n  I would remind my colleagues that without enactment of this bill, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission will not get the additional funding \nit needs to increase the integrity of the financial markets. The \nFederal Housing Administration will have to stop helping families \nfacing foreclosure to refinance into affordable mortgages at the worst \npossible time for such a stoppage to occur.\n  The Food and Drug Administration will not receive the funding it \nneeds to significantly increase the number of food and medical product \nsafety inspections, both domestic and overseas, that it could otherwise \nperform.\n  If the Omnibus is not enacted, $550 million less would be provided \nfor the FBI to protect our Nation and our communities from terrorism \nand violent crime. Not passing this bill means 650 fewer FBI special \nagents, and 1,250 fewer intelligence analysts and other professionals \nfighting crime and terrorism on U.S. soil.\n  In conclusion, I ask the fundamental question: Will the United States \nbe better off in the next year, and will the Federal Government be in a \nbetter position to help lead our country out of this deep recession, if \nwe pass this bill? The answer is obviously, yes. It is in America's \nbest interests to close the book on the last administration and to help \nthe new administration hit the ground running.\n  Now is not the time to relitigate past policy battles. Now is the \ntime to clear the decks and look to the future. For all these reasons, \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting cloture on H.R. 1105.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know the hour is a bit advanced, so I \nwill not take much time. I think it is pretty clear what the outcome of \nthis vote will be, so I will not take a lot more time of this body. I \nhave spent a lot of time on the Senate floor in the last week or so \ntalking about this legislation before us.\n  I think there are a couple things that need to be mentioned again. \nSomehow it seems to be accepted around here that earmarks are a \nstandard practice and that they have been going on forever, and it is \nsomehow the purview of the Appropriations Committee to do these \nearmarks, which Americans have become pretty familiar with, I am happy \nto say, in the last week or so.\n  That is not so. It is not so. In 1991, there was a total of 537 \nearmarks for the entire appropriations process. This evil has grown, \nand it has grown, and it has grown--to the point where we now have \nclose to 9,000 earmarks. All we are asking is to authorize. We have \ntalked a lot about the individual earmarks. But the fact is, they are \nnot authorized. I heard one of my colleagues today, on this side of the \naisle, say: Well, the authorizing committees are too busy. Really? \nReally? So all we are asking is to go back to what this body had done \nand the Congress had done for a couple hundred years; that is, \nauthorize the projects.\n  So what has happened? It has grown and grown and grown. Today, a \nformer staffer on the Appropriations Committee pled guilty in Federal \ncourt. What did it have to do with? It had to do with earmarks, and we \nhave former Members of Congress now residing in Federal prison because \nof this gateway drug, as my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, \ncalls it.\n  So last November the American people, as I am keenly aware, voted for \nchange. They voted for change, and somehow we are saying: This is last \nyear's business--only this is funding this year's operations.\n  So we will vote to pass this bill, and the message is, my friends and \ncolleagues, that it is business as usual in Washington, while \nunemployment is 8.1 percent and employers have to cut another 651,000 \njobs.\n  So if the President were serious about his pledge for change, he \nwould veto this bill. He will not. Now, he will say we are going to \noutline a process of dealing with this problem in a different way. I \nquote from Mr. Gibbs:\n\n     . . . and that the rules of the road going forward for those \n     many appropriations bills that will go through Congress and \n     come to his desk will be done differently.\n\n  Well, the first chance we get to show people change is business as \nusual in the Senate and the House. It is very unfortunate. It is very \nunfortunate. We should not be astonished at the low approval ratings we \nhave here when Americans see the expenditure of their hard-earned tax \ndollars in the projects we have talked about in the past without \nscrutiny, without authorization, and certainly not in a fashion the \nAmerican people want their tax dollars spent. So we will invoke cloture \nand we will move forward. The bill will go to the President's desk, he \nwill sign it, and the signal to the American people is: You voted for \nchange, but you are not getting any change today.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, before yielding the time so we can vote, \nI wish to commend and thank the distinguished Senator from Hawaii for \nhis leadership of the Appropriations Committee, particularly in our \nnegotiations that we have had with Members of the other body. We are \nnot legislating in a vacuum. These proposals and provisions of this \nbill have been carefully reviewed by our committee. In this case, it \nincludes I think about seven bills that were individually written and \nproposed to the full committee by the subcommittees, after a series of \nhearings reviewing the administration's requests for funding, listening \nto outside groups that had opinions and views about the level of \nappropriations for many accounts and programs. But our true leader who \ndeserves praise for this final work product, as I said, is the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Has all time been used, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the order that is now in effect indicates \nthat if there are 60 votes on this cloture vote, there will be just a \nvoice vote on final passage. I ask the Chair if that is factual.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered on the \nmeasure.\n  Mr. REID. So that is the understanding we have. If that, in fact, is \nthe case, then we would--this will be the last vote today.\n  People are asking: What are we going to do the rest of the week? \nFirst of all, we are going to spend the rest of this week on \nnominations. We are going to try to get one up tomorrow that we can \ndebate and hopefully vote on. We may not be able to do that.\n  I would say to everyone there has been a lot of pent-up desire to \ncome out and give speeches on other issues. I think we will have plenty \nof time to do that tomorrow. So we will set aside a couple hours, at \nleast, tomorrow for morning business. I look forward to this vote and \nending this long process on this appropriations bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 1105, the \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act:\n         Harry Reid, Daniel K.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the staff of the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations. Since I assumed the chairmanship of \nthe committee less than 2 months ago, on January 21, the staff of the \ncommittee has accomplished some extraordinary things.\n  The committee held a markup on the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct less than a week after I assumed the gavel, on January 27. We \npassed the Recovery Act on Februay 10, held an open conference with the \nHouse and then passed the conference report on February 14. On February \n17, the President signed the Recovery Act into law.\n  The committee then moved immediately to take up the 2009 Omnibus Act, \nwhich we have passed today. I want to recognize the many late nights, \nthe weekends, and the lost family time that have all been sacrificed by \nstaff in order that we might accomplish the passage of two significant \nappropriations bills in less than 2 months.\n  As is our tradition, the committee operated in a fully bipartisan \nfashion in all of our efforts, and our nonpartisan support staff did \ntheir usual superb job of allowing the policy staff to complete their \nwork under such tight deadlines.\n  Without the hard work, dedication and extraordinary effort of all the \nstaff members of this committee, we would not have passed the Recovery \nAct or the 2009 omnibus. As the chairman of this committee, and on \nbehalf of the American people who they serve so well, I thank them for \ntheir exceptional efforts and for providing me such an outstanding \nstart to my time as leader of this committee.\n  I submit the names of all of the staff members of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee for the Record.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n       Carrie Apostolou, Arex Avanni, Michael Bain, Dennis \n     Balkham, Gabrielle Batkin, Katie Batte, Ellen Beares, Rebecca \n     Benn, Suzanne Bentzel, Lisa Bernhardt, Jessica Berry, Rob \n     Blumenthal, David Bonine, John Bray, Dale Cabaniss, Art \n     Cameron, George A Castro, Doug Clapp.\n       Roger Cockrell, John J.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \naccomplishments of the North Laurel Middle and High School cheerleading \nsquads from the city of London in my home State of Kentucky. Recently, \nboth teams won national championships in the Universal Cheerleaders \nAssociation, at competitions held in Orlando, FL.\n  Both teams overcame setbacks and injuries but still triumphed. \nThrough hard work and dedication, they were able to clinch the national \ntitles for Kentucky. Recently, the Sentinel-Echo newspaper in London, \nKY, published an article detailing the victories of both teams.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the \ncheerleaders and coaches from North Laurel Middle and High Schools for \ntheir performances in the national competition. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be printed in the Record, as well as the \nnames of the participants and coaches.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel-Echo, Feb. 13, 2009]\n\n                        Laurels for North Laurel\n\n                           (By Tara Kaprowy)\n\n       With full police and fire truck escort, marching band \n     fanfare and thousands of students waiting to greet them, \n     North Laurel middle and high school cheerleaders came home \n     wreathed in victory Tuesday. The teams both clinched first \n     place last weekend at the Universal Cheerleaders Association \n     National High School Cheerleading Championship, the be-all \n     end-all of cheerleading competitions.\n       North Laurel Middle School coach Christy Jones was \n     thrilled.\n       ``It's all the buzz down here,'' she said of the North \n     Laurel wins. ``They loved the girls, they loved the \n     routine.''\n       North Laurel High School coach Kim Wood was likewise \n     pleased.\n       ``We're celebrating like we've never celebrated before,'' \n     she said.\n       Wood's team has had a heart-stopping couple of days. The \n     team arrived in Orlando, Fla., a few days before the weekend \n     competition to have time to practice their highly technical \n     routine.\n       But on the first day, tragedy struck.\n       ``We had one of our strongest bases get injured,'' Wood \n     said. ``She blew her knee out.''\n       With Lindsey Lewis now forced to the sidelines, it was up \n     to Laura Robinson--who had never even competed before--to \n     step in.\n       ``She was so nervous,'' Wood said.\n       To incorporate Robinson into the performance, the girls had \n     to adjust their formations and rework the routine, practicing \n     six hours a day to get things right.\n       ``Each girl had to work even harder,'' Wood said.\n       By the end of the second round of competition, the girls \n     were in seventh place; one of the girls had fallen, which \n     cost the team points. Nevertheless, they advanced to finals. \n     This time, their 2\\1/2\\-minute routine was flawless.\n       ``It was perfect,'' Wood said. ``They were awesome.''\n       When the winners were being announced, the judges asked the \n     girls to maintain their composure out of respect for the \n     other teams. But Wood said when the runner-up was named--and \n     it wasn't North Laurel--her girls were ecstatic.\n       ``They were bawling and crying and jumping for joy,'' Wood \n     said.\n       Over in the middle-school competition, the girls were up \n     against the fearsome Mount Pisgah and Houston girls, \n     cheerleaders from two middle schools who finish first and \n     second year after year.\n       This year, Jones said she was ready for the Tennessee \n     teams, with North Laurel's choreographer crafting a routine \n     that was at the highest level of difficulty. The performance \n     incorporates 13 full-ups, a move in which the girls complete \n     a 360-degree turn before they hit the top of their stunt.\n       ``We do them to one leg, which is even more difficult,'' \n     Jones said.\n       The girls pulled off the stunts, even though they were also \n     plagued by injuries.\n       Dani Flannery, who tore the ligaments in her ankle last \n     year, reinjured her leg while in Florida.\n       She chose to compete anyway.\n       ``She battled back,'' Jones said. ``And she did it with a \n     smile on her face.'\n       In the end, the NLMS girls pulled off their routine and, by \n     12 points, were named the champions.\n       Jones said the win was sweet.\n       ``It's been very difficult to gain respect,'' she said. \n     ``It's kind of the (Tennessee team) club, but we broke into \n     it this year. And they didn't like it.''\n       Jones said she and her girls are thankful for the support \n     they received throughout the year.\n       ``We are just so appreciative of our principal (David \n     Hensley),'' she said. ``He is so supportive of our program. \n     And our parents, listen, our parents raised the money so \n     every child could come to Florida for free. And the \n     community. Every time they buy a T-shirt or a box of donuts, \n     it lets these girls achieve their dream.

Mr. President, I rise to honor Senator Patrick Leahy on \nthe occasion of his 13,000th vote.\n  I have had the privilege of serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunder Senator Leahy's leadership for more than 10 years. The Judiciary \nCommittee is one of the original standing committees of the U.S. Senate \nand its role is unique. It is the Judiciary Committee's special charge \nto ensure that we remain faithful to our Founders' vision of America as \na nation of laws.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy takes this \nresponsibility very seriously and he has continually demonstrated his \nfidelity to the rule of law. Chairman Leahy has repeatedly risen in \ndefense of our fundamental constitutional rights, even when it is not \npolitically popular.\n  He particularly distinguished himself in the aftermath of the 9/11 \nterrorist\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\nattacks. At a time when some were calling for us to sacrifice our \nrights in the fight against terrorism, Pat Leahy said that we could be \nboth safe and free.\n  He worked to include important civil liberties protections in the \nPATRIOT Act. He led the opposition to controversial Bush administration \npolicies relating to torture, indefinite detention, and the warrantless \nsurveillance of innocent American citizens. He was one of the first \nMembers of Congress to speak out against the Guantanamo Bay detention \ncenter. Chairman Leahy led the fight against the Military Commissions \nAct. He was particularly eloquent and persistent in defending the right \nto habeas corpus and he was vindicated when the Supreme Court held that \nthe habeas-stripping provision of the Military Commissions Act is \nunconstitutional.\n  Chairman Leahy has also been a giant in the Senate when it comes to \njudicial nominations. He has fought to preserve the integrity and \nindependence of our Federal judiciary throughout his career and long \ntenure on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Despite the highly charged atmosphere that has beset the judicial \nnominations process in recent years, Chairman Leahy handled judicial \nnominations fairly and expeditiously during his chairmanship of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee under President George W. Bush. In the \napproximately 3 years in which he chaired the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee under President Bush, 168 of the President's judicial \nnominees were confirmed. By comparison, during the 4-year period under \nPresident Bush when Republicans had a majority in the Senate and \nchaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, only 158 judicial nominees were \nconfirmed.\n  Chairman Leahy also led the fight to enhance the security of Federal \njudges and courthouses in the wake of several tragic incidents of \nviolence our Nation witnessed in recent years. This record is a tribute \nto Chairman Leahy's deep respect for the Federal bench and his \ncommitment to bipartisanship in the advice and consent process.\n  Senator Leahy has fought for human rights at home and abroad. As the \nlead sponsor of the Innocence Protection Act, he has worked to ensure \nthat innocent people are not subject to the death penalty. He has been \nthe foremost champion in Congress in the campaign against antipersonnel \nlandmines, authoring the first legislation by any government to ban the \nexport of landmines.\n  I want to pay tribute particularly to Chairman Leahy for creating the \nHuman Rights and the Law subcommittee in January 2007 and for giving me \nthe opportunity to chair this subcommittee during the 110th Congress. I \nwas proud to work with Senator Leahy in the 110th Congress to enact the \nGenocide Accountability Act, which makes it a crime to commit genocide \nanywhere in the world; the Child Soldiers Accountability Act, which \nmakes it a crime and violation of immigration law to recruit or use \nchild soldiers anywhere in the world; and the Trafficking in Persons \nAccountability Act, which makes it a crime to engage in human \ntrafficking anywhere in the world.\n  Mr. President, America is fortunate to have Senator Patrick Leahy's \nleadership at this challenging moment in our history. I look forward to \nworking with him as we strive to restore the rule of law at home and to \nreclaim America's role as a champion for human rights around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/10/senate-section/article/S2961-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ADOPTION INCENTIVES PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last year, working together, Republicans \nand Democrats produced one of the most far-reaching improvements to our \nNation's child welfare system in over a decade. The Fostering \nConnections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 included a \nnumber of policies designed to increase the number of adoptions of \nspecial needs children in foster care.\n  Unfortunately, the Omnibus appropriations bill that the Senate is \nconsidering this week includes a provision that overrides the Adoption \nIncentives improvements included in the Fostering Connections to \nSuccess and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008.\n  I have been told that it was not the intention of the drafters of the \nOmnibus appropriations bill to override the improvements to the \nAdoption Incentives Program and the Democratic leadership intends to \ncorrect this problem in the future.\n  The right thing would be to correct this problem in the underlying \nbill and I filed an amendment that would have accomplished this. \nUnfortunately, I was told by the Democratic leadership that they would \nnot allow the bill to be changed at all.\n  I am not happy that I was not permitted to fix this problem in the \nomnibus bill. This unfortunate outcome, where real progress in \nincreasing the number of adoptions is potentially jeopardized, \nhighlights the perils of rushing legislation through in a partisan \nmanner and not consulting with the committees of jurisdiction.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank Senator Grassley. We worked together on the \nFostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 \nin what was a model of bipartisan and bicameral legislating. I do not \nwant to see any provisions of that work jeopardized.\n  While I am certain that our colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee in no way mean to jeopardize the adoption incentive \nprovisions of the Fostering Connections and Increasing Adoptions Act, I \nalso feel that communication with the Finance Committee would have led \nto an easy remedy. My staff, working with the Congressional Research \nService, caught the error as soon as the language was introduced and \nmade available.\n  We need to work together toward a solution. I am prepared to \nintroduce legislation to correct the error and preserve the work of the \nFinance Committee, Ways and Means Committee, and child welfare \ncommunity.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do want the members of the adoption community to be \nassured that I will do everything in my power to make sure this \ncorrection is made and that adoption incentive funds are made \navailable. I will be happy to introduce legislation with my partner on \nthe Senate Finance Committee, the chairman of that committee, Senator \nBaucus. We can base the legislation on my amendment to reinstate the \nadoption incentives improvements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/10/senate-section/article/S2961-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2961-S2963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am sure you are fully aware of the impact high gasoline \n     prices is having on Idahoans. A large portion of the \n     population are on fixed incomes that do not rise with \n     inflation or energy costs. Another large portion of the \n     population barely earned enough to feed their families when \n     gas was $1.25 a gallon. Many of those same Americans are \n     still earning the same or slightly better wages, though \n     inflation and higher energy costs have effectively caused a \n     net reduction in their incomes.\n       Personally, it is hard to find work, I have turned in \n     dozens of applications without even a single interview. So, I \n     decided to get my degree online, since it was out of the \n     question to commute to a campus because of fuel costs. My \n     best friend commuted for his entire two years of community \n     college, roughly 60 miles round trip every day. However, it \n     is prohibitively expensive to do so now. I am also self-\n     employed, doing whatever work I can find, though it never \n     amounts to much more than paying what expenses I do have. \n     Lately I have been selling firewood to help cover the \n     increases in gas prices, since I am a small-scale miner/gold \n     prospector and\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\n     wish to explore some gold-producing regions in this great \n     state this year.\n       I recall hearing that the government removed gasoline from \n     the Consumer Price Index in the 80s; if this is true, it was \n     a grave mistake. These gasoline and oil prices will cause \n     inflation almost as fast as the Federal Reserve having a \n     license to print money as fast as they can.\n       As an American, and Idahoan, I want to state that we need \n     to lift the bans on offshore oil drilling. Norway, I believe, \n     has always drilled offshore, and they export quite a bit of \n     oil, as well as keeping their own energy costs down compared \n     to other areas of the world. I understand that we are not \n     drilling much offshore; however, I have heard that Cuba and \n     other Caribbean countries have been, which means if we do not \n     pump the oil ourselves, someone else will.\n       Second, hydroelectric is the safest, cheapest, and most \n     superior form of electricity any country can harness and \n     possess. Instead of demolishing dams, we need to build more \n     if possible. Licenses need to be granted to all existing dams \n     if there is any possible way for them to expand their \n     generating capacity. Environmentalists cry we need more solar \n     power. Solar panels are inefficient given that it takes a \n     huge surface area to generate a small amount of energy. I \n     suppose if they could be installed in places that are rarely \n     used, and out of sight, so much the better, so Solar panels \n     should be installed on the roofs of city buildings, would not \n     take up valuable land that is so desperately needed for \n     farming, and other uses.\n       As far as gasoline and alternative fuels, I would petition \n     Congress to reopen the investigation into the Ocean Thermal \n     Energy Conversion, which was experimented with during the \n     70s, but later abandoned after the oil crisis. It would use \n     the naturally-heated water, pumped through heat exchangers, \n     causing refrigerants to be evaporated in a closed system, \n     driving turbines, creating electricity which could then be \n     used to synthesize the ammonia fuel, which ammonia is not \n     combustible in normal atmospheric pressure, but when \n     introduced into a high pressure environment, such as a \n     combustion chamber, it will combust. In the early part of \n     this decade it was estimated that the fuel could be \n     produced and distributed with probably no higher than a \n     50-cent per gallon cost. Just a small fleet of ships \n     around the equator would be able to supply the entire \n     world's energy. Combustion of the ammonia would produce \n     only water vapor. I studied this in high school thanks to \n     being in the U.S. Academic Decathlon, and it grabbed my \n     interest so I did what research I could on the matter.\n       Another main objective should be to get the oil fields in \n     Iraq back in production ASAP. I have read production reports \n     from before and after the Iraq invasion. I forget how much \n     Iraq was producing prior to the invasion, but afterwards, \n     there has been negligible amounts of oil being produced \n     there.\n       I would also propose that tax incentives should be given to \n     wealthy landowners in regions that have historically been \n     productive for wildcatting. The incentives being to get the \n     landowners who can afford to, to explore their properties for \n     oil.\n       There is also another solution which I feel the auto \n     industry purposely avoids telling people. It is a fact, that \n     I have seen, and rode in, never could find one for sale, \n     SUVs, small pick-ups and the like, with 4-cylinder diesel \n     engines that provided plenty of power, with a fuel economy of \n     anywhere from 45 to 60 miles per gallon. Rudolph Diesel, who \n     invented the Diesel engine had stated that his life's work \n     would be complete once it was used in automobiles. I firmly \n     believe the Germans have been at the forefront of technology, \n     efficiency, and precision, and that auto makers should \n     produce more vehicles with these 4-cylinder diesels.\n       I know, the environmentalists have for the most part banned \n     diesel in many places. However, what makes it cleaner and \n     better for the environment to burn 2.5 to 3 gallons of gas \n     than to burn 1 gallon of diesel?\n       I do believe it is wrong to say that America is addicted to \n     oil. We aren't addicted to oil; there is no alternative, and \n     nothing that we can put in our tanks has the same energy \n     potential gallon for gallon as gasoline or diesel. However, I \n     recall vaguely a quote I read that was said by Nikola Tesla, \n     basically saying it was barbaric for an nation to use up its \n     crude oil reserves. But I say it is equally barbaric to use \n     food crops to produce alternative fuels, AKA ethanol. Why \n     cannot we turn noxious weeds such as knapp weed and bull \n     thistles into ethanol? Why does it have to be corn?! People \n     are starving, and here we are gassing up with food that \n     should be used to feed people. People cannot eat oil or \n     gasoline. It is my understanding that the U.S. government \n     pays subsidies to farmers so they do not plant hundreds of \n     millions of acres of land to keep prices up on certain crops. \n     If corn must be used, it should be from the land that the \n     government is paying them not to plant, since the other corn \n     crops are sufficient for food needs.\n       It is also my understanding that the world's largest \n     deposit of oil shale exists in the United States. It amounts \n     to almost double the proven recoverable crude oil reserves in \n     the world. Why are not we mining and processing this oil \n     shale? Further, I do not see how the oil companies are making \n     record profits.\n       The one thing it has been politically incorrect to talk \n     about is inflation. If you adjust the oil companies' incomes \n     for inflation, everyone will find that in real wealth, their \n     earnings are breaking no records. When gas was 25 cents a \n     gallon, it was a silver quarter that was being paid. The \n     amount of silver in a silver quarter is worth now \n     approximately $3 to $4. So in terms of REAL wealth, \n     constitutional money as per Article One, Section Ten, the \n     price has gone from, what, 25 cents a gallon to 30 cents \n     maybe? It is not that prices are going up; it is that the Fed \n     is printing too much money driving the value of the dollar \n     down faster than wages can go up, and this usury needs to \n     stop.\n       They used to claim that there was not enough silver to \n     maintain a silver standard and supply enough money for \n     everyone. Hmmmm. . . Guess what that causes? Deflation! The \n     money would increase in purchasing power, and the same amount \n     of silver would continue to be sufficient for the needs of \n     the economy.\n       Sometimes I feel like I am the only American who \n     understands this problem.\n       I would like to point out: Heads should have rolled after \n     we abandoned the gold and silver standards. I am sure you \n     know what debasing currency is. This is what helped bring \n     Rome to an end. They figured out that most people would \n     accept a coin for face value regardless of content. So, \n     instead of say, 90% gold, the Romans started to debase their \n     coinage, so they could make more money with less gold. The \n     coins dropped in purity. More and more copper was added until \n     their gold coins contained almost no gold. This is what \n     happened in this country in the 60s when we abandoned silver. \n     Our Founding Fathers understood the problem, so I would like \n     to point out the one capital crime that no one has been \n     sentenced for.\n       According to the Coin Act of 1792, those who debased the \n     currency, ``or otherwise with a fraudulent intent'' were to \n     suffer the death penalty:\n       ``Penalty of Death for de-basing the coins. Section 19. And \n     be it further enacted, That if any of the gold or silver \n     coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint shall \n     be debased or made worse as to the proportion of the fine \n     gold or fine silver therein contained, or shall be of less \n     weight or value than the same out to be pursuant to the \n     directions of this act, through the default or with the \n     connivance of any of the officers or persons who shall be \n     employed at the said mint, for the purpose of profit or gain, \n     or otherwise with a fraudulent intent, and if any of the said \n     officers or persons shall embezzle any of the metals which \n     shall at any time be committed to their charge for the \n     purpose of being coined, or any of the coins which shall be \n     struck or coined at the said mint, every such officer or \n     person who shall commit any or either of the said offenses, \n     shall be deemed guilty of felony, and shall suffer death.''\n       America is not being held hostage by the gas pumps, or the \n     oil companies. Probably the greatest mistake any civilization \n     could make was breaking up Standard Oil. As soon as Standard \n     Oil was broken up, fuel prices went up quite a bit history \n     records. America is being held hostage by the monetizers of \n     debt, printing instead of legal tender, promissory notes \n     which take a perfectly valuable commodity like paper and ink, \n     and make them truely worthless, as stated by Ludwig Von Mises \n     when he was talking about fiat currency.\n       Economist John Maynard Keynes, who was chief architect of \n     the fiat currency system, had stated ``The best way to \n     destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency. By \n     a continuing process of inflation, governments can \n     confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the \n     wealth of their citizens.'' And indeed that is what is \n     happening.\n       Patrick Henry had stated ``This great nation was founded \n     not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but \n     on the Gospel of Jesus Christ!''. I agree with this \n     statement. However, our government has gone from the wise \n     ways of a Republic, with the Biblical honest weights and \n     measures, to a corrupted system that is now based almost \n     entirely on the system of usury.\n       There is no shortage of oil, and people are willing to pay \n     the prices they are paying for it now. They have no choice, \n     and those prices being paid now, are the result of a paper \n     currency that is constantly being inflated. A barrel of Oil \n     is always worth a barrel of Oil, and an ounce of silver is \n     always worth an ounce of silver. A dollar is not always worth \n     a dollar.\n       So, while I still have the 1st Amendment rights, I am going \n     to send this letter, and pray that it does not fall on deaf \n     ears.\n     Adam.\n                                  ____\n\n       In response to your email requesting some stories about the \n     rising oil costs, I would like to contribute the following. \n     This will not be a simple paragraph or two and, for that, I \n     apologize.\n       I grew up in Helena, Montana, and crawled around in mines \n     and mills as a kid and young adult. I have seen firsthand, \n     the long-term effects of mine waste and tailings piles where \n     nothing would grow on the waste for 100 years, the small \n     streams and creeks ran orange in Butte and the banks were \n     brown for up to 10 feet on either side. Now, I also \n     understand back then, this was not seen as damaging and there \n     were plenty of open spaces and clear skies for the infant \n     country of the USA and, without these mines and mills, the \n     U.S. would not be what it is today.\n       I worked for almost 27 years in the oil exploration \n     industry and almost 16 years of that was working and living \n     in Brasil so I have firsthand exposure to the shortcomings \n     and failures of alcohol fuels and the damage it has done to \n     the economy of Brasil.\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\n       Further, I have seen what the U.S. has done to destroy the \n     drilling industry in the states as well as driving out any \n     U.S. Coast Guard licensed personnel, U.S. flag vessels and \n     shipyard work done in the U.S.\n       Now let us consider alcohol fuels and blended gasoline:\n       As a developing country, Brasil needs oil, they do not have \n     a large export economy and until recently, did not have a \n     large internal oil supply. To offset the cost of importing \n     oil, they mandated the use of alcohol as a fuel for their \n     automobiles. Since labor is cheap and technology was not, \n     Brasil had a huge labor intensive industry of raising sugar \n     cane for the purpose of making fuel. In fact this was nothing \n     more that rum!\n       Sugar cane derived fuel is still recognized as the \n     ``hottest'' fuel as compared to corn.\n       Brasil mandated that alcohol fuel be the same price as \n     gasoline and forced Petrobras to manufacture and distribute \n     alcohol to do so.\n       Even at $50/ month average worker wages, sugar cane growing \n     almost unattended, IE no need for irrigation or fertilizers, \n     the cost per liter of alcohol was 4 to 5 times that of the \n     cost the same liter of gasoline! This resulted in an enormous \n     tax base to Brasilian citizens, up to 60% and a horrid \n     inflation spiral you cannot imagine, inflations of 100% per \n     month!\n       In my opinion, alcohol is not only a stupid idea; it \n     accelerates the consumption of oil and the earth's resources \n     and causes MORE pollution. Here is why:\n       (1) Alcohol loves water and will absorb water while in \n     storage and in use. This causes any iron or steel parts in \n     the engine to wear out faster. This means more parts and or \n     more engines are needed sooner. These parts can only be \n     derived from metal which means more mining, smelting and more \n     heavy metal pollution.\n       (2) Alcohol does not give as much power per unit of liquid \n     as gasoline, no matter what! Anyone can do this and it does \n     not need a scientific degree for real average Joe results. \n     Drive in South Dakota where it is mandated to have 10% \n     alcohol/ 90% gasoline blended fuel. The interstate is flat so \n     you can set your cruise control. I did this in my Mazda \n     pickup and have seen similar results by being forced to use \n     alcohol fuels in Washington in other vehicles. By driving say \n     320 miles on the interstate with gasoline only, you can \n     achieve say 20 miles per gallon which would use 16 gallons of \n     gasoline.\n       Now, blended fuel decreases the fuel efficiency of any \n     internal combustion and lowers its economy. This same vehicle \n     with the blended fuel gets anywhere between 20 to 25% less \n     MPG. In our same example, this vehicle would get 15 to 16 \n     MPG, which means the same 320 miles would take 21 to 20 \n     gallons of blend. Now, this blended fuel is 90% gasoline in \n     21 gallons of blend there is 21 0.9 = 18.9 gallons of \n     gasoline and 20 gallons of blend is 20 0.9 = 18 gallons of \n     gasoline.\n       So, our blended fuel consumes at least 20% more \n     gasoline!!!!! In this journey that means an average of 3 \n     gallons more of gasoline for the trip.\n       These are real results I did myself!\n       Even autos designed for alcohol blends get less economy and \n     consumes more fuel! You can check in Phoenix, Arizona, as \n     they mandate blended fuels in the summer and the cars get \n     poorer economy.\n       So, what does alcohol fuels do?\n       (1) Consumes more oil\n       (2) Consumes more of the earth's metals by wearing out \n     engines quicker\n       (3) Consumes more of the earth's energy. You have to plant, \n     harvest, ferment, distill and purify corn to generate \n     alcohol. It costs about 6 times more per gallon to make than \n     gasoline and wastes water, electricity and fuel to make. \n     Since the government subsidizes this, we the tax payers loose \n     big time and the environment suffers at an even accelerated \n     rate.\n       (4) It takes food out of circulation and raises prices.\n       (5) Who wins? Big oil for more demand, the automobile \n     industry, farmers and the government in the form of more \n     taxes.\n       (6) Who loses? The American citizen.\n       Now, what have I seen? Well, much of the U.S. does not have \n     public transport and we have to drive for food, work, \n     shopping and anything else. I have seen my gasoline bills \n     almost double in the past 6 months and I am driving much \n     less.\n       Much of the U.S. does not have natural gas and we use \n     propane. Propane has jumped 50% in price the past 6 months \n     that means heating bills have jumped 50%. Even thought we are \n     mainly hydroelectric for electricity, my power bill has \n     increased an average of 25% due to pressure from fossil fuel \n     increases.\n       I am retired and on a fixed income and cannot afford to pay \n     my bills any longer due to the significant increases!\n       And please do not get me started on the fallacy of \n     fluorescent lighting and electric autos. Both are dangerous \n     and will cause tremendous heavy metal pollution as well as a \n     larger demand for mining and thus more toxic waste.\n       Not to be a cynic but I know this will fall on deaf ears as \n     it is not politically expedient to take the correct position \n     instead of the one Washington currently has taken.\n     Frank, Spirit Lake.\n                                  ____\n\n       We recently took a three-night trip to Yellowstone Park, \n     driving from Boise. Our VW Passatt station wagon, a roomy and \n     very comfortable car, uses about half the fuel of a pickup \n     truck (29 to 34 mpg highway). For this trip for four adults, \n     the cost of lodging and food (meals eaten in restaurants) \n     dwarfed the cost of gasoline.\n       The higher price of fuel will spur both innovation \n     (www.aptera.com) and conservation. As Boise is close to being \n     under EPA ``supervision'' for air quality non-attainment \n     (ozone), the higher price of gas can only help as demand \n     slackens.\n       Let us face it, most of us are not wise users of energy, \n     and with a little extra effort we all could reduce our \n     consumption by 10% to 25%. I see many more pedestrians and \n     bicycles on the streets, most of us need more exercise. Our \n     consumptive habits and the growth of said consumption is not \n     sustainable--innovation and conservation will have to happen \n     to solve our energy problems.\n       In reading your email regarding this problem, I have to ask \n     you who is responsible for lack of public transportation in \n     this country?\n     David, Boise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/10/senate-section/article/S2963-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING EIGHT KENTUCKY STATE POLICE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

A bill to provide for the exchange of certain land located in \nthe Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests in the State of Colorado, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Sugar Loaf Fire \nStation Land Exchange Act of 2009.\n  This bill is the same as the version I introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives in the last Congress, H.R. 3181. It will facilitate a \nfair exchange of lands on the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest near \nBoulder, CO., between the Forest Service and the Sugar Loaf Fire \nDistrict. The Fire District is seeking this exchange so that they can \nmaintain and upgrade their fire stations serving the Sugar Loaf \ncommunity and other nearby communities and properties--areas that are \nin the wildland/urban interface and thus at risk of wildfires. In fact, \nthese fire stations serve the area that was burned in the Black Tiger \nFire in 1989. That fire was the motivation for the Sugar Loaf community \nto invest more strongly in fire protection. The Fire District has grown \na lot over the years, and will be celebrating its 40th anniversary this \nAugust.\n  The bill relates to two fire stations. The Fire District acquired \nstation 1 through an original mining claim under the 1872 mining laws. \nIn 1967, a public meeting was held on this property to establish a fire \ndistrict and modify the old school building on the site into a \nfirehouse to hold a fire truck and other firefighting equipment. On May \n14, 1969, the U.S. Forest Service approved a special use permit, which \nallowed the fire department to use both the firehouse and approximately \n5 acres of the property under it. The special use permit was reissued \non August 11, 1994, with a life of 10 years.\n  In 1970, the fire department applied for a special use permit to \noperate and maintain a second firehouse--station 2--on Sugar Loaf Road. \nThe original permit was approved of in 1970, and had an expiration date \nof December 31, 1991. The permit boundary included 2 acres.\n  The special use permit issued in 1994 combined the two permits for \nstations 1 and 2 into one. The new permit for station 2 reduced the \npermit area to one acre, because the area of impact and existing \nimprovements did not exceed one acre.\n  The Fire District entered into discussions with the Forest Service \nabout a land swap. In August 1997, the Fire District filed an \napplication to acquire the property under stations 1 and 2 pursuant to \nthe Small Tracts Act, STA. The STA allows for transfers of small \nmineral fractions by the sale of property for market value, or by the \nexchange of properties of nearly equal value. The application proposed \ntrading a mining claim surrounded by National Forest, for approximately \n3 acres under station 1 and 1.5 acres under station 2.\n  The Fire District worked in good faith to comply with the STA. In \nNovember 2002, officials from the Fire District met with officials from \nthe Forest Service. Upon review of the STA application, the Forest \nService concluded that the parcel under station 2 did not qualify for a \nland exchange and that the Fire District would have to pursue a new \nspecial use permit for the property under station 2. As a result, the \nFire District is interested in securing ownership of the land under \nthese stations through this exchange legislation.\n  The Fire District has occupied and operated these fire stations on \nthese properties for over 30 years. If they can secure ownership, the \nlands will continue to be used as sites for fire stations. The Fire \nDistrict has made a strong, persistent, good faith effort to acquire \nthe land under the stations through administrative means and has \ndemonstrated its sincere commitment to this project by expending its \nmonetary resources and the time of its staff to satisfy the \nrequirements set forth by the Forest Service.\n  However, those efforts have not succeeded and it has become evident \nthat legislation is required to resolve the situation.\n  The Fire District is willing to trade the property it owns for the \nproperty under the stations. However, the Fire District is firm in its \nposition that it wants land under both stations, and that the amount of \nland must be adequate to satisfy both its current and anticipated \nneeds.\n  Under the bill, the land exchange will proceed if the Fire District \noffers to convey acceptable title to a specified parcel of land \namounting to about 5.17 acres in an unincorporated part of Boulder \nCounty within National Forest boundaries between the communities of \nBoulder and Nederland. In return, the land--about 5.08 acres--where the \ntwo fire stations are located will be transferred to the Fire District.\n  The lands transferred to the Federal government will become part of \nthe Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest and managed accordingly.\n  The bill provides that the Forest Service shall determine the values \nof all lands involved through appraisals in accordance with Federal \nstandards. If the lands conveyed by the Fire District are not equal in \nvalue to the lands where the fire stations are located, the Fire \nDistrict will make a cash payment to make up the difference. If the \nlands being conveyed to the Federal government are worth more than the \nlands where the fire stations are located, the Forest Service can \nequalize values by reducing the lands it receives or by paying to make \nup the difference or by a combination of both methods. The bill \nrequires the Fire District to pay for the appraisals and any necessary \nland surveys.\n  The bill permits the Fire District to modify the fire stations \nwithout waiting for completion of the exchange if the Fire District \nholds the Federal government harmless for any liability arising from \nthe construction work and indemnifies the Federal Government against \nany costs related to the construction or other activities on the lands \nbefore they are conveyed to the Fire District.\n  This is a relatively minor bill but one that is important to the Fire \nDistrict and the people it serves. I think it deserves enactment \nwithout unnecessary delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dodd, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Casey, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Reid, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Carper, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n        Cardin, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, \n        Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Begich, Mr. Burris, Mr. Kaufman, and Mrs. \n        Gillibrand)):\n   S. 560. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to \nestablish an efficient system to enable employees to form, join, or \nassist labor organizations, to provide for mandatory injunctions for \nunfair labor practices during the organizing efforts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are facing a profound economic crisis, the likes of \nwhich we have not seen since the Great Depression. Countless working \nfamilies who were already living on the edge of financial disaster have \nbeen hit hard, and they have nothing to fall back on. Their faith in \nthe American dream has been replaced by fear for their families and \ntheir future.\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\n  We have already taken some much-needed actions to put our country \nback on track, but more needs to be done. In these perilous times, \nworking families need security. They need new skills and new \nopportunities. And they need a voice in the decisions that will affect \ntheir families and their futures.\n  Now more than ever, workers need someone on their side, fighting for \nthem. Now more than ever, they need unions. Unions were fundamental in \nbuilding America's middle class, and they have a vital role to play \ntoday in restoring the American dream for working families.\n  First and foremost, unions enable workers to obtain their fair share \nof the benefits that their hard work creates. Union wages are 30 \npercent higher than nonunion wages. Eighty percent of union workers \nhave health insurance, compared to only 49 percent of their nonunion \ncounterparts. Union members are four times more likely to have a \nguaranteed pension.\n  Equally important in this crisis, unions provide greater security and \ngreater promise of fair treatment. At a time when workers who lose \ntheir jobs can remain unemployed for a year or more, those who are \nrepresented by a union have better job security and the assurance of \nknowing they will have a voice at the table when difficult decisions \nare made.\n  It is little wonder that so many Americans want a union on their \nside. In a recent survey, more than half of all nonunion workers--\nnearly 60 million men and women--say they would join a union if they \ncould.\n  The problem is that most workers who want a union can't get one. \nThose who attempt to exercise this fundamental right often find that \nthe current system is rigged against them.\n  Unscrupulous employers routinely break the law to keep unions out. \nThey fire union supporters. They intimidate workers, harass them, and \ndiscriminate against them. They close down whole departments--or even \nentire plants--to avoid a union. A recent study by the Center for \nEconomic and Policy Research found that union supporters are fired in \nmore than one quarter of all union organizing campaigns.\n  Even when workers prevail in a union election, employers can steal \nthe victory by refusing to bargain fairly for the first union contract. \nThey drag their feet, delay bargaining, and use a variety of other \ntactics to prevent an agreement. One study found that in more than a \nthird of hard-won union elections, workers are denied a contract \nbecause of employers' delaying tactics.\n  Many of these abuses by employers are illegal, but employers have no \nincentive to change their behavior. The penalties for violating \nworkers' rights are so weak that they simply become a minor cost of \ndoing business.\n  Obviously, not all employers see unions as the enemy. Many successful \ncompanies have allowed their workers to organize without threats or \ndirty tricks. They have formed strong partnerships with their \nemployees, and they have prospered. But these individual good examples \nare not enough to solve the problem. We need to deal with the bad \nactors. We need to stop the lawbreaking that has become alarmingly \ncommon and provide stronger protections for workers' rights.\n  That is why we need the Employee Free Choice Act. This important \nlegislation will give American workers the real freedom to choose a \nunion without fear of threats or intimidation.\n  First, the bill gives workers two possible ways to choose whether \nthey want a union. They can rely on an election, or--if they fear \nintimidation from their employer during the election process--they can \nuse a process called majority sign-up, which enables workers to choose \nwhether they want a union by deciding whether to sign their name on a \ncard calling for a union.\n  Majority sign-up has always been a valid way to form a union. Since \n2003, more than half a million private sector workers have formed a \nunion through this efficient and democratic process.\n  The problem is that under current law, workers may use the majority \nsign-up process only if their employer agrees. That is not fair. \nWorkers--not their bosses--should get to choose how they make the \nimportant decision about whether they want union representation. The \nEmployee Free Choice Act puts this choice in workers' hands.\n  Second, the bill ensures that workers who choose a union will have a \nfair process for getting a first contract. It provides that if the \nunion and the employer don't reach a contract within 90 days, either \nside can seek mediation from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation \nService. The agency has provided collective bargaining mediation \nservices--including mediation of first contract negotiations--for more \nthan 50 years, and it has an 86 percent success rate.\n  In the rare instance when the mediation process fails, the bill \nprovides for binding arbitration, which will be handled by a panel of \nhighly qualified arbitrators who have long experience in developing \ncontract provisions that are fair to both sides. This type of \narbitration is a tried-and-true method of resolving contract disputes \nthat is already used in the rail and airline industries, and for public \nsector workers in at least 25 States.\n  Finally, the Employee Free Choice Act improves remedies for workers \nwho face discrimination or retaliation when they seek to organize or \nobtain a first contract. Under the bill, employers will no longer be \nable to violate the law with impunity and write off the insignificant \npenalties as a minor cost of doing business. The act takes away these \nperverse incentives for employers to break the law by increasing the \nremedies for workers, and by imposing new penalties on employers who \nact illegally during organizing campaigns or first-contract bargaining. \nThese important changes will put real teeth in the law, and give \nemployers a financial reason to respect workers' rights.\n  With these basic reforms, the Employee Free Choice Act will fix the \ncurrent broken system and level the economic playing field for millions \nof American workers. It will help them obtain real, tangible benefits \nthat will make a difference in their lives and in the lives of their \nfamilies.\n  By restoring fairness to the American workplace, and strengthening \nthe voice of American workers, we can rebuild the land of opportunity--\na land with good jobs, fair wages, and fair benefits that can support a \nfamily. We can revitalize the American middle class and restore the \nAmerican dream. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation and help put working families back on the path to \nprosperity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON, of Florida (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. \n        Klobuchar):\n  S. 562. A bill to require accurate and reasonable disclosure of the \nterms and conditions of prepaid telephone calling cards and services, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, prepaid telephone calling cards \nare used by many Americans to stay in touch with loved ones around the \ncountry and throughout the world. Unfortunately, some providers and \ndistributors of these cards are scamming consumers--by imposing \nundisclosed junk fees, charging exorbitant rates, and selling cards \nthat expire shortly after consumers start using them.\n  Over the past couple of years, a number of State Attorneys General \nand the Federal Trade Commission have opened investigations and found \nthat a number of providers and distributors are engaging in unfair and \ndeceptive business practices. These practices include charging \ncustomers for calls where they receive busy signals, imposing weekly \n``maintenance fees'' that may take away up to 20 percent of the card's \noverall value, and billing for calls in 3-minute increments.\n  As a result of these investigations, some companies have been fined \nor have entered into consent decrees forbidding them from engaging in \nsome deceptive practices. In addition, some states--including Florida--\nhave imposed certain regulatory requirements on prepaid calling card \nproviders and distributors. To date, however, neither the Federal \nCommunications Commission nor the Federal Trade Commission has taken \nany action to impose up-front nationwide consumer protection \nrequirements on this industry. This lack of federal standards allows \nmany of these unscrupulous operators to move from state to state, and \ncreate new ``shell companies'' to escape consumer protection \nregulations. This is\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\nwrong, and I think we need to fix this situation.\n  That's why I rise today to introduce the Prepaid Calling Card \nConsumer Protection Act of 2009.\n  The Prepaid Calling Card Consumer Protection Act of 2009 requires the \nFederal Trade Commission to draft comprehensive rules requiring all \nprepaid telephone calling card providers and distributors to disclose \nthe rates and fees associated with their calling cards up-front, at the \npoint of sale. It also requires providers who market their cards in \nlanguages other than English to disclose rates and fees in that \nlanguage as well. Furthermore, the legislation requires providers to \nhonor the cards for at least a year after the time the card is first \nused.\n  To enforce these disclosure requirements, the bill gives the Federal \nTrade Commission, State Attorneys General, and state consumer \nprotection advocates the ability to sue the fraudsters who violate \nthese requirements in federal court. In addition, the law preserves \nadditional state consumer protection requirements--such as state \nutility commission certification or bonding requirements.\n  I invite my colleagues to join with Senators Snowe, Klobuchar and \nmyself in supporting the Prepaid Calling Card Consumer Protection Act \nof 2009. We should waste no time in ensuring that military \nservicemembers, seniors, immigrants and other Americans using these \nprepaid telephone calling cards are protected from bad actors in the \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish commissions to review the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding injustices suffered by European Americans, \nEuropean Latin Americans, and Jewish refugees during World War II; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Wartime Treatment \nStudy Act. This bill would create two factfinding commissions: one \ncommission to review the treatment by our Government during World War \nII of American citizens or residents of German or Italian descent and \npersons of European descent living in Latin American countries, and \nanother commission to review the U.S. Government's treatment of Jewish \nrefugees fleeing Nazi persecution during World War II. This bill is \nlong overdue.\n  I am very pleased that my colleagues Senators Grassley, Kennedy, \nLieberman, Inouye, Cardin and Wyden have joined me as cosponsors of \nthis important bill. I thank them for their support. And I thank \nCongressman Wexler, who has been the unflagging champion of this \nlegislation and will be introducing an identical bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The victory of America and its allies in the Second World War was a \ntriumph for freedom, justice, and human rights. The courage displayed \nby so many Americans, of all ethnic origins, should be a source of \ngreat pride for all Americans.\n  But, at the same time that so many brave Americans fought for freedom \nin Europe and the Pacific, the U.S. Government was curtailing the \nfreedom of people here at home. While it is, of course, the right of \nevery nation to protect itself during wartime, the U.S. Government must \nrespect the basic freedoms for which so many Americans have given their \nlives. War tests our principles and our values. And as our Nation's \nrecent experience has shown, it is during times of war and conflict, \nwhen our fears are high and our principles are tested most, that we \nmust be even more vigilant to guard against violations of the basic \nfreedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.\n  Many Americans are aware that during World War II, under the \nauthority of Executive Order 9066, our Government forced more than \n100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes and ultimately into internment \ncamps. Japanese Americans were forced to leave their homes, their \nlivelihoods, and their communities and were held behind barbed wire and \nmilitary guard by their own government. Through the work of the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, created \nby Congress in 1980, this shameful event finally received the official \nacknowledgement and condemnation it deserved.\n  While I commend our Government for finally recognizing and \napologizing for the mistreatment of Japanese Americans during World War \nII, I believe that it is time that the Government also acknowledge the \nmistreatment experienced by American citizens or residents of German or \nItalian descent and persons of European descent living in Latin \nAmerican countries, as well as Jewish refugees.\n  The Wartime Treatment Study Act would create two independent, fact-\nfinding commissions to review this unfortunate history, so that \nAmericans can understand why it happened and work to ensure that it \nnever happens again. One commission will review the treatment by the \nU.S. Government of German Americans, Italian Americans, and other \nEuropean Americans, as well as European Latin Americans, during World \nWar II.\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\n  I believe that most Americans are unaware that the U.S. Government \ndesignated more than 600,000 Italian-born and 300,000 German-born \nUnited States resident aliens and their families as ``enemy aliens.'' \nThe U.S. Government unfairly subjected many to arrest, detainment, and \nrelocation. Indeed, as was the case with Japanese Americans, \napproximately 11,000 ethnic Germans, 3,200 ethnic Italians, and scores \nof Bulgarians, Hungarians, Romanians or other European Americans living \nin America were taken from their homes and placed in internment camps \nduring World War II. Even less well known is the U.S. policy \ncoordinated with many Latin American countries that resulted in \nthousands of European Americans, including German and Austrian Jews, \nbeing arrested, shipped to the United States by U.S. military \ntransport, and interned. Many European Americans and European Latin \nAmericans were later repatriated or deported to European Axis nations \nduring World War II, and some were exchanged for Americans and Latin \nAmericans held in those nations. We must learn from this history and \nexplore why we failed to protect the basic freedoms of our fellow \nAmericans and those brought here from Latin America.\n  A second commission created by this bill will review the treatment by \nthe U.S. Government of Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi \npersecution and genocide. We must review the facts here as well and \ndetermine how restrictive immigration policies failed to provide \nadequate safe harbor to Jewish refugees fleeing the persecution of Nazi \nGermany. It is a horrible truth that the United States turned away \nthousands of refugees, delivering many refugees to their deaths at the \nhands of the Nazi regime.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there has been a measure of justice for \nJapanese Americans who were denied their liberty and property. It is \nnow time for the U.S. Government to complete the accounting of this \nperiod in our Nation's history. It is now time to create independent, \nfact finding commissions to conduct a full and thorough review of the \ntreatment of all European Americans, European Latin Americans, and \nJewish refugees during World War II.\n  Up to this point, there has been no justice for the thousands of \nGerman Americans, Italian Americans, and other European Americans who \nwere branded ``enemy aliens'' and then taken from their homes, \nsubjected to curfews, limited in their travel, deprived of their \npersonal property, and, in the worst cases, placed in internment camps.\n  There has been no justice for Latin Americans of European descent who \nwere taken from their homes, shipped to the United States, and interned \nhere.\n  There has been no justice for the European Americans and European \nLatin Americans who were repatriated or deported to hostile, war-torn \nEuropean Axis powers, often in exchange for Americans being held in \nthose countries.\n  Finally, there has been no justice for the thousands of Jews, like \nthose aboard the German vessel the St. Louis, who sought refuge from \nhostile Nazi treatment but were callously turned away at America's \nshores.\n  The injustices to European Americans, European Latin Americans, and \nJewish refugees occurred more than 60 years ago. Americans must learn \nfrom these tragedies now, while the people who survived these \ninjustices are still with us, and are still here to teach us. We cannot \nput this off any longer. Their numbers are rapidly dwindling. I spoke \non the Senate floor in the last Congress about one such former \ninternee, Max Ebel, who died still waiting for his country to \nacknowledge his internment and those of many other European Americans. \nIf we wait any longer, even more people who were affected will no \nlonger be here to know that Congress has at last recognized their \nsacrifice and resolved to learn from the mistakes of the past.\n  We should never allow this part of our Nation's history to repeat \nitself. And, while we should be proud of our Nation's triumph in World \nWar II, we should not let that justifiable pride blind us to the \ntreatment of some Americans by their own government.\n  I was very pleased that the Senate approved this bill by an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority as an amendment to the immigration \nbill in 2007. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Wartime \nTreatment Study Act again this Congress, and to allow this bill to \nbecome law as soon as possible. I have been seeking to enact this \nlegislation for eight years. It is long past time for a full accounting \nof this tragic chapter in our Nation's history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families, requiring them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limiting their travel and personal \n     property rights. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, thousands of European Latin \n     Americans, including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, \n     relocated to the United States, and interned. Many were later \n     repatriated or deported to European Axis nations during World \n     War II and exchanged for Americans and Latin Americans held \n     in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the German American and Italian American \n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide continued entitlement to coverage for immunosuppressive drugs \nfurnished to beneficiaries under the Medicare Program that have \nreceived a kidney transplant and whose entitlement to coverage would \notherwise expire, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. March 12 is recognized as World Kidney Day, a day to \nraise awareness of the major health and societal costs of kidney \ndisease. Today, 26 million American adults have chronic kidney disease, \nand 500,000 have irreversible kidney failure, or end-stage renal \ndisease ESRD. These patients require dialysis or a kidney transplant to \nsurvive.\n  Fortunately, medical advancements have transformed organ \ntransplantation from an experimental procedure into the accepted and \noften best treatment for organ failure. Transplantation has prolonged \nand improved the lives of thousands of Americans. Over 16,000 Americans \nreceived a kidney transplant in 2007, and 150,000 today are living with \nfunctioning kidney transplants.\n  Many of these kidney transplants were paid for by the Medicare \nsystem, which provides health care to aged and disabled Americans, as \nwell as those living with ESRD. For these ESRD patients, Medicare also \ncovers dialysis for patients who have not received a donor kidney and \nimmunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplant recipients. Organ \ntransplant recipients must take immunosuppressive drugs every day for \nthe life of their transplant to reduce the risk of organ rejection.\n  In 2000, Congress wisely eliminated the 36-month time limitation for \naged and disabled beneficiaries who had Medicare status at the time of \ntransplant. So today, for an older or disabled person on Medicare, \nimmunosuppressive drugs are covered by Medicare for the life of the \ntransplant.\n  However, we still have an unfair and unrealistic gap in coverage for \npeople with ESRD who are neither disabled nor elderly. For those \ntransplant recipients, coverage for immunosuppressive drugs ends 36 \nmonths after transplantation. This is economically inefficient and \nmorally wrong. Without regular access to immunosuppressive drugs to \nprevent rejection, many patients find themselves back in a risky and \nfrightening place--in need of a new kidney.\n  Since Medicare covers the cost of the transplant for end stage renal \ndisease, it makes sense for Medicare to preserve\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\nthis investment by covering antirejection drugs. It would be far less \nexpensive for Medicare to cover immunosuppressive drugs at a cost of \n$10,000 to $20,000 a year than to pay for dialysis--$71,000 a year--or \nanother transplant, $106,000, if a patient's kidney fails and he is \nonce again eligible for Medicare coverage.\n  I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Thad Cochran, the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive \nDrug Coverage for Transplant Patients Act. This legislation would allow \nkidney transplant recipients to continue Medicare coverage for the \npurpose of immunosuppressive drugs only. All other Medicare coverage \nwould end 36 months after the transplant.\n  It is time to take this step to provide continuous coverage for \nimmunosuppressive drugs through Medicare. This is a logical and moral \nmove that will reduce the need for dialysis and kidney retransplants \nand provide reliable, sustained access to critically important, \nlifesaving medications for thousands of Americans. In the long run, we \nwill save both money and lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to create a Financial Product Safety Commission, to \nprovide consumers with stronger protections and better information in \nconnection with consumer financial products, and to give providers of \nconsumer financial products more regulatory certainty; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. When consumers purchase tangible consumer products such \nas toasters or televisions, they can be reasonably confident that the \nproducts are safe for their families to use. In America we don't say \n``buyer beware'' when it comes to lead paint in toys or risky drugs. \nBut when Americans purchase financial products such as mortgages or \ncredit cards, they often have little idea whether those products --and \nthe mountain of fine print that come with them--are good for their \nfamilies. Why?\n  The answer is that consumer products are subject to oversight, while \nfinancial products are not. Professor Elizabeth Warren, Chairperson of \nthe Congressional Oversight Panel for the $700 billion Troubled Assets \nRelief Program, was right when she said ``we need more oversight.'' \nThat was more than a year ago.\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\n  Today there are no fewer than 10 Federal regulators with \nresponsibility for consumer protections from predatory or deceptive \nfinancial products, but none have oversight as its primary objective.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today with Senators Schumer and \nKennedy would create a Financial Product Safety Commission that would \nfocus exclusively on the interests of consumers. I am pleased that \nCongressmen Bill Delahunt and Brad Miller will be introducing the House \ncompanion.\n  The objectives of the Financial Product Safety Commission would be to \nreduce consumer risk in using financial products, coordinate \nenforcement with other Federal and State regulators, and report to the \npublic regarding the state of consumer financial product safety.\n  The Financial Product Safety Commission would fulfill that mission by \npreventing predatory and deceptive financial practices, educating \nconsumers on the responsible use of financial products and services, \nestablishing a regulatory floor beneath which consumer financial \nproduct safety could not fall, and recommending the steps that should \nbe taken to improve the value of financial products for consumers.\n  The bill is supported by over 55 national and State organizations, \nincluding Consumer Federation of America, Center for Responsible \nLending Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP, La Raza, AFL-CIO, \nSEIU, National Consumer Law Center, Consumers Union, Public Citizen, \nand U.S. PIRG. I include a statement of support for the Record.\n  As Congress embarks on financial regulatory reform, our improved \nregulatory system must focus not just on the safety and soundness of \nthe providers of financial products but also on the safety of the \nconsumers of financial products. The Financial Product Safety \nCommission will do just that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsupporting material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 566\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Financial \n     Product Safety Commission Act of 2009''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's multiagency financial services regulatory \n     structure has created a dispersion of regulatory \n     responsibility, which in turn has led to an inadequate focus \n     on protecting consumers from inappropriate consumer financial \n     products and practices;\n       (2) the absence of appropriate oversight has allowed \n     excessively costly or predatory consumer financial products \n     and practices to flourish; and\n       (3) the creation of a regulator whose sole focus is the \n     safety of consumer financial products would help address this \n     lack of consumer protection.\n\n     SEC. 3.

COLLABORATION WITH FEDERAL AND STATE ENTITIES.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--Nothing in this Act or any rule \n     promulgated under this Act may be construed to annul, alter, \n     affect, or exempt any person from complying with the laws of \n     any State, except to the extent that those laws are \n     inconsistent with a consumer financial product safety rule \n     promulgated by the Commission, and then only to the extent of \n     the inconsistency. For purposes of this section, a State law \n     is not inconsistent with this Act or a consumer financial \n     product safety rule, or the purposes of the Act or rule, if \n     the protection afforded by such State law to any consumer is \n     greater than the protection provided by the consumer \n     financial product safety rule or this Act.

Each such department or agency shall \n     cooperate with the Commission and, to the extent permitted by \n     law, furnish such materials to the Commission. The Commission \n     and the heads of other departments and agencies engaged in \n     administering programs relating to consumer financial product \n     safety shall, to the maximum extent practicable, cooperate \n     and consult in order to ensure fully coordinated efforts.\n\n     SEC. 9.

Richard J. Durbin\n     Majority Whip, U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. William Delahunt\n     House of Representatives\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Schumer\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Brad Miller\n     House of Representatives\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin and Schumer and Representatives \n     Delahunt and Miller: The undersigned organizations strongly \n     support your legislation to create a federal Financial \n     Product Safety Commission (FPSC) that would ensure the \n     fairness, safety and sustainability of credit and payment \n     products. It is now widely accepted that the current \n     international economic crisis was triggered by the failure of \n     federal regulators to stop abusive lending, particularly in \n     the housing sector. By creating a separate agency focused \n     exclusively on credit safety, your legislation will not only \n     better protect consumers, but the entire economy.\n       Under this legislation, the FPSC would be empowered to \n     ensure that credit and payment products do not have predatory \n     or deceptive features that can harm consumers or lock them \n     into unaffordable loans, such as pre-payment penalties, \n     unjustified fees, or hair-trigger interest rate increases. \n     The agency would also conduct ongoing research and \n     investigation into credit industry products and services. In \n     addition, it would provide consumers with high-quality \n     information about how to avoid abusive lending or credit \n     problems. This approach offers two crucial improvements over \n     the current splintered, ineffectual regulatory system:\n       A FPSC would put consumer protection first. Federal \n     regulatory agencies have often treated consumer protection as \n     less important than or even in conflict with their mission to \n     ensure the safety and soundness of financial institutions. In \n     addition, the independence of regulators like the Office of \n     the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift \n     Supervision has been threatened because they are directly and \n     almost entirely funded by the institutions they oversee. As a \n     result, federal agencies dithered for years in implementing \n     regulations to stop unfair and deceptive mortgage and credit \n     card lending practices, finally producing only after the \n     current foreclosure and consumer debt crisis took hold. \n     Regulators have left other types of dangerous products \n     completely untouched, such as high-cost ``overdraft'' loans \n     that are triggered without consumer permission. The FPSC \n     would be required to make consumer protection its top \n     priority, which will also better ensure the soundness of \n     financial institutions.\n       A FPSC would stop regulatory agencies from competing among \n     themselves to lower standards. Right now, financial \n     institutions freely switch charters between federal and state \n     regulation, and between various federal charters, in order \n     to reduce the level of oversight and the costs associated \n     with it. Under a FPSC, regulated institutions could not \n     choose the agency that regulates them. The FPSC would be \n     empowered to establish federal minimum standards for all \n     credit products and the institutions that offer them, so \n     that competition between state and federal regulators \n     would only exist to improve the quality of consumer \n     protection.\n       Unless the structure of financial services regulation is \n     realigned to change not just the focus of regulation but its \n     underlying philosophy, it is unlikely that consumers will be \n     adequately protected from unfair or dangerous credit products \n     in the future. The ultimate result of this crucial \n     legislation would be an agency designed to protect consumers \n     from the corrosive effects of unsafe credit, which has a \n     regulatory perspective that is truly independent of the \n     institutions it regulates. Just as importantly, this agency \n     would not be under constant pressure to keep protection \n     standards low. You have created a template for regulatory \n     modernization that will protect consumers, financial \n     institutions and the economy for years to come.\n       We applaud your leadership on this issue and look forward \n     to working with you to enact this proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n       Gregory L.

Res. 72\n\n       Whereas Mexico is 3 times the size of the State of Texas \n     and has a population of approximately 110,000,000 people;\n       Whereas Mexico has the 12th largest economy in the world, \n     with an annual gross domestic product of just under \n     $1,000,000,000,000;\n       Whereas Mexico is the 8th largest exporter of crude oil in \n     the world and provides approximately \\1/3\\ of the oil \n     imported by the United States;\n       Whereas Mexico is the 2nd largest buyer of exports from the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Mexico has the largest Spanish-speaking population \n     of any country in the world;\n       Whereas there is a tragically consistent demand for heroin, \n     marijuana, methamphetamines, and cocaine from drug users in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the Government of Mexico is locked in an extremely \n     violent struggle against drug trafficking organizations that \n     produce and transport narcotics;\n       Whereas the drug trafficking organizations in Mexico are \n     well organized, heavily armed, and wealthy criminal \n     enterprises, with estimated criminal earnings of more than \n     $25,000,000,000 every year;\n       Whereas it is estimated that Mexican drug trafficking \n     organizations produce 8 metric tons of heroin and 10,000 \n     metric tons of marijuana each year;\n       Whereas, in confrontations with the Government of Mexico \n     and with each other, the drug trafficking organizations have \n     adopted tactics intended to intimidate the public at large, \n     corrupt law enforcement officials, and create a perception of \n     increased violence among the people of Mexico;\n       Whereas, in 2008, approximately 6,200 people in Mexico died \n     as the result of violence related to drug trafficking, more \n     than twice as many as in 2007;\n       Whereas drug-related killings continued in Mexico during \n     2009, and on February 9, 2009, a total of 35 people were \n     killed in drug-related violence in Mexico;\n       Whereas drug trafficking organizations in Mexico have \n     brazenly targeted and executed many high-ranking public \n     officials in Mexico;\n       Whereas more than 800 police officers and soldiers in \n     Mexico have been killed in the line of duty since late 2006;\n       Whereas efforts by the Government of Mexico and the United \n     States Government to combat drug trafficking organizations \n     and power struggles between the drug trafficking \n     organizations themselves have resulted in growing violence \n     along the 2000-mile border between the United States and \n     Mexico;\n       Whereas drug-related violence affects cities and towns on \n     both sides of the border, as drug trafficking organizations \n     from Mexico form partnerships with criminal organizations \n     based in the United States;\n       Whereas law enforcement authorities in the United States \n     have reported an increase in the number of killings, \n     kidnappings, and home invasions linked to Mexican drug \n     trafficking organizations in a number of cities in the United \n     States, some of which are thousands of miles from the Mexican \n     border;\n       Whereas a 2008 report by the Department of Justice \n     indicated that Mexican drug trafficking organizations now \n     operate in 195 cities in the United States;\n       Whereas the 2008 National Drug Threat Assessment by the \n     Department of Justice identified drug organizations from \n     Mexico as the greatest criminal threat to the United States;\n       Whereas the Government of Mexico is strengthening the \n     institutions of a democratic state that adheres to the rule \n     of law, supports a free press, and is committed to human \n     rights;\n       Whereas the inauguration of President Felipe Calderon in \n     December 2006 represented another step forward in the process \n     of strengthening institutions in Mexico;\n       Whereas President Calderon has made defeating drug \n     trafficking organizations a top priority of his \n     administration, increasing the security budget of Mexico from \n     $2,000,000,000 in 2006 to $4,000,000,000 in 2008 and \n     deploying nearly 36,000 federal troops to carry out anti-drug \n     operations;\n       Whereas the Government of Mexico has undertaken reforms \n     that, together with significant changes to the code of \n     criminal procedure and the penal code, could transform the \n     justice system in Mexico to be more open and transparent, \n     protect human rights, and devote resources to investigating \n     and prosecuting crimes;\n       Whereas President Calderon has taken significant steps to \n     crack down on corruption within the police forces and other \n     government institutions of Mexico;\n       Whereas officers of the Government of Mexico have succeeded \n     in seizing record quantities of narcotics from drug \n     trafficking organizations;\n       Whereas law enforcement officials in Mexico are cooperating \n     with law enforcement agencies in the United States at \n     unprecedented levels, with Mexico extraditing 83\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\n     major drug traffickers to stand trial in the United States in \n     2007, and another 93 major drug traffickers in 2008;\n       Whereas the police and army units of Mexico are often \n     outgunned by members of the drug trafficking organizations, \n     who employ heavy machine guns, high-powered assault weapons \n     such as the AK-47, 0.50 caliber sniper rifles, military hand \n     grenades, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and \n     sophisticated technology like night vision goggles and \n     communication interception devices;\n       Whereas a large majority of the weapons and ammunition used \n     by the drug trafficking organizations come from sources in \n     the United States, particularly gun dealers and gun shows in \n     Texas, Arizona, and California;\n       Whereas approximately 90 percent of all firearms recovered \n     at crime scenes in Mexico are illicitly trafficked across the \n     border from the United States to Mexico;\n       Whereas the people of Mexico and the military and civilian \n     officials of the Government of Mexico have demonstrated \n     tremendous courage in confronting the drug trafficking \n     organizations;\n       Whereas the United States Government, along with law \n     enforcement agencies in the United States and Mexico, has \n     escalated its efforts to disrupt the trafficking of \n     narcotics, money, people, and arms across the border and to \n     combat drug trafficking organizations;\n       Whereas the United States Government can and should do more \n     to reduce the demand for illegal drugs in the United States \n     and stop the illegal exportation of money and weapons;\n       Whereas the efforts by the United States Government to \n     combat trafficking are outlined in the National Drug Control \n     Strategy (2008), the Southwest Border Counternarcotics \n     Strategy (2007), and the U.S. Strategy for Combating Criminal \n     Gangs from Central America and Mexico (2007);\n       Whereas, on October 22, 2007, the United States Government \n     and the Government of Mexico announced a multiyear security \n     agreement called the ``Merida Initiative'', which is intended \n     to combat drug trafficking and other criminal activity along \n     the border of the United States and Mexico and in Central \n     America; and\n       Whereas Congress has appropriated $465,000,000 for the \n     Merida Initiative, allocating to the Government of Mexico a \n     total of $400,000,000 in equipment, technical assistance, and \n     training in fiscal year 2008, which is now in the process of \n     being delivered: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Mexico is a key strategic partner of the United States;\n       (2) a secure, prosperous, and democratic Mexico is \n     indispensable to the goal of the United States to have \n     prosperity and peace throughout the Americas and the world;\n       (3) the people and the Government of Mexico have launched a \n     sustained attack on drug trafficking organizations based in \n     Mexico;\n       (4) the increasing violence and criminality of drug \n     trafficking organizations threaten the well-being of the \n     people of the United States and Mexico and pose security \n     challenges to cities and towns in the United States;\n       (5) drug-related violence is a ``cross-border'' problem \n     that requires close cooperation between the Government of \n     Mexico and the United States Government;\n       (6) the United States Government and the Government of \n     Mexico have a shared interest and responsibility in defeating \n     drug trafficking organizations, and a comprehensive strategy, \n     jointly conceived and executed, is required for significant \n     progress to be made;\n       (7) the Senate applauds and fully supports efforts by \n     President Felipe Calderon, the people of Mexico, and the \n     Government of Mexico to confront the drug trafficking \n     organizations, apprehend their members, and bring them to \n     justice;\n       (8) the Department of State should--\n       (A) ensure prompt delivery of the equipment, technical \n     assistance, and training for which Congress appropriated \n     funds in fiscal year 2008 as part of the Merida Initiative;\n       (B) continue to support the Government of Mexico in its \n     efforts to strengthen institutions and the rule of law, root \n     out corruption, and protect human rights; and\n       (C) ensure full accountability for all assistance and \n     equipment provided by the United States Government to the \n     Government of Mexico; and\n       (9) the United States Government should employ its broad \n     diplomatic and law enforcement resources, in partnership with \n     the Government of Mexico and governments throughout the \n     Americas, to defeat drug-related criminal enterprises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url":
