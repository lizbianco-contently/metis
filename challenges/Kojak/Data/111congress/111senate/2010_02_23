Madam President, as we meet here in Washington this \nweek, unemployment continues to hover around 10 percent. Tens of \nmillions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. The national \ndebt is at a staggering all-time high. In response to all this, the \nadministration wants lawmakers to go down to the White House to talk \nabout a health care bill Americans have already rejected resoundingly. \nThe American people thought the debate on this approach to reform was \nover. They issued their verdict on the substance of the Democratic \nbills and the process that was used to force them on the public. Yet \nhere we are, once again, being told by the White House we have to \nconsider the same health care bills that caused such a backlash across \nthe country in December. Democrats either aren't listening to the \nAmerican people or they are going down the same road they have gone \ndown again and again over the past year: put a bill together behind \nclosed doors and then try to force it through Congress along a party-\nline vote and ultimately onto a public that doesn't want it.\n  Americans don't want to be told what is best for them. They call the \nshots. What they are telling lawmakers in Washington to do on health \ncare is to stop and start over. They want us to put the old bills on \nthe shelf, pull out\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\na clean sheet of paper, bring all the parties together, and start over.\n  They are telling us they want a new bill. It is no wonder, since the \nbills we have seen would slash Medicare, increase taxes, and lead to \nhigher insurance premiums. You could call this kind of approach many \nthings, but you can't call it reform. Americans want real reform. That \nis what I had hoped Thursday's meeting at the White House would \npresent, an opportunity for us to share the best ideas and work \ntogether on commonsense solutions. I am disappointed the White House \nseems to view it instead as an opportunity to simply restart where we \nleft off in December. Americans don't know how else to say it. They are \nnot interested in reform that starts with either of these two bills. \nThe American people have been quite clear about that. They are not \ninterested in reform that starts with either of these two bills.\n  If you think they are mad about the process they have seen so far, \nwait until Democrats in Washington completely ignore them and try to \njam these bills through one more time. People aren't interested in so-\ncalled reform that raises costs instead of lowering them. They are not \ninterested in massive cuts to Medicare. They are not interested in new \ntaxes at a time when we are already struggling. They are not interested \nin a government-run health care system that will inevitably lead to \ndelays and to rationing. They want step-by-step reforms that address \nthe core of our problem, which is cost, not grand government schemes \nthat only expand existing problems, increase our debt, and extend the \nreach of government further and further into our lives.\n  Reform is necessary. Unfortunately, it seems Washington Democrats are \nso wedded to their own flawed vision of reform that they would rather \nhave nothing at all done about health care than to implement the kinds \nof changes Americans want.\n  When it comes to solving problems, Americans want us to listen first \nand then, if necessary, offer targeted, step-by-step solutions. Above \nall, they are tired of a process that shuts them out. They are tired of \ngiant bills negotiated in secret, then jammed through on a party-line \nvote in the middle of the night. It should be clear by now, Americans \nare tired of grand schemes imposed from above. They have been telling \nus exactly that for an entire year. Incredibly, our friends on the \nother side still don't seem to get it. But Americans see what is going \non, and that is why they will reject this bill one more time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/23/senate-section/article/S678-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I rise to address the jobs issue and the bill before the \nSenate. Part of it is to show to my fellow Senators and the American \npeople that the Democratic leadership has a different view on this bill \nbefore us that is a partisan bill, particularly in regard to the \nabsence of tax extenders being in that bill, compared to what they have \nover several of the recent years, which was very supportive of these \ntax provisions that are left out of this bill. I will explain it this \nway.\n  Although the Senate Democratic leader was highly involved in the \ndevelopment of the bipartisan bill, he arbitrarily decided to replace \nit with a bill now being jammed through the Senate. From the start, \nthis was something Senator Baucus and I were working on with both \nleaders of the Senate. Somehow, that didn't seem to work in the end, as \nwe thought it was working very well as we were moving along. As much as \nI was surprised by the Democratic leader's disregard for \nbipartisanship, I am even more surprised by the explanation given by \nhim and his people who speak for him.\n  Perhaps the most significant change between the bipartisan package \nChairman Baucus and I helped put together and the package we voted to \nmove to is the package of expired tax provisions has been removed. \nThese expired tax provisions are the ones I referred to as tax \nextenders. These generally very popular and certainly bipartisan tax \nextender provisions have, in fact, been extended several times over the \npast few years. What is surprising is that hyperpartisan members of the \nmajority have suddenly somehow decided tax extenders are what they \nrefer to as ``partisan pork for Republicans.'' A representative sample \ncomes from one report which describes the bipartisan bill as ``an \nextension of soon-to-expire tax breaks that are highly beneficial to \nmajor corporations, known as tax extenders, as well as other corporate \ngiveaways that have been designed to win GOP support.'' Like this is \nsomething that only Republicans have ever been for or it is just for \nmajor corporations.\n  There is another quote in the Washington Post which includes this \nattribution to the Senate Democratic leadership:\n\n       ``We're pretty close,'' [the majority leader] said Friday \n     during a television appearance in Nevada, adding that he \n     thought ``fat cats'' would have benefitted too much from the \n     larger Baucus-Grassley bill.\n\n  Understand, Senator Baucus is a Democrat, I am a Republican. The \nportrait being painted, then, by certain members of the majority, \nechoed without critical examination by people in our press, is wildly \ninaccurate. For one thing, the tax extenders include provisions such as \nthe deduction for qualified tuition for college and related expenses \nand also the deduction for certain expenses for elementary and \nsecondary schoolteachers. That ended December 31. It is going to mean \ntax increases for these families if we don't reinstitute it. If you are \ngoing to college or if you are a grade school teacher, the Senate \nDemocratic leadership thinks you are a fat cat, so you are on your own. \nIf your house was destroyed in a recent natural disaster and you still \nneed any of the temporary disaster relief provisions contained in this \nextenders package, too bad, because helping you would amount to \ncorporate giveaways in the eyes of some around here.\n\n  The bipartisan package that was shelved included an extension of \nunemployment insurance and also a COBRA health insurance extension. Do \nthese provisions benefit corporate fat cats? The answer is obviously \nno. Therefore, the common, ordinary person, Main Street America, \nsmalltown America or big city America, the working people of this \ncountry, that is who will benefit from those provisions that are left \nout of this bill.\n  The tax extenders have also been routinely passed and repeatedly \npassed because, in fact, they are and have been bipartisan and have \nbeen very popular and have been very beneficial to the economy. \nDemocrats have consistently voted in favor of extending these tax \nprovisions. Let me as an example refer to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, \nwho released a very strong statement upon the House package of tax \nextenders in December 2009. Just 6 weeks ago, the other body passed \nthese tax extenders. This is what the leader of the Democratic Party in \nthe House had to say in December 2009, not very long ago: that it is \n``good for business, good for homeowners, and good for our \ncommunities.''\n  In 2006, the then-Democratic leader released a blistering statement:\n\n       After Bush Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of \n     critical tax extenders [because] American families and \n     businesses are paying the price because this Do Nothing \n     Republican Congress refuses to extend important tax breaks.\n\n  Recent bipartisan votes in the Senate on extending expiring tax \nprovisions have come in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n2008, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which passed the \nSenate by unanimous vote, and the Working Families Tax Relief Act of \n2004, which was originally passed in the Senate by a simple voice vote,\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\nalthough the conference report received 92 votes in favor and a \nwhopping 3 against. That doesn't sound, to me, like these tax extenders \nare just for GOP corporate fat cats.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, \nextension of several of these provisions goes back even further, \nincluding the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999, which passed the Senate \nby unanimous consent and lost just one Senator voting against it coming \nout of conference.\n  Why have Democrats in the last few weeks or maybe in just the last \nfew days turned against the extenders, particularly considering it \npassed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives with Democratic \nsupport? The only explanation to this behavior is that certain Senators \nhave decided it serves deeply partisan goals to slander what have been, \nfor several years, very bipartisan and very popular tax provisions \nbenefiting many different people.\n  Yesterday's Washington Post article, from which I quoted, includes a \nstatement from a Democratic leadership aide saying that:\n\n       No decisions have been made, but anyone expecting us \n     immediately to go back to a bill that includes tax extenders \n     will be sorely disappointed.\n\n  Having put their heads into the sand, this Chamber's leaders seem \nintent on keeping them there, based on that previous quote. The bill, \nas currently written, would allow employers of illegal workers to \nbenefit from the payroll tax holiday. For sure, we should correct that \nmistake with an amendment. But under this parliamentary setup, you can \nonly offer an amendment if not a single Senator objects to setting \naside the existing business and replacing it with a new idea. The \nleadership's posture on this bill now prohibits this correction of \ngiving illegal workers the benefit of a payroll tax holiday or the \nemployer that employs them. Either the Democratic leaders are playing \npartisan politics with tax extenders or they don't understand the worth \nof the provisions to the economy as a whole and, most importantly, job \nretention and job creation.\n  I wish to speak about a very specific industry where 23,000 jobs are \nat risk and, in some instances, people actually without a job since \nDecember 31 because the biodiesel tax credit has been allowed to expire \non December 31. That is one of the many tax extenders.\n\n  These workers are not GOP corporate fat cats, and in case anybody \nthinks biodiesel--because it is connected to agriculture--is related \njust to Iowans, let me make it very clear that these green jobs are in \n44 of the 50 States, with thousands of people unemployed.\n  There are 24 facilities in Texas, 15 in my State of Iowa, 6 in \nIllinois, 6 in Missouri, and 4 facilities in Washington State. Ohio has \n11 facilities, there are 5 facilities in Indiana, 3 each in Mississippi \nand South Carolina, 7 in Pennsylvania, and 4 in Arkansas. New Jersey \nhas 2 facilities, there is 1 facility in North Dakota. Only 6 States \nout of 50 do not have some biodiesel production layoffs because \nCongress did not act by December 31 of last year.\n  You know what. We just had to stay in session on Christmas Eve--\nbecause we had not met on Christmas Eve since 1895--to pass a health \ncare reform bill that does not take effect until 2014.\n  Think of that. Let people in the biodiesel industry be laid off \nbecause Congress cannot act because we had to work on a bill that does \nnot take effect until the year 2014.\n  So we need to turn away from talk about GOP corporate fat cats. We \nhave to start thinking about those teachers having income tax \nprovisions to be able to deduct expenses they have for their \nclassrooms. We ought to think about these biodiesel workers being laid \noff. We ought to be thinking about the people who are harmed by the \nfloods and have an extension of the temporary tax relief for them and \nquit bad-mouthing popular bipartisan proposals that we need to pass and \nshould have passed yet last year, as the House of Representatives did. \nSo we need to get back to work on a bipartisan package that was in the \nworks until the Democratic leadership dramatically changed directions \nand went partisan.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise for two purposes this morning. The \nfirst is to speak about a native of Scranton, PA, who died serving our \ncountry in Afghanistan. LCpl Larry M. Johnson, just 19 years old, lost \nhis life in the service to his country in the last couple of days. He \nbecomes for Pennsylvania the 43rd soldier killed in action in \nAfghanistan, with an additional 191 Pennsylvanians who have been \nwounded at last count.\n  When we lose one of our brave young soldiers in Afghanistan or Iraq \nor anywhere around the world, we have a lot to say about their \nsacrifice and their service. I often, as we all do at one time or \nanother, quote Abraham Lincoln: ``These Americans gave the last full \nmeasure of devotion to their country.'' No one said it better than \nLincoln. He captured the essence of their service and the sense of loss \nwe all feel when someone who is serving their country is lost in \ncombat.\n  LCpl Larry Johnson's duties were the following: He was the combat \nengineer. His main responsibility was to combat and detect improvised \nexplosive devices, and we know them by the acronym IEDs. He lost his \nlife doing that work. Just 19 years old, he was a graduate of Scranton \nHigh School in 2008.\n  In instances such as this, probably the best testimony about the \nsoldier's life, their commitment to their country and the sacrifice \nthey made, probably the best testament of all of those subjects comes \nfrom members of their family. In this case, there was testimony in news \narticles over the last couple of days from friends and teachers, but, \nof course, most poignantly and most movingly from Larry Johnson's \nfamily. Yesterday in the Scranton Time-Tribune there was an article \namong several over the course of a couple of days, but this article in \nparticular focused on Larry Johnson's family. I unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record two stories, one entitled ``Teacher Recalls \nScranton Marine's `Really Good Heart.' '' That is the name of the first \nstory. That is February 21. The second story I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record is entitled ``Knock at the Door Brought \nTragedy Home for Marine's Kin.'' That is from Borys Krawczeniuk, \nFebruary 22.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From citizensvoice.com, Feb. 22, 2010]\n\n        For Marine's Family, Knock at Door Brought Tragedy Home\n\n                         (By Borys Krawczeniuk)\n\n       Johanna Johnson thought she would die first, not any of her \n     four kids.\n       ``You're not supposed to bury your son. Your son is \n     supposed to bury you,'' Johnson, 43, said Sunday. ``It isn't \n     supposed to be this way.''\n       She worried about Larry, her third child, the Marine in \n     Afghanistan, the one who loved the outdoors and a good time \n     and loved his mom so much that he always promised he would \n     someday make sure she no longer had to work. He would buy her \n     a double-block home in California, and she would live on one \n     side and live off the rent from the other half.\n       ``I'm 43 and he's acting like I'm 70,'' Johnson said.\n       She worried about him the way a mom worries about a son \n     fighting a war a world away, but this was not supposed to \n     happen.\n       Two serious-looking Marines are not supposed to come to the \n     door of a tiny, third-floor apartment on Moosic Street in \n     Scranton to report that your son gave his life in service to \n     his country.\n       Last Thursday, they did.\n       The official Marine version says Lance Cpl. Larry M. \n     Johnson, 19, of Scranton, died that day ``as a result of a \n     hostile incident while conducting combat operations in \n     Helmand province, Afghanistan.''\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\n       Family members say a Marine who transported his body to the \n     U.S. told them Cpl. Johnson, trained as a combat engineer \n     whose job was to seek and destroy improvised explosive \n     devices, was the victim of one himself. He was part of the \n     renewed thrust into Helmand, the United States' biggest push \n     in Afghanistan since 2001. The goal is to chase away the \n     Taliban.\n       His funeral will be Thursday or Friday, family members \n     said.\n       Johanna Johnson was not home when the Marines arrived with \n     the bad news.\n       She was at work, second day on the job on the assembly line \n     packaging helmet shields at Gentex Corp. in Simpson where \n     they make the helmets American troops wear in places like \n     Afghanistan.\n       Ashley, 21, Larry Johnson's older sister, heard the knock \n     on the door from the bathroom.\n       It was a hard knock, she remembered.\n       ``Is your mom home one Marine asked.\n       ``I went to turn away and I was like, `Wait, did something \n     happen to my brother?' '' Ashley Johnson asked.\n       They never actually said Larry Michael Johnson was dead.\n       ``I just knew,'' Ashley said. ``I saw the look in their \n     face that he was dead. I didn't even have to ask the \n     question.''\n       She broke down. She chokes up re-telling the story.\n       Her brother, a 2008 Scranton High School graduate, always \n     smiled. He loved to laugh and was good at breaking the \n     silence when a conversation paused with a joke.\n       He was no more than 5 feet 7 inches tall, and suggesting \n     Larry Johnson would be a Marine might bring a chuckle. He \n     enlisted in October 2008 only two weeks after surprising his \n     mother with his decision.\n       His father, an Army veteran also named Larry Johnson, would \n     do his best to get his son to bulk up by lifting weights, but \n     pictures show a skinny kid. In a senior prom picture, he has \n     a barely visible pencil-thin mustache.\n       His sister Ashley always wanted to take care of him.\n       He wanted to care for animals. As a 10-year-old, he dreamed \n     of being a veterinarian. He owned an unnamed python and could \n     draw highly detailed pictures of animals. Outdoors, he snow-\n     boarded, skied, water-skied, camped, rode all-terrain \n     vehicles and liked to party, family members said. Though he \n     was underage, he liked a beer or two now and then.\n       ``The transformation that these Marines did to Larry was \n     something,'' said Jeff Whitney, Johanna Johnson's boyfriend, \n     whom Cpl. Johnson viewed as a stepfather. ``Not that he was a \n     bad kid, don't get me wrong. But he was headed in the wrong \n     direction, hanging around with knuckleheads. He was headed \n     straight to jail. I kept on him every time. I kept on his \n     butt.''\n       The Marines did the rest. His Marine pictures show a boy \n     turning into a man, with wider biceps and a more rugged look.\n       He gained respect for others, family members said, always \n     answering, ``Yes, sir'' or ``No, sir.'' After being deployed \n     to Afghanistan in October, he talked about how he would no \n     longer take life for granted.\n       At Christmas, he sent his mother a deep fryer and a crock \n     pot he bought online from Wal Mart.\n       On patrol, he would sometimes call her via a satellite \n     phone, sometimes when he should not have.\n       ``He'd be out on a mission and he would call me,'' Johanna \n     Johnson said. ``He always worried about his mother.''\n       The last three weeks, well before he died, he did not call. \n     It is now apparent to family members that he could not \n     because the mission was being planned, and secrecy was \n     essential.\n       ``I was stressing over my phone not ringing,'' Johanna \n     Johnson said. ``I kept saying `Why isn't he calling me? I \n     wish he would call me.'

Nissley)\n\n       Jennifer Brotherton remembers former student Larry M. \n     Johnson as a good-natured kid who almost always had a smile \n     on his face.\n       When the Scranton High School teacher heard Friday the 19-\n     year-old 2008 graduate was killed while serving with the \n     Marines in Afghanistan, she was shocked.\n       ``He had a really good heart and he was so full of \n     energy,'' said Ms. Brotherton, who was Lance Cpl. Johnson's \n     English teacher in 2006-2007.\n       ``Any time a child dies, it's too soon,'' she added.\n       Lance Cpl. Johnson was a combat engineer assigned to 2nd \n     Combat Engineer Battalion, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade. \n     He joined the Marines after graduating from Scranton High \n     School and was promoted to lance corporal on Dec. 1.\n       Information released Saturday by military officials \n     indicates that Lance Cpl. Johnson died Thursday ``as a result \n     of a hostile incident while conducting combat operations'' in \n     Helmand Province, Afghanistan. His remains arrived in Dover, \n     Del., on Saturday.\n       Efforts to contact family members were unsuccessful.\n       Scranton School District officials plan to reach out to the \n     family in the coming days ``to see what they might need,'' \n     said Gregg Sunday, the district's business manager.\n       ``I can't imagine what the family is going through right \n     now,'' Mr. Sunday said. ``It's a tragedy.''\n       Lance Cpl. Johnson was deployed to Afghanistan in October. \n     His awards include the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, National \n     Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal \n     and NATO International Security Assistance Force Medal.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. The one that focused on his family begins with this line, \nspeaking of Larry Johnson's family:\n\n       Johanna Johnson thought she would die first, not any of her \n     four kids.\n\n  This is what Larry's mom is quoted as saying in the second line of \nthe story:\n\n       You're not supposed to bury your son. Your son is supposed \n     to bury you. It isn't supposed to be this way.\n\n  The story went on to talk about what Larry's hopes and dreams were, \nnot only for himself but for his own mother. The story says that Larry \nJohnson ``loved his mom so much that he always promised he would some \nday make sure she no longer had to work. He would buy her a double-\nblock home in California, and she would live on one side and live off \nthe rent from the other half.'' That was a soldier's dream for his \nmother--just 19 years old and not only thinking about the rest of his \nlife, not only volunteering to serve his country in the Marine Corps \nand going to Afghanistan, but to have a dream--a dream for his mother's \nfuture that he hoped to bring to fruition.\n  Larry Johnson's sister Ashley is 21 years old, just 2 years older \nthan Larry. She talked about the knock at the door that no family, no \nmother or father, no brother or sister--no loved one--ever wants to be \npresent for. But Ashley heard the knock at the door. It was a hard \nknock at the door, she remembered. The one marine who was at the door \nasked, ``Is your mom home?''\n  This is what Ashley said after that. She went to turn away, and she \nasked herself: Wait, did something happen to my brother? He never \nactually said--the marine at the door--that Larry Michael Johnson was \ndead, but Ashley said the following:\n\n       I just knew. I saw the look on their face that he was dead. \n     I didn't even have to ask the question.\n\n  The story goes on to talk about Larry's father, by the same name--\nLarry--who was an Army veteran who served his country as well. It is \ntalking about how his father prepared him to go into the Marine Corps \nonce Larry made the decision to become a marine.\n  Then the story ends with a couple of references to, again, Larry's \nmom--the one he had a dream for, the one he wanted to build a house in \nCalifornia for someday in the future. The story says:\n\n       At Christmas, he sent his mother a deep fryer and a crock \n     pot that he bought online from WalMart.\n\n  He wanted to send that to her.\n  It says:\n\n       On patrol, he would sometimes call [his mother] via a \n     satellite phone, sometimes when he should not have.\n\n  But, again, he loved his mother.\n  Johanna Johnson is quoted toward the end of the story:\n\n       He'd be out on a mission and he would call me. He always \n     worried about his mother.\n\n  There is really not a lot more I could say about his life and his \nsacrifice than what was contained in this story about what it means to \nserve, what it means to give, as I said before, in Lincoln's words, \n``the last full measure of devotion to your country.'' But we know that \nwhen these lives are lost, it is not just about service, it is not just \nabout combat and the military or the Marine Corps. All of that is \nrelevant and critically important, but in the end these stories are \nabout families, about mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters.\n  For those who have loved and lost, we do our best to try to \nunderstand, but we can never fully understand what Johanna Johnson and \nher family are living through these last few days and will live with \nthe rest of their lives. They will be able to manage that loss. They \nwill be able to move on. But they will never be fully recovered from \nthat kind of a loss.\n  We are thinking of Larry Johnson and his family today. We are praying \nfor them. We want him and his family to know, in our own small way, how \nmuch we appreciate his sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about what I believe should \nbe our top priority, almost our exclusive focus in terms of immediate \nwork, and that is the issue of jobs and the economy. Doing so, I \napplaud the fact that finally as a body we are somewhat focused on \nthat. We are debating a bill having to do with job creation, economic \ngrowth. But at the same time, I find it unfortunate, really sad, that \nas we take up that top agenda item for the American people we do so by \ntaking up a bill of the majority leader, which is fine, but in a way \nunder which he completely shuts out any opportunity for amendment on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Again, I find that process really unfair and unfortunate. The fact \nthat every Republican idea, every Republican amendment is just being \nshut out is really frustrating, even angering to me as a Republican. \nBut the issue isn't Republican and Democrat. The issue is what is good \nand right for the American people. The fact is that ideas and \namendments on the Senate floor, which is supposed to be a place of \nunlimited debate, virtually unlimited ability to offer good ideas, to \noffer amendments, that is being completely subverted, and all \namendments are being shut out.\n  Because of that, I am going to ask unanimous consent that we break \nout of that logjam, that we break out of that bitter partisanship and \nconsider, with an open mind, one amendment I am bringing forward. But \nlet me spend a few minutes outlining that amendment.\n  As we look on the job picture and the economy over the last year, as \nI talk about that job picture over the last year with folks in my \nState, I hear two dominant concerns. No. 1, we are still in a heck of a \nrecession. The job creation that was promised a year ago with the \nstimulus just hasn't panned out. The promise of staying below 8 percent \nunemployment, minimizing that job loss, clearly, tragically, \nunfortunately never panned out. The President promised his stimulus \nwould keep us below 8 percent. Unfortunately, as we all know, \nunemployment nationally went above 10 percent. Right now it still \nhovers near 10 percent, just a shade below that. And, again, \nunfortunately, the Federal Reserve has issued a report recently warning \nthat sort of high level of unemployment would be with us for several \nyears to come.\n  What I hear from Louisianans all around the State--and I would \ncertainly trust what Members from every State of the Union hear in \ntheir home States--is that we need a better model to create jobs, to \njump-start this economy, to get us out of this serious recession.\n  The other big theme and concern I hear all around Louisiana is: What \nare you all doing about this unsustainable level of spending and debt? \nI share that fear. I share that concern. Even as we struggle to get out \nof this recession--and we are not near there yet--I am fearful that the \nnext economic crisis is coming based on spending and debt, \nunsustainable levels of spending and debt. We are near debt levels \ntoday comparable to where this Nation was at the end of World War II \ncompared to GDP.\n  I don't like the idea of going into heavy debt for anything, but if \nwe are going to do it as a nation, surely the reason we had with World \nWar II, the need to build a modern Army overnight, unlike any military \nwe had ever had before that, to defeat Hitler, to preserve freedom and \ndemocracy, literally our way of life, surely that reason is a pretty \ndarn good one. That is why we as a nation went into debt, got up to 120 \npercent of GDP at the end of World War II.\n  The ``greatest generation'' that did that, that sacrificed and fought \nand won that war, turned around after the war and wiped away that debt, \nsent it down with great prosperity and fiscal restraint in the 1950s. \nBut today we are nearing those same historic high levels of debt, with \nour overall debt now at about 100 percent of GDP, but, obviously, \nwithout the historical circumstances such as we had in World War II.\n  The other thing we don't have is that plan to get rid of it, that \ndetermination to reverse course and get our fiscal house in order \nbecause we don't have that plan either. In fact, we are in a huge \nfiscal debt hole, and we have not even stopped digging. In fact, the \nonly thing this administration and this liberal Congress have done in \nthe last year is to put down the shovel digging and used a backhoe \ninstead, specifically to pass a budget that takes that historically \nhigh level of debt and doubles it in 5 years and triples it in 10 \nyears.\n  In the face of those two enormous challenges, we need to create jobs \nmuch more effectively than we have in the last year, and we need to get \nspending and debt under control.\n  I proposed last March legislation that I and my cosponsors called the \nno-cost stimulus act. The no-cost stimulus act is about just that, \ncreating great American jobs, stimulating the economy, helping us get \nout of this recession, using a fundamentally different model than the \nlast year, at no cost to the taxpayer, not continuing to drop hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars out of helicopters--a fundamentally different \napproach at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  In fact, it will produce new Federal revenue and lower our level of \ndeficit and debt.\n  How do we do that? We do it by focusing on our domestic energy \nsector, by opening access to domestic energy we have in great \nquantities in this country, by decreasing our reliance on foreign \nsources and creating great American jobs in the process. Again, we do \nthis by opening access to our tremendous energy reserves we have.\n  We are the only country on Earth that has major, significant energy \nresources but that puts 95 percent of them off limits under Federal law \nand says: No, no, no, no, you cannot touch that. You cannot touch 95 \npercent of our domestic energy resources.\n  We need to change that both to improve our energy situation and to \ncreate good American jobs because the answer on the energy front is not \neither/or. It is not either drill for traditional sources, such as oil \nand gas, or develop new technology, new research and development. The \nAmerican people know it is not either/or; it is all of the above, and \nwe need to do all of the above aggressively.\n  This bill fits right into that commonsense, all-of-the-above \nmentality of the American people. We open access to domestic energy \nreserves. We produce\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\nmore energy here at home. In doing so, we grow great American jobs--2 \nmillion long-term, sustainable, well-paying jobs. In doing that, we \nincrease GDP by as much as $10 trillion over the next 30 years.\n  But we accomplish even more. We lessen our dependence on foreign \nsources. We do not spend additional taxpayer dollars and go deeper into \ndebt. By creating these jobs and domestic energy, we actually increase \nFederal revenue. Because what happens when we open our energy resources \nfor production? That production comes online, royalty goes to the \nFederal Government--new Federal revenue--and we decrease deficit and \ndebt. It truly is a win-win-win.\n  Part of that is also focusing on the nuclear side, developing what \nmany folks, including the President, have talked about but which we \nhave not accomplished yet: a true nuclear renaissance, a true \nstreamlining of nuclear programs so we can dramatically increase that \ncapacity, particularly producing electricity.\n  Finally, let me mention the other part of the win-win-win which is in \nthis legislation. We devote some significant portion of the new, \nadditional Federal revenue created to alternative energy research and \ndevelopment. So, again, it is not either/or; it is all of the above.\n  This proposal has significant support. I am very proud to say we now \nhave 18 Senators who are coauthors of the proposal. There is a \ncompanion bill in the House with 50 coauthors there. So it is a \nsignificant proposal with significant support. It represents a win-win-\nwin for the American people and the American economy in this time of \nserious recession.\n  So why shouldn't this be actively considered and debated and voted \non, on the floor of the Senate? We are supposed to be considering a \njobs bill. That is progress. At least, finally, we are focused on jobs. \nBut why is every alternative, every amendment being shut out by the \nmajority leader, including this valid alternative?\n  So in that vein, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to offer amendment No. 3318, which is filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, again, I came to the Senate hearing this was the \nbody of full and open debate, full and open consideration of \namendments. The problem is my experience here in 5 years has been \nanything but that, including yet again this week on this legislation, \nas we are trying to address the top issue of the American people: jobs \nand the economy.\n  Why can't we have a full debate? Why can't we have open consideration \nof amendments, including this alternative model to continuing to spend \ntaxpayer dollars, increasing deficit and debt at an alarming rate. \nAgain, I find it unfortunate that is the partisan procedural position \nwe are in. But I will continue with my Senate coauthors, with the 50 \nHouse coauthors of this no-cost stimulus proposal to advance this idea \nas part of a reasonable solution to grow good jobs without having to \nspend another trillion dollars of hard-earned taxpayer dollars and \nincreased deficit and debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I come down to the floor and I hear \nthe Senator from Louisiana saying he has been in the Senate for years \nand he cannot believe we cannot debate these things. I have watched \nover the last 13 months since President Obama took the oath of office--\n13 months and less than a week--and I am incredulous the Senator from \nLouisiana would say what he says; that we, in fact, do not allow debate \nin this institution, when more than 100 times, just in the last 13 \nmonths--I think maybe 110 times; I cannot keep count because we add a \nfew every day or every week--more than 100 times the other party, the \nRepublicans, have obstructed, have delayed, have stopped us from moving \nforward.\n  We have had plenty of time to debate. We will stay here weekends. We \nwill stay here evenings. But when it is not debate they want, it is to \nblock things--maybe talking things to death is the way they block \nthings; maybe they just object to things--but time and time again we \nhave had the ``slow walk'' on health care, so we have not been able to \nput a bill on the President's desk. That is not because people do not \nhave ideas. It is not because people want to shut down debate. It is \nbecause they have tried to stop these bills on issue after issue after \nissue.\n  I remember something so simple as the children's health insurance \nbill, which President Bush vetoed but many people in both parties \nsupported. They tried to slow that down. They tried to slow the Lilly \nLedbetter legislation which we passed to try to make sure women doing \nthe same job in the same place are paid as much as men doing the same \njob in the same place.\n  I could stand here, Mr. President, as you could, representing your \nconstituents in Santa Fe and Taos and all over New Mexico--you could do \nthe same as I can do, representing my constituents in Toledo and Dayton \nand Galion and Saint Clairsville--and point out that when we have tried \nto get things done, they have blocked it.\n  We do want bipartisanship. But the public, more than anything, wants \nus to get things done. The Senator from Louisiana has been one of the \nleaders, in conjunction with one of his other regional Senators, who \nhas said health care could be President Obama's Waterloo. There are \npeople in this institution on the other side of the aisle--not all of \nthem; the senior Senator from my State, George Voinovich, has \ncooperated a lot of times on a lot of things, unlike some of his \ncolleagues, but there are senior Senators on that side of the aisle, \nwhere their goal is to see the President of the United States fail. If \nthe President of the United States fails, this country does not move \nforward.\n  We are in the worst economic times of my lifetime, brought on by \nterrible policies in the last 8 years: bank deregulation, tax cuts for \nthe rich, a war not paid for, a giveaway to drug companies and the \ninsurance companies in the name of Medicare privatization, causing all \nthese problems that we inherited a year ago, and all they want to do is \nstop the jobs bill. They voted last night--the Senator who just \ncomplained about not being able to debate voted last night not to even \nallow the bill on the floor, as he did on health care, as he has done \non issue after issue after issue.\n  It is not personal to me what they are doing, but it is certainly \nwrong when they try to block issue after issue, bill after bill. We can \ndisagree on what we need to do to bring this country forward. We can \ndisagree on the jobs bill. We can disagree on the health care bill. But \nwe ought to be able to agree we can have full debate, move forward, \nwork on this legislation, and pass it in a reasonable time so every \nSenator does not talk it to death in the way of stopping it, in the way \nof obstructionism.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/23/senate-section/article/S682-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Metro Safety\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the current state \nof affairs in the Washington Metro and why we need to bring about \nchange. The Washington Metro, America's subway, is in trouble. I fear \nfor its safety. I fear for its operational reliance. I fear for the \nwell-being of both the passengers and the workers who ride Metro.\n  Every morning, I am afraid to wake up and find out that there has \nbeen another accident or death on the Washington Metro. Most recently, \na Metro\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\ntrain carrying 345 passengers derailed underground in the heart of \ndowntown. It was Friday when the Federal Government reopened after our \nbig No. 2 blizzard. The train somehow managed to get on the wrong track \nas it was leaving the station. Thank God a safety device actually \nworked and pushed the train off of the wrong track to prevent it from \ncrashing into another train. Thankfully, a near miss.\n  In June, there was a terrible crash of the Metro, cars upon cars upon \ncars. Since that time, 13 people have died on the Metro, and there have \nbeen countless injuries. That is why that terrible day after our No. 2 \nblizzard, many sat in the dark, scared to death. They were afraid of \nbeing crashed into, which had happened before. They were afraid of \nfire. They were afraid of smoke. They were afraid of being trapped and, \nmost of all, they were afraid that Congress would fail to act.\n  I wish to salute the Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and \nCommunity Development chaired by my good colleague Senator Bob \nMenendez, for taking a great interest in this and introducing \nlegislation that the administration sanctions to begin to get Metro on \nthe right track. We need to do this.\n  Last year, after the nine people were killed, I introduced \nlegislation to give the Transportation Secretary the authority to \nestablish Federal safety standards for Metro systems around the \ncountry. There had been none. It would require the Transportation \nSecretary to implement the National Transportation Safety Board's most \nwanted safety recommendations.\n  After accidents on subways, after accidents on our Metro, the NTSB \ncomes in and investigates. Gee, are we glad to see them. They are the \nCSI meets Metro. At the end, they not only tell us what went wrong, but \nwhat we have to do to get it right. Well, guess what. We don't listen \nto them. After every accident, there is press--we are going to make \nchanges--but nothing happens. So, for example, the issues they have \nrecommended relating to crashworthiness standards for cars, emergency \nentry and evacuation standards, data event recorders, often go \nunheeded. We have to make those changes, and we need to take another \nstep.\n  Today, I take another step by joining Senator Menendez, Senator Dodd, \nand Senator Cardin on the Public Transportation Safety Program Act. \nThis is an idea that we have worked on, along with the administration, \nto give the Transportation Secretary the authority to establish Federal \nsafety standards. It also strengthens State oversight programs that \ninspect and regulate the Metro systems. Because Washington Metro is in \ntwo States and in the District of Columbia--Maryland, Virginia, and \nDC--it has the Tri-State Oversight Committee. But you know what. The \nMetro board doesn't have to pay any attention. In fact, we had to raise \ncane and pound the table to allow them to work with the safety \ninspectors and actually walk the tracks to try to get some action. We \nhad to muscle our way in, just trying to get the Tri-State folks \ninvolved in safety.\n  Well, for me, right now, the spotlight is the Washington Metro. My \nobligation is here. There are other Metro systems around the country \nthat this bill will also deal with, but right now, myself and Senator \nCardin, John Warner--Mark Warner--John Warner in his time--Jim Webb, \nand Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton want to work together. We want \nto work with the Banking Committee to pass legislation that would bring \nabout change. We want to make sure that when we make recommendations, \nthe FTA--the Federal Transit Authority--has the authority to implement \nthe changes and to make sure that Metros both here and around the \ncountry implement them.\n  We also want to require that the implementation of the NTSB's most \nwanted list is absolutely done so when we say let's have crashworthy \nstandards for our cars, it is actually implemented. Did you know we \nhave standards for everything that is involved in transportation but \nnot standards for the safety or the crashworthiness of these cars? \nThese two bills are important because there are no Federal safety \nstandards for Metro systems. Rail transit is the only transportation \nmode without safety standards oversight or enforcement. As I said, we \nhave safety standards for airplanes, commuter rail systems, even buses, \nbut Metro systems do not have standards, even though the rail transit \nhas 14 million daily riders. Up until now, safety has been left to the \nStates. Each State has its own safety enforcement practices, but in our \ncase of the Washington Metro, which travels in two States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, we need to make sure we have a system that is \nappropriately regulated.\n  The bill that was introduced by the Banking Committee and Senator \nMenendez yesterday, which I support, does two things. It gives the \nTransportation Secretary authority to establish safety standards for \nMetro, light rail, and bus systems nationwide. It provides a framework \nfor developing and enforcing those safety standards, and it will look \nat existing industry standards and best practices. It would also have \nto consider the NTSB's recommendations.\n  I think about those 13 people a lot. I think about the people who \nride the Metro. I think about the people who work on the Metro. So when \nwe talk about this legislation, we have to think of it not in terms of \nrail cars and money but in terms of people and in terms of safety.\n  That is why I introduced the National Metro Safety Act in July after \nthe accident, joined by my colleague Senator Cardin. It enables the \nTransportation Secretary to develop, implement, and enforce those \nnational safety standards, and it requires DOT to implement the NTSB, \nthe National Transportation Safety Board's, most wanted safety \nrecommendations. They have what they call their top 10. It would have \nstandards for the crashworthiness of cars. It would mandate evacuation \nstandards so that people could get out of these cars in the event of an \naccident. It would have the black box data recording device so we could \ntrace what happens on a car and have the lessons learned. It would also \ndeal with the hour of service regulations for train operators. It \nrequires that we do these actions.\n  So for these issues--the crashworthiness, the train cars, the \nemergency entry and evacuation, data--all of this has been recommended \nin the past by the NTSB. In 2002 they recommended data event recorders. \nNothing happened. They recommended emergency evacuation standards in \n2006. Nothing happened. They recommended hours of service to make sure \nour people were fresh and fit for duty. Nothing happened. We know what \nhappens: accidents in which people die, are maimed, burned, or injured.\n  It is time we listened to the experts who advise us. It is time that \nwe ensure the safety of the people who ride the Metro here. It is time \nthat we take action and be able to bring this under the Federal Transit \nAuthority. The people who count on us when they get on a subway should \nbe able to count on us to do all we can to ensure their safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to take on a cause which I \nknow is close to the hearts of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, which is to assert the privilege of pay-go. I have heard \ninnumerable arguments made on the other side of the aisle about the \nimportance of the pay-go mechanisms in this Congress: how pay-go will \nbe used to discipline our spending as a Congress and how pay-go is the \nway we get to financial and fiscal responsibility as a Congress. In \nfact, 2 weeks ago, I believe it was, the majority leader came to the \nfloor and offered a brandnew pay-go resolution as a matter of statute \nand said that this is one of the key pillars of the majority party and \nthe President in the area of how you discipline spending and bring our \nspending house in order. The President has mentioned pay-go on numerous \noccasions also.\n  Why all this talk about pay-go? Because I think people are beginning \nto realize--certainly our constituents--that the government is spending \ntoo much money; that we are running up too much debt; that we are \npassing bill after bill after bill in this Congress which we are not \npaying for. The cost of those bills is going to our children. We are \ngoing to double the Federal debt here in 2013. We are going to triple \nthe Federal debt in 2019 under the President's budget and the budget\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\npassed by the Democratic leadership in this Congress. The Federal debt \nincreases by $11 trillion over the next 9 years of this budget that is \nbeing proposed by the President--$11 trillion. We get to a point where \nour Nation is basically spending so much and borrowing so much that our \nfinancial house is unsustainable.\n  Those are not my words. Those are the words actually of the Secretary \nof the Treasury and the head of OMB. They both said their own budget \nthat they sent up here was unsustainable in its present form because it \nspends so much more money than we have, and those bills get passed \nright on to our kids.\n  Well, in defense of their sending up a budget that spends all of this \nmoney we don't have and doubles the debt in 2013 and triples it in \n2019, they said they were going to assert pay-go rules which would \ndiscipline this Senate on the issue of spending. At the time they made \nthat assertion I said, Oh, come on, give us a break. Over the last 3 \nyears that this Congress has been under Democratic control, under \nliberal control, in over 20 instances, pay-go as it presently exists in \nthe law was waived, costing over $\\1/2\\ trillion in new spending. \nApproximately $\\1/2\\ trillion that should have been subject to pay-go \nrules was waived--simply waived--by the other side of the aisle: We are \nnot going to pay attention to pay-go rules, we are going to spend the \nmoney and add the debt to our children's backs.\n  I think the American people notice this and are certainly frustrated \nabout this, because they intuitively understand--it is called common \nsense--if you spend all of this money you don't have, the debt is going \nto come back to roost on our children's backs and it reduces their \nquality of life. Obviously, if you have a government that runs up \ndeficits which exceed the capacity of our ability to repay them, it is \nour children who end up paying the cost of that profligate spending. It \nis our children who end up with these bills. Their standard of living \nwill be reduced as a result of all of this new deficit and debt this \nCongress has passed and which this Congress has proposed.\n  So for political cover, they called up a couple of weeks ago this \npay-go resolution and said we are going to assert pay-go around here on \neverything that comes through this Congress. We are going to make sure \nthe financial house of this Congress is disciplined by the rule of pay-\ngo.\n  Well, that is why I want to help them, because here is a new bill on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  It violates pay-go. It violates their own rules. It violates this \ngreat sanctity that they claim was going to be the cause of fiscal \ndiscipline--the pay-go rule. Just a few weeks ago, we passed a pay-go \nresolution here. What did we get? Within 2 weeks, we have a bill that \nviolates the pay-go rules.\n  The pay-go rules, as we have them--and they are the law, the rule of \nthe Senate today--say that pay-go will apply for any legislation that \nincreases the deficit in the first 5-year period or in the first 10-\nyear period. This bill has been scored by CBO as violating that rule. \nIt increases the deficit by $12 billion, unpaid for, in the first 5-\nyear period. This bill is, therefore, subject to a pay-go point of \norder.\n  We are going to hear a specious argument from the other side of the \naisle that, well, in the year 2020 we account for all this and we get \nthe money back. Well, I don't believe that. I don't believe the check \nis in the mail either. The American people don't believe that. More \nimportantly, the rules of the Senate don't allow that. The rules of the \nSenate make it very clear that if it adds to the deficit in the first 5 \nyears, it is subject to a pay-go point of order. And this is not a \nsmall amount here; $12 billion is a lot of money. I know that under the \nway we function here, and we talk about trillions--and the President \nrolled out just yesterday a new $100 billion or $200 billion package of \nhealth care, added to a $2.4 trillion package of health care--I know \nthat billions become lost sometimes in that debate. But $1 billion is a \nlot of money, and this is $12 billion added to our children's backs in \nthe way of deficit and debt. Most Americans see that as a lot of money. \nYou could run the entire State government of New Hampshire for about 3 \nyears on that. Yet we are going to run up the deficit by $12 billion, \nin violation of our own rules.\n  There is something even more outrageous about this bill. It is pretty \noutrageous that we would have all the sanctimonious discussion from the \nother side of the aisle about how they are going to live by pay-go 2 \nweeks ago and then have the first bill they bring forth violate the \nrules of pay-go. That is pretty outrageous in and of itself. But this \nbill, in an act of gamesmanship that really deserves a special award--\nmaybe a gold medal at the Vancouver Olympics for gamesmanship in fiscal \npolicy and how you basically pass on to your children a major new debt \nwithout telling them it is coming--certainly this bill would deserve a \ngold medal in that category.\n  On top of the pay-go violation, this bill creates $140 billion of \ndeficit and debt. Now, even on the other side of the aisle, that has to \nbe considered a lot of money. Maybe they don't consider $12 billion a \nlot of money, but $140 billion has to be big money. So $140 billion of \ndeficit and debt is built into this bill even though the bill, on its \nface, states that it only spends $12 billion or $15 billion, something \nlike that. How do they do that? How could that possibly be? Because \nwhat they have done here--and as I said, this deserves a gold medal for \nmanipulating the financial house of the Senate and the Congress in a \nway that is avoiding actual accountability for the debt you are adding \nonto our children's shoulders--is they have put into the baseline the \nhighway money. So the billions in highway money for this year in this \nbill, multiplied out over 10 years, comes to $140 billion, and then \nthey have claimed that is all offset, all that money is offset. How do \nthey claim it is offset? Well, it is tactical, but follow this because \nit is the ultimate game in double bookkeeping--something Al Capone \nmight have done were he running the books of the Senate. There is a \nhighway trust fund that doesn't have enough money to pay for the roads \nthey want to build--the highway committee in this Congress, the EPW \nCommittee. They want to build more roads than the trust fund has money \ncoming in for, so they take money from the general fund and transfer it \nto the highway trust fund.\n  They allege that 10 years ago or so, the highway trust fund lent \nmoney to the general fund and no interest was paid on that money lent \nto the general fund. First off, at the time they passed the law that \nsaid no interest was to be paid on it--but it would be ridiculous to \npay interest between the two funds anyway--even if you accepted that \nargument, you couldn't get to the numbers they are talking about. What \nthey have done is claimed that any money that comes out of the general \nfund to fund the highway fund is an offset. That is an interesting \nconcept. Therefore, it doesn't get scored against the deficit by the \nhighway fund.\n  Where do we get the money we took from the general fund to fund the \nhighway fund? The answer is pretty simple: We borrow it from China, \nfrom Saudi Arabia, from Americans, and our kids get a bill called a \npiece of debt that they have to pay off. This double-entry bookkeeping, \nin the tradition of Al Capone basically, when simplified, means that it \nadds $140 billion of new deficit and debt to the general fund, which \nhas to be paid by our kids--not offset, unpaid for, simply money spent.\n  Do you know something. We are spending a lot of money around here \nthat we don't have, and it is not right. I think the American people \nwould like us to stop that. If we are going to spend this money on \nroads, then let's pay for it. Don't hide the fact that you are not \npaying for this with some gamesmanship called offsetting highway fund \nwith general fund money. I think that is a pretty cynical act. If you \ndon't have the courage to stand before this Congress and say publicly \nthat we want to spend $140 billion and don't want to pay for it, then \nyou are not fulfilling your responsibility to your constituents, \nbecause that is what you are doing. You have an obligation not to try \nto hide what you are doing in some sort of bookkeeping manipulation, \nwhich gets you a gold medal for bookkeeping manipulation but certainly \ndoesn't do anything for transparency and honesty in government, on top \nof having a pay-go violation--$12 billion as scored by CBO.\n  This point of order lies. There is $140 billion of new spending \nproposed in this bill, which isn't paid for. It is spending\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\nthat isn't paid for, and it is authorized and going to be spent. That \nis pretty inexcusable because it is claimed that it is paid for, which \nis the real hypocrisy of what we are seeing.\n  My colleagues on the other side may vote against this point of order. \nI cannot understand how they can do that, and I cannot understand how, \nwhen the majority leader comes down here--and I am sure he will or one \nof his representatives will--and says pay-go should not lie here \nbecause in 2020 we are going to pay for all this, that they can claim \nanything other than the fact that a pay-go point of order lies. I mean, \nit does lie.\n  What is a pay-go point of order? It is the CBO telling us that we \nhave violated our own rules, called pay-go, and we are spending money \nthat goes to the deficit--in this case, $12 billion.\n  So as a very practical matter this is a pretty black-and-white \nsituation: either you are for enforcing fiscal discipline here with a \npay-go point of order or you are not. I have to say, if this pay-go \npoint of order fails, then I think we ought to follow it up with a \nunanimous consent that says we are going to rid ourselves of pay-go as \nan enforcement mechanism because we are then saying it doesn't mean \nanything. Clearly, that would be the only conclusion you could reach.\n  A pay-go point of order makes it clear: There is $12 billion of \ndeficit spending in the first 5-year window, which violates the pay-go \nrules set up by this Senate and specifically proposed and promoted by \nthe Democratic majority as a way to give us fiscal discipline, and we \nare ignoring it, overruling it, and we are bypassing it with this piece \nof legislation if we do waive the pay-go rule.\n  At this point, I make a point of order that the pending amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, would increase the on-\nbudget deficit for the sum of years 2010 to 2014. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order against the amendment pursuant to section 201(a) of S. \nCon. Res. 21, Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I move that the point of order be waived.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my waiver of \nthe relevant point of order that was recently entered into include all \nrelevant points of order that were raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today on the occasion of Black \nHistory Month to recognize the accomplishments of three leading \nMarylanders in American medicine. Established by Howard University \nhistorian Carter G. Woodson in 1927 as Black History Week, this now \nmonth-long celebration is an opportunity to elevate awareness of Black \nAmericans' contributions to our Nation's history.\n  It is customary for American families to spend time in February \nlearning more about famous Black Americans who helped shape our Nation, \nincluding Marylanders Harriet Ross Tubman, the ``Moses of her people,'' \nwho ran the Underground Railroad, and Justice Thurgood Marshall, the \nfirst black Supreme Court Justice and the architect of the legal \nstrategy leading to the 1954 landmark Brown v. Board of Education \ndecision.\n  Today, I come to the Senate floor to highlight the contributions of \nthree Marylanders who are currently at the pinnacle of the medical \nprofession--Dr. Ben Carson, Dr. Eve Higginbotham, and Dr. Donald \nWilson.\n  I have spoken before on the crushing burden of health disparities on \nour health care system and the urgent need to eliminate them. It is an \nissue directly affecting one out of every three Americans: 37 million \nAfrican Americans, 45 million Latinos, 13 million Asians, 2.3 million \nNative Americans and Alaskan Natives, and 400,000 Hawaiians and Pacific \nIslanders in our Nation. While minorities represent one-third of our \nNation's population, they are fully one-half of the uninsured. So when \nwe enact legislation that expands access to millions of uninsured \nAmericans, it will make a difference in minority communities, in \nminority health overall, and in the health of our Nation.\n  But providing access to comprehensive health insurance addresses only \none of the factors contributing to health disparities. Research informs \nus that even after accounting for those who lack health insurance, \nminority racial and ethnic groups face inequities in access and \ntreatment; and they have adverse health care outcomes at higher rates \nthan whites. Even when insurance status, income, age, and severity of \nconditions are comparable, racial and ethnic minorities tend to receive \nlower quality health care. Therefore, coverage is not enough.\n\n  Despite many attempts over the years by health policymakers, \nproviders, researchers, and others, wide disparities still persist in \nmany facets of health care. When it comes to equitable care for \nminorities, low-income, geographic, cultural and language barriers, and \nracial bias are found to be common obstacles. These inequities carry a \nhigh cost in terms of life expectancy, quality of life, and efficiency, \nand they cost our Nation billions of dollars each year.\n  Researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the University of \nMaryland found that between 2003 and 2006, racial and ethnic \ndisparities cost the Nation more than $229 billion in excess direct \nmedical costs. Adding indirect costs reveals a staggering $1.24 \ntrillion from lost wages and premature and preventable deaths and \ndisabilities. By elevating the focus on health disparities, we can \nbring down these costs and improve the quality of care across the \nboard.\n  If we are to improve the health care status of Americans, we must \nfocus on and eliminate these disparities. One step is ensuring every \ncommunity has a sufficient supply of well-trained medical \nprofessionals, and this is where our Nation's academic medical centers \nplay an essential role. All three physicians--Drs. Carson, \nHigginbotham, and Wilson--shine as leaders in their medical profession \nand have devoted their careers to academic medicine.\n  First is Dr. Benjamin Carson, a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon \nwho works daily to save and improve the lives of children as director \nof pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. Dr. Carson's story is truly \ninspiring. He was born and raised in Detroit by a mother who encouraged \nBen and his brother to work hard and succeed in school. Dr. Carson \ngraduated high school with honors and was admitted to Yale University \nto study psychology. He attended the University of Michigan Medical \nSchool, specializing in neurosurgery. Dr. Carson completed neurosurgery \nresidency at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where at age 33 he became the \nyoungest physician ever to head a major division there. Dr. Carson has \nsurgically separated several pairs of conjoined twins and has pioneered \nnew, groundbreaking procedures to save children's lives.\n  Most notable among Dr. Carson's numerous accolades and honors is the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award, \nwhich he received in 2008. In addition to his surgical acumen, Dr. \nCarson is a dedicated community activist. He is president and cofounder \nof the Carson Scholars Fund which recognizes young people of all \nbackgrounds for exceptional academic and humanitarian accomplishments. \nHe is also president and cofounder of the Benevolent Endowment Network \nFund, an organization that works to cover the medical expenses of \npediatric neurosurgery patients with complex medical conditions.\n  Second, I wish to recognize Dr. Eve Higginbotham, an internationally \nrecognized physician who was recently appointed senior vice president \nand executive dean for health services at Howard University. Dr. \nHigginbotham is\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nthe first woman to chair a university-based ophthalmology department in \nthe United States, and she held this position at the University of \nMaryland School of Medicine in Baltimore from 1994 to 2006. Her next \nappointment was dean and senior vice president for academic affairs at \nMorehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n  Dr. Higginbotham is a frontline warrior in the fight to eliminate \nhealth disparities. As a member of the Friends of the Congressional \nGlaucoma Caucus Foundation, she developed a glaucoma screening training \nprogram that has been implemented in more than 40 medical schools \nnationwide. Through this program, medical students provide glaucoma \nscreening to elderly residents in underserved communities, making \npossible early detection and treatment for the leading cause of \nblindness among African Americans.\n  Dr. Higginbotham was recently inducted into the American Academy of \nArts and Sciences. She has served on the boards of the American Academy \nof Ophthalmology, Women in Ophthalmology, and the National Space \nBiomedical Research Institute. She is also a past president of the \nBaltimore City Medical Society and the Maryland Society of Eye \nPhysicians and Surgeons.\n  Finally, I wish to recognize Dr. Donald Wilson, who was Dr. \nHigginbotham's immediate predecessor at Howard University. Dr. Wilson \nserved as dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine from \n1991 to 2006. The University of Maryland's medical research funding \nincreased nearly fivefold, from $77 million to $341 million during Dr. \nWilson's leadership. His tenure at Maryland distinguished him as the \nNation's first African-American dean of a nonminority medical school. \nWhile at the University of Maryland, Dr. Wilson also served as the \ndirector of the Program in Minority Health and Health Disparities \nEducation and Research.\n  Dr. Wilson has also chaired Federal health committees at the NIH and \nthe FDA, as well as serving on the advisory council of HHS's Agency for \nHealth Care Policy and Research. He was chairman of both the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges and the Council of Deans of \nU.S. Medical Schools. And he was the first African American to hold \neach of these positions. He is a member of several medical and research \nsocieties, including the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy \nof Sciences and the Association of American Physicians. He is a master \nof the American College of Physicians, an honor bestowed on fewer than \n1 percent of its members. Dr. Wilson also cofounded the Association for \nAcademic Minority Physicians in 1986.\n  Numerous honors and awards have been bestowed upon Dr. Wilson, \nincluding the Baltimore Urban League's Whitney M. Young, Jr., \nHumanitarian Award. In 2003, he received the prestigious Frederick \nDouglass Award from the University System of Maryland Board of Regents. \nDr. Wilson is also the recipient of the Institutional Leadership \nDiversity Award from the Association of American Medical Colleges Group \non Student Affairs-Minority Affairs Section.\n  Drs. Carson, Higginbotham, and Wilson are three living reasons why we \ncelebrate Black History Month. Their contributions have made invaluable \ncontributions to American medicine, but they are just the tip of the \niceberg in terms of African Americans who have made a noteworthy impact \nupon our Nation.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the contributions of \nthese three noteworthy physicians as this body seeks to make health \ncare available to everyone, and join me in celebrating their \naccomplishments during Black History Month.\n  Mr. President, to clarify, my intention on my previous motion to \nwaive was to waive the Budget Act and budget resolutions with respect \nto the motion to concur with an amendment and that the yeas and nays \npreviously ordered be considered as ordered on the motion as modified. \nI ask unanimous consent for this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about two issues. \nFirst, the jobs bill and the provision that Senator Hatch and I worked \non that helped break the partisan logjam, and also the need for the \nSenate to take up and pass up to $25 billion in FMAP assistance to the \nStates. First, the jobs portion.\n  During our break, I traveled all around my State from Cheektowaga to \nOswego, from Syracuse to Poughkeepsie, from Long Island to New York \nCity. In each place, I talked with people who had lost their jobs. It \nwas heartbreaking. These are people who are looking desperately to find \nwork.\n  One of the sadder points of this recession is, of course, its depth. \nIt is deeper than all but one recession we have had since World War II. \nBut, second, it seems to affect people at all income levels. If you are \npoor, if you are middle class, even if you are upper middle class, you \ncan lose your job. Perhaps most painful of all, the amount of time that \npeople are out of work is much longer than previous recessions. In \nother words, in previous recessions, you would lose your job, it would \nbe horrible, but you would say to yourself: In 3 or 4 months, I can \nfind a new job quite easily. That has not happened.\n\n  In fact, I met people such as a woman in Rochester who worked for a \nmajor firm in human resources. She is about 50. She does not have a \nfamily, but her job was her life. She was told she had to leave a year \nand a half ago. She has been looking and looking. Her salary was in the \nlow six figures. She was a very talented person upon meeting her. No \nwork. No job.\n  I met somebody who came from a blue-collar background. The family had \nno education. He climbed his way to the top of the tool-and-die \nindustry. He was making a good living. He has six children and a wife \nwho stayed home because when you have six kids, it is not easy to work. \nHe was laid off about a year ago. Again, he has been looking and \nlooking, first with his high skills in his industry, and then he kept \nlooking lower and lower and lower on the pay scale, to no avail. No \njob. I could repeat this story over and over.\n  I can see why the people of Massachusetts voted the way they did. I \ndid not agree with it, but I understand it. In my judgment, what they \nwere saying was simple. If you look at the exit polls, about 50 percent \nof the people in Massachusetts supported the President's health care \nbill and an equal number against it. But, overwhelmingly, they were \nsaying to us, whether they were for the bill or against it, focus on \nissue No. 1, jobs--jobs, the economy, helping the middle class stretch \nthat paycheck so they can make ends meet.\n  That is why I think Senator Reid, our majority leader, was so wise to \nput together the bill he did, the HIRE Act. That is why he reached out \nto those across the aisle, as did I. That is why I am pleased this \nvital legislation--hardly a panacea; it is not going to cure all our \nproblems--looks as though it will move forward late this afternoon or \nthis evening.\n  I am very proud--we are all proud--that we have bipartisan support. I \nbelieve the vote later on will be even more bipartisan than the vote to \nmove forward on the bill yesterday. Bipartisan victories such as this \nhave been few and far between. But this could be the start of something \ngood. I hope the bipartisanship will not end with this afternoon's \nvote.\n  Unemployment, of course, is not simply a blue State problem or a red \nState problem; it is an everywhere problem. It will take more than one \nparty's solutions to solve it. So if there is only one issue that we \ncan find common ground on this year, let it be jobs.\n  We all know unemployment, which is hovering just below 10 percent, is \nunacceptably high. When you hear the number 10 percent, it is an \nabstract figure. But if you are a husband or wife, a son or daughter \nwho is out of work, or one in your family is out of work, unemployment \nis 100 percent.\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\n  As the economy shows signs of life, unfortunately millions of \nAmericans remain out of work, struggling to make ends meet with savings \nand unemployment benefits. There are more than 15 million unemployed \nAmericans. That is not even counting those who have stopped looking for \nwork. There are more than 6 million people who have been out of work \nfor 6 or more months. Each one has a story, a life, usually a family, \nsuch as the woman from Rochester I mentioned.\n  When I go to sleep at night, I sometimes think of the people I talked \nwith last week while we were on break and about their pain at losing \ntheir job and their quest to find a new one. Unfortunately, despite \ntheir efforts, most of them have not found work.\n\n  This recession is unlike anything we have seen since the 1930s. It \nhas created immeasurable hardship and heartache for tens of millions of \nAmerican families. It doesn't matter if you are in a red State or a \nblue State. If you are unemployed, you want a job.\n  Last year, Congress took bold steps to bring our economy back from \nthe brink of collapse, and GDP growth in the last quarter was as high \nas 5.7 percent. The purpose of the provision Senator Hatch and I have \nintroduced is to take that growth and translate it into jobs because \nwhile the economy grew at a very rapid clip--5.7 percent--hardly a job \nwas created. That is a problem because we cannot continue to grow at \nthat rate unless people start going back to work. Until the \nunemployment rate drops significantly, Congress must do more to help \nfamilies across the country who are desperately struggling to find \nwork, and this bill is a step in the right direction.\n  Last year, I believe Congress was right not to add a jobs tax credit \nto the stimulus package. Economists told us that with the economy \nshrinking and losing 700,000 jobs a month when the President took \noffice, our focus had to be on stimulating demand. But now that the \neconomy is beginning to grow--at the very worst is flat--a tax credit \nis what is needed because there are companies that have seen sales blip \nup and they are wondering whether to hire that additional worker. The \nSchumer-Hatch tax credit may push them over the edge and they may say: \nOK, I will hire somebody. Then, instead of the vicious cycle of \ndownward employment we have seen, a virtuous cycle will begin. That \ncompany will hire a worker, that worker will go to the stores and buy \nthings, those stores may hire another worker and more money circulates \nin the economy and we start moving upward as opposed to downward.\n  After reviewing the criticisms of past tax credit proposals, Senator \nHatch and I set out to develop an idea that would address some of the \npast concerns while honing in on the problem we are trying to solve, \nwhich is persistently high and long-term unemployment. I felt we needed \na solution that was simple, immediate, focused, fiscally responsible, \nand potentially bipartisan. That is what our proposal does.\n  Let me talk about each word. It is simple. Small business, we know, \nis the job growth engine in America. But if you tell a small \nbusinessperson they have to fill out 40 pages or even hire an \naccountant before they get a tax credit, they are going to say: Forget \nabout it. But this is immediate. Again, if you tell a small \nbusinessperson: Yes, you will get a tax credit, but it will be a year \nfrom April when your tax returns come in, they are not going to do it.\n  Our proposal is immediate. The minute the worker is hired, the \nbenefit begins. As I said, it is simple: All the employer must do is \nshow that the person they are hiring has been unemployed for 60 days--\nand that is easy to do because they can show 60 days of unemployment \nbenefits--and that is that.\n  Third, our program is fiscally responsible. It is not a big, huge \nbureaucracy. It is not a new government agency. The money goes directly \nto the small business that makes the new hire, and that is why it has \nbang for the buck. It is estimated that if 3 million people were hired \nby this credit, it would cost about $15 billion. Mr. President, $15 \nbillion sounds like a lot of money, but compared to the stimulus--\nagain, for a different purpose a year ago when the economy was \ncollapsing--the cost of ours is about one-sixtieth, and dollar for \ndollar it will be focused on jobs.\n  So it meets all these criteria. It will focus like a laser on the \nunemployed and will create jobs right away at a reasonable cost. In \nthis day when communication is so important, it can be explained in a \nsingle sentence. Any private sector employer that hires a worker who \nhas been unemployed for 60 days will not have to pay payroll taxes on \nthat worker for the rest of the year. That is it. Nothing else. It \nexplains the whole program from start to finish. By the way, if the \nemployer keeps that worker for at least a year, they will receive an \nadditional $1,000 tax credit.\n  Our plan is good for business and good for workers. The more a \nbusiness pays a worker, the bigger benefit they get. Many of the \nprevious programs were aimed, understandably, at workers at the lower \nincome level. But these days, when you have people in our State who \nmake $60,000, $80,000, $100,000 or $120,000 a year and who can't find \nwork, they will benefit by the same percentage as somebody at the lower \nend of the spectrum. The sooner the employer hires, the bigger the \nbreak because it lasts this year. The employer doesn't pay taxes and \nthe benefits go immediately into the business's cashflow. Unlike other \nproposals, there is no waiting to receive a tax credit. The employer \ndoesn't pay the taxes to the government in the first place.\n  Obviously, employers decide to hire workers when it makes business \nsense. If your sales are declining, no tax incentive is going to \nencourage you to hire somebody. But we are now finding--at this stage \nof this Nation's incipient and all-too-small recovery--that many \nbusinesses, large and small, are finding orders are beginning to rise, \nsales beginning to increase. It is those businesses that our tax credit \nis aimed at. This proposal may give them the push they need to add a \nfew workers or hire them a few months sooner than they otherwise might. \nEither would be a good thing.\n  I don't wish to delude my colleagues, and I know Senator Hatch, the \ncoauthor of this proposal, would agree, that this provision is not a \npanacea. There are other proposals Congress could, should, and must \nconsider to aid job creation, but I look forward to considering those \nideas in the weeks to come. In the meantime, we ought to take advantage \nof the bipartisan camaraderie, which I hope lasts, and move this \nproposal forward.\n  I wish to thank a number of people who helped. At the top of the list \nis Chairman Baucus. When Senator Hatch and I--both members of his \ncommittee, the Finance Committee--brought him the proposal, he thought \nit was a good idea and helped champion it. I wish to thank Leader Reid, \nwho jumped right at the opportunity to pass the proposal. I wish to \nrecognize Senator Casey and Senator Gillibrand, my colleague, for the \nhard work they put into an alternative tax credit idea, which could end \nup complementing, not replacing, our idea. Finally, last but certainly \nnot least, I wish to thank my colleague, Senator Hatch, as well as \nSenator Grassley, who worked with us on this proposal to refine it and \nmake it possible to pass, which I believe we will do shortly.\n  I wish to turn the subject to another pressing issue; that is, the \npressing issue of State fiscal relief. While our top priority is \nputting unemployed Americans back to work, nothing we do on job \ncreation will be truly effective unless we also stop the bleeding \ncaused by State and local budget cuts across the Nation. We cannot, \nwith one hand, incentivize private sector employment while, on the \nother hand, through inaction, force State and local governments to lay \noff thousands of firefighters, teachers, health care providers, and \nother public servants.\n  Right now, States face the steepest ever dropoff in revenues. My \nState of New York and so many of the localities I have visited--from \nlarge major cities such as New York City and Buffalo, to the smaller \ntowns and villages--are desperate for help. If they do not receive it, \nthey are going to have to lay off thousands and thousands of workers. \nIn the city of New York, they are talking about laying off teachers. \nThat is hurting our seed corn. The number of police officers, at a time \nof crime and terrorist threats, is declining. That hurts our economy as \nwell as our localities.\n  New York is not alone. From California to Arizona, to Alabama, to\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\nMaine, and to Mississippi, State Governors have laid out proposals that \nwill unfortunately eliminate jobs and cut critical services in the \ncoming months. In fact, it is estimated, if there is no help, State and \nlocal governments will have to lay off 1 million workers-- something we \ncan ill afford at a time of this incipient recovery. The cuts couldn't \ncome at a worse time for our fledgling economy. States will be forced \nto make massive layoffs and they will be cornered into raising taxes on \nhard-working, middle-class Americans at a time when families can't \nafford to take another hit and at a time when taking money out of the \neconomy makes no sense at all. It oftentimes makes no sense but now \nmore particularly.\n\n  Last week, the Nation's Governors nearly unanimously endorsed a 6-\nmonth emergency extension of FMAP, the Federal Medicaid Assistance \nProgram, which would send up to $25 billion to the States. They know \nfirsthand that job losses in their States would have been much more \nsevere were it not for the significant relief Congress provided for \nthem in last year's stimulus package, particularly through the FMAP \nprogram. I know our economy is growing, but out in the States it sure \ndoesn't feel like a recovery yet. Cutting off this assistance now, as \nthe stimulus expires, would be like pulling the rug from under the \nStates just as they are maybe beginning to turn the corner.\n  I was an ardent supporter of the Recovery Act's FMAP aid because, \nplain and simple, it saves jobs, and I argued for it then. I am \nespecially proud to have authored a provision that ensured a stream of \nfunding that went directly to county governments. In my State, the \nMedicaid burden, much of it--too much of it--falls on localities. If we \nwere just to give Albany the money--not just the Albany share but the \ncounty share--the counties and New York City might never see that money \never again. So I was able to--with the help of Leader Reid and Chairman \nBaucus--write a provision into law that said the locality gets its \nshare directly, and I am urging the Senate to include this language in \na new emergency extension as well.\n  We cannot afford to delay any longer. This economic downturn didn't \ncome with an end-of-the-year deadline. This critical aid to States \nshouldn't either. So I hope that in the next jobs bill we pass FMAP is \na vital part, and I hope, just as with the provision Senator Hatch and \nI put together, it will get broad bipartisan support. I believe an \noverwhelming majority of Governors--Democratic and Republican--have \nalready signed a letter urging that that happen, and I hope we will get \npeople from both sides of the aisle to make sure the next jobs bill \ncontains a healthy and robust FMAP extension. The House has already \npassed it. It is up to us.\n  We have much yet to do on the job front, but our efforts will be \nundermined if our Nation's Governors are forced to lay off workers and \nraise property taxes. We need to plug the holes in the dam so our \nrecovery efforts are not washed away. We need to put this great Nation \nback on a path to prosperity by passing the tax credit Senator Hatch \nand I have offered and then by moving forward and making sure FMAP is \nextended for at least another 6 months.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Reconciliation\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think all across this country people \nare wondering about what is going on in Congress and, specifically, \nwhat is going on in the Senate. People are using the expression that \ngovernment is broken and that we seem to be a dysfunctional \ninstitution.\n  The reason for the alarm is pretty obvious. The United States today \nfaces the most serious set of crises we have seen since the Great \nDepression. Today, some 17 percent of our people are either unemployed \nor underemployed. This is on top of coming out of a decade where the \nmedian family income actually declined. So people by the millions are \ntoday working longer hours for lower wages. They are wondering what \nkind of life is going to be available for their kids. They are having a \nhard time affording childcare. They are having a hard time affording \nhigher education. We have 46 million people who are uninsured. We have \n45,000 people who die every single year because they can't get to a \ndoctor. If we don't get a handle on health care, their costs are going \nto be doubling in the next 8 years. We recently saw Blue Cross in \nCalifornia asking for a 39-percent rate increase for their premiums. It \nis not unusual. It is going on all over the country.\n  People are saying, What is going on? Is the middle class going to \ncontinue to collapse? Is poverty going to continue to increase? Are you \nguys going to get your act together and begin to do something that \nbenefits working families in this country?\n  It goes without saying that the American people want--I want, you \nwant, we all want--bipartisan efforts to solve these problems, but, \nmost importantly, we want to solve these issues. We have to deal with \nthe economy. We have to deal with our friends on Wall Street whose \nrecklessness and illegal behavior has driven this country into this \nterrible recession. We have to deal with it. We have to deal with \nhealth care. We don't have a choice. We have to deal with the $12 \ntrillion national debt. We have to do it.\n  Unfortunately, I think what the American people are beginning to \ncatch onto is that to have bipartisanship, you need a ``bi,'' you need \ntwo sides coming together. What we have here in the Senate is not two \nsides coming together but one side, our Republican friends who are \nsaying: No, no, no. If it is good for Obama, it is bad for us. No, no, \nno. We have had a record-breaking number of filibusters, a record-\nbreaking number of other obstructionist tactics. The end result is the \nAmerican people are becoming very frustrated.\n  I do a national radio show every week and every week on that program \nsomebody is calling me up and saying, I don't understand it. When the \nRepublicans were in control of the Senate, they were able to bring \nforth sweeping proposals. They didn't have 60 votes. What is going on? \nYou guys on your side, those who are Independents and in the Democratic \ncaucus, you have 59 votes, why aren't you doing it? It is a good \nquestion.\n  I think more and more people are talking about using the \nreconciliation process, which is simply a parliamentary procedure which \nenables us to pass legislation with the end result of saving taxpayers' \nmoney and lowering the deficit. The beauty of that approach is you can \ngo forward with 51 votes, not the 60 votes we are having a very \ndifficult time obtaining, because we are not getting much support from \nthe other side. Some people say, Well, this reconciliation approach is \nunfair. This is a radical idea. Why are you bringing it forth? The \nanswer is that this has been done time after time after time, mostly, \nin fact, by Republicans. So it seems to me if this is a concept the \nRepublicans have used year after year after year for very major pieces \nof legislation, it is appropriate for the Democratic caucus to do that \nas well.\n  Let me give a few examples. Many Americans will remember the Contract \nWith America. That was Newt Gingrich's very big idea. I thought it was \na very bad idea, but nonetheless it was a very comprehensive approach. \nThe Contract With America in 1995 was passed in the Senate through \nreconciliation. This was a broad, comprehensive bill, and this is what \nPresident Clinton said. This is what the Washington Post reported \nPresident Clinton saying when he vetoed that legislation, and I am glad \nhe did. This is what Clinton said:\n\n       Today I am vetoing the biggest Medicare and Medicaid cuts \n     in history, deep cuts in education, a rollback in \n     environmental protection, and a tax increase on working \n     families.\n\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\n\n  This was Clinton's veto message of the Republican Contract With \nAmerica that was passed through reconciliation.\n  That is not the only effort the Republicans mounted through \nreconciliation. In 1996, Republicans passed legislation to enact \nwelfare reform through reconciliation. In 1997, Congress used \nreconciliation to establish new health coverage programs or to \nsubstantially expand existing ones, including SCHIP passed through \nreconciliation. In 2005, Republicans pushed through reconciliation \nlegislation that reduced spending on Medicaid and raised premiums on \nupper income Medicare beneficiaries. In 2003, Republicans used \nreconciliation to push through President Bush's 2003 tax cuts. In 2001, \nRepublicans used reconciliation to pass President Bush's $1.35 trillion \ntax cut, much of it going to the wealthiest people in this country.\n  What is my point? My point is that it would be the utmost hypocrisy \nfor Republicans to tell us we should not use reconciliation when they \nhave used it time and time and time again.\n  Let me conclude by saying this country faces enormous problems. What \nhas occurred over the last year, year and a half, is an unprecedented \nlevel of obstructionism and delaying tactics on the part of our \nRepublican colleagues. The American people are hurting. They want to \nsee this government begin the process of creating millions of decent-\npaying jobs. They want to see a transformation of our energy system so \nwe can move from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy and jobs doing that. The American people want to see us rebuild \nour infrastructure which is presently crumbling and we can create jobs \ndoing that. In the short term, the American people want us to do \nsomething about the high cost of a college education by expanding Pell \ngrants and by also addressing the very serious problems with childcare \nand the needs for school construction. We can do that as well.\n  My point is the American people are angry. They are frustrated. They \nwant action. If the Republicans choose, as is their right, to try to \nobstruct and try to use the rules to delay action, I think we should do \nwhat they have done time after time after time and that is use the \nreconciliation process. That is what I think we should do, and I hope \nwe will.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Nuclear Nonproliferation\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to express support for the \nObama administration's efforts on nuclear nonproliferation. We know--\nand I believe this is a consensus in our country--that nuclear \nterrorism poses the most serious threat to our security, as well as the \nsecurity of other nations around the world. I believe we have a solemn \nresponsibility to do what we can to combat the threat of nuclear \nweapons.\n  The Obama administration has set forth a vision which puts American \nsecurity first in pursuit of a world where terrorists cannot acquire \nweapons of mass destruction. The Senate also has an important \nleadership role to play. Our No. 1 obligation should be to protect the \nAmerican people.\n  In Prague last April, President Obama described the steps the United \nStates is prepared to take toward a world without nuclear weapons. In \nexpressing this goal, the President acknowledged the necessity of \nmaintaining our weapons complex while simultaneously working to \nnegotiate agreements that decrease the number of nuclear weapons in the \nworld. He said:\n\n       Make no mistake, as long as these weapons exist, the United \n     States will maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal to \n     deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies \n     . . . but we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal.\n\n  This January, a bipartisan group of American national security \nleaders came together to help guide our thinking on these important \nissues. Former Secretary of State George Shultz, former Secretary of \nDefense William Perry, former National Security Adviser and Secretary \nof State Henry Kissinger, and former Senator Sam Nunn all have stellar \nnational security experience and credentials. They wrote together:\n\n       Nuclear weapons today present tremendous dangers, but also \n     an historic opportunity. U.S. leadership will be required to \n     take the world to the next stage--to a solid consensus for \n     reversing reliance on nuclear weapons globally as a vital \n     contribution to preventing their proliferation into \n     potentially dangerous hands, and ultimately ending them as a \n     threat to the world.\n\n  President Obama is willing and able to provide this leadership at \nthis critical point in history.\n  The administration is in the final stages of negotiating START with \nRussia. This treaty would reduce deployed nuclear weapons in the United \nStates and Russia and would provide crucial verification measures that \nwould allow a window into the Russian nuclear program.\n  While the Treaty has taken a little longer than expected to complete, \nI applaud Assistant Secretary for Verification, Compliance and \nImplementation, Rose Gottemoeller, for her leadership and her efforts \nto pursue a strong agreement as opposed to an immediate agreement.\n  A new START agreement is in our national security interest, \nespecially in terms of maintaining verification and transparency \nmeasures. Once completed, this agreement can help to strengthen the \nU.S.-Russian relationship and potentially increase the possibility of \nRussian cooperation on an array of thorny international issues, \nincluding North Korea and Iran.\n  The START follow-on treaty is also a clear demonstration that the \nUnited States is upholding our disarmament obligation under the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty, one of the treaty's three pillars, in addition \nto nonproliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. START is a \nnecessary step in reaffirming U.S. leadership on nonproliferation \nissues. Without a clear commitment to our nonproliferation \nresponsibilities through a new START agreement, it will be increasingly \ndifficult for the United States to secure international support in \naddressing the urgent security threats posed by the spread of nuclear \nweapons.\n  An essential element of securing our nuclear weapons complex begins \nat home. Last Thursday, Vice President Biden spoke at the National \nDefense University about the administration's efforts to maintain a \nsafe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Vice President's speech.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The Path to Nuclear Security: Implementing the President's Prague \n                                 Agenda\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen; Secretaries Gates and Chu; General \n     Cartwright; Undersecretary Tauscher; Administrator \n     D'Agostino; members of our armed services; students and \n     faculty; thank you all for coming.\n       At its founding, Elihu Root gave this campus a mission that \n     is the very essence of our national defense: ``Not to promote \n     war, but to preserve peace by intelligent and adequate \n     preparation to repel aggression.'' For more than a century, \n     you and your predecessors have heeded that call. There are \n     few greater contributions citizens can claim.\n       Many statesmen have walked these grounds, including our \n     Administration's outstanding National Security Advisor, \n     General Jim Jones. You taught him well. George Kennan, the \n     scholar and diplomat, lectured at the National War College in \n     the late 1940s. Just back from Moscow, in a small office not \n     far from here, he developed the doctrine of Containment that \n     guided a generation of Cold War foreign policy.\n       Some of the issues that arose during that time seem like \n     distant memories. But the topic I came to discuss with you \n     today, the challenge posed by nuclear weapons, continues to \n     demand our urgent attention.\n       Last April, in Prague, President Obama laid out his vision \n     for protecting our country from nuclear threats.\n       He made clear we will take concrete steps toward a world \n     without nuclear weapons, while retaining a safe, secure, and \n     effective arsenal as long as we still need it. We will work \n     to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. And we \n     will do everything in our power to prevent the spread of \n     nuclear weapons to terrorists and also to states that don't \n     already possess them.\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\n       It's easy to recognize the threat posed by nuclear \n     terrorism. But we must not underestimate how proliferation to \n     a state could destabilize regions critical to our security \n     and prompt neighbors to seek nuclear weapons of their own.\n       Our agenda is based on a clear-eyed assessment of our \n     national interest. We have long relied on nuclear weapons to \n     deter potential adversaries.\n       Now, as our technology improves, we are developing non-\n     nuclear ways to accomplish that same objective. The \n     Quadrennial Defense Review and Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Review, which Secretary Gates released two weeks ago, present \n     a plan to further strengthen our preeminent conventional \n     forces to defend our nation and our allies.\n       Capabilities like an adaptive missile defense shield, \n     conventional warheads with worldwide reach, and others that \n     we are developing enable us to reduce the role of nuclear \n     weapons, as other nuclear powers join us in drawing down. \n     With these modern capabilities, even with deep nuclear \n     reductions, we will remain undeniably strong.\n       As we've said many times, the spread of nuclear weapons is \n     the greatest threat facing our country.\n       That is why we are working both to stop their proliferation \n     and eventually to eliminate them. Until that day comes, \n     though, we will do everything necessary to maintain our \n     arsenal.\n       At the vanguard of this effort, alongside our military, are \n     our nuclear weapons laboratories, national treasures that \n     deserve our support. Their invaluable contributions range \n     from building the world's fastest supercomputers, to \n     developing cleaner fuels, to surveying the heavens with \n     robotic telescopes.\n       But the labs are best known for the work they do to secure \n     our country. Time and again, we have asked our labs to meet \n     our most urgent strategic needs. And time and again, they \n     have delivered.\n       In 1939, as fascism began its march across Europe, Asia, \n     and Africa, Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt that \n     the Nazis were racing to build a weapon, the likes of which \n     the world had never seen. In the Southwest Desert, under the \n     leadership of Robert Oppenheimer, the physicists of Los \n     Alamos won that race and changed the course of history.\n       Sandia was born near Albuquerque soon after the Second \n     World War and became our premier facility for developing the \n     non-nuclear components of our nuclear weapons program.\n       And a few years later the institution that became Lawrence \n     Livermore took root in California. During the arms race that \n     followed the Korean War, it designed and developed warheads \n     that kept our nuclear capabilities second to none.\n       These examples illustrate what everyone in this room \n     already knows--that the past century's defining conflicts \n     were decided not just on the battlefield, but in the \n     classroom and in the laboratory.\n       Air Force General Hap Arnold, an aviation pioneer whose \n     vision helped shape the National War College, once argued \n     that the First World War was decided by brawn and the Second \n     by logistics. ``The Third World War will be different,'' he \n     predicted. ``It will be won by brains.''\n       General Arnold got it almost right. Great minds like Kennan \n     and Oppenheimer helped win the Cold War and prevent World War \n     Three altogether.\n       During the Cold War, we tested nuclear weapons in our \n     atmosphere, underwater and underground, to confirm that they \n     worked before deploying them, and to evaluate more advanced \n     concepts. But explosive testing damaged our health, disrupted \n     our environment and set back our non-proliferation goals.\n       Eighteen years ago, President George H.W. Bush signed the \n     nuclear testing moratorium enacted by Congress, which remains \n     in place to this day.\n       Under the moratorium, our laboratories have maintained our \n     arsenal through the Stockpile Stewardship Program without \n     underground nuclear testing, using techniques that are as \n     successful as they are cutting edge.\n       Today, the directors of our nuclear laboratories tell us \n     they have a deeper understanding of our arsenal from \n     Stockpile Stewardship than they ever had when testing was \n     commonplace.\n       Let me repeat that--our labs know more about our arsenal \n     today than when we used to explode our weapons on a regular \n     basis. With our support, the labs can anticipate potential \n     problems and reduce their impact on our arsenal.\n       Unfortunately, during the last decade, our nuclear complex \n     and experts were neglected and underfunded.\n       Tight budgets forced more than 2,000 employees of Los \n     Alamos and Lawrence Livermore from their jobs between 2006 \n     and 2008, including highly-skilled scientists and engineers.\n       And some of the facilities we use to handle uranium and \n     plutonium date back to the days when the world's great powers \n     were led by Truman, Churchill, and Stalin. The signs of age \n     and decay are becoming more apparent every day.\n       Because we recognized these dangers, in December, Secretary \n     Chu and I met at the White House with the heads of the three \n     nuclear weapons labs. They described the dangerous impact \n     these budgetary pressures were having on their ability to \n     manage our arsenal without testing. They say this situation \n     is a threat to our security. President Obama and I agree.\n       That's why earlier this month we announced a new budget \n     that reverses the last decade's dangerous decline. It devotes \n     $7 billion to maintaining our nuclear stockpile and \n     modernizing our nuclear infrastructure. To put that in \n     perspective, that's $624 million more than Congress approved \n     last year--and an increase of $5 billion over the next five \n     years. Even in these tight fiscal times, we will commit the \n     resources our security requires.\n       This investment is not only consistent with our \n     nonproliferation agenda; it is essential to it. Guaranteeing \n     our stockpile, coupled with broader research and development \n     efforts, allows us to pursue deep nuclear reductions without \n     compromising our security. As our conventional capabilities \n     improve, we will continue to reduce our reliance on nuclear \n     weapons.\n       Responsible disarmament requires versatile specialists to \n     manage it.\n       The skilled technicians who look after our arsenal today \n     are the ones who will safely dismantle it tomorrow.\n       And chemists who understand how plutonium ages also develop \n     forensics to track missing nuclear material and catch those \n     trafficking in it.\n       Our goal of a world without nuclear weapons has been \n     endorsed by leading voices in both parties. These include two \n     former Secretaries of State from Republican administrations, \n     Henry Kissinger and George Shultz; President Clinton's \n     Secretary of Defense Bill Perry; and my former colleague Sam \n     Nunn, for years the Democratic Chairman of the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee.\n       Together, these four statesmen called eliminating nuclear \n     weapons ``a bold initiative consistent with America's moral \n     heritage.''\n       During the 2008 Presidential campaign, both the President \n     and Senator McCain supported the same objective. We will \n     continue to build support for this emerging bipartisan \n     consensus like the one around containment of Soviet \n     expansionism that George Kennan inspired.\n       Toward that end, we have worked tirelessly to implement the \n     President's Prague agenda.\n       In September, the President chaired an historic meeting of \n     the UN Security Council, which unanimously embraced the key \n     elements of the President's vision.\n       As I speak, U.S. and Russian negotiators are completing an \n     agreement that will reduce strategic weapons to their lowest \n     levels in decades.\n       Its verification measures will provide confidence its terms \n     are being met. These reductions will be conducted \n     transparently and predictably. The new START treaty will \n     promote strategic stability and bolster global efforts to \n     prevent proliferation by showing that the world's leading \n     nuclear powers are committed to reducing their arsenals.\n       And it will build momentum for collaboration with Russia on \n     strengthening the global consensus that nations who violate \n     their NPT obligations should be held to account.\n       This strategy is yielding results. We have tightened \n     sanctions on North Korea's proliferation activities through \n     the most restrictive UN Security Council resolution to date--\n     and the international community is enforcing these sanctions \n     effectively.\n       And we are now working with our international partners to \n     ensure that Iran, too, faces real consequences for failing to \n     meet its obligations.\n       In the meantime, we are completing a government-wide review \n     of our nuclear posture.\n       Already, our budget proposal reflects some of our key \n     priorities, including increased funding for our nuclear \n     complex, and a commitment to sustain our heavy bombers and \n     land and submarine-based missile capabilities, under the new \n     START agreement.\n       As Congress requested and with Secretary Gates' full \n     support, this review has been a full interagency partnership.\n       We believe we have developed a broad and deep consensus on \n     the importance of the President's agenda and the steps we \n     must take to achieve it. The results will be presented to \n     Congress soon.\n       In April, the President will also host a Nuclear Security \n     Summit to advance his goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear \n     material within four years. We cannot wait for an act of \n     nuclear terrorism before coming together to share best \n     practices and raise security standards, and we will seek firm \n     commitments from our partners to do just that.\n       In May, we will participate in the Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     Review Conference. We are rallying support for stronger \n     measures to strengthen inspections and punish cheaters.\n       The Treaty's basic bargain--that nuclear powers pursue \n     disarmament and non-nuclear states do not acquire such \n     weapons, while gaining access to civilian nuclear \n     technology--is the cornerstone of the non-proliferation \n     regime.\n       Before the treaty was negotiated, President Kennedy \n     predicted a world with up to 20 nuclear powers by the mid-\n     1970s. Because of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the \n     consensus it embodied, that didn't happen.\n       Now, 40 years later, that consensus is fraying. We must \n     reinforce this consensus, and strengthen the treaty for the \n     future.\n       And, while we do that, we will also continue our efforts to \n     negotiate a ban on the production of fissile materials that \n     can be used in nuclear weapons.\n       We know that completing a treaty that will ban the \n     production of fissile material\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\n     will not be quick or easy--but the Conference on Disarmament \n     must resume its work on this treaty as soon as possible.\n       The last piece of the President's agenda from Prague was \n     the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       A decade ago, we led this effort to negotiate this treaty \n     in order to keep emerging nuclear states from perfecting \n     their arsenals and to prevent our rivals from pursuing ever \n     more advanced weapons.\n       We are confident that all reasonable concerns raised about \n     the treaty back then--concerns about verification and the \n     reliability of our own arsenal--have now been addressed. The \n     test ban treaty is as important as ever.\n       As President Obama said in Prague, ``we cannot succeed in \n     this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it.''\n       Some friends in both parties may question aspects of our \n     approach. Some in my own party may have trouble reconciling \n     investments in our nuclear complex with a commitment to arms \n     reduction. Some in the other party may worry we're \n     relinquishing capabilities that keep our country safe.\n       With both groups we respectfully disagree. As both the only \n     nation to have used nuclear weapons, and as a strong \n     proponent of non-proliferation, the United States has long \n     embodied a stark but inevitable contradiction. The horror of \n     nuclear conflict may make its occurrence unlikely, but the \n     very existence of nuclear weapons leaves the human race ever \n     at the brink of self-destruction, particularly if the weapons \n     fall into the wrong hands.\n       Many leading figures of the nuclear age grew ambivalent \n     about aspects of this order. Kennan, whose writings gave \n     birth to the theory of nuclear deterrence, argued \n     passionately but futilely against the development of the \n     hydrogen bomb. And Robert Oppenheimer famously lamented, \n     after watching the first mushroom cloud erupt from a device \n     he helped design, that he had become ``the destroyer of \n     worlds.''\n       President Obama is determined, and I am as well, that the \n     destroyed world Oppenheimer feared must never become our \n     reality. That is why we are pursuing the peace and security \n     of a world without nuclear weapons. The awesome force at our \n     disposal must always be balanced by the weight of our shared \n     responsibility.\n       Every day, many in this audience help bear that burden with \n     professionalism, courage, and grace.\n       A grateful nation appreciates your service. Together, we \n     will live up to our responsibilities. Together, we will lead \n     the world.\n       Thank you.\n       May God bless America. May God protect our troops.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the Vice President said that recent years \nhave seen a slow but steady decline in support for our nuclear \nstockpile and infrastructure and for our highly trained nuclear \nworkforce. The four national security statesmen I previously referred \nto agree. In January, all four of these experts wrote:\n\n       These investments are urgently needed to undo the adverse \n     consequences of deep reductions over the past 5 years in the \n     laboratories' budgets for the science, technology and \n     engineering programs that support and underwrite the Nation's \n     nuclear deterrent.\n\n  We know that JASON, an independent defense advisory group of senior \nscientists, has also echoed these same concerns in a recent study. The \nJASON group found that the lifetimes of today's warheads could be \nextended for decades. That was the good news. While the weapons are in \ngood shape, JASON is concerned that maintenance of the stockpile relies \non the ``renewal of expertise and capabilities in science, technology, \nengineering, and production unique to the nuclear weapons program'' and \nthat this expertise was ``threatened by lack of program stability, \nperceived lack of mission importance, and degradation of the work \nenvironment.''\n  The Obama administration's budget request reflects these concerns. \nThe fiscal year 2011 budget request devotes $7 billion to maintaining \nour nuclear weapons stockpile and complex and for related efforts. \nDelivering on promises made in Prague and elsewhere, this \nadministration has demonstrated a clear commitment to a nuclear \nnonproliferation strategy that is an integral part of our security and \nthat of our allies.\n  As Under Secretary of State for Arms Control in International \nSecurity, Ellen Tauscher, a former Member of the House, said recently:\n\n       Nuclear disarmament is not the Holy Grail. As long as we \n     see the rise of nuclear weapons in other countries, we will \n     maintain deterrence that is second to none.\n\n  This approach by Ellen Tauscher is smart, strategic, and measured, \nand it puts American security first.\n  As I stand in support of full funding for the administration's \nnuclear weapons stockpile and complex request, I believe it is very \nimportant that we stand together--all of us, Democrats, Republicans, \nand Independents.\n  Key dimensions of our nuclear stockpile are the nuclear labs and \nresident scientific expertise. We need to be able to continue to \nrecruit the most highly qualified and motivated experts tasked with \nstockpile maintenance. Our three National Laboratories--Lawrence \nLivermore in California, Los Alamos in New Mexico, and Sandia in New \nMexico and California--are staffed by gifted public servants who have \nestablished methods for verifying the safety, security, and reliability \nof our stockpile. This budget presented by the administration will help \nto ensure that the most talented scientists continue to be attracted to \nour labs and that these labs continue to be state of the art.\n  The administration's 2011 budget request also bolsters the case for \neventual ratification of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. A full \ninvestment in our nuclear weapons infrastructure will mean the United \nStates can continue to maintain its nuclear weapons infrastructure \nwithout testing. We have not tested a nuclear weapon since 1992 because \nwe now have the technical means to ensure the reliability and safety of \nour stockpile without testing.\n  This is an issue of national security and preventing nuclear \nterrorism. By working to diminish access to fissile material, by \nworking to ensure Russia and the United States decrease nuclear \nstockpiles, and by promoting a ban on nuclear testing and by ensuring \nour nuclear arsenal is safe and secure--all of these measures, as well \nas others--will help to create an international environment where a \nterrorist's access to fissile material is diminished.\n  I should mention as well the work of Senator Lugar. Senator Lugar has \nbeen a remarkable leader in regard to promoting the Nunn-Lugar program \nall these years. I agree with Senator Lugar's efforts to secure more \nfunding as the mandate of the program is expanded without commensurate \nresources. Senator Lugar reports that the program ``has eliminated more \nnuclear weapons than the combined nuclear arsenals of France, China, \nand the United Kingdom for less than $3 billion--a striking return on \ninvestment.'' I have to agree that is a striking return, indeed.\n  Finally, I also express support for the administration's requested \nincrease in funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency, which \nwe all know by the acronym IAEA. For too the long, the IAEA's technical \nassistance and cooperation programs have been underfunded. \nInternational nonproliferation efforts face an uncertain future. Iran \nand North Korea are our primary concerns, but potential nuclear \nflashpoints remain between India and Pakistan, and the security of \nfissile material, while improving, remains a vital concern. In order \nfor the IAEA to be best positioned to confront proliferation efforts in \nNorth Korea and Iran, as well as monitor the peaceful nuclear energy \nprograms in countries around the world, its budget needs to reflect \nthis growing portfolio. U.S. leadership in nonproliferation is \nessential. A fully funded IAEA will complement U.S. efforts to combat \nproliferation at this critical time.\n  These investments in our national security are substantial, but there \nis no greater threat than that of nuclear terrorism. We must remain \nvigilant in doing everything we can to ensure terrorists do not get \ntheir hands on weapons of mass destruction. The nonproliferation \nmeasures mentioned above all help to address this threat.\n  To keep America safe, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents must \nwork together--let me say that again--must work together to promote \nnonproliferation and confront nuclear terror by ensuring that our \nexisting nuclear arsenal is safe, secure, and effective.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in a moment, I will ask unanimous consent \nto be able to offer an amendment, but\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nfirst I wish to talk about that amendment because I understand the \nother side is going to object.\n  Currently, there are seven States that collect no income tax from \ntheir residents. Those States are my home the State of Nevada, Florida, \nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.\n  Under current Federal tax law, in all the States that have an income \ntax, individuals are allowed to deduct those income taxes from their \nFederal tax form. Your property taxes can also be deducted. Even when \nyou register your car and pay your registration fee on your car, you \nare allowed to deduct that because that is a local tax. The tax that \nyou are not allowed to deduct, if we don't extend current law, will be \nthe sales tax.\n  My State relies more on a sales tax for its revenue sources. That is \nwhat it decided to do. Other States have chosen to set their taxes up \ndifferently. But States have the flexibility to set up their taxes in \nthe way they feel is best for their residents. My State actually has a \nconstitutional amendment against collecting a State income tax from its \nresidents.\n  Nevadans don't want a State income tax, but they want to be treated \nfairly. So a few years ago, we passed a law so that Nevada and these \nsix other States would be treated fairly; so that residents would have \nthe option of deducting a sales tax or an income tax. It is just a \nmatter of fairness, but it also allows people to keep more of their own \nincome. At the end of last year, the deductibility for the sales tax \nexpired, and I would like to be able to offer an amendment to extend it \nin this jobs bill.\n  I believe if people have more of their own money--money they can \ncount on--they will make good decisions, and they will actually go out \nand spend some of that money. I believe this would actually be a good \nmeasure to put in the jobs bill. It was in the original bipartisan bill \nthat Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley came up with and \nintroduced. So I am hoping the other side will not object, although I \nunderstand they are going to.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to offer \nan amendment to allow for the deduction of State and local sales tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  In my capacity as a Senator from Colorado, I object.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I knew that was going to happen because \nthe majority party has decided to allow no amendments on this bill, \nwhich is a shame. It is the reason I voted against cloture on the bill \nyesterday, because I think it is only fair that we get to offer \namendments on such an important and expensive bill. This is one of the \namendments that I think should be allowed.\n  We will be making other efforts during the year to get the sales tax \ndeductibility enacted into law because it is a question of fairness for \nthese seven States. I know the Senators from those seven States join me \nin fighting for this. We fought together before, and we are going to \ncontinue to fight to try to make sure this deductibility, as a matter \nof fairness for our citizens, is maintained in Federal law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I stated earlier today, I had worked \nto put together a bipartisan package with my colleague, Finance \nCommittee Chairman Baucus, to address some time-sensitive matters that \nneed to be considered.\n  I was under the impression that the Senate Democratic leadership \ngenuinely wanted to work on a bipartisan basis but, unfortunately, I \nwas mistaken.\n  Although the majority leader was deeply involved in the development \nof our bipartisan bill, as soon as it was released he announced that he \nwould not take it up, and he arbitrarily decided to replace it with a \nbill he plans to jam through the Senate.\n  I addressed my concerns earlier about the removal of the tax extender \nprovisions.\n  Now I want to discuss another significant change between the \nbipartisan package Chairman Baucus and I put together and the Senate \nDemocratic leadership's bill that we will be voting on this week.\n  A package of expired and expiring Medicare health provisions has been \nremoved without any explanation. These bipartisan provisions are \nessential to the health and well-being of Medicare beneficiaries. They \nhave been routinely supported by both sides and passed repeatedly in \nrecent years.\n  So where does that leave us? We are now less than a week away from \nthe end of February, and Medicare beneficiaries around the country will \nsuffer from the Senate Democratic leader's decision to remove these \nprovisions without any explanation. Medicare beneficiaries should not \nbe held hostage to whatever partisan goals the Senate Democratic \nleadership envisions.\n  To make matters worse, they have decided to ``fill the tree,'' as the \nprocedure is called, so there will be no opportunity to offer these \nessential health provisions known as ``Medicare extenders'' as \namendments to his bill.\n  The decision to abandon a bipartisan approach is especially ironic \nconsidering the fact that later this week President Obama is hosting a \nbipartisan meeting with Senators and Members of the House to discuss \nhealth care reform.\n  It is too early to tell if that meeting will lead to a true \nbipartisan effort to address health care reform issues, at least in \nsome areas where there is broad agreement on both sides. But I commend \nthe President for his bipartisan outreach and invitation to meet and \ndiscuss these important issues. It is an approach that the Senate \nDemocratic leadership abandoned last year.\n  Apparently, political games have become more important than ensuring \nthat critical legislation is passed to protect Medicare beneficiaries' \naccess to health care.\n  Many individuals, in fact, are already in jeopardy of suffering \nadverse consequences to their health because of the failure by the \nSenate Democratic leadership to ensure that these critically needed \nMedicare provisions would be enacted by the end of last year. These are \nthe same provisions that had broad, bipartisan support when they were \nconsidered by the Finance Committee and included in the health care \nbill the committee reported last fall.\n  I am going to review some of these provisions and the impact they \nhave on Medicare beneficiaries and their access to health care.\n  First, there is the need for a physician payment update, what we \ncommonly refer to as the ``SGR'' or the ``doc fix.'' A 2-month \nextension that was passed in December is scheduled to expire on \nFebruary 28, just 5 days from now. Unless a physician update is enacted \nby March 1, physicians, nurses, and other health care practitioners \nwill experience severe payment cuts of 21 percent as of that date.\n  These payment cuts would be even more disastrous for physicians in \nrural States, such as Iowa, where Medicare reimbursement is already \nabout 30 percent lower than in other areas. But payment cuts of this \nmagnitude will severely impact physicians and health care practitioners \nthroughout the country, and they will significantly threaten \nbeneficiary access to care.\n  Should these cuts occur and continue for any length of time, they \nwill have a truly disastrous effect on the ability of seniors to find, \nor keep, physicians who take Medicare patients.\n  I am appalled that Medicare beneficiaries' access to physicians and \nother needed medical care is being jeopardized because of the political \ngames that are being played by the Senate Democratic leadership.\n  Let's look at beneficiaries who are already being affected by other \nMedicare provisions that should have been extended, as they have been \nin the past, but that were allowed to expire at the end of last year.\n  One of the most pressing is an extension of the exceptions process \nfor therapy caps. The law puts annual payment limits or financial caps \non therapy services. There are annual dollar limits on outpatient \nphysical therapy and speech-language pathology therapy combined and on \noccupational therapy.\n  While the law provided for an exceptions process to these caps when \nadditional therapy was medically necessary, that provision expired at \nthe end of 2009. Medicare beneficiaries who have suffered strokes or \nserious debilitating injuries, such as a hip fracture,\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\nhave significant rehabilitation needs. Some of these beneficiaries have \nalready exceeded their therapy limits for 2010.\n  Since the exceptions process that would have allowed these patients \nto receive more needed therapy has expired, beneficiaries with the \ngreatest need for therapy will be the hardest hit. Congress must \naddress this issue immediately.\n  A second issue of major concern is the need for additional payment \nfor mental health services. A provision that expired at the end of last \nyear provided an additional 5-percent payment for Medicare mental \nhealth services provided by psychologists and mental health counselors. \nThis provision has been key to improving access to mental health care \nservices for veterans and other military personnel suffering from post-\ntraumatic stress and other disorders since TRICARE coverage is based on \nMedicare rates.\n  Significant shortages of mental health personnel have made it \nexceedingly difficult for Medicare beneficiaries and some of our \nmilitary returning from overseas to find this critically needed help. \nThe expiration of this provision has made it even more difficult for \nthem to obtain these services. Congress needs to act immediately to \nhelp Medicare beneficiaries and members of the Armed Forces in need of \nmental health services.\n  A third issue concerns additional payments for ambulance services \nthat are routinely extended, year after year. Many ambulance providers \nneed them to survive. But those provisions also expired at the end of \nlast year.\n  Another provision would ensure that Medicare beneficiaries can \ncontinue to get vital medical supplies such as diabetic test strips, \ncanes, nebulizers, and wound care products from their local community \npharmacies.\n  Under current law, suppliers of durable medical equipment, \nprosthetics, orthotics, and other supplies must get accredited to prove \nthey comply with quality standards. Many eligible professionals, such \nas physicians, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, and others are \nspecifically exempted from this requirement. This provision would \nexempt pharmacies from being accredited under certain circumstances. \nPharmacies must have been enrolled as a Medicare supplier with a \nprovider number for at least 2 years, have DME billings that are less \nthan 5 percent of their total sales, be in good standing with Medicare, \nand meet other criteria.\n  Medicare beneficiaries living in rural and underserved areas are \nparticularly at risk of losing access to these critical medical \nproducts. This provision is essential to ensure they do not.\n  There are also a number of expired provisions in this package that \nimprove payment for hospitals, especially rural hospitals. These \nhospitals rely on these provisions to keep their doors open.\n  The impact of a hospital shutting its doors would be especially hard \non rural and underserved areas where hospitals are the only point of \naccess for health care.\n  Our country is facing record unemployment and Americans are \nstruggling to make ends meet. The failure to extend these essential \nMedicare provisions immediately will make access to health care or \nneeded medical services simply unavailable for many beneficiaries. The \nimpact will be even worse for those in rural areas already facing \nhealth care access problems.\n  These examples show some of the damage that failing to extend these \nMedicare provisions will do to our seniors' health care.\n  We need to get back to work on the bipartisan package that was in the \nworks until the Senate Democratic leadership's dramatic change in \ndirection.\n  Medicare beneficiaries are counting on us to work together and get \nthis done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 2009, bills aimed at weakening the \nability of universities to regulate the possession of firearms on \ncampus were introduced in 12 State legislatures, including the Michigan \nState Legislature. In 2008, 17 States saw similar legislation \nintroduced. Fortunately for the safety of students, faculty, and \nvisitors, none of these bills passed. In fact, according to the Wall \nStreet Journal, as of July 2009, State legislative efforts to allow \nfirearms on college campuses had been defeated 34 straight times \nnationwide. However, while this statistic demonstrates a clear national \nconsensus that guns do not belong at universities, the National Rifle \nAssociation, NRA, continues to push for weaker gun regulations.\n  Already in 2010, efforts have been undertaken that would weaken the \nability of colleges to determine their own security needs in Arizona, \nGeorgia, Virginia, and Colorado. These legislative efforts are part of \na strategy to pressure State legislatures into passing legislation that \nwould force colleges to allow the possession and use of firearms by \nstudents, faculty, and others on campus. According to a report from the \nBrady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, entitled ``No Gun Left Behind: \nThe Gun Lobby's Campaign to Push Guns into Colleges and Schools,'' this \nstrategy can be seen as a response to the horrific shootings at \nVirginia Tech in 2007. According to this strategy, the way to prevent \nfuture violence on college campuses is to have more guns on campuses.\n  Increasing the number of guns in university settings is likely to \nincrease the threat of violence. Every day at colleges across the \ncountry, young people engage in risky behaviors involving alcohol and \ndrugs. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \nbinge drinking and illegal drug use is highest among 18- to 24-year-\nolds. Furthermore, a report by the National Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University found that ``nearly half of \nAmerica's full-time college students abuse drugs or drink on binges at \nleast once a month.'' This behavior is dangerous enough without \nintroducing a weapon into the environment. Additional threats to public \nsafety stemming from firearms on campuses include the high risk of gun \nthefts in typically unsecure college living environments, as well as an \nincrease in the number of accidental shootings.\n  Students and faculty should feel safe while on campus. Contrary to \nthe claims of some, more guns on campus will not create a more secure \ncampus. More guns will increase the threat of violence, and that is why \nlegislation that would force universities to allow firearms on campus \nis misguided.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/23/senate-section/article/S693-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S693-S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Specialist Marc Decoteau\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor Army SPC \nMarc Paul Decoteau of Waterville Valley, NH, for his service and \nsupreme sacrifice for his country.\n  Specialist Decoteau demonstrated a willingness and dedication to \nserve and\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\ndefend his country by joining the U.S. Army. Just as many of America's \nheroes have taken up arms in the face of dire threats, Marc dedicated \nhimself to the defense of our ideals, values, freedoms, and way of \nlife. His valor and service cost him his life, but his sacrifice will \nhelp spare millions from lives under tyranny and oppression.\n  An exceptional student-athlete, Marc played an integral role in two \nPlymouth Regional High School State football championships and was also \na standout lacrosse player. Marc graduated from Plymouth High School in \nPlymouth, NH, in 2008 and, sensing a call to duty, enlisted in the Army \nshortly thereafter.\n  Tragically, on January 29, 2010, this brave 19-year-old gave his life \nfor this Nation while in support of combat operations in the Wardak \nProvince of Afghanistan. At the time of this hostile action, Specialist \nDecoteau, a member of the 6th Psychological Operations Battalion out of \nFort Bragg, NC, was serving his first tour in Afghanistan in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  A beloved member of the Waterville Valley community, Marc was \nrespected and admired by all those around him. As a loyal member of the \nU.S. Army, he continually performed above and beyond all expectations. \nSpecialist Decoteau will live on as a decorated hero and a patriot.\n  Marc was recognized for his service several times, receiving the \nNational Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with \nCampaign Star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service \nRibbon, and Parachutist Badge. He was also posthumously awarded the \nArmy Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, and NATO Medal.\n  My condolences and prayers go out to Marcs parents Mark and Nancy, \nhis brother Andrew and sister Maddie, and his family and friends. I \noffer them my deepest sympathies and most heartfelt thanks for their \nsacrifice. Marc exemplified the words of Daniel Webster who said, ``God \ngrants liberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to guard \nand defend it.'' Because of his efforts, the liberty of this country is \nmade more secure. God bless Marc Decoteau.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/23/senate-section/article/S694-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SELDON TECHNOLOGIES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues that March is National Eye Donor Month. In 1983, \nPresident Ronald Reagan announced, ``One of the most magnificent \npresents that one human being can bestow upon another is the gift of \nsight. Incredible as it may seem, it is within the power of each of us \nto give this precious gift simply by making arrangements to donate our \neyes after death.'' In less than 50 words, President Reagan expressed \nhow simple and incredible it is to give the gift of sight. He declared \nMarch as National Eye Donor Month, and today his words hold no less \nrelevance.\n  During National Eye Donor Month, we should take time to honor past \ndonors and their families for the tremendous gift of sight they have \ngiven. These gifts have helped to improve the lives of over 1 million \nrecipients since this procedure was introduced into America's health \ncare system. Throughout the United States today, more than 40,000 \ncorneal transplants take place yearly, over 750 each week. The Eye Bank \nAssociation of America was founded in 1961 and promulgates medical \nstandards for eye banks throughout the world. Its initial membership of \n25 member banks has grown to 85 banks in the United States and 15 \ninternational banks.\n  Corneal transplants can restore sight to people of all ages and all \nwalks of life, whether it be a newborn, an adult or an aging \ngrandparent. While success rates for corneal transplants have always \nbeen high, advancements in recent technology have increased success \nrates to over 95 percent. When the procedure was first performed, \npatients would spend upwards of 1 month in the hospital recovering from \nthe transplant. Today, it is an outpatient procedure.\n  Today, we possess the knowledge and technology to give the gift of \nsight to thousands of individuals through the generosity of eye \ndonation. Anyone can become an eye donor. Cataracts, poor eyesight or \nage do not prevent a person from being a donor. I encourage all \nAmericans to become eye donors. It is a very simple process. All you \nneed to do is sign up on your State's donor registry and talk to your \nfamily to ensure they understand that you wish to give the gift of \nsight.\n  Donated human eyes and corneal tissue are used for research, \neducation and transplantation. There is no substitute for human tissue \ndonation. Corneal transplants cannot take place without the priceless \ngift of corneal donation from one human to another. I encourage my \ncolleagues to work with their local eye banks to help raise awareness \nwithin your communities and throughout our country. I am honored to \nrecognize March as National Eye Donor Month today in the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/23/senate-section/article/S694-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S694-S695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GETTYSBURG COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Gettysburg Coin \nAct, which I was proud to introduce with Senator Specter. This \nlegislation commemorates one of the most significant events in our \nNation's history.\n  The Gettysburg Coin Act would produce a commemorative coin in 2013 \nrecognizing the 150th anniversary of the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg and \nPresident Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. The Battle of \nGettysburg\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nnot only marked a decisive moment in the American Civil War, but proved \nto be the turning point in our Nation's history. More Americans \nperished during the Battle of Gettysburg than in any other battle in \nAmerican history. It is with this understanding that we must, as \nPresident Abraham Lincoln so eloquently said in the Gettysburg Address, \n``highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain'' in \ndefending our Nation's freedom. This rings true today as our Nation's \nservicemen and women continue the long tradition of protecting our \nfreedom and values.\n  Today, I would also like to recognize the important work of the Army \nHeritage Center Foundation, which continues the proud tradition of \nprotecting and preserving our Nation's rich military history. Based in \nCarlisle, PA, the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center works with \nthe U.S. Army to preserve the memories of soldiers and their families, \nhonor their service, and help educate the American public about the \nArmy's contributions to our nation. The center's world class archives \nstore a collection of Army memorabilia and artifacts, so we can \nremember how life was lived and the repercussions of war. The Army \nHeritage Center Foundation's support for the 150th anniversary \ncommemorative coin is just another way they continue to fulfill their \nmission.\n  As a Pennsylvanian, I am proud of the role my State has played and \ncontinues to play in shaping our Nation's history. It is my hope that \nthese coins will commemorate a day of great national pride and remind \nus of the sacrifices that generations of American soldiers and their \nfamilies have made to safeguard this Nation. Therefore, I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to commemorate the \n150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/23/senate-section/article/S695-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n       RECOGNIZING THE TRANSPORTATION TRADES DEPARTMENT, AFL-CIO\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

The TTD \nis a leader in the effort to ensure that our transportation needs are \nfully met, and they work to remind us of the critical role that workers \nserve in this industry.\n  As chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation \nand a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I have \nfound TTD to be a trusted, valuable resource to help strengthen our \ninfrastructure and expand our skilled, well-trained workforce. We are \nworking together to address our ailing bridges and highways, improve \nour rail systems and ports, and modernize our air traffic control \nsystems.\n  I am proud to have worked with TTD to guard against those who would \nput safety, security, and service at risk. TTD and I have fought \nagainst risky privatization schemes for Amtrak and air traffic \ncontrollers and to rein in air carriers who seek out low-cost, poorly \nsupervised foreign repair facilities. There is absolutely no excuse for \ncutting corners on safety anywhere in the transportation industry.\n  Our work in transportation is far from done. With our economy mired \nin a recession and lingering unemployment crisis, we need to rebuild \nour infrastructure and put Americans back to work. We must do more to \nmodernize rail, transit, and ports, improve safety on our roads, and \ninvest in the technologies that will make air travel safer and more \nefficient. Transportation workers are a strong partner in these bold \nsteps, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with TTD in \npursuit of these shared goals.\n  Twenty years after its inception, the Transportation Trades \nDepartment, AFL-CIO, continues to be a leader in a more efficient, \nproductive, and connected nation.

Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to \nrecognize and congratulate Richard Basham on his retirement as football \ncoach of the Marquette University High School Hilltoppers.\n  Coach Basham led the Hilltoppers for 38 seasons. Throughout his \ntenure, the Hilltoppers had 4 undefeated seasons, 20 conference \nchampionships, and 9 state championships--including in Coach Basham's \nfinal season. With 340 career wins, Coach Basham has won more high \nschool football games than any other coach in Wisconsin State history.\n  In addition to Coach Basham's outstanding work on the football field, \nhe led students in the classroom as a math teacher and chair of the \nMarquette University High School Mathematics Department. He showed an \nenduring commitment to bettering the lives of his students and his \nplayers, cultivating their passion for success.\n  In a State that is proud to call Title Town and the great Vince \nLombardi its own, Richard Basham will be remembered as the leader of \nanother great football dynasty.

A bill to protect State and local witnesses from tampering \nand retaliation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to make it a Federal offense to intimidate or threaten a \nwitness in a State court proceeding.\n  This legislation I believe to be necessary based upon some very \ndisastrous experiences in the criminal courts in Philadelphia, as \nevidenced by a lengthy series of articles in the Philadelphia Inquirer \nand a field hearing which the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs \nheld in Philadelphia. What has occurred is that in many instances, \nwitnesses are intimidated--even murdered--to prevent them from \ntestifying.\n  The crime scenes in our big cities are atrocious. I spent eight years \nas the district attorney of Philadelphia. When I left that position, I \ndidn't think the crime problem could be worse, but regrettably it is \nnow, in many aspects. One of the aspects has been for the young thugs \nwho are under accusation or friends of those who are under charge to go \nto the witnesses and terrify them and even murder them. During the \ncourse of the field hearing, we had two parents testify about how their \nchildren were brutally murdered.\n  It is a violation of State law to intimidate a witness, but making it \na Federal offense imports a great deal more pressure, more power to the \nsituation. People do not like the Federal presence, the initiation of a \ncriminal case, the investigation by the FBI, and the treatment of the \nFederal courts is materially different--at least in Philadelphia--than \nit is in the State court proceedings.\n  I think this kind of legislation would be very salutary. If you don't \nhave the integrity of the judicial process protected, it is a very sad \nday in the administration of justice. I introduced this legislation on \nbehalf of Senator Schumer, Senator Klobuchar, and Senator Kaufman.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nstatement and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \n     introduce the State Witness Protection Act of 2010. I am \n     joined on this legislation by Senators Kaufman, Schumer and \n     Klobuchar as original cosponsors.\n       As reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer on December 14, \n     2009, ``[p]rosecutors, detectives, and even some defense \n     attorneys say witness fear has become an unspoken factor in \n     virtually every court case involving violent crime in \n     Philadelphia. Reluctant or terrified witnesses routinely fail \n     to appear in court, and when they do, they often recant their \n     earlier testimony or statement to police.''\n       One Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney is quoted in \n     the article saying that at least one witness in every murder \n     trial recants. As a result, Assistant District Attorneys \n     learn to ``lock in'' witness testimony early with signed \n     statements and testimony under oath, and are expert in cross-\n     examining witnesses who ``go south.'' At times, the \n     prosecutors are forced to lock up witnesses on material \n     witness warrants to assure their appearance at trial.\n       In Philadelphia between 2006 and 2008, the District \n     Attorney's Office filed witness intimidation charges against \n     approximately 1,000 individuals. Their conviction rate on \n     these charges, however, is only 28%.\n       Witness intimidation and violent crime are problems that I \n     have worked on for decades, since I was an Assistant District \n     Attorney and later District Attorney in Philadelphia, and on \n     the Judiciary Committee, where I have served since 1981 when \n     I was sworn in.\n       Criminal trials cannot proceed unless there are witnesses, \n     and if witnesses are subject to intimidation or even worse, \n     murdered, criminal cases cannot go forward. And unless \n     witnesses can be assured they will be protected, the problem \n     of witness intimidation cannot be expected to go away.\n       Philadelphia's witness intimidation problems are similar to \n     those faced by many communities in our country. A recent Op-\n     Ed in the Chicago Tribune stated that witnesses often want to \n     cooperate with police, but the risk of retribution is too \n     great. The article posed the following question ``What would \n     happen if we diminished the risk and created a greater sense \n     of assurance that the law would do its job in actually making \n     the streets safe as well as protecting those who decide to \n     turn killers in?''\n       On January 8, 2010, I chaired a field hearing in \n     Philadelphia for the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime \n     and Drugs on witness intimidation to explore how law \n     enforcement can better protect witnesses. Two parents--each \n     who lost a child to gun violence--testified. Barbara Clowden \n     told us that her son Eric Hayes, 17 years old, was killed \n     just two days before he was to testify in an arson trial in \n     Philadelphia. Because Eric's life had been threatened, in \n     January 2006 his family entered into the city's witness \n     relocation program. Eventually the money from the program ran \n     out and they had to relocate to Northeast Philadelphia where \n     Eric was murdered. No one to date has been convicted of \n     Eric's murder.\n       Ted Canada is a Philadelphia resident and SEPTA bus driver. \n     In 2005, his son Lamar Canada was shot 12 times and killed by \n     Dominick Peoples and another unidentified shooter in \n     Philadelphia over a gambling debt. One witness to the \n     shooting, Johnta Gravitt, 17 years old, was murdered 10 days \n     after he testified at the preliminary hearing and identified \n     Peoples as one of the shooters. Another witness initially \n     cooperated but after his statement to the police was publicly \n     posted in his neighborhood identifying him as a ``snitch,'' \n     he recanted. Peoples, nevertheless, was convicted.\n       The most notorious example of witness intimidation in \n     Philadelphia involves Kaboni Savage, a drug kingpin who was \n     federally indicted last April on racketeering and murder \n     charges for retaliating against his former drug associate, \n     Eugene Coleman. Coleman had agreed to testify against Savage \n     in a federal trial. The federal charges allege that to \n     retaliate for this, Savage orchestrated the firebombing of \n     Coleman's family home on the 3200 block of North 6th Street \n     in Philadelphia during the early morning hours of October 9, \n     2004. Killed in the fire were Coleman's mother, Marcella \n     Coleman (age 54); Coleman's infant son, Damir Jenkins (15 \n     months old); Marcella Coleman's niece, Tameka Nash (age 34), \n     and her daughter, Khadjah Nash (age 10); Marcella Coleman's \n     grandson, Tahj Porchea (age 12); and a family friend, Sean \n     Rodriguez (age 15). In a conversation secretly recorded by \n     court authorized wiretaps, Savage explained how witness \n     intimidation works, ``Without the witnesses, you don't have \n     no case . . . No witness, no crime.''\n       The witness intimidation problem is exacerbated by internet \n     sites, such as whosarat.com, which expose the identities of \n     witnesses and government informants. Gang members and \n     criminals are becoming more computer savvy. They use the \n     internet to find out who may be a cooperating witness by \n     accessing public court dockets. They also access other sites \n     to locate these individuals. With this information obtained \n     anonymously through the internet, gang members and other \n     criminals can easily threaten or harm witnesses, as well as \n     their family members.\n       It is imperative that we find a way to make people feel \n     safe if they step forward and provide information to law \n     enforcement. As Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. \n     Ramsey testified at the Subcommittee hearing, ``the only way \n     we're going to deal with crime in communities is when the \n     community steps forward, but they have to feel comfortable in \n     doing so and know they have support.''\n       To better protect state witnesses from witness tampering \n     and witness retaliation, I am introducing today The State \n     Witness Protection Act of 2010, a bill that ensures that \n     state witnesses will receive the same protections\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\n     from actions of intimidation and retaliation as federal \n     witnesses have under federal law. Making this a federal \n     offense and bringing in the FBI to investigate, as \n     Commissioner Ramsey testified, ``would make a tremendous \n     difference and make people think twice before they'' engaged \n     in witness intimidation He explained it this way--\n       I just think the whole environment or atmosphere when you \n     go into a Federal court versus a local court is just somewhat \n     different, and they [defendants] haven't been exposed to it \n     that often. I just think it has an impact in the feedback \n     I've gotten from people on both sides, whether it's another \n     law enforcement agency or from a person who's been in the \n     criminal justice system. They do not want to go into Federal \n     court. (Tr. At 16).\n       The bill, which tracks the language of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1512 and 1513, provides the same penalties as now \n     provided in federal court for witness tampering in state \n     court proceedings. For state court proceedings, the bill \n     makes it a federal offense to kill, physically harm, threaten \n     to physically harm, harass, or intimidate, or offer anything \n     of value to, a state court witness or victim if done--\n       with the intent to influence another person's testimony;\n       with the intent to induce another to withhold testimony or \n     records, alter or destroy evidence, evade legal process, or \n     be absent from a state proceeding if that person has been \n     summoned by legal process;\n       with the intent to hinder or prevent a person from \n     providing information to law enforcement; or\n       with the intent to retaliate against anyone for being a \n     witness or providing testimony or information to law \n     enforcement.\n       Federal jurisdiction is established by prosecuting only \n     cases where there are communications in furtherance of the \n     offense by mail, interstate or foreign commerce by any means, \n     including computer, interstate or foreign travel in \n     furtherance of the commission of the offense, or the use of \n     weapons which have been shipped or transported across state \n     lines. Any attempt or conspiracy to commit these same \n     offenses is also illegal and subject to the same penalties. \n     And finally, the bill provides for specific guideline \n     enhancements for all obstruction offenses.\n       The message must be sent loud and clear that serious \n     penalties will be imposed on those who dare to attempt to \n     obstruct justice in our country. The ``State Witness \n     Protection Act of 2010'' is a strong means of delivering that \n     necessary message.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 3017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Help Find the \nMissing Act, otherwise known as Billy's Law, which I am introducing \ntoday along with my colleagues, Senators Schumer, Gillibrand and \nMerkley.\n  I was introduced to the issues Billy's Law addresses by two of my \nconstituents, Jan and Bill Smolinski, who have lived through a parent's \nworst nightmare: the disappearance of their son.\n  On the afternoon of August 24, 2004, then-31-year-old Billy Smolinski \ndisappeared without a trace. He left behind a dog he loved and his \nbrandnew house; a truck with his keys and wallet still inside; and \nparents who have spent every day since searching for him and praying \nfor his return. One moment he was there, asking his neighbors to look \nafter his dog for a few days, and the next he was gone without \nexplanation.\n  Jan and Bill Smolinski have spent countless hours working with law \nenforcement to try to find Billy. Through that experience, they \ndiscovered that we do a poor job managing data about missing adults. \nThe bill we are introducing today will help correct those shortcomings \nso that families in similar situations can focus only on their missing \nloved ones and not have to worry that their agony will be prolonged \nsimply because we fail to keep track of--and share--critical \nidentifying data.\n  Billy's Law does three things: It facilitates the sharing of data \nabout missing people between agencies; it requires law enforcement to \ncompile and track missing persons data that is not currently being \ncollected consistently; and it provides funding to improve, monitor, \nand maintain that data.\n  It is my hope that no parent will ever have to experience what Jan \nand Bill Smolinski are going through, and, as a parent, my heart truly \ngoes out to them. Passing Billy's Law will help give families of \nmissing adults confidence that we are doing everything we can to \ncarefully track the information necessary to locate their loved ones.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Bond, and Mr. \n        Merkley):\n  S. 3020. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to reform and improve the HUBZone program for small \nbusiness concerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Landrieu, \nBond, and Merkley to introduce the Historically Underutilized Business \nZone, HUBZone, Improvement Act of 2010. This vital piece of bipartisan \nlegislation is similar to that which I introduced in the 110th \nCongress, S. 3699. The purpose of the bill is to help ensure that only \neligible firms participate in the critical HUBZone program by requiring \nthat the Small Business Administration, SBA, implement Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, recommendations for improving the \nmanagement, oversight and evaluation of the program.\n  As former Chair and now Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have long championed critical \nsmall business programs such as the HUBZone program, which provides \nFederal contracting opportunities to small firms located in \neconomically distressed areas.\n  The program is devised to help stimulate economic development and job \ncreation. In these troubled economic times, a properly functioning \nHUBZone program is essential for nation-wide economic recovery. \nAccording to the SBA, as of October 2009, 21,222 certified businesses \nhave participated in the HUBZone program since its inception in 1997. \nIn fiscal year 2008, HUBZone firms were awarded approximately $10.1 \nbillion in Federal contracts. And let there be no doubt--with the \nFederal Government contracting for over $500 billion in goods and \nservices in fiscal year 2009 alone--we must have a robust and \ntrustworthy HUBZone program for small businesses to continue generating \njobs in our nation's most economically distressed communities.\n  The GAO has issued multiple reports detailing fraud and abuses within \nthe HUBZone program. Alarmingly, the GAO found that the mechanisms the \nSBA uses to certify and monitor HUBZone firms provide limited assurance \nthat only eligible firms participate in the program. The GAO \nspecifically stated that the ``SBA's control weaknesses exposed the \ngovernment to fraud and abuse.'' The GAO also had concerns that the SBA \nhad no mechanisms to adequately assess program results.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would take immediate steps to \nrectify the serious issues that GAO found. The bill requires the SBA to \nimplement the GAO recommendations resulting from the study and audits. \nThese include maintaining an accurate, correct and up-to-date map; \nimplementing policies that ensure that only eligible firms participate \nin the program; employing appropriate technology to control costs and \nmaximize other benefits, such as uniformity, completeness, \nsimplification and efficiency; notifying the Congressional Small \nBusiness Committees of any backlogs in applications and \nrecertifications with plans and timetables for eliminating the \nbacklogs; and implementing plans to assess the effectiveness of the \nHUBZone program.\n  Moreover, the Federal Government must strive to continue to provide \nmaximum practicable contracting opportunities to those who are \nlegitimate HUBZone firms. I am dismayed by the myriad ways that \ngovernment departments and agencies have time and again egregiously \nfailed to meet most of their statutory small business contracting \ngoals. I am alarmed that only one Federal small business contracting \nprogram--the Small Disadvantaged Business program--has met its \nstatutory goal, and that the three other small business goaling \nprograms have all fallen drastically short. In fiscal year 2008, the \nFederal Government met only 2.34 percent of its 3 percent government-\nwide goal for the HUBZone program. Even worse, the Federal Government \nmissed meeting its overall goal for small business contracting by \nalmost 2 percent, depriving small businesses of over $10 billion.\n  I am confident that this legislation will require the changes \nnecessary to eliminate fraud while paving the way for the Federal \nGovernment to maximize the use of this contracting vehicle. In turn, \nqualified HUBZone firms will provide the essential job creation and \neconomic development necessary in their respective communities. The \nHUBZone program is a tremendous tool for replacing lost jobs across all \nindustry sectors in distressed geographic areas, and clearly, this \nprogram should be better utilized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3020\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reform and \n     improve the HUBZone program of the Administration.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the HUBZone program was established under the HUBZone \n     Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-135; 111 Stat. 2627) to stimulate \n     economic development through increased employment and capital \n     investment by providing Federal contracting preferences to \n     small business concerns in those areas, including inner \n     cities and rural counties, that have low household incomes, \n     high unemployment, and suffered from a lack of investment; \n     and\n       (2) according to the Government Accountability Office, the \n     weakness in the oversight\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n     of the HUBZone program by the Administration has exposed the \n     Government to fraud and abuse.\n\n     SEC. 4. HUBZONE IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       The Administrator shall--\n       (1) ensure the HUBZone map--\n       (A) is accurate and up-to date; and\n       (B) revised as new data is made available to maintain the \n     accuracy and currency of the HUBZone map;\n       (2) implement policies for ensuring that only HUBZone small \n     business concerns determined to be qualified under section \n     3(p)(5) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)(5)) are \n     participating in the HUBZone program, including through the \n     appropriate use of technology to control costs and maximize, \n     among other benefits, uniformity, completeness, simplicity, \n     and efficiency;\n       (3) submit to the Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee on Small \n     Business of the House of Representatives a report regarding \n     any application to be designated as a HUBZone small business \n     concern or for recertification for which the Administrator \n     has not made a determination as of the date that is 60 days \n     after the date on which the application was submitted or \n     initiated, which shall include a plan and timetable for \n     ensuring the timely processing of the applications; and\n       (4) develop measures and implement plans to assess the \n     effectiveness of the HUBZone program that--\n       (A) require the identification of a baseline point in time \n     to allow the assessment of economic development under the \n     HUBZone program, including creating additional jobs; and\n       (B) take into account--\n       (i) the economic characteristics of the HUBZone; and\n       (ii) contracts being counted under multiple socioeconomic \n     subcategories.\n\n     SEC. 5. EMPLOYMENT PERCENTAGE.\n\n       Section 3(p) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (5), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(E) Employment percentage during interim period.--\n       ``(i) Definition.--In this subparagraph, the term `interim \n     period' means the period beginning on the date on which the \n     Administrator determines that a HUBZone small business \n     concern is qualified under subparagraph (A) and ending on the \n     day before the date on which a contract under the HUBZone \n     program for which the HUBZone small business concern submits \n     a bid is awarded.\n       ``(ii) Interim period.--During the interim period, the \n     Administrator may not determine that the HUBZone small \n     business is not qualified under subparagraph (A) based on a \n     failure to meet the applicable employment percentage under \n     subparagraph (A)(i)(I), unless the HUBZone small business \n     concern--\n\n       ``(I) has not attempted to maintain the applicable \n     employment percentage under subparagraph (A)(i)(I); or\n       ``(II) does not meet the applicable employment percentage--\n\n       ``(aa) on the date on which the HUBZone small business \n     concern submits a bid for a contract under the HUBZone \n     program; or\n       ``(bb) on the date on which the HUBZone small business \n     concern is awarded a contract under the HUBZone program.''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) Hubzone program.--The term `HUBZone program' means \n     the program established under section 31.\n       ``(9) Hubzone map.--The term `HUBZone map' means the map \n     used by the Administration to identify HUBZones.''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \nof 1978 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to promulgate regulations \nto allow electric utilities to use renewable energy to comply with any \nFederal renewable electricity standard, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Support \nRenewable Energy Act of 2010 with my colleague, Senator Ensign. This \nbill would modify the Renewable Electricity Standard currently drafted \nin the American Clean Energy Leadership Act to ensure that all forms of \nrenewable energy qualify.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is again considering the implementation \nof a Renewable Electricity Standard that will encourage the development \nand deployment of new and existing renewable energy technologies. \nHowever, as the proposed Renewable Electricity Standard is currently \ndrafted, only electricity-producing renewable technologies would \nqualify. This would exclude direct use renewable energy technologies \nthat displace the need for electricity, rather than produce \nelectricity.\n  Our legislation would modify the definition of renewable energy as it \napplies to the draft Renewable Electricity Standard to include \ncustomer-sited renewable energy equipment. Specific examples of these \ndirect use technologies are solar water heating, solar space heating \nand cooling, solar daylight and light-pipe technology, biogas, and \nground source geothermal heat pumps. These technologies can be used in \nhomes and businesses to provide light, heating, and cooling directly--\nwithout the need for electricity from the grid. This legislation will \nallow utilities to generate renewable energy credits equal to the \nelectricity or thermal energy displaced by direct use renewable energy \ntechnologies in order to meet a Renewable Electricity Standard.\n  In addition to the reduced stress on our overburdened electricity \ntransmission grid, the incentivized production and installation of \nthese renewable technologies would spur the growth of green, \nsustainable jobs. One example of the potential for job creation was \nprovided to me by Orion Energy Systems in my home State of Wisconsin. \nOrion manufactures light-pipes, which captures natural light on a roof \nand transfers that light through a pipe to a ceiling, where it is \ndiffused to light a room, like a traditional light bulb. Because light \npipes uses solar energy directly to produce light, rather than generate \nelectricity, this innovative technology would not qualify as renewable \nenergy under the draft Renewable Electricity Standard.\n  Orion has already retrofitted approximately 5,000 facilities with \nimproved lighting technology nationwide. With about 400 lighting \nfixtures on average, if these same facilities decided to upgrade to the \nlight-pipe technology it would take between 6 million and 10 million \nman-hours to install. These would be jobs for roofers and carpenters at \na time when the construction industry is badly in need of work.\n  Direct use renewable energy technologies have significant \nenvironmental benefits. The energy savings from retrofitting these \nfacilities with the light-pipe would amount to a savings of between 915 \nand 1,934 gigawatts of electricity per year, which amounts to the \nenergy equivalent of 343 to 725 million tons of coal that would not \nhave to be burned, avoiding the release of between 0.6 and 1.28 million \ntons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. In addition, the \nusers of this technology will save money on their electric bill, which \ncould then be used for other things, like hiring new employees or \nincreasing salaries.\n  This is just one company and one of the many technologies that would \nqualify for the expanded Renewable Electricity Standard under our \nlegislation. This is clearly a win-win-win situation for jobs, the \nfacilities that install the technologies and save on energy costs, and \nfor the environment.\n  Direct use renewable energy technology is cost-effective, can be \ndeployed locally, requires no new transmission infrastructure, and can \nbe utilized in areas throughout the country that cannot sustain a \ncommercial-scale power generation facility from other renewable energy \nsources. Furthermore, it will create much needed American jobs in both \nmanufacturing and construction. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthe Support Renewable Energy Act of 2010.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Bayh, Mr. Graham, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Thune, Mr. Casey, \n        Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \n        Brownback, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 3022. A bill to impose sanctions on persons who are complicit in \nhuman rights abuses committed against citizens of Iran or their family \nmembers after the June 12, 2009, elections in Iran, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, February 11, 2010, was the 31st \nanniversary of the Islamic Republic of Iran. For most Iranians, the \nIslamic Republic is the only government they have ever known, and \nunfortunately, it is a record that many would rather forget--\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n31 years of economic potential lost and the resources of a great and \nproud nation stolen by a corrupt ruling elite; 31 years of a regime \nthat puts its own selfish interests and those of foreign terrorist \ngroups ahead of the needs of the Iranian people; 31 years of justice \ndenied, freedom curtailed, and dignity trampled.\n  In recent months, the world has watched in awe as hundreds of \nthousands of Iranians have said ``enough,'' and demanded better for \nthemselves. They have taken to the streets and the Internet, risking \nthe violent reprisal of a regime without conscience, in order to insist \non their universal human rights. In television news clips and YouTube \nvideos, in Twitter updates and countless online exchanges, the world \nhas seen the naked oppression of the Iranian regime and its masked \nagents.\n  We have watched as peaceful Iranian demonstrators for human rights \nhave been beaten, and shot--even murdered--in the streets of cities \nacross Iran.\n  We have watched as Iranian men and women--many not more than young \nboys and girls--have been rounded up in their homes and dormitories, \nand hauled away unlawfully to face torture and other abuses in the \ndarkest corners of the country, where the eyes of the international \ncommunity struggle to see.\n  Just a few months ago, we watched as a young woman named Neda was \nshot in broad daylight by agents of the Iranian government. And as that \nyoung woman bled to death in the street, it became clear to me and many \nothers that this was the beginning of the end of the Islamic Republic. \nAfter 31 years, that day cannot come soon enough, but how and when it \ndoes is up to the Iranian people.\n  This struggle continues in Iran. On February 11, many Iranians took \nto the streets again to demonstrate peacefully for freedom and justice. \nAgain, many were beaten. Again, many were detained unlawfully. Again, \nmany were no doubt tortured--and worse. The world has watched these \nabuses long enough. Now the world must act. It is long past time for \ndemocratic, law-abiding nations to stand up together, to speak with one \nvoice, and to show these courageous Iranian human rights advocates that \nthe free world is on their side. The recent statement between the U.S. \nand the European Union supporting human rights in Iran is a welcome \ndevelopment, and I hope to see more and more such joint actions.\n  It is also long past time for the U.N. Security Council to impose the \ncrippling sanctions on the Iranian government that have been promised \nfor so long. As that negotiation drags on, individual countries should \nnot refrain from taking their own individual actions to impose pressure \non the rulers of Iran for failing to abide by their own international \nagreements, both security agreements and human rights agreements. In \nthat vein, I was pleased to see the White House recently announce a new \nset of sanctions against four Iranian entities and one individual \nactive in Iran's nuclear program. I hope there is a lot more where that \ncame from.\n  I do not wish, however, to confine our sanctions effort only to those \npersons in Iran who threaten our security and that of our allies, \neither through their support for terrorism or Iran's weapons programs. \nI also want to bring the full force of America's economic power to bear \nagainst those in Iran who threaten that country's peaceful human rights \nand democracy activists. That is why, just a few weeks ago, I sought to \nintroduce an amendment to the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \nAccountability, and Divestment Act, which would impose targeted \nsanctions on persons in Iran who violate the human rights of their \nfellow citizens.\n  Building on that earlier effort, today I am introducing, together \nwith my good friend and colleague Senator Joe Lieberman, the Iran Human \nRights Sanctions Act, which is co-sponsored by a broad bipartisan group \nof U.S. Senators.\n  This bill has two parts.\n  First, it would require the President to compile a public list of \nindividuals in Iran who, starting with the presidential election last \nJune, are complicit in human rights violations against Iranian citizens \nand their families, no matter where in the world those abuses occur. I \nwant to stress: This would be a public list, posted for all the world \nto see on the websites of the State and Treasury Departments. We will \nshine a light on the names of Iran's human rights abusers, and we will \nmake them famous for their crimes.\n  Second, this bill would then ban these Iranian individuals from \nreceiving U.S. visas, and impose on them the full battery of sanctions \nunder the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. That means, \nfreezing any assets and blocking any property they hold under U.S. \njurisdiction, and ending all their financial transactions with U.S. \nbanks and other entities. If passed into law, this would be the first \ntime the U.S. Government has ever imposed punitive measures against \npersons in Iran because of their human rights violations.\n  In short, under this bill, Iranian human rights abusers would be \ncompletely cut off from the global reach of the U.S. financial system, \nand that would send a powerful signal to every country, company, and \nbank in the world that they should think twice about doing business \nwith the oppressors of the Iranian people.\n  Over the past year, the President has made every effort to extend a \nhand to the Iranian government--to seek to overcome 31 years of painful \nhistory, and to search for common ground on matters of common interest. \nUnfortunately, the President's generosity has been met defiantly, again \nand again, with the clenched fist of Iran's rulers--a fist that is \nincreasingly stained with the blood of the Iranian people. It should \nnow be clear that the Iranian regime has no desire to meet its \ninternational responsibilities and every desire to use all the tools of \nviolence and repression at its disposal to crush the peaceful \naspirations of Iran's citizens.\n  Faced with this disturbing reality, America must lead an \ninternational effort to support the human rights of the Iranian people, \nand to put that effort at the center of our policy toward Iran. We must \nencourage our international partners, especially our European allies, \nto do the same, and to impose their own targeted sanctions on Iran's \nhuman rights abusers. This is not about picking winners in an internal \nIranian matter. It is about standing up for the universal values we \nhold dear, and championing the cause of all who seek to secure those \nvalues for themselves.\n  The Iran Human Rights Sanctions Act is an important start of this \neffort, and I encourage my colleagues in Congress to move quickly and \npass it into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 3024. A bill to ensure that the creation of jobs by small \nbusinesses is considered during the Federal legislative and rulemaking \nprocess, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague Senator \nPryor, to introduce the Job Impact Analysis Act of 2010, a bipartisan \nmeasure that will help ensure that the Federal Government--both \nCongress and agencies of the executive branch--fully considers small \nbusiness job creation in the bills we pass here in Congress and in the \nrules and regulations that agencies promulgate.\n  As the former Chair and now Ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I believe there is no more urgent \nimperative than job creation in our country. With 25,000 additional \nunemployed in my State of Maine alone, since the recession began in \n2007, and twenty-three million Americans unemployed or underemployed, \nit is more paramount than ever that everything we do must focus like a \nlaser on jumpstarting our economy. Furthermore, the fastest route to \nrecovery runs through Main Street small businesses, which over the past \n15 years have generated 64 percent of all net new jobs in this country, \nand so we must foster an entrepreneurial environment where small \nbusinesses can take risks and invest in the future to preserve and \ncreate more jobs.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would help make sure that in \nwhatever measure we are debating--whether it be health care reform, a \njobs\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nbill, or financial services overhaul--that we strive to discern whether \nit contributes to creating a climate in which our smallest enterprises \nand entrepreneurs cannot only survive, but thrive. It would amend the \nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to direct the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, to the extent practicable, to \nestimate in a ``job impact statement'' the potential job creation or \njob loss attributable to each bill or joint resolution reported by a \ncongressional committee that exceeds $5 billion in costs. For years we \nhave had environmental impact statements, and so in 2010, I do not \nthink it is too much to ask, where are the job impact statements?\n  As our Nation continues to reel from the worst set of economic \ncircumstances since World War II, Congress must focus on job creation, \nand we must begin by ensuring all economic factors--including potential \nsmall business job creation and job loss--are fully considered in \ndebate of every bill that we consider in the Senate. It is clear that \nWashington has ignored the will of the people for far too long. At a \ntime when the Nation is struggling to dig out of the deepest recession \nsince the Great Depression, we must ensure that our country once again \nbrings to bear the kind of ingenuity, creativity, and innovation that \nmade America and our free-market economy the greatest and most powerful \non earth. I believe that a job impact statement attached to every bill \nwith costs over $5 billion would provide a powerful incentive for \nCongress to focus its efforts where they belong and help Congress focus \non what matters to the American people these days--job creation.\n  In addition, onerous regulations are crushing the entrepreneurial \nspirit of America's small businesses. In 2009, there were close to \n70,000 pages in the Federal Register, which chronicles new regulations \nby the government. Furthermore, according to research by the Small \nBusiness Administration's, SBA's, Office of Advocacy, the annual cost \nof Federal regulations totals $1.1 trillion, and small firms bear a \ndisproportionate burden, paying approximately 45 percent more per \nemployee in annual regulatory compliance costs than larger firms. Small \nfirms also spend twice as much on tax compliance than their larger \ncounterparts.\n  So our legislation includes several targeted regulatory reforms that \nwould help to ensure that Federal agencies fully consider small \nbusiness implications during the rulemaking process. The reforms in our \nbill are based on what we introduced in the Regulatory Flexibility \nReform Act in the 109th Congress and the Independent Office of Advocacy \nand Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 2008, from the 110th \nCongress. Most of these reforms have been supported by a host of small \nbusiness stakeholders, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the National Small \nBusiness Association, the National Association for the Self-Employed, \nWomen Impacting Public Policy, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, \nSmall Business Legislative Council, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  Our measure would amend the Regulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, the \nseminal legislation, enacted in 1980, which requires agencies to \nconsider the impact of their regulatory proposals on small businesses, \nto analyze effective alternatives that minimize small business impact, \nand to make their analyses available for public comment. The RFA \nrequires federal agencies to conduct a small business analysis any time \na proposed Federal rule would impose a ``significant impact on a \nsubstantial number of small businesses.'' Unfortunately, there remain a \nnumber of loopholes in the RFA that undermine its effectiveness in \nreducing these regulatory burdens.\n  Our legislation would close loopholes in this process, while also \nensuring that Federal agencies consider potential job creation and job \nloss during the rulemaking process. In far too many cases, Federal \nagencies promulgate rules and regulations without adequately addressing \nthe economic impact on small businesses. Under our legislation agencies \nmust consider the ``indirect'' effects of an ``economic impact.'' Rules \nwith indirect effects are currently exempt from RFA coverage according \nto well-established case law. This has serious consequences for small \nbusinesses. It means that Federal agencies can avoid the various \nanalyses required under the RFA by either requiring the states to \nregulate small entities or regulating an industry so rigorously that it \nhas a negative trickle down impact on other industries. For example, \nrules can regulate a handful of large manufacturers in the same \nindustry. Yet, a foreseeable, indirect effect of these rules--not \npresently considered under RFA analyses--is that small distributors \nwould no longer have the right to sell the product produced by the \nlarger manufacturers.\n  The RFA has already saved billions of dollars for small businesses by \nforcing government regulators to be sensitive to their direct impact on \nsmall firms. If billions of dollars can be filtered out of direct \nregulatory mandates upon small business while improving workplace \nsafety and environmental conditions, even more can be saved by \nfiltering out unnecessary or duplicative costs to those small \nbusinesses indirectly impacted by regulation. Those dollars would be \nbetter spent by the businesses hiring more employees or providing \nexisting employees with greater benefits, and would also help to \nprevent unintended job loss through regulatory requirements.\n  Our legislation also requires Federal agencies to consider comments \nprovided by the SBA's Office of Advocacy, which has historically not \nreceived the public attention it deserves. In case after case, it has \nbeen the last, best hope for small businesses faced with burdensome, \nduplicative and nonsensical Federal regulations. Our legislation would \nalso amend the RFA to include a provision for agencies to specifically \nrespond to comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy. Codifying \nthis necessary change would ensure that agencies give the proper \ndeference to the Office of Advocacy, and to the comments and concerns \nof small businesses. This is a straightforward and simple reform that \ncould have major benefits.\n  In addition, our measure would also clarify the circumstances for \nwhen ``periodic review'' under the RFA is required. Many questions have \narisen as a result of ambiguous language in the RFA that has caused \nsome confusion as to what rules require periodic review, and when. \nUnder our bill, periodic review, with a focus on potential job creation \nor job loss, would be required for all final rules that would impose a \nsignificant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. \nAgencies would be required to review all 10-year-old rules every year \nto avoid confusion over which rules to review. In addition, agencies \nwould be required to review rules every 10 years and not just the first \n10 years.\n  Finally, our bill would ensure the statutory and budgetary \nindependence of the SBA Office of Advocacy, a key office that is \nintended to be the independent voice for small business within the \nFederal Government. It is charged with the duty of representing the \nviews and interests of small businesses before other Federal agencies, \nand developing proposals for changing government policies to help small \nbusinesses. These roles can sometimes come into conflict.\n  Our bill would resolve such conflicts in favor of the small \nbusinesses that rely on the Chief Counsel and the Office of Advocacy to \nbe a fully independent advocate within the Executive Branch. The bill \nwould help to reinforce a clear mandate that the Office of Advocacy \nmust fight on behalf of small businesses, regardless of the position \ntaken on critical issues by the administration. Funding for the Office \nof Advocacy currently comes from the ``Salaries and Expense Account'' \nof the SBA's budget. Staffing is allocated by the SBA Administrator to \nthe Office of Advocacy from the overall staff allocation for the \nAgency. In 1990, there were 70 full-time employees working on behalf of \nsmall businesses in the Office of Advocacy. Today, there are fewer than \n50. The independence and effectiveness of the Office is potentially \ndiminished when the Office of Advocacy staff is reduced, at the \ndiscretion of the administrator.\n  To address this problem, our legislation would build a firewall to \nminimize political intrusion into the management of day-to-day \noperations of the\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\nOffice of Advocacy similar to the one that protects Inspectors General \nin other agencies. The bill would require the Federal budget to include \na separate account for the Office of Advocacy drawn directly from the \nGeneral Fund of the Treasury. No longer would its funds come from the \ngeneral operating account of the SBA. This will free the Chief Counsel \nfor Advocacy from having to seek approval from the SBA Administrator to \nhire staff for the Office of Advocacy.\n  Our bill would leave unchanged current law that allows the Chief \nCounsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of \nAdvocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures \ndirected by Federal law and the Office of Personnel Management. This \nlong-standing special hiring authority, which is limited only to \nemployees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it \nallows the Chief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best \nassist the Office in responding to changing issues and problems \nconfronting small businesses.\n  This non-controversial, bipartisan legislation is absolutely \nnecessary. I urge my colleagues to support my bill so we can ensure \nthat our Nation's small businesses and their employees are provided \nwith much needed relief.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3024\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Job Impact \n     Analysis Act of 2010''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Job impact statement for reported bills and joint resolutions.\nSec. 4.

Office of Advocacy.\nSec. 8. Clerical amendments.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,100,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 45 \n     percent, or $7,647, more per employee than larger firms in \n     annual regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) The Federal Government should fully consider the costs, \n     including indirect economic impacts and the potential for job \n     creation and job loss, of proposed rules.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     creation or job loss.\n       (8) To the maximum extent practicable, the Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office should, in certain estimates the \n     Director prepares with respect to bills or joint resolutions \n     reported by congressional committees, estimate the potential \n     job creation or job loss attributable to the bills or joint \n     resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 3. JOB IMPACT STATEMENT FOR REPORTED BILLS AND JOINT \n                   RESOLUTIONS.\n\n       Section 424 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \n     Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 658c) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) if the Director estimates that the total amount of \n     direct costs of all Federal intergovernmental mandates in the \n     bill or joint resolution will equal or exceed $5,000,000,000 \n     (adjusted annually for inflation), to the extent practicable, \n     the potential job creation or job loss in State, local, and \n     tribal governments as a result of the mandates.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) if the Director estimates that the total amount of \n     direct costs of all Federal private sector mandates in the \n     bill or joint resolution will equal or exceed $5,000,000,000 \n     (adjusted annually for inflation), to the extent practicable, \n     the potential job creation or job loss in the private sector \n     as a result of the mandates.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nprovide assistance for programs and activities to protect and restore \nthe water quality of the Columbia River Basin, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3025\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Columbia River Restoration \n     Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific \n     Northwest and the fourth largest river in the United States \n     by volume. The river is 1,243 miles long, and its drainage \n     basin includes 259,000 square miles, extending into 7 States \n     and British Columbia, Canada, and including all or part of 5 \n     national parks,\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\n     the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, and the Hells \n     Canyon National Recreation Area.\n       (2) The Columbia River Basin and its tributaries provide \n     significant ecological and economic benefits to the Pacific \n     Northwest and the entire United States. Traditionally, the \n     Columbia River Basin and its tributaries were the largest \n     salmon producing river system in the world, with annual \n     returns peaking at as many as 30 million fish. The Columbia \n     River drainage basin includes more than 6 million acres of \n     irrigated agricultural land, and its 14 hydroelectric dams, \n     combined with additional dams on its tributaries, produce \n     more hydroelectric power than any other North American river.\n       (3) The Lower Columbia River Estuary stretches 146 miles \n     from the Bonneville Dam to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean, \n     and much of this area is degraded. Polychlorinated biphenyls \n     (PCBs) in salmon tissue and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \n     (PAHs) in salmon prey exceed estimated thresholds for delayed \n     mortality, increased disease susceptibility, and reduced \n     growth. Legacy contaminants (DDT and PCBs) banned in the \n     1970s are still detected in river water, sediments, and \n     juvenile Chinook salmon. Several pesticides have been \n     detected, including atrazine and simazine, which can affect \n     salmon behavior or act as hormone disruptors. Emerging \n     contaminants, such as hormone disruptors from pharmaceutical \n     and personal care products, have been found in river water \n     and juvenile male salmon. These contaminants may impair \n     salmon growth, health, and reproduction.\n       (4) The Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin includes \n     1,050 miles of the mainstem Columbia River upstream of the \n     Bonneville Dam, including the 1,040 miles of its largest \n     tributary, the Snake River, and all of the tributaries to \n     both rivers. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) \n     Columbia River Basin Fish Contaminant Survey detected the \n     presence of 92 priority pollutants, including PCBs, dioxins, \n     furans, arsenic, mercury, and DDE (a breakdown product of \n     DDT), in fish that are consumed by the Confederated Tribes of \n     the Warm Springs, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the \n     Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian \n     Reservation, and the Nez Perce Tribe, as well as by other \n     people consuming fish throughout the Columbia River Basin. A \n     fish consumption survey by the Columbia River Intertribal \n     Fish Commission showed that tribal members were eating 6 to \n     11 times more fish than EPA's estimated national average. The \n     nuclear and toxic contamination at the Hanford Nuclear \n     Reservation presents an ongoing risk of contamination in the \n     Middle Columbia Basin. Sampling of sediments by the EPA in \n     2004 documented widespread presence of toxic flame retardants \n     known as polyrominated diphenyl ethers.\n       (5) Contamination of the Middle and Upper Columbia River \n     Basin has a direct impact on water quality and habitat \n     quality in the Lower Columbia River Estuary. Investments in \n     habitat restoration and toxics reduction in the Middle and \n     Upper Columbia River Basin can have significant benefits for \n     fish and wildlife throughout the entire basin.\n       (6) Together with the Governors of Oregon and Washington, \n     the EPA created the Lower Columbia River Estuary Partnership \n     (Estuary Partnership) in 1995 to provide regional \n     coordination to focus on the lower river, to advance the \n     science of the ecosystem, and to deliver environmental \n     results. The Estuary Partnership was formed within the \n     National Estuary Program and provides a structure for \n     organization and collaboration to implement Federal \n     priorities. The Estuary Partnership includes all key Federal \n     agencies as part of its management and governing structure, \n     including the EPA, the United States Geological Survey \n     (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     (NOAA), the Army Corps of Engineers, the Forest Service, and \n     tribal, State, and local governments.\n       (7) The Columbia River Basin was designated by the EPA as \n     an ``Estuary of National Significance'' in 1995 and a ``Large \n     Aquatic Ecosystem'' in 2006.\n       (8) The Estuary Partnership has developed an unparalleled \n     2-State, public and private partnership, including \n     unprecedented collaborative efforts among key Federal \n     partners, including the EPA, the NOAA, the USGS, and the Army \n     Corps of Engineers to advance Federal goals, and the Estuary \n     Partnership and its partners have gathered scientific \n     information and compiled data, and have made significant \n     gains in habitat protection and environmental education.\n       (9) Despite these advances, further degradation exists and \n     contaminants persist in the Columbia River Basin and are \n     impairing the health of fish, wildlife, and humans.

Res. 419\n\n       Whereas ``National Guard Youth Challenge Day'' will be \n     celebrated on February 24, 2010;\n       Whereas high school dropouts need guidance, encouragement, \n     and avenues toward self-sufficiency and success;\n       Whereas over 1,300,000 students drop out of high school \n     each year, costing this Nation more than $335,000,000,000 in \n     lost wages, revenues, and productivity over the lifetimes of \n     these individuals;\n       Whereas the life expectancy for a high school dropout is 9 \n     years less than that of a high school graduate, and a high \n     school dropout can expect to earn about $19,000 each year, \n     compared to approximately $28,000 for a high school graduate;\n       Whereas 54 percent of high school dropouts were jobless \n     during an average month in 2008, with 40 percent having no \n     job for the entire year;\n       Whereas each annual class of high school dropouts cost this \n     Nation over $17,000,000,000 in publicly subsidized health \n     care over the course of their lives;\n       Whereas approximately 90 percent of individuals in prisons \n     throughout the United States are high school dropouts;\n       Whereas the goal of the National Guard Youth Foundation, a \n     non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, is to improve the \n     education, life skills, and employment potential of high \n     school dropouts in the United States through public \n     awareness, scholarships, higher education assistance, and job \n     development programs;\n       Whereas the National Guard Youth Challenge Program provides \n     military-based training, supervised work experience, \n     assistance in obtaining a high school diploma or equivalent \n     degree, and development of leadership qualities, as well as \n     promotion of citizenship, fellowship, service to their \n     community, life skills training, health and physical \n     education, positive relationships with adults and peers, and \n     career planning;\n       Whereas the National Guard Youth Challenge Program \n     represents a successful joint effort between States and the \n     Federal Government;\n       Whereas since 1993, the National Guard Youth Challenge \n     Program has developed 32 programs in 27 States and Puerto \n     Rico;\n       Whereas since 1993, over 92,850 young individuals have \n     successfully graduated from the program, with 80 percent \n     earning their high school diploma or GED certificate, 24 \n     percent going to college, 18 percent joining the military, \n     and 57 percent entering the workforce with career jobs;\n       Whereas the National Guard Youth Challenge Program has \n     successfully helped high school dropouts in this Nation; and\n       Whereas the National Guard Youth Challenge Program can play \n     a larger role in providing assistance to the youth of the \n     United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Guard Youth \n     Challenge Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Guard Youth Challenge Day'' on February 24, 2010, \n     with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my colleagues \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Chambliss, Senator Shaheen, Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Barrasso and Senator Byrd, I rise today to submit a resolution \nin support of the goals and ideals of National Guard Youth Challenge \nDay and in support of the Youth ChalleNGe program.\n  Few programs have been as effective in combating the high rate of \nhigh school dropouts as the Youth ChalleNGe program.\n  Established by the National Guard in 1993 to help at-risk youth aged \n16-18 who have dropped out or been expelled from school, the National \nGuard Youth ChalleNGe program includes a 5-month residential program \nand 12-month mentoring program where participants learn life-skills, \ngain real-life work experience, receive on-the-job training, \nparticipate in community service and have the opportunity to earn a \nhigh school diploma or GED.\n  Everyone knows that high school dropouts face much greater challenges \nthan their peers who finish school. Dropouts have an unemployment rate \nof 40 percent, as compared to the national average of 10 percent. \nFifty-four percent of high school dropouts were jobless in an average \nmonth during 2008 alone.\n  One in every three teen mothers is a dropout and one in four babies \nis born to a high school dropout. Dropouts have a life expectancy that \nis nine years less than a high school graduate.\n  While looking for programs that keep students in school, we must also \nfocus on programs that offer our high school dropouts a road back, and \nthe National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is one such program.\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\n  The National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program has graduated more than \n92,850 former high school dropouts from the program to date, with 99 \npercent of them going on to pursue higher education, a career in the \nmilitary or employment, according to a recent audit.\n  The annual cost of graduating one child from the Youth ChalleNGe \nprogram is $14,000. Contrasted with the $40,000 it costs to incarcerate \nthat same youth, it is no surprise the program has earned the \nenthusiastic bipartisan support of governors nationwide.\n  The program currently operates only 32 programs across 27 states and \nPuerto Rico. Last year alone, of the 18,701 dropouts who applied to \nthis voluntary program, more than 40 percent were turned away due to \nlack of funding.\n  Unfortunately, America has one of the highest dropout rates in the \nworld among developed nations. Nationally, an estimated one-third of \nhigh school freshmen do not graduate from high school in four years; in \nthe 50 largest U.S. cities, the dropout rate may be closer to 50 \npercent. That totals 1.2 million high school dropouts each year.\n  The soaring dropout rate is a national crisis that costs our economy \nbillions of dollars each year to support dropouts who are more likely \nto be unemployed or underemployed, incarcerated, on public welfare, or \nteen parents.\n  The median income of a high school dropout is $18,000, versus $25,000 \nfor a high school graduate, and the annual unemployment rate for \ndropouts is 40 percent compared with the nationwide rate of 10 percent.\n  This means that each dropout, over the course of his or her lifetime, \ncontributes $60,000 less in taxes that an individual with a high school \ndegree.\n  Each class of dropouts costs States $17 billion in publicly \nsubsidized health care costs over the course of their lives.\n  Individuals lacking a high school education also make up 90 percent \nof our nation's prison population accounting for $45 billion of the $50 \nbillion spent annually on incarceration.\n  The economic cost in lost productivity and earnings over the course \nof a high school dropout's lifetime is $329 billion, according to the \nAlliance for Excellent Education.\n  Over the next decade, if current dropout rates persist, the economic \nloss to our nation will total more than $3 trillion.\n  Eleven States have requested funding to start a program. Unlike most \nprograms, the Youth ChalleNGe program requires States to match 25 \npercent of the program's cost with the Federal Government providing 75 \npercent, and three States with existing programs are seeking funding \nfor additional programs.\n  The National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program changes more than just the \ncadet; it transforms entire families and communities.\n  According to the parent of a recent ChalleNGe graduate in Louisiana: \n``I had struggled for several years trying to give [my son] what he \nneeded in the way of direction. He had no ambition, no direction, no \ngoals for the future, no interest whatsoever in school, and appeared to \nhave no grasp of how poorly his future looked if he continued on the \nroad he was on. The successes the Youth ChalleNGe program provided gave \nhim a self-confidence I've never seen in him before. He realizes he can \nachieve anything he wants in life if he is willing to put forth the \neffort. Thank you for giving me my son back.''\n  Our nation can no longer afford to lose ground educationally if we \nare to compete in a global, knowledge-based society. As President Obama \nnoted in his speech, ``In this country, the success of our children \ncannot depend more on where they live than on their potential.'' In \norder to make that sentiment a reality, we must not only address needed \nreforms to put our failing schools back on track, but also expand \nprograms that reach out to those youth who dropped out of high school \nto ensure that they have every chance to succeed. The future of our \nyouth--and our economy--depends on it.\n  Do not just take my word for it. Tomorrow morning I am hosting a \npanel and discussion about the Youth ChalleNGe Program in the Russell \nBuilding, Room 485 from 10:30 to 11:45. I invite all of my colleagues \nto meet some of these remarkable young men and women who have made the \nchoice to turn their lives around.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to join with me to pass this resolution \nwhich shines a much needed light on a program that is truly making a \ndifference in the lives of our greatest natural resource--our children.\n  This is a happy subject, and one for which I think the Presiding \nOfficer shares my enthusiasm, and that is our support of the National \nGuard Youth ChalleNGe Program. Tonight we are celebrating at the fifth \ngala that supports this program, and tomorrow I will be hosting, along \nwith many of our colleagues, a panel about the success of the National \nGuard Youth ChalleNGe Program.\n  The Presiding Officer was a Governor before she became a Senator, so \nshe knows very well the challenges of workforce development, moving our \nyoung people through high school so they graduate on time with the \nrequisite skills to allow them to be ready to go to college or ready to \ngo to work. Unfortunately, that is not the case in America today with \ntoo many of our young people. So we are struggling here in Congress; \nGovernors are looking for programs all over the country; educators are \nsearching for what works.\n  I am here to tell my colleagues that there is a program that works, \nand I thank the Presiding Officer for her support. I also wish to thank \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Chambliss, Senator Shaheen, Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Barrasso and Senator Byrd for cosponsoring this resolution and \nfor calling attention to the fact that tomorrow is National Guard Youth \nChalleNGe Day. But more than joining in this resolution, I hope this \nCongress, as this appropriations process starts for this year, when \nlooking to find a wise way to spend a dollar, will look to the National \nGuard Youth ChalleNGe Program.\n  This program reaches out in 27 States and Puerto Rico with over 32 \nprograms to kids between the ages of 16 and 18 who have given up on \nthemselves and whose families have given up on them. They haven't been \narrested yet. They haven't been incarcerated yet. They haven't gotten \ninto trouble with drugs yet, but they are on the road in that dangerous \ndirection. This program offers them an opportunity to take a different \nroad. It offers them an opportunity to change. I am proud to say that \nsince this program was started here in Congress and in partnership with \nGovernors and nonprofits around the country, we have graduated \nthousands of children from this program with an almost 95-percent \nsuccess rate, which with this group is almost unheard of. This is a 17-\nmonth program including 5 months of residential schooling followed by \n12 months of mentorship. So in 17 months, kids who were headed in the \nwrong direction are literally turned around and headed in the right \ndirection. That is because it is a combination of all of the best \npractices: getting them out of their environment and introducing them \nto a new set of disciplines and rules and regulations. It is not a boot \ncamp. There are not wires around these facilities. These young people \ncan leave any day. It is completely voluntary. But they stay because \nthey know they need the discipline. They know they need the focus. They \nknow our men and women of the National Guard care not just about our \ncountry as a whole but about the individual citizens who make up the \ncountry. Through our National Guard, men and women give of their time \nin terms of teaching and training. It is a phenomenal program.\n  I don't know if the Presiding Officer has attended some of the \ngraduations, but I have, and I think perhaps she has, and many of our \ncolleagues have. They share with me their stories. They say, Senator, I \nhave given speeches at many of my college graduations and at many \nwonderful, prominent, large high schools, but the graduations that have \ntouched me the most have been the graduations of the Youth ChalleNGe \ncadets. Sometimes a program will graduate 100 cadets; sometimes smaller \nprograms will graduate 50; but there are always lots of tears of joy in \nthose auditoriums around the country when these cadets graduate.\n  I will never, ever forget standing in Alexandria, actually Camp \nBeauregard, right outside of Alexandria, a central Louisiana city. I \nhad given my speech.\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nI thought it was pretty good, but it wasn't spectacular. It was very \ngood. I heard a grown man behind me sobbing. I thought to myself, I \nhope I haven't said anything inappropriate in my remarks. He came up to \nme with these huge arms and hugged me from the back and said, Senator, \nI have never known my government to do anything good for me--I don't \nknow if I agree with that--but, he said, Today, you have given me my \nson back. I will never forget that as long as I live. That is what this \nprogram means to parents. It is giving them their children back, which \nis the greatest gift a parent, as the Presiding Officer knows, having \nfour children, can have. These kids are floundering in the regular high \nschools, not making any sense to them, because we haven't done I think \nwhat we should be doing in all cases with them in high school. This \nprogram works. Not only does it work for the individual, but it works \nfor our economy.\n  I wish to read into the Record a few of the statistics about what it \nmeans to our country when we save one person from dropping out of high \nschool. These are the statistics. One in every three teen mothers is a \ndropout from high school. One in four babies born is born to a high \nschool dropout. The National Guard program has graduated more than \n92,850 former high school dropouts with 99 percent of them going on to \neither pursue higher education, a career in the military, or \nemployment, according to a recent audit. The annual cost of graduating \none child from this program is $14,000. Contrast that with the $40,000 \nit costs annually for incarceration of someone who failed to graduate, \ngot on the wrong road, got involved in drugs or in a life of crime. For \na $14,000 investment, leveraging the strength of the National Guard, \nleveraging the hopes and prayers of parents who want so much for their \nchildren to turn around, leveraging the power of the individual child \nknowing something is wrong and wanting to make it right, I couldn't \nthink of a better program than this.\n  I have spoken personally to Secretary Arne Duncan about this. I have \nspoken personally on every occasion I can to members of the White House \nleadership team and the education team and the members of the Defense \nAppropriations team. So I am hoping we recognize the soaring dropout \nrate as a national crisis that costs our economy billions of dollars. \nThere are programs that work. Not every program that government invents \nor frames fails. So for people who say we can't spend any more money, \nlet's spend it on programs such as this. Let's move the money from some \nprograms that aren't working as well to programs such as this and \nleverage the investments our country is making, whether it is through \nthe National Guard or through other programs.\n  The median income of a high school dropout is $18,000 versus $25,000 \nfor a high school graduate.

Res. 345\n\n       Whereas, on December 23, 2008, a group of military officers \n     calling itself the National Council for Democracy and \n     Development (referred to in this preamble as the ``CNDD'') \n     seized power in a coup in Guinea, installed as interim \n     President Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, and promised to hold \n     elections;\n       Whereas, on September 28, 2009, authorities of the \n     Government of Guinea opened fire on a crowd of thousands of \n     unarmed opposition protesters who were gathered in and around \n     an outdoor stadium to protest statements made by Captain \n     Camara that he may run\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n     for president, after he said that he would not;\n       Whereas, on September 29, 2009, the United States \n     Department of State condemned the brazen and inappropriate \n     use of force by the military against civilians in Guinea, and \n     demanded the immediate release of opposition leaders and a \n     return to civilian rule as soon as possible;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Security Council \n     Report of the International Commission of Inquiry Mandated to \n     Establish the Facts and Circumstances of the Events of 28 \n     September 2009 in Guinea, 156 people were killed or \n     disappeared and at least 109 women and girls ``were subjected \n     to rape and other sexual violence, including sexual \n     mutilation and sexual slavery'';\n       Whereas according to Human Rights Watch, these killings and \n     assaults were part of a ``premeditated massacre'' in which \n     the ``level, frequency, and brutality of sexual violence that \n     took place at and after the protests strongly suggests that \n     it was part of a systematic attempt to terrorize and \n     humiliate the opposition, not just random acts by rogue \n     soldiers'';\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \n     Rights characterized the events as a ``blood bath'' and \n     stated that they ``must not become part of the fabric of \n     impunity that has enveloped Guinea for decades'';\n       Whereas according to the humanitarian organization CARE, \n     ``What happened in Guinea is an outrage--and a stark reminder \n     of a larger epidemic of violence against women and girls \n     around the world.'';\n       Whereas Amnesty International reports that violence against \n     women knows few bounds, and that ``in armed conflicts, \n     countless women and girls are raped and sexually abused by \n     security forces and opposition groups as an act of war, and \n     often face additional violence in refugee camps. Government \n     sponsored violence also exists in peacetime, with women \n     assaulted while in police custody, in prison, and at the \n     hands of any number of state actors.'' and that ``violence \n     against women is a violation of human rights that cannot be \n     justified by any political, religious, or cultural claim'';\n       Whereas the International Commission of Inquiry of the \n     United Nations concluded that ``the crimes perpetrated on 28 \n     September 2009 and in the immediate aftermath can be \n     described as crimes against humanity'' and that there is \n     sufficient evidence that Captain Camara ``incurred individual \n     criminal liability and command responsibility for the events \n     that occurred during the attack and related events in their \n     immediate aftermath'';\n       Whereas, on January 15, 2010, General Sekouba Konate and \n     Captain Camara of the Republic of Guinea and President Blaise \n     Compaore of Burkina Faso signed the Joint Declaration of \n     Ouagadougou pledging to form a transitional government of \n     national unity in Guinea, to hold elections within six months \n     without the participation of candidates from the military \n     junta, and to permit the entry of an international observer \n     mission from the Economic Community of West African States; \n     and\n       Whereas, in accordance with the Joint Declaration of \n     Ouagadougou, a prime minister from the coalition of \n     opposition forces, Forces Vives, has been named to the \n     transitional government: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) deplores the rape and assault of women and the killing \n     of political protestors in Guinea;\n       (2) urges the prosecution, by the appropriate authorities, \n     of those responsible for orchestrating or carrying out the \n     violence in Guinea;\n       (3) urges the President, in coordination with leaders from \n     the European Union and the African Union, to continue to \n     consider punitive measures that could be taken against senior \n     officials in Guinea found to be complicit in the violence, \n     and in particular, the atrocities perpetrated against women \n     and other gross human rights violations;\n       (4) encourages the President to remain actively engaged in \n     the political situation in Guinea, and to continue to convey \n     that the blatant abuse of women will not be tolerated;\n       (5) calls on President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso to \n     ensure that Captain Camara does not return to Guinea in order \n     to allow a peaceful transition to civilian rule;\n       (6) notes that the first steps set forth in the Joint \n     Declaration of Ouagadougou have been initiated with the \n     naming of a prime minister and urges all parties to continue \n     to adhere to the agreement to see the process through free, \n     fair, and timely elections; and\n       (7) recognizes the importance of the multilateral observer \n     mission to help ensure peace and security in Guinea during \n     the period of transition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/23/senate-section/article/S713-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S713-S714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRUTH IN CALLER ID ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee be discharged from further consideration of H. \nCon. Res. 158 and the Senate proceed to the consideration of that \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 158) expressing \n     support for the designation of an Early Detection Month for \n     breast cancer and all forms of cancer.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate passage of H. \nCon. Res. 158, the House companion to a resolution I introduced last \nAugust to highlight greater awareness of breast and other cancers by \ndesignating an early cancer detection month. This House resolution is \nsponsored by my good friend and colleague from North Carolina, \nCongressman Bob Etheridge.\n  Almost every person has been touched by cancer, either personally or \nthrough a family member or friend who has suffered from some form of \nthe disease. Sadly, every year, more than 2 million new cases of cancer \nare diagnosed in the United States.\n  The most common forms of cancer diagnosed in Americans are skin \ncancer, breast cancer in women, prostate cancer in men, lung cancer, \nand colorectal cancers. And it is estimated that in 2009, over half a \nmillion Americans died from all types of cancer.\n  Last year, in North Carolina, there were an estimated 42,270 new \ncases of cancer and more than 18,000 deaths due to cancer. Of those \nlost, 1,300 deaths were from breast cancer in women and 860 deaths from \nprostate cancer.\n  Current cancer treatments include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, \nhormone therapy, biological therapy, and targeted therapy; however, \nthere is no cure. Many oncologists and breast cancer researchers \nbelieve that a cure for breast cancer will not be discovered until well \ninto the future.\n  However, we cannot sit idly by while we wait for a cure. Instead, we \nmust continue to support organizations, health care providers, and even \nour friends who work so hard to raise awareness about cancer, \nparticularly cancer prevention and early detection. Fortunately, many \nforms of cancer can be prevented altogether, such as skin cancer and \nlung cancer. In addition, at least half of all new cancer cases can be \nprevented or detected earlier by screening, and if detected early \nenough, more than 75 percent of all people could be saved when cancer \nis most treatable.\n  For breast cancer, early detection has been proven to reduce \nmortality. This is encouraging, due to the fact that 1 in 8 women in \nthe United States will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.\n  In 2008 alone, the overall cost of cancer in the United States was \nestimated at $228.1 billion. Greater awareness and early detection of \nall cancers will not only save tens of thousands of lives, but also \ngreatly reduce the financial strain on the government and private \nhealth care services by detecting cancer before it requires very \nexpensive treatment.\n  Cancer has taken an enormous toll on our society's health and \neconomy. But this disease, in all its forms, is often detectible at \nearly stages. By designating a month to focus on early detection for \nbreast cancer and all other forms of cancer, we will address some of \nthe principle challenges that inhibit screening and prolong detection. \nEnhanced awareness and screening are the keys to reducing morbidity and \nmortality from cancer and reducing the financial and emotional stress \nthat this disease places on Americans.\n  I want to thank Senator Richard Durbin for joining me in cosponsoring \nthe Senate resolution. I also would like to thank Representative \nEtheridge for sponsoring the House companion, which passed on January \n21. I am extremely pleased that both Chambers have been supportive of \nthis issue and that the Senate is adopting this concurrent resolution \ntoday.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \non the table, that there be no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements relating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
